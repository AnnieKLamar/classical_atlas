Not to bore you with an over-long, rambling <br />Tale, the city-dweller turns rustic, rattling on about <br />Furrows, and vineyards, stringing his elm-trees, killing <br />Himself with zeal, aged by his passion for yields. <br />But after his <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> are lost to theft, <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> to disease <br />The crops have failed, the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> is broken by ploughing, <br />Pricked by his losses, in the depths of night, he grabs <br />His <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and rides to <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a>’ house in a rage. <br />When <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a> sees him, wild and unshaven, he cries: <br />‘<a href=/people/8493 target=_blank>Volteius</a>, you look rough, and seem to be sorely tried.’ <br />‘Truly, patron, call me a miserable wretch,’ he said, <br />‘If you want to call me by my true name.
