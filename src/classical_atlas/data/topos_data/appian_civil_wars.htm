Internal discord did not bring them to blows, however; these were dissensions merely and contests within the law, which they composed by making mutual concessions, and with much respect for each other. Once when the plebeians were going to a war they fell into such a controversy, but they did not use the weapons in their hands, but withdrew to the hill, which from this time on was called the Sacred Mount. Even then no violence was done, but they created a magistrate for their protection and called him the tribune of the plebs, to serve especially as a check upon the consuls, who were chosen by the Senate, so that the political power should not be exclusively in their hands. Whence arose still greater bitterness, and the magistrates were arrayed in stronger animosity to each other after this event, and the Senate and plebeians took sides with them, each believing that it would prevail over the other by augmenting the power of its own magistrates. In the midst of contests of this kind <a href=/people/10971 target=_blank>Marcius</a> <a href=/people/2734 target=_blank>Coriolanus</a>, having been banished contrary to justice, took refuge with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416133RVol class=ethnic long=13.3 lat=41.6>Volsci</a> and levied war against his country. </p>                        </div>

The sword was never carried into the assembly, and there was no civil butchery until <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a>, while serving as tribune and bringing forward new laws, was the first to fall a victim to internal commotion; and many others besides, who were assembled with him at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, were slain around the temple. Sedition did not end with this abominable deed. Repeatedly the parties came into open conflict, often carrying daggers; and occasionally in the temples, or the assemblies, or the forum, some one serving as tribune, or praetor, or consul, or a candidate for those offices, or some person otherwise distinguished, would be slain. Unseemly violence prevailed almost constantly, together with shameful contempt for law and justice. As the evil gained in magnitude open insurrections against the government and large warlike expeditions against the country were undertaken by exiles, or criminals, or persons contending against each other for some office or military command. There were chiefs of factions in different places aspiring to supreme power, some of them refusing to disband the troops intrusted to them by the people, others levying forces against each other on their own account, without public authority. Whichever of them first got possession of the city, the others made war nominally against their adversaries, but actually against their country. They assailed it like a foreign enemy. Ruthless and indiscriminate massacres of citizens were perpetrated. Men were proscribed, others banished, property was confiscated, and some were even subjected to excruciating tortures. </p>                        </div>

Such officials were formerly called dictators — an office created in the most perilous emergencies for six months only, and long since fallen into disuse. <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, although nominally elected, became dictator for life by force and compulsion. Nevertheless he became satiated with power and was the first man, so far as I know, holding supreme power, who had the courage to lay it down voluntarily and to declare that he would render an account of his stewardship to any who were dissatisfied with it. And so, for a considerable period, he walked to the forum as a private citizen in the sight of all and returned home unmolested, so great was the awe of his government still remaining in the minds of the onlookers, or their amazement at his laying it down. Perhaps they were ashamed to call for an accounting, or entertained other good feeling toward him, or a belief that his despotism had been beneficial to the state. Thus there was a cessation of factions for a short time while <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> lived, and a compensation for the evils which <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> had wrought. </p>                        </div>

He charged that it was not the wish of the Senate, but of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, his enemy, who had command of an army in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and was scheming to depose him. So he sent a proposal that both should retain their armies, so that neither need fear the other's enmity, or that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> should dismiss his forces also and live as a private citizen under the laws in like manner with himself. Both requests being refused, he marched from Gaul against <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> in the Roman territory, entered it, put him to flight, pursued him into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, won a brilliant victory over him in a great battle, and followed him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>.

Then he returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. Having overpowered by war his principal rival, who had been surnamed the Great on account of his brilliant military exploits, he now ruled without disguise, nobody daring any longer to dispute him about anything, and was chosen, next after <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, dictator for life. Again all civil dissensions ceased until <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, envious of his great power and desiring to restore the government of their fathers, slew in the Senate this most popular man, who was also the one most experienced in the art of government. The people mourned for him greatly. They scoured the city in pursuit of his murderers. They buried him in the middle of the forum and built a temple on the place of his funeral pile, and offered sacrifice to him as a god. </p>                        </div>

Massacres, banishments, and proscriptions of both senators and the so-called knights took place straightway, including great numbers of both classes, the chief of factions surrendering their enemies to each other, and for this purpose not sparing even their friends and brothers; so much does animosity toward rivals overpower the love of kindred. So in the course of events the Roman empire was partitioned, as though it had been their private property, by these three men: <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>, and the one who was first called <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, but afterward <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> from his relationship to the other <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and adoption in his will. Shortly after this division they fell to quarrelling among themselves, as was natural, and <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, who was the superior in understanding and skill, first deprived <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> of Africa, which had fallen to his lot, and afterward, as the result of the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389207LAkt class=place long=20.68 lat=38.942>Actium</a>, took from <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> all the provinces lying between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421170WAdr class=place long=16.95 lat=42.09>Adriatic</a> gulf. Thereupon, while all the world was filled with astonishment at these wonderful displays of power, he sailed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and took that country, which was the oldest and at that time the strongest possession of the successors of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, and the only one wanting to complete the Roman empire as it now stands. In consequence of these exploits he was at once elevated to the rank of a deity while still living, and was the first to be thus distinguished by the Romans, and was called by them <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>. He assumed to himself an authority like <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s over the country and the subject nations, and even greater than <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s, not needing any form of election, or authorization, or even the pretence of it. His government being strengthened by time and mastery, and himself successful in all things and revered by all, he left a lineage and succession that held the supreme power in like manner after him. </p>                        </div>

The remaining books of the civil wars treat of those waged by the triumvirs against each other and the Roman people, until the end of these conflicts, and the greatest achievement, the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389207LAkt class=place long=20.68 lat=38.942>Actium</a>, fought by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius Caesar</a> against <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> and <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> together, which will be the beginning of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> history. </p>                        </div>

Of the land acquired by war they assigned the cultivated part forthwith to settlers, or leased or sold it. Since they had no leisure as yet to allot the part which then lay desolated by war (this was generally the greater part), they made proclamation that in the meantime those who were willing to work it might do so for a share of the yearly crops a tenth of the grain and a fifth of the fruit. From those who kept flocks was required a share of the animals, both <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> and small <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>.

But the very opposite thing happened; for the rich, getting possession of the greater part of the undistributed lands, and being emboldened by the lapse of time to believe that they would never be dispossessed, and adding to their holdings the small farms of their poor neighbors, partly by purchase and partly by force, came to cultivate vast tracts instead of single estates, using for this purpose slaves as laborers and herdsmen, lest free laborers should be drawn from agriculture into the army. The ownership of slaves itself brought them great gain from the multitude of their progeny, who increased because they were exempt from military service. Thus the powerful ones became enormously rich and the race of slaves multiplied throughout the country, while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> people dwindled in numbers and strength, being oppressed by penury, taxes, and military service.

Not perceiving any remedy, as it was not easy, nor exactly just, to deprive men of so many possessions they had held so long, including their own trees, buildings, and fixtures, a law was once passed with difficulty at the instance of the tribunes, that nobody should hold more than 500 jugera of this land, or pasture on it more than 100 <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> or 500 <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>.

Those who held possession of lands under the law were required to take an oath to obey the law, and penalties were fixed for violating it, and it was supposed that the remaining land would soon be divided among the poor in small parcels. But there was not the smallest consideration shown for the law or the oaths. The few who seemed to pay some respect to them conveyed their lands to their relations fraudulently, but the greater part disregarded it altogether. </p>                        </div>

They collected together in groups, and made lamentation, and accused the poor of appropriating the results of their tillage, their vineyards, and their dwellings. Some said that they had paid the price of the land to their neighbors. Were they to lose the money with the land? Others said that the graves of their ancestors were in the ground, which had been allotted to them in the division of their fathers' estates. Others said that their wives' dowries had been expended on the estates, or that the land had been given to their own daughters as dowry. Money-lenders could show loans made on this security. All kinds of wailing and expressions of indignation were heard at once. On the other side were heard the lamentations of the poor — that they had been reduced from competence to extreme penury, and from that to childlessness, because they were unable to rear their offspring. They recounted the military services they had rendered, by which this very land had been acquired, and were angry that they should be robbed of their share of the common property. They reproached the rich for employing slaves, who were always faithless and ill-tempered and for that reason unserviceable in war, instead of freemen, citizens, and soldiers. While these classes were lamenting and indulging in mutual accusations, a great number of others, composed of colonists, or inhabitants of the free towns, or persons otherwise interested in the lands and who were under like apprehensions, flocked in and took sides with their respective factions. Emboldened by numbers and exasperated against each other they attached themselves to turbulent crowds, and waited for the voting on the new law, some trying to prevent its enactment by all means, and others supporting it in every possible way.

When the time for voting came he advanced many other arguments at considerable length and also asked them whether it was not just to divide among the common people what belonged to them in common; whether a citizen was not worthy of more consideration at all times than a slave; whether a man who served in the army was not more useful than one who did not; and whether one who had a share in the country was not more likely to be devoted to the public interests. He did not dwell long on this comparison between freemen and slaves, which he considered degrading, but proceeded at once to a review of their hopes and fears for the country, saying that the Romans had acquired most of their territory by conquest, and that they had hopes of occupying the rest of the habitable world, but now the question of greatest hazard was, whether they should gain the rest by having plenty of brave men, or whether, through their weakness and mutual jealousy, their enemies should take away what they already possessed. After exaggerating the glory and riches on the one side and the danger and fear on the other, he admonished the rich to take heed, and said that for the realization of these, hopes they ought to bestow this very land as a free gift, if necessary, on men who would rear children, and not, by contending about small things, overlook larger ones; especially since they were receiving an ample compensation for labor expended in the undisputed title to 500 jugera each of free land, in a high state of cultivation, without cost, and half as much more for each son of those who had sons.

After speaking thus he called the gods to witness that he did not willingly do any despite to his colleague. As <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a> was still unyielding he went on taking the vote. <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a> was forthwith reduced to the rank of a private citizen and slunk away unobserved. </p>                        </div>

As the persons in possession neglected to hand in lists of their holdings, a proclamation was issued that informers should furnish testimony against them. Immediately a great number of embarrassing lawsuits sprang up. Wherever a new field had been bought adjoining an old one, or wherever a division of land had been made with allies, the whole district had to be carefully inquired into on account of the measurement of this one field, to discover how it had been sold and how divided. Not all owners had preserved their contracts, or their allotment titles, and even those that were found were often ambiguous. When the land was resurveyed some owners were obliged to give up their fruit-trees and farm-buildings in exchange for naked ground. Others were transferred from cultivated to uncultivated lands, or to swamps, or pools. In fact, the measuring had not been carefully done when the land was first taken from the enemy. As the original proclamation authorized anybody to work the undistributed land who wished to do so, many had been prompted to cultivate the parts immediately adjoining their own, till the line of demarkation between them had faded from view. The progress of time also made many changes. Thus the injustice done by the rich, although great, was not easy of ascertainment.

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a> were glad to accept this, because they preferred Roman citizenship to possession of the fields. <a href=/people/11076 target=_blank>Fulvius Flaccus</a>, who was then both consul and triumvir, exerted himself to the utmost to bring it about, but the Senate was angry at the proposal to make their subjects equal citizens with themselves. For this reason the attempt was abandoned, and the people, who had been so long in the hope of acquiring land, became disheartened. While they were in this mood Gaius <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a>, who had made himself agreeable to them as a triumvir, offered himself for the tribuneship.

As soon as he was elected to this distinguished position he began to lay plots against the Senate, and proposed that a monthly distribution of corn should be made to each citizen at the public expense, which had not been customary before. Thus he got the leadership of the people quickly by one measure of policy, in which he had the cooperation of <a href=/people/11076 target=_blank>Fulvius Flaccus</a>. Directly after that he was chosen tribune for the following year, for in cases where there was not a sufficient number of candidates the law authorized the people to choose from the whole number then in office. </p>                        </div>

Having bought the plebeians, as it were, he began, by another like political manoeuvre, to court the equestrian order, who hold the middle place between the Senate and the plebeians. He transferred the courts of justice, which had become discredited by reason of bribery, from the senators to the knights, reproaching the former especially with the recent examples of <a href=/people/11042 target=_blank>Aurelius</a> <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a>, <a href=/people/2349 target=_blank>Salinator</a>, and, third in the list, <a href=/people/382 target=_blank>Manius</a> <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquilius</a> (the one who subdued Asia), all notorious bribe-takers, who had been acquitted by the judges, although ambassadors sent to complain against them were still present, going around uttering hateful accusations against them. The Senate was extremely ashamed of these things and yielded to the law, and the people ratified it. In this way were the courts of justice transferred from the Senate to the knights. It is said that soon after the passage of this law <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a> remarked that he had broken the power of the Senate once for all. This saying of <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a> has been even more confirmed by experience in the course of events. This power of sitting in judgment on all Romans and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>, including the senators themselves, in all matters as to property, civil rights, and banishment, exalted the knights like rulers over them and put senators on the same level with subjects. Moreover, as the knights voted in the election to sustain the power of the tribunes, and obtained from them whatever they wanted in return, they became more and more formidable to the senators. So it shortly came about that the political mastery was turned upside down, the power being in the hands of the knights, and the honor only remaining with the Senate. The knights went so far that they not only held power over the senators, but they openly flouted them beyond their right. They also became addicted to bribe-taking, and having once tasted these enormous gains, they indulged in them even more basely and immoderately than the senators had done. They suborned accusers against the rich and did away with prosecutions for bribe-taking altogether, partly by concert of action and partly by force and violence, so that the practice of this kind of investigation became entirely obsolete. Thus the judiciary law gave rise to another struggle of factions, which lasted a long time and was not less baneful than the former ones. </p>                        </div>

A cry was raised, the dead body was seen in the midst of the crowd, and all who were outside fled from the temple in fear of a like fate. <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a> went into the assembly desiring to exculpate himself of the deed. Nobody would so much as listen to him. All turned away from him as from one stained with blood. <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a> and <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> were nonplussed and, having lost the chance of accomplishing what they wished, they hastened home, and their partisans with them. The rest of the crowd occupied the forum throughout the night as though some calamity were impending. <a href=/people/1513 target=_blank>Opimius</a>, one of the consuls, who was staying in the city, ordered an armed force to be stationed at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> at daybreak, and sent heralds to convoke the Senate.

Presently the rich bought the allotments of the poor, or found pretexts for seizing them by force. So the condition of the poor became even worse than it was before, until <a href=/people/862 target=_blank>Spurius</a> Borius, a tribune of the people, brought in a law providing that the work of distributing the public domain should no longer be continued, but that the land should belong to those in possession of it, who should pay rent for it to the people, and that the money so received should be distributed. This distribution was a kind of solace to the poor, but it did not serve to increase the population. By these devices the law of <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a> (most excellent and useful if it could have been carried out) was once for all frustrated, and a little later the rent itself was abolished at the instance of another tribune. So the piebeians lost everything.

It was provided also in this law that if the people should enact it the senators should take an oath within five days to obey it, and that any one who should refuse to do so should be expelled from the Senate and should pay a fine of twenty talents for the benefit of the people.

It began unexpectedly, grew to great proportions rapidly, and extinguished the Roman seditions for a long time by a new terror. When it was ended it gave rise to new seditions under more powerful leaders, who did not work by introducing new laws, or by playing the demagogue, but by employing whole armies against each other. I have treated it in this history because it had its origin in a Roman sedition and resulted in another one much worse. It began in this way. <a href=/people/11076 target=_blank>Fulvius Flaccus</a> in his consulship first openly excited among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a> the desire for Roman citizenship, so as to be partners in the hegemony instead of subjects. When he introduced this idea and strenuously persisted in it, the Senate, for that reason, sent him away to take command in a war, in the course of which his consulship expired, but he obtained the tribuneship after that and managed to have the younger <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a> for a colleague, with whose cooperation he brought forward other measures in favor of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>. When they were both killed, as I have previously related, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a> were still more excited. They could not bear to be considered subjects instead of equals, or to think that <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> and <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a> should suffer such calamities while working for their political advantage. </p>                        </div>

They desired this especially because by that one step they would become rulers instead of subjects.

He endeavored to bring to an agreement the Senate and the equestrian order, who were then in sharp antagonism to each other, in reference to the law courts. As he was not able to restore the courts to the Senate openly, he tried the following artifice on both of them. As the senators had been reduced by the seditions to scarcely 300 in number, he brought forward a law that an equal number should be added to their enrolment from the knights, to be chosen according to merit, and that the law courts should be made up from all of these hereafter. He provided in the law that they should make investigations about bribery, as accusations of that kind were almost unknown, since the custom of bribe-taking prevailed without restraint. This was the plan that he contrived for both of them, but it turned out contrary to his expectations, for the senators were indignant that so large a number should be added to their enrolment at one time and be transferred from knighthood to the highest rank. They thought it not unlikely that they would form a faction in the Senate by themselves and contend against the old senators more powerfully than ever. The knights, on the other hand, suspected that, by this doctoring, the courts of justice would be transferred from their order to the Senate exclusively. Having acquired a relish for the great gains and power of the judicial office, this suspicion disturbed them. Most of them fell into doubt and distrust toward each other, discussing which ones seemed more worthy than others to be enrolled among the 300; and envy against their betters filled the breasts of the remainder. Above all were they angry at the revival of the charge of bribery, which they thought had been ere this entirely suppressed, so far as they were concerned. </p>                        </div>

It seems that the ancient Romans, like the Greeks, abhorred the taking of interest on loans as something knavish, and hard on the poor, and leading to contention and enmity; and by the same kind of reasoning the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> considered lending itself as having a tendency to deceit and lying. But, since time had sanctioned the practice of taking interest, the creditors demanded it according to custom. The debtors, on the other hand, put off the payment by causing war and civil commotion. Some indeed threatened to visit the legal penalty on the interest-takers. The praetor <a href=/people/2997 target=_blank>Asellio</a>, who had charge of these matters, as he was not able to compose their differences by persuasion, allowed them to proceed against each other in the courts, thus bringing the conflict of law and custom before the judges. The lenders, exasperated that the old law should be revived, killed the praetor in the following manner. He was offering sacrifice to <a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a> and <a href=/people/327 target=_blank>Pollux</a> in the Forum, with a crowd standing around as was usual at such a ceremony. In the first place somebody threw a stone at him.

They got ahead of him and prevented him from reaching the temple, and after he had fled into a certain tavern they cut his throat. Many of his pursuers, thinking that he had taken refuge with the <a href=/people/12228 target=_blank>Vestal virgins</a>, ran in there, where it was not lawful for men to go. Thus was <a href=/people/2997 target=_blank>Asellio</a>, while serving as praetor, and pouring out the libation, and wearing the sacred gilded vestments customary in such ceremonies, slain at the second hour of the day, in the midst of the forum, by the side of the sacrificial offerings. The Senate offered a reward of money to any free person, and freedom to any slave, and impunity to any accomplice, who should give testimony leading to the conviction of the murderers of <a href=/people/2997 target=_blank>Asellio</a>, but nobody gave any information.

Afterward the chiefs of factions assailed each other with great armies, according to the usage of war, and the country lay as a prize between them.

He also led the new <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> citizens, who had very little power in the elections, to hope that they should be distributed among all the tribes — not putting forward anything concerning his own advantage, but with the expectation of employing them as loyal servants in his every attempt. <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a> straightway brought forward a law for this purpose. If it were enacted <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> and <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a> would have everything they wanted, because the new citizens far outnumbered the old ones. The old citizens saw this and opposed the new ones with all their might. They fought each other with sticks and stones, and the evil increased continually. The consuls, becoming apprehensive, as the day for voting on the law drew near, proclaimed a vacation of many days' duration, such as was customary on festal occasions, in order to postpone the voting and the danger. </p>                        </div>

Out of regard for their general and fear of ignominy if they should abandon their standard, they rallied at once. <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> ordered up fresh troops from his camp and sent others around by the socalled <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125USub class=demonym long=12.4906 lat=41.8952>Suburran</a> road to take the enemy in the rear. The Marians fought feebly against these new-comers, and as they feared lest they should be surrounded they called to their aid the other citizens who were still fighting from the houses, and proclaimed freedom to slaves who would share their labors. As nobody came forward they fell into utter despair and fled at once out of the city, together with those of the nobility who had cooperated with them. </p>                        </div>

Each kept moving about his own command to see that no calamity was brought about either by the frightened people or by the victorious troops: They summoned the people to an assembly at daybreak and lamented the condition of the republic, which had been so long given over to demagogues, and said that they had done what they had done as a matter of necessity. They proposed that no question should ever again be brought before the people which had not been previously considered by the Senate, an ancient practice which had been abandoned long ago. Also that the voting should not be by tribes, but by centuries, as King <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> had ordained. They thought that by these two measures — namely, that no law should be brought before the people unless it had been previously before the Senate, and that the voting should be controlled by the well-to-do and sober-minded rather than by the pauper and reckless classes — there would no longer be any starting-point for civil discord. They proposed many other measures for curtailing the power of the tribunes, which had become extremely tyrannical. They enrolled 300 of the best citizens at once in the list of senators, who had been reduced at that time to a very small number and had fallen into contempt for that reason.

Although the old citizens resisted with all their might, <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a> cooperated with the new ones. It was supposed that he had been bribed with 300 talents to do this. The other consul, <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, sided with the old citizens.

He returned with a large and well-disciplined army, devoted to him and elated by its exploits. He had abundance of ships, money, and apparatus suitable for all emergencies, and was an object of terror to his enemies. <a href=/people/669 target=_blank>Carbo</a> and <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a> were in such fear of him that they despatched emissaries to all parts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> to collect money, soldiers, and supplies.

The Sullan faction knew this and sent envoys to <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> to negotiate, not because they hoped or desired to come to an agreement, but because they expected to create dissensions in <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>'s army, which was in a state of dejection. In this they succeeded. <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> took hostages for the armistice and marched down to the plain. Only three from each side came to the conference, hence what passed between them is not known. It seems that during the armistice <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> sent <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> to his colleague, <a href=/people/1374 target=_blank>Norbanus</a>, to communicate with him concerning the negotiation and that there was a cessation of hostilities while they were waiting for an answer. <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> on his way took possession of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412139USue class=place long=13.9307 lat=41.2346>Suessa</a>, which had espoused the side of <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, and <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> made complaint of this to <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>. The latter, either because he was privy to the affair or because he did not know what answer to make concerning the strange act of <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a>, sent back <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>'s hostages. His army blamed the consuls for the unjustifiable seizure of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412139USue class=place long=13.9307 lat=41.2346>Suessa</a> during the armistice and for the surrender of the hostages, who were not demanded back, and made a secret agreement with <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> to go over to him if he would draw nearer. This he did and straightway they all went over en masse, so that the consul, <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, and his son Lucius, alone of the whole army, were left nonplussed in their tent, where they were captured by <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>. That <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> was not aware of a conspiracy of this kind, embracing his whole army, seems to me inexcusable in a general. </p>                        </div>

As nobody came back and no answer was returned (for it seems that <a href=/people/1374 target=_blank>Norbanus</a> feared lest he should be accused by his army in the same way that <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> had been), <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> again advanced, devastating all hostile territory. <a href=/people/1374 target=_blank>Norbanus</a> did the same thing on other roads. <a href=/people/669 target=_blank>Carbo</a> hastened to the city and caused <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, and all the other senators who had joined <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, to be decreed public enemies. It was at this time that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> was burned.

Nor was <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> idle.

There was only one hour of daylight left, and there were thick vineyards thereabout. They made their plans for battle in hot temper and not with good judgment, hoping to take <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> unawares and to stampede him. But they were beaten, both the place and the time being unfavorable for them. They became entangled in the vines, and suffered a heavy slaughter, losing some 10,000 men. About 6000 more deserted, and the rest were dispersed, only 1000 getting back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a> in good order.

As, however, he needed some pretence of being elected it was managed in this way. The kings of the Romans in the olden time were chosen for their bravery, and when one of them died the senators held the royal power in succession for five days each, until the people could decide who should be the new king. This five-day ruler was called the Interrex, which means king for the time being. The retiring consuls always presided over the election of their successors in office, and if there chanced to be no consul at such a time an Interrex was appointed for the purpose of holding the consular comitia. <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> took advantage of this custom. There were no consuls at this time, <a href=/people/669 target=_blank>Carbo</a> having lost his life in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418129UPra class=place long=12.8924 lat=41.8399>Praeneste</a>. So <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> went out of the city for a time and ordered the Senate to choose an Interrex. They chose <a href=/people/11080 target=_blank>Valerius Flaccus</a>, expecting that he would soon hold the consular comitia. But <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> wrote to <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> to bring before the people the proposition that he (<a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>) considered it advisable, under present circumstances, that the city should be governed by a dictator according to a custom that had been abandoned 400 years. He told them not to appoint the dictator for any definite time, but until the city and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and the whole government, so shaken by factions and wars, should be put upon a firm foundation. That this proposal referred to <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> himself was not at all doubtful. <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> made no concealment of it.

The Romans were unwilling, but they had no more opportunities for elections according to law, and they considered that this matter was not altogether in their own power. So, in the absence of everything else, they welcomed this pretence of an election as an image and semblance of freedom and chose <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> their absolute master for as long a time as he pleased. There had been autocratic rule of the dictators before, but it was limited to short periods. But in <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>'s time it first became unlimited and so an absolute tyranny; yet they added, for propriety's sake, that they chose him dictator for the enactment of such laws as he might deem best and for the regulation of the commonwealth. Thus the Romans, after having government by kings for sixty Olympiads, and a democracy, under consuls chosen yearly, for 100 Olympiads, resorted to kingly government again.

Marcus <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> and <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> were chosen. But <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, like a reigning sovereign, was dictator over the consuls. Twenty-four axes were borne in front of him, as was customary with dictators, the same number that were borne before the ancient kings, and he had a large body-guard also. He repealed laws and he enacted others. He forbade anybody to hold the office of praetor until after he had held that of quaestor, or to be consul before he had been praetor, and he prohibited any man from holding the same office a second time till after the lapse of ten years. He reduced the tribunician power to such an extent that it seemed to be destroyed. He curtailed it by a law which provided that one holding the office of tribune should never afterward hold any other office; for which reason all men of reputation or family, who formerly contended for this office, shunned it thereafter. I am not able to say positively whether <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> transferred this office from the people to the Senate, where it is now lodged, or not. To the Senate itself, which had been much thinned by the seditions and wars, he added about 300 members from the best of the knights, taking the vote of the tribes for each one. To the plebeians he added more than 10,000 slaves of proscribed persons, choosing the youngest and strongest, to whom he gave freedom and Roman citizenship, and he called them <a href=/people/2610 target=_blank>Cornelii</a> after himself.

It is perhaps from this example that the Roman emperors now make a showing of consuls to the country and even exhibit themselves in that capacity, considering it not unbecoming to hold the office of consul in connection with the supreme power. The next year the people, in order to pay court to <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, chose him consul again, but he refused the office and nominated <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a> Isauricus and <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> <a href=/people/11027 target=_blank>Pulcher</a> for their suffrages, and voluntarily laid down the supreme power, although nobody was troubling him.

Almost incredible is it that after incurring so many dangers in forcing his way to this power he should have laid it down of his own free will after he had acquired it. Paradoxical beyond anything is the fact that he was afraid of nothing, although more than 100,000 young men had perished in this war, and he had destroyed of his enemies ninety senators, fifteen consulars, and 2600 of the so-called knights, including the banished. The property of these men had been confiscated and many of their bodies cast out unburied.

More than 2000 golden crowns which had been made in haste were carried in it, the gifts of cities and of the legions that he had commanded and of individual friends. It would be impossible to describe all the splendid things contributed to this funeral. From fear of the assembled soldiery all the priests and priestesses escorted the remains, each in proper costume. The entire Senate and the whole body of magistrates attended with their insignia of office. A multitude of the Roman knights followed with their peculiar decorations, and, in their turn, all the legions that had fought under him. They came together with eagerness, all hastening to join in the task, carrying gilded standards and silver-plated shields, such as are still used on such occasions. There was a countless number of trumpeters who by turns played the most mournful dirges. Loud cries were raised, first by the Senate, then by the knights, then by the soldiers, and finally by the plebeians. For some really longed for <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, but others were afraid of his army and his dead body, as they had been of himself when living. As they looked at the present spectacle and remembered what this man had accomplished they were amazed, and agreed with their opponents that he had been most beneficial to his own party and most formidable to themselves even in death.

Directly <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> arrived in Spain <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> cut in pieces a whole legion of his army, that had been sent out foraging, with its animals and servants.

In this siege a woman tore out with her fingers the eyes of a soldier who had insulted her and was trying to commit an outrage upon her. When <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> heard of this he put to death the whole cohort that was supposed to be addicted to such brutality, although it was composed of Romans. Then the armies were separated by the advent of winter. When spring came they resumed hostilities, <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> coming from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426007LPyr class=place long=0.658 lat=42.632>Pyrenees</a> mountains, where they had wintered, and <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> and <a href=/people/1076 target=_blank>Perpenna</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-83RLus class=place long=-8.3 lat=39>Lusitania</a>. They met near the town of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392-03USuc class=place long=-0.3868 lat=39.1994>Sucro</a>. While the fight was going on flashes of lightning came unexpectedly from a clear sky, but these trained soldiers were not in the least dismayed. They continued the fight, with heavy slaughter on both sides, until <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> defeated <a href=/people/1076 target=_blank>Perpenna</a> and plundered his camp. On the other hand, <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> defeated <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, who received a dangerous wound from a spear in the thigh, and this put an end to that battle. <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> had a white fawn that was tame and allowed to move about freely. When this fawn was not visible <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> considered it a bad omen. He became low-spirited and abstained from fighting; nor did he mind the enemy's scoffing at the fawn. When she made her appearance running through the woods <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> would run to meet her and, as though he were inspired by her, he would begin to harass the enemy. Not long afterward <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> fought a great battle near Seguntia, lasting from noon till night. <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> fought on horseback and vanquished <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, killing nearly 6000 of his men and losing about half that number himself. <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> at the same time destroyed about 5000 of <a href=/people/1076 target=_blank>Perpenna</a>'s army. The day after this battle <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a>, with a large reinforcement of barbarians, attacked the camp of <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> unexpectedly towards evening with the intention of besieging it with a trench, but <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> hastened up and caused <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> to desist from his bold enterprise. In this way they passed the summer, and again they separated to winter quarters. The following year, which was in the 176th Olympiad, two countries were acquired by the Romans by bequest. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a> was left to them by <a href=/people/349 target=_blank>Nicomedes</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a> by <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> <a href=/people/1363 target=_blank>Apion</a>, of the house of the <a href=/people/7852 target=_blank>Lagidae</a>. There were wars and wars; the Sertorian was raging in Spain, the <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridatic</a> in the East, that of the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> on the entire sea, and another one around <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=ethnic long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretans</a> themselves, besides the gladiatorial war in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, which started suddenly and became very serious. Although distracted by so many conflicts the Romans sent another army of two legions into Spain.

Moreover, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403-29RCel class=ethnic long=-2.9 lat=40.32>Celtiberians</a> took this occasion to insult them as men under suspicion.

The forces of <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> overran many of his towns and brought the men belonging to them under subjection. While <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> was laying siege to Pallantia and underrunning the walls with wooden supports, <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> suddenly appeared on the scene and raised the siege. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> hastily set fire to the timbers and retreated to <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>. <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> rebuilt the part of the wall which had fallen and then attacked his enemies who were encamped around the castle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/423000UCa2 class=place long=-1.9611 lat=42.3015>Calagurris</a> and killed 3000 of them.

On the tenth day, however, a great battle was fought between them.

He procured much money from many women who hoped that they would get their husbands killed in the rising, and he formed a conspiracy with a number of senators and knights, and collected together a body of plebeians, foreign residents, and slaves. His leading fellow-conspirators were <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> and <a href=/people/965 target=_blank>Cethegus</a>, who were then the city praetors.

He added that the powers which he had accepted unwillingly he would gladly yield to those who wished to take them back, and would not wait the time fixed for their expiration. The artfulness of this communication consisted in showing the fairness of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> and in exciting prejudice against <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, as though the latter was not willing to give up his command even at the appointed time. When <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> came back to the city, he spoke to the senators in the same way and then, also, promised to lay down his command. As a friend and marriage connection of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> he said that the latter would very cheerfully do the same, for his had been a long and laborious contest against very warlike peoples; he had added much to the Roman power and now he would come back to his honors and his sacrificings and take his rest. He said these things in order that successors to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> might be sent at once, while he (Pompey) should merely stand on his promise. <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> exposed his artifice, saying that promises were not sufficient, and insisting that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> should lay down his command now and that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> should not be disarmed until <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> himself had returned to private life. On account of private enmity, he said, it would not be advisable either for <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> or for the Romans that such great authority should be held by one man. Rather should each of them have power against the other in case one should attempt violence against the commonwealth. Throwing off all disguise, he denounced <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> unsparingly as one aiming at supreme power, and said that unless he would lay down his command now, when he had the fear of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> before his eyes, he would never lay it down at all. He moved that, unless they both obeyed, both should be voted public enemies and military forces be levied against them. In this way he concealed the fact that he had been bought by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. </p>                        </div>

Some of the senators really thought that it would not be safe to the commonwealth to deprive <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> of his power until after <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> should lay down his, since the latter was outside of the city and was the man of more towering designs. <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> held the contrary opinion, that they had need of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> against the power of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, or otherwise that both armies should be disbanded at the same time. As the Senate would not agree with him he dismissed it, leaving the whole business still unfinished. He had the power to do so as tribune.

He even slew with his own hand one of his officers who tried to restrain him. Moved by these acts of severity on the part of <a href=/people/1898 target=_blank>Petreius</a>, the minds of the soldiers were still more attracted to the clemency of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. Soon afterward <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> managed to cut off the enemy's access to water, and <a href=/people/1898 target=_blank>Petreius</a> was compelled by necessity to come with <a href=/people/847 target=_blank>Afranius</a> to a conference with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> between the two armies. Here it was agreed that they should abandon Spain to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and that he should conduct them unharmed to the other side of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437072WVar class=place long=7.1974 lat=43.6664>Varus</a> and allow them to proceed thence to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. Arrived at this stream, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> called a meeting of all those who were from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and addressed them as follows: My enemies (for by still using this term I shall make my meaning clearer to you), I did not destroy those of you who surrendered to me when you had been sent to seize my camp, nor the rest of your army when I had cut you off from water, although <a href=/people/1898 target=_blank>Petreius</a> had previously slaughtered those of my men who were intercepted on the other side of the river <a href=/people/3250 target=_blank>Sicoris</a>. If there is any gratitude among you for these favors tell them to all of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s soldiers. After speaking thus he dismissed them uninjured, and he appointed Quintus <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> governor of Spain.

This title is an honor conferred upon generals by their soldiers, who thus testify that they consider them worthy to be their commanders. In the olden time the generals accepted this honor only for the greatest exploits. At present I understand that the distinction is limited to cases where at least 10,000 of the enemy have been killed.

Their expectation was fulfilled. <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> encamped there and his army immediately fell sick. When they drank the water their eyesight became dim as in a mist, and sleep with torpor ensued, and after that frequent vomiting and spasms of the whole body.

But when they received the news of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s victory in Spain they took courage and put themselves in order of battle in a narrow space along the seashore. Here a severe battle was fought in which <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> lost only one man, while <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> lost 600 killed, besides a still larger number wounded. </p>                        </div>

As there was a severe wind blowing the servants told the pilot to be of good courage and seize this opportunity to avoid the enemy who were in the neighborhood. The pilot made his way down the river by rowing. When they came toward the mouth they found it broken into surf by the wind and the sea. The pilot at the instigation of the servants put forth all his efforts, but as he could make no progress he became fatigued and gave it up.

Two soldiers advanced to him thinking that he was a deserter. One of these he killed before the stratagem was discovered and he cut off the shoulder of the other.

Then <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, compelled by necessity, drew his whole army together in order to force <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> to fight even against his will. The latter occupied a number of the redoubts that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had vacated and remained quiet. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was greatly vexed at this and ventured upon an extremely difficult and chimerical task; that is, to carry a line of circumvallation around the whole of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s positions from sea to sea, thinking that even if he should fail he would acquire great renown from the boldness of the enterprise. The circuit was 1200 stades. So, great was the work that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> undertook. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> built a line of countervallation. Thus they parried each other's efforts. Nevertheless, they fought one great battle in which <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> defeated <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> in the most brilliant manner and pursued his men in headlong flight to his camp and took many of his standards.

One of the standard bearers, with his standard reversed, dared to thrust the end of it at <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself, but the attendants of the latter cut him down. When the soldiers entered the camp they did not station any guards.

He remained altogether silent in hesitancy and dread, as though he were no longer commander but under command, and as though he were doing everything under compulsion and against his judgment; such dejection had come over this man of great deeds (who, until this day, had been most fortunate in every undertaking), either because he had not carried his point when he had decided what was the best course but was about to cast the die involving the safety of so many men and also involving his own reputation, until now invincible; or because some presentiment of approaching evil troubled him, presaging his complete downfall that very day from a position of such vast power. After merely saying to his friends that whichever should conquer, that day would be the beginning of great evils to the Romans for all future time, he began to make arrangements for the battle.

They had pity for the valor of these men (the elite of both parties), especially because they saw Romans embattled against Romans. As the danger came nearer, the ambition that had inflamed and blinded them was extinguished, and gave place to fear. Reason purged the mad passion for glory, estimated the peril, and exposed the cause of the war, showing how two men contending with each other for supremacy had put themselves in a position where the one who should be vanquished could no longer hold even the humblest place, and how so great a number of the nobility were incurring the same risk on their account. The leaders reflected also that they, who had lately been friends and relatives by marriage, and had cooperated with each other in many ways to gain rank and power, had now drawn the sword for mutual slaughter and were leading to the same impiety those serving under them, men of the same city, of the same tribe, blood relations, and in some cases brothers against brothers. Even these circumstances were not wanting in this battle; because many unexpected things must happen when thousands of the same nation come together in the clash of arms. Reflecting on these things each of them was seized with unavailing repentance, and since this day was to decide for each whether he should be the highest or the lowest of the human race, they hesitated to begin the fight.

The latter advanced confidently to the encounter, but with stolidity and absolute silence, like men who had had experience in many similar engagements. And now, as they came nearer together, there was first a discharge of arrows and stones. Then as the cavalry were a little in advance of the infantry they charged each other. Those of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> prevailed and began to flank the tenth legion. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> then gave the signal to the cohorts in ambush and these, starting up suddenly, advanced to meet the cavalry, and with spears elevated aimed at the faces of the riders.

Some of the king's attendants came in the skiff, among them a Roman, named <a href=/people/265 target=_blank>Sempronius</a>, who was then serving in the king's army and had formerly served under <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> himself. He gave his hand to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> in the king's name and directed him to take passage in the boat to the young man as to a friend. At the same time the whole army was marshalled along the shore as if to do honor to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, and the king was plainly seen in the midst of them wearing a purple robe. </p>                        </div>

While rowing to the shore all were silent, and this made him still more suspicious. Finally, either recognizing <a href=/people/265 target=_blank>Sempronius</a> as a Roman soldier who had served under him or guessing that he was such because he alone remained standing (for, according to military discipline, a soldier does not sit in the presence of his commander), he turned to him and said, Do I not know you, comrade?

But, contrary to the expectation of all, he replied without hesitation, I discharge you. Then, to their still greater astonishment, and while the silence was most profound, he added, And I will give you all that I have promised when I have my triumph with others. At this expression, as unexpected as it was kind to them, shame immediately took possession of all, and reflection, together with jealousy at the thought of their abandoning their commander in the midst of such great wars and of others joining in the triumph instead of themselves, and of their losing the gains of the war in Africa, which were expected to be great, and becoming enemies of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself as well as of the opposite party.

At length he came back and said that he would not punish any of them, but that he was grieved that even the tenth legion, to which he had always given the first place of honor, should join in such a riot.

Thus did they disclose to each other what they had been privately thinking about for a long time. Each of them tested those of their own friends, and of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s also, whom they considered the most courageous of either faction.

It was said that this happened in the case of <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> when he changed from a king to a tyrant.

While they were in their cups the conversation turned on the question, What is the best kind of death for a man? Various opinions were given, but <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> alone expressed the preference for a sudden death. In this way he foretold his own end, and conversed about what was to happen on the morrow. After the banquet a certain bodily faintness came over him in the night, and his wife, <a href=/people/2393 target=_blank>Calpurnia</a>, had a dream, in which she saw him streaming with blood, for which reason she tried to prevent him from going out in the morning. When he offered sacrifice there were many unfavorable signs. He was about to send <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> to dismiss the Senate when <a href=/people/412 target=_blank>Decimus</a>, who was with him, persuaded him, in order not to incur the charge of disregard for the Senate, to go there and dismiss it himself. Accordingly he was borne thither in a litter. Games were going on in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BPom class=place long=12.47388 lat=41.89524>Pompey's theatre</a>, and the Senate was about to assemble in one of the adjoining buildings, as was the custom when the games were taking place. <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> were early at the portico in front of the theatre, very calmly engaging in public business as praetors with those seeking their services. When they heard of the bad omens at <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s house and that the Senate was to be dismissed, they were greatly disconcerted. While they were in this state of mind a certain person took <a href=/people/1659 target=_blank>Casca</a> by the hand and said, You kept the secret from me, although I am your friend, but <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> has told me all. <a href=/people/1659 target=_blank>Casca</a> was suddenly conscience-stricken and shuddered, but his friend, smiling, continued, Where shall you get the money to stand for the aedileship? Then <a href=/people/1659 target=_blank>Casca</a> recovered himself. While <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> were conferring and talking together, <a href=/people/2921 target=_blank>Popillius</a> <a href=/people/5074 target=_blank>Laena</a>, one of the senators, drew them aside and said that he joined them in his prayers for what they had in mind, and he urged them to make haste.

When he arrived there and found only <a href=/people/2393 target=_blank>Calpurnia</a> he merely said that he wanted to speak to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> about urgent business, and then waited for him to come back from the Senate, because he did not know all the particulars of the affair.

A tablet informing him of the conspiracy was put into <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s hand by another person while he was sacrificing in front of the curia, but he went in immediately and it was found in his hand after his death. Directly after he stepped out of the litter <a href=/people/2921 target=_blank>Popillius</a> <a href=/people/5074 target=_blank>Laena</a>, who a little before had joined his prayers with the party of <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, accosted <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and engaged him aside in earnest conversation. The sight of this proceeding and especially the length of the conversation struck terror into the hearts of the conspirators, and they made signs to each other that they would kill themselves rather than be captured. As the conversation was prolonged they saw that <a href=/people/5074 target=_blank>Laena</a> did not seem to be revealing anything to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, but rather to be urging some petition. They recovered themselves and when they saw him return thanks to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> after the conversation they took new courage. It was the custom of the magistrates, when about to enter the Senate, to take the auspices at the entrance. Here again <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s first victim was without a heart, or, as some say, the beginning of the entrails was wanting. A soothsayer said that this was a sign of death. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, laughing, said that the same thing had happened to him when he was beginning his campaign against <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> in Spain. The soothsayer replied that he had been in very great danger then and that now the omen was still more entitled to credence. So <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> ordered him to sacrifice again. None of the victims were more propitious; but being ashamed to keep the Senate waiting, and being urged by his enemies in the guise of friends, he went in disregarding the omens. For it was fated that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> should meet his doom. </p>                        </div>

Some senators were wounded in the tumult and others killed. Many other citizens and strangers were murdered also, not designedly, but as such things happen in public commotions, by the mistakes of those into whose hands they fell. Gladiators, who had been armed early in the morning for that day's spectacles, ran out of the theatre into the balcony of the Senate. The theatre itself was emptied in haste and panic-terror, and the markets were plundered. All citizens closed their front doors and put themselves in a posture of defence on their roofs. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> fortified his house, apprehending that the conspiracy was against him as well as <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>, the master of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, being in the forum at the time, learned what had been done and ran to the island in the river where he had a legion of soldiers, which he transferred to the plain in order to be in greater readiness to execute <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s orders; for he yielded to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> as a closer friend of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and also as consul. While pondering over the matter they were strongly moved to avenge the death of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, but they feared lest the Senate should espouse the side of the murderers and so they concluded to await events. There had been no military guard around <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, for he did not like guards except the usual attendants of the magistracy. Many civilian officers and a large crowd of citizens and strangers, of slaves and freedmen, had accompanied him from his house to the Senate, but had fled en masse, all except three slaves, who placed the body in a litter and, with uneven step (being an uneven number), bore him homeward who, a little before, had been master of the earth and sea. </p>                        </div>

There they took counsel and decided to bribe the populace, hoping that if some would begin to praise the deed others would join in from love of liberty and longing for the republic. They thought that the Roman people were still exactly the same as they had heard that they were at the time when the elder <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> expelled the kings. They did not perceive that they were counting on two incompatible things, namely, that people could be lovers of liberty and bribe-takers at the same time. The latter class were much easier to find of the two, because the government had been corrupt for a long time. The plebeians were now much mixed with foreign blood, freedmen had equal rights of citizenship with them, and slaves were dressed in the same fashion as their masters. Except in the case of the senatorial rank the same costume was common to slaves and to free citizens. Moreover the distribution of corn to the poor, which took place in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> only, drew thither the lazy, the beggars, the vagrants of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. The multitude of discharged soldiers no longer returned one by one to their native places as formerly, fearing that some of them might be accused of having engaged in iniquitous wars, but were sent in groups to unjust allotments of lands and houses belonging to others.

Still others were opposed to thanking them and thought that it would be sufficient to grant them impunity. Such were the devices to which they resorted, and were trying to discover which of these courses the Senate would be inclined to accept first, hoping that after a little that body would be more easily led on by them to the other measures. The honester portion revolted at the murder as impious, but out of respect for the great families of the murderers would not oppose the granting of impunity, yet they were indignant at the proposal to honor them as public benefactors.

Seeing a great number of these senators themselves who had been designated by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> for city magistracies, priestly offices, and the command of provinces and armies (for, as he was going on a long expedition, he had appointed them for five years), <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> proclaimed silence as consul and said: Those who are asking for a vote on the character of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> ought to consider in the first place that all the things done and decreed under his government and while he was the chosen ruler of the state remain in full force. If it is decided that he usurped the government by violence, his body should be cast out unburied and all his acts annulled. These acts, to speak briefly, embrace the whole earth and sea, and most of them will stand whether we like them or not, as I shall presently show. Those things which alone belong to us to decide, because they concern us alone, I will propose to you first, so that you may gain a conception of the more difficult questions from a consideration of the easier ones. Almost all of us have held office under <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; or do so still, having been chosen thereto by him; or will do so soon, having been designated in advance by him; for, as you know, he had disposed of the city offices, the yearly magistracies, and the command of provinces and armies for five years.

Some encouraged <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> himself and the other magistrates to believe that they would obtain for them the same positions from the people's gratitude without any change of officers, but simply by the more legal method of election in place of monarchical appointment, and that it would be an additional honor to them to hold the same places under the monarchy and the republic.

Despising such prophecies, uttered with so much confidence by the soothsayer, and other prodigies that I have previously mentioned, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> went on his way and was killed, being fifty-six years of age. He was a man most fortunate in all things, superhuman, of grand designs, and fit to be compared with <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. Both were men of the greatest ambition, both were most skilled in the art of war, most rapid in executing their decisions, most reckless of danger, least sparing of themselves, and relying as much on audacity and luck as on military skill. <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> made a long journey through the desert in the hot season to visit the oracle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/292255SAmm class=place long=25.5435 lat=29.2052>Ammon</a> and crossed the Gulf of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=place long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylia</a> against a head sea successfully.

Once he was the first to ascend the scaling ladders and leaped over the wall among his enemies alone, and in this condition received thirteen wounds. Yet he was never defeated, and he finished almost every war in one or two battles. He conquered many barbarians in Europe and made himself master of Greece, a people hard to control, fond of freedom, who boasted that they had never obeyed anybody before him, except <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> for a little while under the guise of his leadership in war. He overran almost the whole of Asia. To sum up <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s fortune and power in a word, he acquired as much of the earth as he saw, and died while he was devising means to capture the rest. </p>                        </div>

He often dashed against the enemy single-handed when all others were afraid. He fought thirty pitched battles in Gaul alone, where he conquered forty nations so formidable to the Romans previously that in the law which exempted priests and old men from military enrolment an exception was made of a Gallic war, in case of which priests and old men were required to serve in the army.

In these civil wars, in which he engaged either through apprehension, as he says, or ambition, he was brought in conflict with the first generals of the age and with many large armies, not now of barbarians, but of Romans in the highest state of efficiency and good fortune, and, like <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, he overcame them all by one or two engagements with each. His forces were not, like <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s, always victorious, for they were defeated by the Gauls most disastrously under the command of his lieutenants, <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a> and <a href=/people/6029 target=_blank>Titurius</a>; and in Spain <a href=/people/1898 target=_blank>Petreius</a> and <a href=/people/847 target=_blank>Afranius</a> shut them up like an army besieged.

It happened to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> in Spain while his army was in great fear of young <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, and hesitated to join battle. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> dashed in advance of all into the space between the armies, and received 200 darts on his shield until his army, moved by shame and fear for his safety, rushed forward and rescued him. Thus in the case of each the first victims without livers presaged danger of death; the second presaged death itself.

Again, the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a> urged him not to march his army into the city while looking toward the setting sun, but to go around and enter facing the east. It is said that he yielded to this suggestion and started to go around, but being bothered by a lake and marshy ground, he disregarded this second prophecy also, and entered the city looking toward the west. Not long after entering he went down the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> in a boat to the river Pallacotta, which takes its water from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> and carries it away in marshes and ponds and thus hinders the irrigation and navigation of the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> country.

On the rumor of this plot, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, using his consular authority, arrested <a href=/people/4058 target=_blank>Amatius</a> and boldly put him to death without a trial.

The followers of <a href=/people/4058 target=_blank>Amatius</a>, and the plebeians generally, missing <a href=/people/4058 target=_blank>Amatius</a> and feeling indignation at the deed, and especially because it had been done by <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, whom the people had honored, determined that they would not be scorned in that way.

The extreme fondness of the plebeians for <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was turned into extreme hatred. The Senate was delighted, because it believed that <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and his associates could not rest secure otherwise. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> also moved that Sextus <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> (the son of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> the Great, who was still much beloved by all) should be recalled from Spain, where he was still at war with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s lieutenants, and that he should be paid 50,000,000 of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> drachmas out of the public treasury for his father's confiscated property and be appointed commander of the sea, as his father had been, with charge of all the Roman ships, wherever situated, which were needed for immediate service.

They thought that what they had done would be confirmed, and the republic be at last restored, and their party successful. Wherefore <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> praised <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> continually, and the Senate, perceiving that the plebeians were making plots against him on its account, allowed him a guard for his personal safety, chosen by himself from the veterans who were sojourning in the city. </p>                        </div>

These were composed wholly of centurions, as being fit for command, and of long experience in war, and his own acquaintances through service under <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. He appointed tribunes over them, chosen from their own number and adorned with military decoration, and these he held in honor and made sharers of his public councils. The Senate began to be suspicious of the number of his guards, and of his care in choosing them, and advised him to reduce them to a moderate number so as to avoid invidious remarks. He promised to do so as soon as the disorder among the plebeians should be quieted. It had been decreed that all the things done by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and all that he intended to do, should be ratified. The memoranda of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s intentions were in <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s possession, and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s secretary, <a href=/people/2049 target=_blank>Faberius</a>, was obedient to him in every way since <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself, on the point of his departure, had placed all petitions of this kind in <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s discretion. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> made many additions in order to secure the favor of many persons.

Seeing that the republic was not confirmed by deeds, they suspected <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> for that reason also. They reposed most confidence in <a href=/people/11075 target=_blank>Decimus Brutus</a>, who had three legions near by.

They preferred, nevertheless, to spend the remainder of their year as private citizens somewhere, as a matter of necessity, rather than serve as praetors in the city where they were not safe, and were not held in honor corresponding to the benefits they had conferred upon their country. Being in this state of mind, and the Senate holding the same opinion as themselves, the latter gave them charge of the supply of corn for the city from all parts of the world until the time should arrive for them to take command of their provinces.

If the latter would have befallen you, then it is well that you were not present. When certain senators proposed rewards to the murderers as tyrannicides you strongly opposed them. For this I give you hearty thanks, although you knew that they intended to kill you also; not, as I think, because you were likely to avenge <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, but, as they themselves say, lest you should be his successor in the tyranny.

Yet you, as consul, ought to have seen what would be for the interest of the majority, and if you had wished to avenge such a monstrous crime, or to reclaim the erring, your office would have enabled you to do either. But you sent hostages from your own family to the murderers at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> for their security.

This will not be unjust to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> now that he is dead, nor would he say that it was unjust if he were living and were asked for the accounts. And as there will be many private persons to dispute with you concerning single pieces of property, you may assume that this portion will not be uncontested. The money transferred to my house was not so large a sum as you conjecture, nor is any part of it in my custody now. The men in power and authority, except <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> and my brothers, divided up the whole of it straightway as the property of a tyrant, but were brought around by me to support the decrees in favor of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and you, if you are wise, when you get possession of the remainder, will distribute it among those who are disaffected toward you rather than among the people. The former, if they are in harmony with you, will send the people, who are to be colonized, away to their settlements. The people, however, as you ought to have learned from the Greek studies you have been lately pursuing, are as unstable as the waves of the sea, now advancing, now retreating. In like manner, among us also, the people are forever exalting their favorites, and casting them down again. </p>                        </div>

The decrees also, he said, had been recorded in a sense different from the understanding at the time. While hastily passing a mere decree of amnesty, it had been registered that whatever had been previously determined on should stand unrepealed, not for its own sake, not because it was satisfactory in all respects, but rather to promote good order and to quiet the people, who had been thrown into tumult by these events. It would be more just, he added, to observe the spirit than the letter of the decree, and not to make an unseemly opposition to so many men who had lost their own and their ancestors' property in the civil convulsions, and to do this in favor of a young man who had received an amount of other people's wealth disproportionate to a private station and beyond his hopes, and who was not making good use of his fortune, but employing it in the rashest adventures.

So they took their portion immediately, in order not to lose their own share by the lawsuits, and they did this not so much on their own account as on that of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, for they were going to bestow the whole of it upon him soon afterward. </p>                        </div>

He went around to the places where his property was on sale and ordered the auctioneers to announce the lowest possible price for everything, both on account of the uncertainty and danger of the lawsuits still pending, and on account of his own zeal for the people, all of which brought him both popularity and sympathy as one undeserving of such treatment.

When <a href=/people/7550 target=_blank>Critonius</a> said that he could not allow <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> to be honored in this way at games given at his expense, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> brought him before <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> as consul. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> said he would refer the matter to the Senate. <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> was vexed and said, Refer it; I will place the throne there as long as the decree is in force. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was angry and prohibited it. He prohibited it still more unreasonably in the next games given by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> himself, which had been instituted by his father in honor of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> Genetrix when he dedicated a temple to her in a forum, together with the forum itself. It was evident that universal hatred of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> had already grown out of this affair, since he seemed to be moved not so much by a feeling of rivalry toward the younger <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> as by an ungrateful purpose to insult the memory of the elder one. <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> himself, with a crowd of people like a body-guard, moved about among the plebeians and those who had received benefits from his father, or had served under him in war, stirring their anger and beseeching them not to despise him, the victim of so many and so great outrages, nor willingly desert him, but to defend <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, their commander and benefactor, dishonored by <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>; to defend him for their own sakes, because they would never be secure in what they had received from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> unless the decrees passed in his honor should remain in full force. He exclaimed against <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> everywhere throughout the city, and especially from the high places that he came to, saying, O <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, do not be angry with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> on my account. Do not insult one who has been the greatest benefactor to you. Heap indignities on me to your heart's content. Cease plundering his property until the legacy to the citizens is paid; then take all the rest. However poor I may be, my father's glory, if that remains, and the distribution to the people, if you will allow it to be made, will be all-sufficient for me. </p>                        </div>

The law concerning Cisalpine Gaul was proposed at once to the great dismay of the senators. They intended, if <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> should first bring the law before them, to reject it, and if he should bring it before the popular assembly without consulting them, to have the tribunes of the people veto it. There were some who advised that this province be made free altogether, so much was it dreaded on account of its nearness. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, on the other hand, accused them of intrusting it to <a href=/people/412 target=_blank>Decimus</a> because he had been one of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s murderers and of having no confidence in himself because he had not joined in killing the man who had subdued the province and brought it to its knees — throwing out these insinuations openly against all of his opponents, as persons who rejoiced over the assassination. When the day for the comitia came the Senate desired that the votes should be taken by centuries, but the Antonians, who had enclosed the forum with a rope during the night, demanded that the votes be taken by tribes according to a plan they had agreed upon. Although the plebeians were incensed against <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> they nevertheless cooperated with him for the sake of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, who stood alongside the rope and begged them to do so.

The people thought that he was ambitious of this office for himself, but that he refrained from being a candidate because he was under age, and, accordingly, they proposed to cast their votes for him for tribune. The Senate begrudged him this increase of power, fearing lest, as tribune, he should bring the murderers of his father before the popular assembly for trial. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, in disregard of his recent alliance with <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, either to curry favor with the Senate, or to appease its dissatisfaction with the law respecting Cisalpine Gaul, or for private reasons, gave public notice, as consul, that <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> should not solicit votes contrary to law; and that if he should do so he (<a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>) would use every means in his power against him.

The people were terror-stricken. The murderers with their gladiators took possession of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> and shut themselves up in it. The Senate was on their side, just as it now is more openly, and was about to vote rewards to them as tyrannicides. If <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> were declared a tyrant then might we all have perished as the friends of a tyrant. In the midst of such confusion, anxiety, and fear, when it would not have been surprising if I had been at a loss what to do, you will find, if you examine, that where courage was needed I was boldest and where artifice was required I was most crafty. The first thing to be done, because it embraced everything else, was to prevent the voting of rewards to the conspirators. This I accomplished against the strong opposition of the Senate and of the murderers, with unfailing courage and in the face of danger, because I then believed that we of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s party could be safe only in case <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> were not declared a tyrant. But when I saw our enemies, and the Senate itself, plunged in the same fear (lest, if <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> were not decreed a tyrant, they themselves should be convicted of murder), and making their fight, for this reason, I yielded and granted amnesty instead of rewards to the murderers, in order to gain what I wanted in exchange. What did I want and how important was it? That <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s name should not be blotted out was the dearest wish of all to me, that his property should not be confiscated, that the adoption on which this young man prides himself should not be annulled, that the will should not be declared invalid, that his body should have a royal funeral, that the immortal honors previously decreed to him should be fulfilled, that all his acts should be confirmed, and that his son, and we his friends, both generals and soldiers, should remain in perfect safety and enjoy a life of honor instead of ignominy. </p>                        </div>

If this exchange had been made in all sincerity it would have been a fair bargain to actually spare the murderers for the sake of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s immortal glory and our complete security, but in fact I did it not with that intention, but in order to gain time. Accordingly, as soon as I had obtained what I wanted from the Senate, and the murderers were freed from anxiety, I took fresh courage and undermined the amnesty, not by votes, not by decrees (for that was impossible), but by working on the people imperceptibly. I brought <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s body into the forum under pretence of burial, I laid bare his wounds, I showed the number of them and his clothing all bloody and slashed by the knives. In public speech I dwelt on his bravery and his services to the common people in pathetic terms, weeping for him as slain and invoking him as a god. These acts and words of mine stirred up the people, kindled a fire in spite of the amnesty, sent them against the houses of our enemies, and drove the murderers from the city. How much the Senate was thwarted and grieved by this was presently shown when they blamed me for exciting the people and sent the murderers away to take command of provinces, <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, which were provided with great armies, telling them to hasten before the appointed time, under pretence of looking after the corn supply. And now another and still greater fear took possession of me (as I had no military force of my own anywhere), lest we should be exposed without arms to the assaults of so many armed men. I suspected my colleague also because he was always at variance with me. He had pretended to be in the conspiracy against <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and he had proposed that the day of the murder should be celebrated as the birthday of the republic. </p>                        </div>

Then for the first time I considered myself on an equality with my enemies, not merely with the open ones [as <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> thinks], but with the more numerous and powerful ones who still choose to remain secret. When I had accomplished these plans there remained one of the murderers on my flank, <a href=/people/11075 target=_blank>Decimus Brutus</a>, who governed a conveniently placed province with a large army, whom I, knowing him to be bolder than the rest, have deprived of Cisalpine Gaul, by promising, in order to keep up appearances with the Senate, to give him in exchange <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, when it has lost its army.

Nevertheless they urged him to come to an agreement with <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>; and as both yielded they formed a new alliance in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>. Not long afterward <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> announced to his friends that some of his body-guard had been tampered with by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, who had formed a plot against him. This he said either as a slander, or because he believed it to be true, or because he had heard of the emissaries of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> in his camp and thought they were actually plotting against his life. When this story was noised about there was a general tumult forthwith and great indignation, for there were few who had sufficient penetration to see that it was for the interest of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, even though he were unjust to him, should live, because he (<a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>) was a terror to the murderers. If he were dead they would quite fearlessly dare anything, especially as they had the support of the Senate. The more intelligent knew this, but the greater part, seeing what <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> suffered daily from the indignities and the losses inflicted on him, considered the accusation not incredible, yet held it to be impious and intolerable that a conspiracy should be formed against <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s life while he was consul. <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> ran with mad fury to those who held this opinion of him, exclaiming that it was <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> that had conspired against him to alienate from him the friendship of the people, which was the only thing left to him. He ran to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s door and repeated the same things, calling the gods to witness, taking all kinds of oaths, and inviting <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> to a judicial investigation. As nobody came forward he said, I will accept your friends as judges. With these words he attempted to enter the house. Being prevented from doing so he again cried out and railed at <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> and vented his wrath against the doorkeepers who restrained him from having a dispute with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>. Then he went away and called the people to witness that if anything should happen to him his death would be due to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s plots. As these words were spoken with deep feeling the multitude underwent a change, and a kind of penitence took the place of their former opinion. There were some who still doubted, and hesitated to put faith in either of them. Some accused them both of making false pretences, believing that they had come to an agreement in the temple, and that these were plots devised against their enemies. Still others thought that this was a device of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> to increase his body-guard. or to alienate the veterans from <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>. </p>                        </div>

While he was waiting at the entrance cogitating over this news it was announced to him that another legion, called the Fourth, had followed the example of the Martian and espoused the side of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>.

When they wanted to go before the Senate en masse he prevented them and would not even allow them to send messengers, believing that the Senate would vote these things to him voluntarily; and would do this all the more, he said, if they know of your zeal and my hesitation. They were reconciled to this course with difficulty. The leading officers complained that he disdained them, and he explained to them that the Senate was moved not so much by good-will toward him as by fear of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> and the want of an army; and that will be the case, he continued, until we humble <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, and until the murderers, who are friends and relatives of the senators, collect a military force for them.

In our elections and in our jury trials justice is ever on the side of the majority.

At <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundusium</a> he organized a royal cohort for his own use and openly made men-at-arms his private guards and night watchmen, serving under a countersign. The whole remainder of the army he led from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundusium</a> to the city, aiming by a shorter path at the same designs that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> contemplated.

Then <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> said: Our law, Conscript Fathers, requires that the accused shall himself hear the charge preferred against him and shall be judged after he has made his own defence; and for the truth of this I appeal to <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, our greatest orator. Since he hesitates to accuse <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> when present, but brings against him in his absence certain charges which he considers of the greatest gravity, and not open to doubt, I have come forward to show, in the fewest words, that these charges are false. He says that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> converted the public money to his own use after <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s death. The law declares such a person to be a thief, not a public enemy, and limits his punishment accordingly. After <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> had killed <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> he accused the latter before the people of plundering the public money and leaving the treasury empty. Soon afterward <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> proposed a decree to investigate these matters and you adopted and confirmed his motion and promised a reward of one-tenth to informers, which reward we will double if anybody will prove that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> had any part in the fraud.

The desertion of two of his legions shows how insubordinate and arrogant <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s army was — which legions you had voted that he should command, and who deserted, in violation of military law, not to you, but to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>.

He enrolled them among his own troops, or if they wished to return to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> he allowed them to do so, in order to show that he was not moved by implacable hatred against him. When he was encamped near to <a href=/people/766 target=_blank>Ventidius</a>, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s friend, who had command of three legions, he inspired the latter with fear, but performed no hostile act, and in like manner gave him the opportunity to join himself or to go on safely with his army to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, and told him to chide the latter for ignoring their common interests. <a href=/people/766 target=_blank>Ventidius</a> took the hint and proceeded to join <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>. <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> also allowed <a href=/people/869 target=_blank>Decius</a>, one of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s officers, who had been taken prisoner at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/446109UMut class=place long=10.925 lat=44.6472>Mutina</a>, and had been treated with honor, to return to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> if he wished, and when <a href=/people/869 target=_blank>Decius</a> tried to find out what were his sentiments toward <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, he said that he had given plenty of indications to persons of discernment and that more would be insufficient for fools. </p>                        </div>

The Senate knew this well, but it hoped that by finding a pretext for annulling a part of the measures it should be enabled in the same way to annul the whole. The decemvirs gave public notice that whoever had received anything from <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s government should make it known in writing immediately, and threatened any who should disobey. The Pompeians also sought the consulship for the remainder of the year in place of <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> and <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a>. But <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> also sought it, applying not to the Senate, but to <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> privately, whom he urged to become his colleague, saying that <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> should carry on the government, as he was the elder and more experienced, and that he (<a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>) would enjoy the title only, by which means he could dismiss his army in a becoming manner, for which reason he had previously asked the honor of a triumph. <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, whose desire for office was excited by this proposal, said to the Senate that he understood that a negotiation was on foot among the generals commanding the provinces, and he advised that they should conciliate the man whom they had treated with disdain and who was still at the head of a large army, and allow him to hold office in the city, notwithstanding his youth, rather than that he should remain under arms in a hostile attitude.

The Senate laughed at <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>'s ambition, and the relatives of the conspirators especially opposed him, fearing lest <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, as consul, should bring the murderers to punishment. </p>                        </div>

They complained especially because of the inopportune time for such a strife, while <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> were far away and their forces not yet organized, and on their own flank in a hostile attitude were <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> and <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>, who, they thought, might form an alliance with <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>.

Messengers were hastily despatched to tell him these things. Directly after they had left the city the Senate repented. It felt that it ought not to be so weakly terror-stricken, or accept a new tyranny without bloodshed, or accustom those seeking office to gain it by violence, or the soldiers to govern the country by the word of command. Rather should they arm themselves as far as possible and oppose the laws to the invaders, for there was some hope that, if the laws were opposed to them, not even they would bear arms against their country. If they should do so, it would be best to endure a siege until <a href=/people/412 target=_blank>Decimus</a> and <a href=/people/505 target=_blank>Plancus</a> should come to the rescue, and to defend themselves to the death rather than submit voluntarily to a slavery thenceforth without remedy.

Their regret for what they had done was confirmed; <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> again made his appearance, and they repealed all of the decrees above mentioned. All who were of military age were called to arms, also the two legions from Africa, and 1000 <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> with them, and another legion that <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a> had left behind, all these were assigned to their proper places.

They hoped also to change those of the opposite faction as soon as it became a contest for liberty. When they sought for the mother and sister of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, and did not discover them either in any open or secret abode, they were again alarmed at finding themselves deprived of such important hostages, and as the Caesarians showed no disposition to yield to them they concluded that these women had been carefully concealed by them. </p>                        </div>

After the sacrifices he caused his adoption by his father to be ratified again, according to the lex curiata, — that is, by a popular vote, — for the parts into which the tribes, or the common people, are divided are called curioe, just as I suppose the similar divisions among the Greeks are called phratrioe. Among the Romans this was the method of adoption most in accordance with law in the case of orphans; and those who follow it have the same rights as real sons in respect of the relatives and the freedmen of the persons who adopt them. Among the other splendid accessories of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was a large number of freedmen, many of them rich, and this was perhaps the principal reason why <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> wanted the adoption by a vote of the people in addition to the former adoption which came to him by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s will. </p>                        </div>

For these reasons each one became treacherous to the household, preferring his own gain to compassion for the home. Those who were faithful and well-disposed feared to aid, or conceal, or connive at the escape of the victims, because such acts made them liable to the very same punishments. This was quite different from the peril that befell the seventeen men first condemned. Then there was no proscription, but certain persons were arrested unexpectedly, and as all feared similar treatment all sheltered each other. After the proscriptions some immediately became the betrayers of all. Others, being free from danger themselves and eager for gain, became hunting <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> for the murderers for the sake of the rewards. Of the remainder, some plundered the houses of the slain, and their private gains turned their thoughts away from the public calamities; others, more prudent and upright, were palsied with consternation.

Then, seizing <a href=/people/1677 target=_blank>Salvius</a> by the hair, just as he was, the centurion drew him as far as need be across the table, cut off his head, and ordered the guests to stay where they were and make no disturbance unless they wished to suffer a like fate. So they remained after the centurion's departure, stupefied and speechless, till the most silent watches of the night, reclining by the side of the tribune's body.

Others thought that such property would bring them bad luck, or that it would not be quite safe for them to be seen with gold and silver in their possession, or that, as they were not free from danger with their present holdings, it would be extra-hazardous to increase them. Only the boldest spirits came forward and purchased at the lowest prices, because they were the only buyers. Thus it came to pass that the triumvirs, who had hoped to realize a sufficient sum for their preparations, were short 20,000,000 of drachmas. </p>                        </div>

His small boats and merchant ships met those who were escaping by sea, and his war-ships sailed along the shore and made signals to those wandering there and saved such as they found. <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> himself met the newcomers and provided them at once with clothing and other necessaries. To those who were worthy he assigned commands in his military and naval forces. When, at a later period, he entered into negotiations with the triumvirs, he would not conclude a treaty without embracing in its terms those who had taken refuge with him. In this way he rendered to his unfortunate country the greatest service, from which he gained a high reputation of his own in addition to that which he had inherited from his father, and not less than that. Others escaped by concealing themselves in various ways, some in the fields or in the tombs, others in the city itself, undergoing cruel anxiety until peace was restored. Remarkable examples were shown of the love of wives for their husbands, of sons for their fathers, and of slaves for their masters, quite beyond expectation.

At first many concealed what they had, hoping that in the end the threat would not be carried out, but when they saw the rewards paid and those who had been informed against punished, they became alarmed, and having procured the appointment of another day, some of them dug their money out of the ground, others drew it out of wells, and others brought it from tombs, in much larger amounts than the former collections. </p>                        </div>

Being the younger son of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> the Great, he was at first disregarded by Gaius <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> in Spain as not likely to accomplish anything of importance on account of his youth and inexperience. He roamed about the ocean with a few followers, committing <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>piracy</a> and concealing the fact that he was <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. When larger numbers joined him for the purpose of pillage, and his force became powerful, he revealed his name. Presently those who had served with his father and his brother, and who were leading a vagabond life, drifted to him as their natural leader, and <a href=/people/2717 target=_blank>Arabio</a>, who had been deprived of his ancestral kingdom, as I have related previously, came to him from Africa. His forces being thus augmented, his doings were now more important than robbery, and as he flew from place to place the name of <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> spread through the whole of Spain, which was the most extensive of the provinces; but he avoided coming to an engagement with the governors of it appointed by Gaius <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. When <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a> learned of his doings he sent Carinas with a stronger army to fight him. <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, however, being the more nimble of the two, would show himself and then disappear, and so he wore out his enemy and got possession of a number of towns, large and small. </p>                        </div>

These cities dreaded a victory of the triumvirs more than anything else, and whatever they could do against them secretly they did. The wealthy citizens fled from a country that they could no longer consider their own and took refuge with <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, who was near by and greatly beloved by all at that time. There were present with him also many seafaring men from Africa and Spain, skilled in naval affairs, so that <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> was well provided with officers, ships, troops, and money. When <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> learned these facts he sent <a href=/people/1905 target=_blank>Salvidienus</a> with a fleet to come alongside of <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> and destroy him, as though it were an easy task, while he passed through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> himself with the intention of joining <a href=/people/1905 target=_blank>Salvidienus</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=place long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a>. <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> advanced with a large fleet to meet <a href=/people/1905 target=_blank>Salvidienus</a>, and a naval engagement took place between them at the entrance of the straits near the promontory of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374235LSky class=place long=23.5297 lat=37.43785>Scyllaeum</a>. The ships of <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, being lighter and manned by better sailors, excelled in swiftness and skill, while those of the Romans, being of great tonnage and size, labored heavily. When the usual rush of waves through the straits came on, and the sea dashed hither and thither under the influence of the current, the ships of <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> suffered less than their adversaries, because they were accustomed to the agitation of the waters; while those of <a href=/people/1905 target=_blank>Salvidienus</a>, being unable to maintain their position firmly, or to work their oars, or manage their rudders, by reason of their inexperience, were thrown into confusion. Accordingly, about sunset, <a href=/people/1905 target=_blank>Salvidienus</a> was the first to give the signal of retreat. <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> withdrew also. The ships suffered about equally on both sides. <a href=/people/1905 target=_blank>Salvidienus</a> retired to the port of <a href=/people/8955 target=_blank>Balarus</a>, facing the straits, where he repaired what was left of his damaged and wasted fleet. </p>                        </div>

The latter were escorted by triremes, but a strong and favorable wind having sprung up they darted across fearlessly, needing no escort. <a href=/people/1451 target=_blank>Murcus</a> was vexed, but he lay in wait for the empty ships on their return. Yet these returned, took on board the remainder of the soldiers, and crossed again with full sails until the whole army, together with <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> and <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, had passed over. Although <a href=/people/1451 target=_blank>Murcus</a> recognized that his plans were frustrated by some fatality, he held his position nevertheless, in order to hinder as much as possible the passage of the enemy's munitions and supplies, or supplementary troops. <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> <a href=/people/1039 target=_blank>Ahenobarbus</a> was sent by <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> to cooperate with him in this work, which they deemed most useful, together with fifty additional ships, one legion, and a body of archers; for, as the triumvirs did not have a plentiful supply of provisions from elsewhere, it was deemed important to cut off their convoys from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. And so <a href=/people/1451 target=_blank>Murcus</a> and <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, with their 130 long ships and a still greater number of small ones, and their large military force, sailed hither and thither harassing the enemy. </p>                        </div>

Yet you saw these inviolable men despoiled with contumely of this inviolable office, and of their sacred vestments, without trial, at the order of one man, because in your behalf they saw fit to proceed against certain persons who wished to proclaim him as king. The senators were deeply grieved at this on your account, for the office of tribune is yours, not theirs. But they were not able to censure this man openly or to bring him to trial by reason of the strength of the armies, which, although heretofore belonging to the republic, he had made his own.

Accordingly the senators refrained, not wishing to insult <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, but only to get rid of the tyranny. So they voted amnesty for all, and it was more particularly decreed that there should be no prosecution for the murder. After a little, when <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> excited the mob against us, the Senate gave us command of the largest provinces and armies, and ordered all the countries between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421170WAdr class=place long=16.95 lat=42.09>Adriatic</a> to obey us.

It passed a decree also to pay back to him, out of the public funds, the value of his father's property, and it appointed him admiral in order that he also might hold a command because he was on the side of the republic.

This is a breaking out of all the wounds that had been previously healed over, — sudden seizures of men, and all kinds of infamy perpetrated by wives and sons, freedmen and slaves. Into so desperate a plight and such conditions has the city now been plunged. At the head of all these villains are the triumvirs, who proscribe their own brothers and uncles and tutors first of all.

On the fourth day, fatigued with labor and thirst, the water which they carried being nearly exhausted, they recollected that it had been said that they should be in a waterless region only three days. So they fell into a panic, fearing that they were the victims of a stratagem. They did not disbelieve those who had been sent in advance and who said that they had seen the river, but they thought that they themselves had been led in a different direction.

While <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> was beseeching them with words of good cheer to persevere to the end, towards evening the river was seen by those in front, who, as was natural, raised a cry of joy, which was taken up by those behind in due order until it reached the rear.

We will make it part of our plan that hunger shall engage them before we do, so that when it is necessary to fight we shall find them weakened and exhausted. Let us not be carried away by our ardor before the proper time. Let no one think that delay implies want of generalship more than haste, when he casts his eye on the sea behind us, which sends us aid and provisions and enables us to win victory without danger if we wait and do not mind the insults and provocations of the enemy, who are not braver than ourselves, as yesterday's work shows, but are trying to avert another danger. Let the zeal which I now desire you to repress be shown abundantly when I ask it. The rewards of victory I will pay you in full when it shall please the gods that our work be finished. And now for your bravery in yesterday's engagement, I will give to each soldier 1000 drachmas and to your officers in proportion.

He preferred to endure a siege, or anything else, rather than come to an engagement with men who were famishing, and whose hopes rested solely on fighting because they despaired of every other resource.

Their officers, although they approved of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>' design, were vexed, thinking that in the present temper of the army they might overpower the enemy more quickly. <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> himself was the cause of these murmurs, being of a gentle and kindly disposition toward all — not like <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, who was austere and imperious in every way, for which reason the army obeyed his orders promptly, not interfering with his authority, not inquiring the reasons for his orders, and not criticising them when they had learned them.

On the one side was the fear of famine, on the other a well-deserved shame that they had constrained their general to fight when he still favored delay, and fear lest they should come short of their promises and prove weaker than their boastings, and expose themselves to the charge of rashness instead of winning praise for good counsel; because also <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, riding through the ranks on horseback, showed himself before them with a severe countenance and reminded them in a few words of what the opportunity offered.

They had little need of arrows, stones, or javelins, which are customary in war, for they did not resort to the usual manoeuvres and tactics of battles, but, coming to close combat with naked swords, they slew and were slain, seeking to break each other's ranks. On the one side it was a fight for self-preservation rather than victory; on the other for victory and for the satisfaction of the general who had been forced to fight against his will. The slaughter and the groans were terrible. The bodies of the fallen were carried back and others stepped into their places from the rear ranks. The generals flew hither and thither overlooking everything, exciting the men by their ardor, exhorting the toilers to toil on, and relieving those who were exhausted so that there was always fresh courage at the front.

The latter were driven back step by step, slowly at first and without loss of courage. Presently their ranks began to dissolve and they retreated more rapidly, and then the second and third ranks in the rear retreated with them, all mingled together in disorder, crowded by each other and by the enemy, who pressed upon them without ceasing until it became plainly a flight.

Once when he was about to cross from Asia into Europe with his army, and while he was awake at night and the light was burning low, he beheld an apparition of extraordinary form standing near him, and when he boldly asked who of men or gods it might be, the spectre answered, I am thy evil genius, <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>.

The fame of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was then at its maximum, not only among the soldiers, but among all others. The victory of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410243PPhi class=place long=24.285 lat=41.012>Philippi</a> was considered wholly due to him, on account of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>' illness. Although <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> was not ignorant that it was a violation of the agreement, he yielded as a matter of favor to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, and appointed friends of the latter as colony leaders for <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s legions. These leaders, in order that they might appear more favorable to the soldiers than <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> was, allowed them to commit still greater outrages. So there was another multitude from other communities, neighbors of the dispossessed ones, suffering many injuries at the hands of the soldiers, and crying out against <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, saying that the colonization was worse than the proscription, since the latter was directed against foes, while the former was against inoffensive persons. </p>                        </div>

The soldiers would be less zealous in the future if they were not paid for their former service. It was a matter of much importance that the five years' term of office was running out, and that the good-will of the soldiers was needed to renew it, for which reason he was willing to overlook for the time being their insolence and arrogance. Once in the theatre when he was present, a soldier, not finding his own seat, went and took one in the place reserved for the knights.

When he was produced before them they supposed that he had been brought from prison, but he denied that he had been imprisoned and related what had taken place. They said that he had been instructed to tell a lie and reproached him for betraying their common interests. Such was the example of their insolence in the theatre. </p>                        </div>

All these things impaired military discipline, and the soldiers thought that they were not so much serving in the army as lending assistance, by their own favor and judgment, to leaders who needed them for their own personal ends. Desertion, which had formerly been unpardonable, was now rewarded with gifts, and whole armies resorted to it, including some illustrious men, who did not consider it desertion to change to a similar cause, for all parties were alike, since neither of them could be distinguished as battling against the common enemy of the Roman people. The common pretence of the generals that they were all striving for the good of the country made desertion easy in the thought that one could serve his country in any party. Understanding these facts the generals tolerated this behavior, for they knew that their authority over their armies depended on donatives rather than on law. Thus, everything was torn in factions, and the armies indulged in insubordination toward the leaders of the factions. </p>                        </div>

He approved of their ardor, saying, In our recent battle we did not fight in a way corresponding to our present necessity. Now we must either surrender, or, if that seems worse than death, we must fight to the death. All assented eagerly, and, in order that no one should have the night for an excuse, they demanded to be led out by daylight. Lucius marched out at dawn. He took an abundance of iron tools, for wall fighting, and ladders of every form. He carried machines for filling the ditches, and folding towers from which planks could be thrown to the walls; also all kinds of missiles and stones and wickerwork to be thrown upon the palisades. They made a violent assault, filled up the ditch, scaled the palisades, and advanced to the walls, which some of them undermined, while others applied the ladders, and others simultaneously moved up the towers and defended themselves with stones, arrows, and leaden balls, with absolute contempt of death.

These fresh troops flung the assailants down from the walls, broke their machines in pieces, and hurled missiles upon them contemptuously from above. Their enemy, although their shields and bodies were pierced and even their voices had failed, held their ground bravely. When the corpses of those who had been killed on the wall were stripped and thrown down among them, they could not bear the indignity, but turned away from the spectacle and stood for a moment undecided, like athletes taking a breathing-spell in the gymnastic games.

The troops of Lucius began to grow down-hearted, and, as usually happens in such cases, the guards relaxed their vigilance, and thus desertion became more frequent, not only of the common soldiers, but, in some cases, of the higher officers also.

With the intention of reverting to the freedom and democratic government of our ancestors, I asked that after the rewards of victory had been distributed the monarchy should be dissolved. When my request was not granted, I sought to enforce it by virtue of my office. <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> falsely accused me, before the army, of obstructing the colonies out of pity for the landowners. I was ignorant of this slander for a long time, and even when I learned of it I did not suppose that anybody could believe it, when one saw that the colony officers were men assigned by my very self to divide the lands among you. But the calumny misled some people, who joined <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> in order to make war against us as they think. But eventually they will find that they have been warring against their own interests. I affirm that you have chosen the better cause, and that you have suffered for it beyond your strength. We are vanquished, not by our enemies, but by hunger, to which we have been left a prey by our own generals. It would be becoming in me to fight to the last extremity for my country. Such an end would make my fame glorious after my high purposes. To that destiny I do not submit, for the sake of you, whom I prefer to my own fame.

When they, who had been the head of the faction, were dead, and the remainder, if there were any left, were bearing arms, not against the state, but because they feared you, and moreover the five years' term was running out, I demanded that the magistracies should be revived in accordance with the customs of our fathers, not even preferring my brother to my country, but hoping to persuade him to assent upon his return and hastening to bring this about during my own term of office. If you had begun this reform you alone would have reaped the glory. Since I was not able to persuade you, I thought to march against the city and to use force, being a citizen, a nobleman, and a consul. These are the causes of the war I waged and these alone; not my brother, nor <a href=/people/382 target=_blank>Manius</a>, nor <a href=/people/821 target=_blank>Fulvia</a>, nor the colonization of those who fought at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410243PPhi class=place long=24.285 lat=41.012>Philippi</a>, nor pity for the cultivators who were deprived of their holdings, since I myself appointed the leaders of colonies to my brother's legions who deprived the cultivators of their possessions and divided them among the soldiers. Yet you brought this charge against me before the soldiers, shifting the cause of the war from yourself to the land distribution, and in this way chiefly you drew them to your side and overcame me, for they were persuaded that I was warring against them, and that they were defending themselves against my wrong-doing. You certainly needed to use artifice in the war you were waging. Now that you have conquered, if you are the enemy of the country you must consider me your enemy also, since I wished what I thought was for her advantage, but was prevented by famine from accomplishing it. </p>                        </div>

They did so, and laid their ship alongside of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s. When the two commanders saw each other they exchanged greetings, and the army of <a href=/people/1039 target=_blank>Ahenobarbus</a> saluted <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> as imperator. <a href=/people/505 target=_blank>Plancus</a> recovered his courage with difficulty. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> received <a href=/people/1039 target=_blank>Ahenobarbus</a> in his own ship and sailed to Paloeis, where <a href=/people/1039 target=_blank>Ahenobarbus</a> had his infantry, and here he yielded his tent to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>. </p>                        </div>

Finally <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>' men revealed their purpose to the others, saying that they had come with <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, not because they were forgetful of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s merits, but with the intention of bringing them to an agreement, or, if <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> refused and continued the war, of defending <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> against him. These things they openly said also when they approached <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s works. While these events 'were in progress the news came that <a href=/people/821 target=_blank>Fulvia</a> was dead. It was said that she was dispirited by <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s reproaches and fell sick; and it was thought that she had become a willing victim of disease on account of the anger of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, who had left her while she was sick and had not visited her even when he was going away. The death of this turbulent woman, who had stirred up so disastrous a war on account of her jealousy of <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, seemed extremely fortunate to both of the parties who were rid of her. Nevertheless, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was much saddened by this event because he considered himself in some sense the cause of it. </p>                        </div>

Cries of alarm and groans of pain were mingled together, and exhortations that fell upon deaf ears. Orders could not be heard. There was no distinction between pilot and common sailor. Knowledge and authority were alike unavailing. The same destruction awaited those in the ships and those who fell overboard, the latter being crushed by wind, waves, and floating timber. The sea was full of sails, spars, and men, living and dead. Those who sought to escape by swimming to land were dashed against the rocks by the surf.

Not only was the sea inexorable to those engulfed in it, as well as to those still in the ships, but the danger from the storm was almost as great on land, lest the surf should dash them against the rocks. So distressed were they by this unexampled tempest that those who were nearest the land feared the land, yet could not get sufficient offing to avoid collision with each other, for the narrowness of the place and its naturally difficult outlet, together with the force of the waves, the rotary motion of the wind, caused by the surrounding mountains, and the whirlpool of the deep, holding everything in its grasp, allowed neither tarrying nor escape. The darkness of a very black night added to their distress. And so they perished, no longer even seeing each other, some uttering confused cries, others yielding in silence, accepting their doom, some even hastening it, believing that they were utterly lost.

Those of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> sought to cut down with their beaks the hostile ships, which were smaller in size, or shatter them, or break through them. When they came to close quarters, being higher, they could hurl missiles down upon the enemy, and more easily throw the corvus and the grappling-irons.

A day was fixed by them, for which 300 ships were put in readiness on either side, provided with missiles of all kinds, with towers and whatever machines they could think of. <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> devised one called the harpago, a piece of wood five cubits long bound with iron and having rings at the extremities.

Others broke the opposing line by sailing through it, at the same time discharging arrows and javelins; and the small boats picked up those who fell overboard. There was a struggle of soldiers while the sailors put forth their strength and the pilots their skill and their lung-power. The generals cheered their men, and all the machines were brought into requisition. The harpago achieved the greatest success. Thrown from a long distance upon the ships, as it could be by reason of its lightness, it clutched them, especially when the ropes pulled on it from behind. On account of the iron bands it could not be easily cut by the men whom it attacked, and those who tried to cut the ropes were prevented from reaching them by its length. As this apparatus had never been known before, the enemy had not provided themselves with scythe-mounted poles. One thing seemed advisable in this unexpected emergency, and that was, to back water and draw the ship away; but as the enemy did the same the force exerted by the men was equal on both sides, and the harpago did its work. </p>                        </div>

Hence arose many and divers frauds and lack of confidence on both sides on the part of those using the same watchword.

As you did not accept the offer at the time when it would have been most advantageous to you, he repeats it now in order that you may not be so often ensnared by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>' words and by the marriage relationship existing between you; for you will remember that, although he is connected by marriage with <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, he declared war against the latter after the treaty had been made, and without excuse. He also deprived <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>, his partner in the government, of his share, and divided no part of it with you. </p>                        </div>

When the latter refused he said that he would surrender to <a href=/people/246 target=_blank>Amyntas</a>. <a href=/people/1111 target=_blank>Furnius</a> said that <a href=/people/246 target=_blank>Amyntas</a> would not receive him, because that would be an insult to the one whom <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> had intrusted with this whole business; and so the interview ended. The opinion prevailed in the camp of <a href=/people/1111 target=_blank>Furnius</a> that, for want of other resources, <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> would deliver himself up to <a href=/people/1275 target=_blank>Titius</a> on the following day. When night came <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> left the customary fires burning, and the trumpets giving the usual signal at intervals through the night, while he quietly withdrew from the camp with a well-prepared band, who had not been previously advised whither they were to go. He intended to go to the sea-shore and burn <a href=/people/1275 target=_blank>Titius</a>' fleet, and perhaps would have done so had not <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> deserted from him and communicated the fact of his departure and the road he had taken, although ignorant of his design. <a href=/people/246 target=_blank>Amyntas</a>, with 1500 <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, pursued <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, who had no cavalry. When <a href=/people/246 target=_blank>Amyntas</a> drew near, <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>' men passed over to him, some privately, others openly. <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, being almost entirely deserted and afraid of his own men, surrendered himself to <a href=/people/246 target=_blank>Amyntas</a> without conditions, although he had scorned to surrender to <a href=/people/1275 target=_blank>Titius</a> with conditions. </p>                        </div>

He was the last remaining son of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> the Great, and had been deprived of his father when very young and of his brother while still a stripling. After their death he concealed himself for a long time and practised robbery secretly in Spain until he had collected a large following, because he made himself known as <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s son. Then he practised more open robbery. After the death of Gaius <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> he carried on war vigorously and collected a large army, together with ships and money, took islands, became master of the western sea, brought famine upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and compelled his enemies to make peace on such terms as he chose. Of most importance was the aid that he rendered to the proscribed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> exposed to utter destruction, rescuing many of the nobility who were, at this later time, safe at home by means of him. But stricken with mental aberration, he never pursued an aggressive policy against his foes, although fortune offered him many opportunities; he only defended himself. After such a career <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> was taken prisoner. </p>                        </div>
