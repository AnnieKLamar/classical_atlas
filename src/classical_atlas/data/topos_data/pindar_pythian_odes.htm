[5] You quench even the warlike thunderbolt of everlasting fire. And the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> sleeps on the scepter of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, relaxing his swift wings on either side, the king of birds; and you pour down a dark mist over his curved head, a sweet seal on his eyelids. Slumbering, he ripples his liquid back, [10] under the spell of your pulsing notes. Even powerful <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>, setting aside the rough spear-point, warms his heart in repose; your shafts charm the minds even of the gods, by virtue of the skill of <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a>'s son and the deep-bosomed <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. But those whom <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> does not love are stunned with terror when they hear the cry of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402225RPie class=person long=22.5 lat=40.2>Pierian</a> <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, on earth or on the irresistible sea; [15] among them is he who lies in dread <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a>, that enemy of the gods, <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a> with his hundred heads. Once the famous <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=demonym long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilician</a> cave nurtured him, but now the sea-girt cliffs above <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=place long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> too, lie heavy on his shaggy chest. And the pillar of the sky holds him down, snow-covered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377150LAit class=place long=15.001 lat=37.748>Aetna</a>, year-round nurse of bitter frost, from whose inmost caves belch forth the purest streams of unapproachable fire. In the daytime her rivers roll out a fiery flood of smoke, while in the darkness of night the crimson flame hurls rocks down to the deep plain of the sea with a crashing roar. </p>                        </div>

Such a creature is bound beneath the dark and leafy heights of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377150LAit class=place long=15.001 lat=37.748>Aetna</a> and beneath the plain, and his bed scratches and goads the whole length of his back stretched out against it.

For seafaring men, the first blessing at the outset of their voyage is a favorable wind; for then it is likely that [35] at the end as well they will win a more prosperous homecoming. And that saying, in these fortunate circumstances, brings the belief that from now on this city will be renowned for garlands and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and its name will be spoken amid harmonious festivities. <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a>, lord of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=person long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a>, you who love the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225WCas class=demonym long=22.505 lat=38.483>Castalian</a> spring of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385226LPar class=place long=22.6219 lat=38.5354>Parnassus</a>, may you willingly put these wishes in your thoughts, and make this a land of fine men. All the resources for the achievements of mortal excellence come from the gods; for being skillful, or having powerful arms, or an eloquent tongue. As for me, in my eagerness to praise that man, I hope that I may not be like one who hurls the bronze-cheeked javelin, which I brandish in my hand, outside the course, [45] but that I may make a long cast, and surpass my rivals. Would that all of time may, in this way, keep his prosperity and the gift of wealth on a straight course, and bring forgetfulness of troubles. Indeed he might remember in what kind of battles of war he stood his ground with an enduring soul, when, by the gods' devising, they found honor such as no other Greek can pluck, </p>                        </div>

If you speak in due proportion, twisting the strands of many themes into a brief compass, less blame follows from men. For wearying satiety blunts the edge of short-lived expectations, and what the citizens hear secretly weighs heavy on their spirits, especially concerning the merits of others. [85] Nevertheless, since envy is better than pity, do not abandon fine deeds! Steer your men with the rudder of justice; forge your tongue on the anvil of truth: if even a small spark flies, it is carried along as a great thing when it comes from you. You are the guardian of an ample store. You have many faithful witnesses of both good and bad. But abide in a blossoming temper, [90] and if you are fond of always hearing sweet things spoken of you, do not be too distressed by expenses, but, like a steersman, let your sail out to the wind. Do not be deceived, my friend, by glib profit-seeking. The loud acclaim of renown that survives a man is all that reveals the way of life of departed men to storytellers and singers alike. The kindly excellence of <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> does not perish, [95] but <a href=/people/654 target=_blank>Phalaris</a>, with his pitiless mind, who burned his victims in a bronze <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>, is surrounded on all sides by a hateful reputation; lyres that resound beneath the roof do not welcome him as a theme in gentle partnership with the voices of boys. The first of prizes is good fortune; the second is to be well spoken of; but a man who encounters and wins both has received the highest garland. </p>                        </div>

For right away he stood the whole band of suitors at the end of a course, [115] and told them to decide with a footrace which of the heroes, who came to be bridegrooms, would take which bride. The Libyan too made such an offer in joining his daughter with a husband. He placed her at the goal, when he had arrayed her as the crowning prize, and in their midst he announced that that man should lead her to his home, whoever was the first to leap forward and touch her robes. There <a href=/people/6193 target=_blank>Alexidamus</a>, when he had sped to the front of the swift race, took the noble girl's hand in his hand and led her through the crowd of Nomad horsemen.
