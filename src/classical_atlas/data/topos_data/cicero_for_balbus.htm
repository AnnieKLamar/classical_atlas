                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi026:1'><b>&sect; 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the authority of those who are advocates in a person's defence be of any weight, the cause of Lucius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> has been defended by the most honourable men; if their experience is to be regarded, it has been defended by the most skillful lawyers; if we look to their ability, by the most eloquent of orators; or if it is their sincerity and zeal that we should regard, it has been upheld by those who are his greatest friends, and who are united to Lucius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> not merely by mutual services, but by the greatest intimacy. What part, then, have I in this defence? That which is given to me by such influence as you have been pleased to allow me; by moderate experience; and by an ability which is by no means equal to my inclination to serve him. For as to the other men by whom he has been defended, I see that to them he is under great obligations; but how much I am under obligations to him I will explain to you at another time. This I assert at the beginning of my speech, — that if I cannot by my exertions properly requite all those men who have been friendly to my safety and to my dignity, I will at all events recompense them as far as in my power by at all times both feeling and declaring my obligations and my gratitude. [2] How great was the energy displayed by Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> in speaking yesterday, O judges, how great his fluency, how great the riches of his eloquence, was shown plainly enough, not only by the secret feelings of your minds, but by your evident and unconcealed admiration. For I never heard anything which appeared to me more acute as regards the state of the law, <br /> ** * I never heard a more copious recollection of precedents; I never heard a more skillful argument concerning treaties, nor any statements of more illustrious authority concerning our wars, or of more weight and dignity with reference to the general interests of the republic; I never heard any one speak more modestly concerning himself, or more eloquently concerning the cause and the charge. [3] So that that saying appeared to me to be a true one, which though some men devoted to literature and to learned studies were said to have given utterance to it, appeared nevertheless to be something incredible; namely, that the man whose soul contained every virtue, could with the most perfect ease do everything which he might wish to do. For how could there have been a greater fertility and variety and richness of eloquence in Lucius <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>, a man born to a most singular gift of oratory if even he had pleaded this cause than was displayed by that man who was able to devote just so much time to this study as he spared from the uninterrupted succession of wars and victories in which his life has been passed from childhood up to this time? <br /> [4] And all this makes my task of summing up the more difficult. For, in truth, I am coming after an oration which has not just passed by your ears, but has sunk deep into the minds of all of you, so that you may very probably derive more pleasure from the recollection of that speech, than you can from the hearing not only of mine, but of any one else's speech whatever. </p>                        </div>

For there is nothing more true than that which he himself said yesterday, that Lucius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> had now all his fortunes at stake, without being accused of any single crime of any description. For he is not said to have stolen the rights of a citizen, nor to have given any false account of his family, nor to have proceeded in an underhand manner by any shameless falsehood, nor to have crept fraudulently into the register. One thing alone is imputed to him, that he was born at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gades</a>; a fact which no one denies. All the rest the prosecutor admits. He admits that he served in Spain, in a most severe war, with Quintus <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, with Caius <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>; that he served both in the fleet and in the army; and, when <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> came into Spain and began to have <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a> for his quaestor, that he never left <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>; that he went to take possession of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>; that he was present at those two hardly contested and most important battles of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392-03USuc class=place long=-0.3868 lat=39.1994>Sucro</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411-86WDur class=place long=-8.5775 lat=41.1415>Durius</a>; that he remained with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> to the end of the war. [6] These are the battles of <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a>. Such were his exertions; such was his industry; such were his dangers encountered on behalf of our republic; such was his valour, worthy of a general; while his hopes were hopes of a reward in proportion to his dangers. The rewards themselves are not the actions of him who obtained them, but of him who conferred them. </p>                        </div>

That the prosecutor does not deny; but he finds fault with it, in such a manner that, as far as <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> himself is concerned, his cause is approved of even at the moment that it is sought to punish him; in the case of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, his conduct is disapproved of, but no punishment is designed for him. And this is the way in which they wish to condemn the fame and fortune of a most innocent man and the conduct of a most admirable commander. Therefore it is the status of <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> as a citizen, and the action of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> that are now on their trial before this court. For you admit that this man was born of a most honourable rank in that state to which he belongs, and that from his earliest manhood disregarding all his private affairs, he has passed his whole time in our wars in the company of our own generals, and that he has been absent from no labour, from no siege, and from no battle. All these things are full of glory, and are the peculiar glory of <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a>; nor is there any crime in any part of such conduct. <br /> [7] Where then is his crime? Is it because <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> presented him with the freedom of the city? Is that a crime of <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>'s? By no means, unless honour is to be accounted ignominy. Whose crime is it then? In reality nobody's at all; but if we look at the pleading of the prosecutor, it is clearly the crime of that man alone who gave him the freedom of the city. But if he had been influenced by interest, he would probably have selected some less worthy man for that reward. Even had he selected a good man, he would not have chosen one who had deserved as well of the state as <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>; even if his action had been one of which it could not have been said that it was contrary to what was lawful, it would have been said that it was contrary to what was becoming. But all such vituperation would have deserved to be rejected by you, O judges. [8] But at present what is it that is said? What does the prosecutor say? That <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> did what it was not lawful for him to do; which is a more serious charge than if he were to say that that had been done by him which was not expedient. For there are things which are not expedient even if they are lawful. But whatever is not lawful is most certainly not expedient. </p>                        </div>

[9] For what qualification is wanting in this man, that, if he had it, we should consider that this liberty might lawfully be given and allowed to him? Is it experience in affairs? a man who during even the latter days of his childhood was beginning his course of the most important wars and commands? most of whose equals in age have seen a camp less frequently than he has celebrated a triumph? who has celebrated as many triumphs as there are countries and parts of the world? who has won as many victories in war as there are kinds of war in the nature of things? Is it ability? when even the very results and terminations of transactions have been, not the guides, but the companions of his counsels? a man in whom the most extraordinary good fortune has so kept pace with extraordinary valour, that, in the opinion of all men, more credit was due to the man than to the goddess; Have modesty, or integrity, or religion, or diligence ever been wanting in that man? a man than whom our provinces, and all free nations, and all kings, and the very most distant people of the earth have not only never seen one more chaste, more moderate, and more religious, but have never in their hopes or wishes even imagined one. [10] Why need I speak of his authority, which is as great as it ought to be, springing from such great virtue and glory? <br />Is it not then, O judges, a shameful thing for the Roman people, that after the senate and people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> have conferred on that man the rewards of the most honourable dignity; when he not only did not ask for commands, but when he even refused them, an inquiry into his conduct should be now taking place, in such terms that there should be a discussion as to whether it was lawful for him to do what he has done; or whether, I will not say, it was lawful, but whether it was impious for him to do so? (for he is said to have done it in contravention of a treaty, — that is to say, in contradiction to the religion and good faith of the Roman people.)

When Quintus <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, the son of Lucius, was prosecuted for extortion and peculation, he, that man to whom the safety of his country was dearer than the sight of it, who had rather abandon his city than his opinion; when he, I say, was before the court, and when his account-books were being carried round to the judges that they might see the entry of one item, I have heard that there was not one judge among them Roman knights, most excellent men as they were, who did not avert his eyes, and turn himself altogether away, lest any one of them should appear for a moment to have doubted whether what such a man had entered in his public accounts was true or false. And shall we open the question of the legality of a decree of Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, pronounced in accordance with the vote of the senate? Shall we compare it with the words of the laws? with the treaties? Shall we scrutinise everything with the most unfriendly minuteness?

When Greeks were unwilling to appear to imagine that the good faith of a well-proved man felt itself more bound by the formality of an oath than by the simple obligation of truth, shall we have a doubt as to what sort of man Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> has been in respect of his regard for the religious observance of laws and treaties? [13] For do you mean that he acted in violation of the treaties ignorantly, or knowingly? If you say that he did so knowingly, O, for the name of our empire! O, for the preeminent dignity of the Roman people! O, for the glory of Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, so widely and universally diffused, in such a manner that the home of his renown has but the same boundaries and limits as our common empire! O you nations and cities; and peoples, and kings, and tetrarchs, and tyrants, you witnesses not only of the valour of Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> in war, but also of his conscientiousness in peace! You too I implore, you, O voiceless lands, and you, O soil of the most remote districts; you, O seas, O harbours, O islands, O shores! For what land is there what place of habitation what spot in which there are not the deeply imprinted traces of this man's courage, and humanity, and spirit and wisdom? Will any one venture to say that this man endued with such incredible and unheard of dignity and wisdom and virtue and consistency, has knowingly neglected and violated and broken treaties! </p>                        </div>

He intimates that Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> acted ignorantly. As if it were a lighter charge, when one has been occupied in affairs of state in so important a republic, and been presiding over the most serious transactions, to do anything which you know not to be legal, or to be utterly ignorant what is legal. Do you really mean that he did not know, he who had waged a most formidable and important war in Spain, what were the rights of the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gades</a>? or that he did not catch the correct interpretation of a treaty made with the people, as not understanding their language? Will any one then dare to say that Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> is ignorant of that which the most ordinary men, men of no knowledge of the world, of no military experience, which every common amanuensis professes to be acquainted with? [15] I, indeed, think on the contrary, O judges, that while Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> excels in every kind and variety of accomplishment, even of those which are not easily learnt without the most perfect leisure for their study, his most extraordinary credit and his most admirable knowledge consists in his thorough acquaintance with the treaties, and agreements, and conditions of other peoples, kings, and foreign nations, in short, with the entire laws of war and peace; unless, indeed, you mean to make out that the things which our books teach us while in the shade and at our leisure, Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> was incapable of learning, either from books, when he was in the enjoyment of peace, or from the actual transactions, when he was engaged in the business of the state. <br />It is my opinion, O judges, this action is more to be attributed to the fault of the times than of the individual. Nor will I say any more about a trial of so scandalous a description. For it is the stain and disgrace of this age to envy virtue, and to seek to crush the budding flower of worth and dignity. In truth, if Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> had lived five hundred years ago, [16] that man from whom, while a young man and a Roman knight, the senate had often sought aid for the general safety; whose exploits had had all nations for their stage, being crowned everywhere by the most illustrious victories, both by land and sea; of which three triumphs had been the witnesses, proving that the whole world was made subject to our empire; whom the Roman people had distinguished with unexampled honours, in that case if it were now said among you that anything that he had done had been done in contravention of a treaty, who would listen to such a statement? No one. For his death would have put an end to the envy of him, his achievements would rest in the glory of his undying name. As then his virtue, if it were only heard of by us, would leave no room for doubt or question, shall it when present among us, when it has been experienced and beheld by ourselves, be injured by the voice of detractors? </p>                        </div>

On the subject of the law, of the treaty, of precedents and of the uninterrupted usage of our state, I shall repeat those things which have been said already. For neither has Marcus <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> who, as was natural to expect from his eloquence and from his honesty, has in the most careful manner explained the whole bearings of the case to you nor has Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> whose speech abounded in every possible ornament of oratory, left me anything new, anything untouched by them to dilate upon: but since, though I drew back, they both wished that this last labour of putting, as it were, a finishing stroke to their work, should be undertaken by me, I beg of you that you will consider that I have undertaken this office and employment more out of regard for what I thought my duty, than from any desire of making a display as an orator. <br /> [18] And, before I approach the law of the case and the cause of <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a>, it seems to me desirable to say a little about the common condition of all of us, for the sake of deprecating the malevolence of any one. If, O judges, whatever may be the rank in which any one is born or whatever the station in which he is placed by birth in respect of fortune that same station he ought to maintain to his old age, and if all men whom either fortune has raised or whom their own labour or industry has ennobled, are to be visited with punishment, then there does not appear to have been a more severe law or condition of life imposed on Lucius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> than on many other virtuous and gallant men. But if the virtue and genius and humanity of many men, though born in the meanest class of life, and in the lowest degree of fortune, has not only obtained them friendship and a plentiful estate, but has gained them also the greatest praise and honour and glory and dignity, then I cannot understand why envy should be more prompt to attack Lucius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a>, than your justice should to come to the assistance of his modesty. [19] And therefore I do not ask of you what it is very important to ask, in order that I may not seem to throw any doubts on your wisdom or your humanity; but I must beg of you not to feel any hatred towards genius, not to be enemies of industry, not to think that humanity deserves to be oppressed, or virtue to be punished. This I beg also; that if you see that my client's cause is of itself a sound and just one, you will allow his personal good qualities and accomplishments to be an assistance to him now that he is on his trial, rather than a hindrance. </p>                        </div>

By that law we see that it is provided that those men shall be Roman citizens whom Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> shall separately present with the freedom of the city in accordance with the opinion of his council. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> here in court asserts that Lucius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> was so presented with it. The public records prove this to be the fact: the prosecutor admits it. But he says that no man of a people joined to us by treaty was capable by law of becoming one of our citizens, unless his own people ratified the measure. [20] Oh what a splendid interpreter of the law! what a fine authority on points of antiquity! what an admirable corrector and reformer of our state, to imagine that treaties impose such a penalty on those who are bound by them, as to make them all incapable of receiving our rewards and kindnesses! For what can possibly be said more ignorant than that it is requisite for the federate cities to ratify such a transaction? For that is not a right peculiar to federate cities, but to all free nations. But the whole of this, O judges, has at all times depended on this consideration, and on this intention, — that when the Roman people had ordered anything, if the allied peoples and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> had adopted and ratified it, and if the law which we had among ourselves was in this manner established among some people on a firm footing, then that people should be bound by the obligations of that law; not in such a manner as to detract in the least from our privileges, but that those nations might enjoy either that law which was established among us, or some other advantage and benefit. <br /> [21] Caius <a href=/people/463 target=_blank>Furius</a>, in the time of our ancestors, passed a law concerning wills Quintus <a href=/people/3486 target=_blank>Voconius</a> passed another concerning the inheritances of women; innumerable other laws have been passed about civil law; the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> have adopted whatever of them they have chosen; even by the <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a> law itself, by which the rights of citizenship were given to the allies and to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a>, it was decreed that those people who did not ratify the law should not have the freedom of the city, which circumstance gave rise to a great contention among the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402167UHer class=place long=16.6692 lat=40.2201>Heraclea</a>, and among the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Neapolis</a>, as a great part of the population in those states preferred the liberty which they enjoyed by virtue of their treaty with us to the rights of citizenship. <br />Lastly, this is the meaning both of that law and of that expression, that the peoples who do ratify it enjoy its advantages owing to our kindness, and not owing to any right of their own. <br /> [22] When the Roman people has enacted anything, if it be a matter of that sort, that it appears it may be granted also to some other nations, whether joined to us by a treaty, or free to decide themselves which law they prefer using, not about our affairs, but about their own; then it seems necessary to inquire whether they have adopted and ratified our law, or not; but the senate never intended that those peoples should have the power of ratifying or declining to ratify measures which concern our republic, our empire our wars, our victory, and our safety. </p>                        </div>

For, according to our law, no one can change his city against his will, nor can he be prevented from changing it, if he pleases, provided only that he be adopted by that state of which he wishes to become a citizen.

(They could not lose their rights of citizenship here, before they had as it were changed their country by their change of citizenship.) <br />But a change of citizenship can also take place by a man's returning to his original city.

[30] Therefore in the Greek cities we see that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=ethnic long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> and men from all quarters are enrolled among the citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, and that the same individuals are citizens of many cities at the same time.

But no one who had any acquaintance with our laws or our customs, who wished to retain his rights as a citizen of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, ever dedicated himself to another city. </p>                        </div>

For I am defending the universal principle, that there is no nation on the whole face of the earth, — whether at variance with the Roman people through some quarrel and hatred, or, on the other hand, united with us by the closest loyalty and mutual good-will, — as to which we are forbidden to adopt any one of its citizens as our own, or to present any one of them with the freedom of our city. [31] Oh how admirable are our laws, and with what god-like wisdom were they established by our ancestors from the very first beginning of the Roman name, especially the law that no one of our people can be a citizen of more than one city, (for it is inevitable that dissimilar states must have a great variety in their laws,) and that no one can be compelled against his will to change his city, nor against his will to remain a citizen of any city. For these are the firmest foundations of our liberty, that every individual should have it in his own power to retain or abandon his privileges. <br />And without any dispute, that has been the most solid foundation of our empire, and the thing which has above all others increased the renown of the Roman name, that that first man, the creator of this city, <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, taught by the treaty which he made with the <a href=/people/11083 target=_blank>Sabines</a>, that it was expedient to increase the population of this city by the adoption of even enemies as citizens. And in compliance with his authority and with the precedent which he established, the presentation of the freedom of our city to others has never been interrupted by our ancestors. Therefore, many tribes from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=place long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latium</a>, the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>, the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127ULan class=place long=12.6989 lat=41.6777>Lanuvium</a>, and all other peoples of all other races, have been received into the privileges of our city; — as, for instance, the <a href=/people/11083 target=_blank>Sabines</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418132RHer class=ethnic long=13.15 lat=41.8>Hernici</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416133RVol class=ethnic long=13.3 lat=41.6>Volsci</a>; the citizens of which cities were not compelled to change the city to which they belonged, if they were unwilling to do so; nor if any of them had acquired the privileges of our citizens by the kindness of the Roman people, would the treaty made with them appear to have been violated. </p>                        </div>

And if the exception prevents such a step from being lawful, it is quite evident that it is lawful where there is no such exception made. Where, then, is the exception made in the treaty between us and the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gades</a>, that the Roman people is not to receive any one of the citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gades</a> into their citizenship? Nowhere. And if there were any such clause, the Gellian and Cornelian law would have annulled it which expressly gave to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> a power of giving the freedom of the city to anybody whatever. “The whole treaty,” says the prosecutor, “is such an exception, because it was ratified with solemn oaths.” I can excuse you if you do not know much about the laws of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>, for you had left your own city; and you were not able to examine our laws very strictly; for they prevented your having any opportunity of instituting such an examination by a public sentence. <br /> [33] What was there in that enactment which was passed concerning <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> by <a href=/people/1509 target=_blank>Gellius</a> and <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> in their consulship in which any exception appears to have been made of treaties which had been ratified by an oath? For first of all, nothing can be ratified in such a manner except what the burgesses or the common people have so ratified. In the second place, such ratifications are to be accounted sacred, either because of the form of ratification itself, or because the invocation of the gods and dedication of the law, <br /> ** * or else, because of some punishment to which the life of that man is devoted who acts in contravention of it. What argument, then, of this sort can you allege with respect to our treaty with the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gades</a>?5 Do you assert that that treaty was solemnly ratified by the devotion of the life of any offender against it, or by any invocation of the gods to uphold the law? I assert that nothing was ever submitted to the burgesses or to the common people with respect to that treaty [I assert that no law was enacted, and no punishment appointed.] <br />When, therefore even if it had been enacted that we were not to receive any man as a citizen, still that would have been ratified which the people enacted subsequently, nor would any exception have appeared to have been made by that expression, “If anything had been formally ratified by an oath,” do you venture to say that anything is formally ratified in this way, with respect to which the Roman people has never come to any decision at all? </p>                        </div>

For it would not become me to say anything against the rights of a city which has deserved very well at our hands, against the invariable opinion of antiquity, and against the authority of the senate. For once, at a very critical period of this republic, when <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, being exceedingly powerful by sea and land, relying on the two Spains, was threatening this empire, and when those two thunderbolts of our empire, Cnaeus and Publius <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, had suddenly perished in Spain, Lucius <a href=/people/10971 target=_blank>Marcius</a>, a centurion of the first division, is said to have made a treaty with the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gades</a>. And as this treaty was maintained more in consequence of the loyalty of that people, of our justice, and, indeed, of its own antiquity, than because it was ratified by any public bond of religion, the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gades</a>, being wise men and well instructed in public law, when Marcus <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> and Quintus <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a> were consuls, made a request to the senate for a more regular treaty; and then the treaty was renewed or made (whichever you please to call it) with the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gades</a>. And concerning that treaty the Roman people never recorded any vote; and they cannot possibly be bound by any religious obligation which has been contracted without their orders. <br /> [35] And so the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gades</a> obtained what it was well entitled to obtain by its services done to our republic, by the testimony borne in its favour by our commanders by the antiquity of its alliance with us, by the authority of Quintus <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>, a most illustrious man by the formal decision of the senate, and by a regular treaty; but it has not received any additional sanction from any public religious ceremonies of ratification. For the people has in no respect whatever bound itself, nor is the cause of the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gades</a> any the worse for that; for it is upheld by many and those the very wealthiest of circumstances. But however there is at present no room for that discussion; for nothing can be so ratified as to be sacred unless it be something that has been adopted by the burgesses or by the common people. </p>                        </div>

For there is nothing else provided for in the treaty except that there be a pious and everlasting peace. What has that to do with the rights of citizenship? That also is added which does not occur in every treaty: “Preserve, with all courtesy and respect, the majesty of the Roman people.” And that expression carries this force with it, that it shows that the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gades</a> is the inferior party in the treaty. [36] First of all, the very description of word used “Preserve” which is a form that we are more accustomed to use in laws than in treaties is an expression of one giving a command, not of one addressing an entreaty. In the next place, as the majesty of the one people is ordered to be preserved and no mention is made of the other, most certainly that people is placed on the higher footing and in the superior condition whose majesty is defended by the sanction of the treaty. And in respect of this the interpretation of the prosecutor is quite undeserving of any reply, who said that the expression “with courtesy and respect,” meant the same as “respectively” just as if he were explaining some ancient and nearly obsolete word. Men are called courteous, kind, affable, pleasant. “ A man who courteously points out the way to a wanderer:” — good-naturedly, not sulkily; — “respectively” has surely no connection with the rest of the sentence, or with the subject. <br /> [37] And, at the same time, it is a perfect absurdity for a provision to be made in the treaty that they should “respectively” preserve the majesty of the Roman people; that is to say, that the Roman people is to wish its own majesty to be uninjured. And if it were so now, as it cannot be, still the fact would remain, that provision had been made for our majesty, but none at all for theirs. Can our majesty then be preserved with good feeling by the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gades</a>, if we are not able to tempt the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gades</a> by rewards to be anxious for its preservation? Can there, in fact be any majesty at all, if we are prevented from availing ourselves of the consent of the Roman people to confer on our commander-in-chief the power of distributing honours and kindnesses as a reward of virtue? </p>                        </div>

Their ambition, and our ancestors' wish, has been, that their walls, their temples, their lands, should be the boundaries of the Roman name and Roman empire, as <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> wished them to be of his journeys and of his labours. <br /> [40] They invoke as witnesses our deceased generals, whose memory and glory survive for everlasting, — the <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipios</a>, the <a href=/people/4100 target=_blank>Bruti</a>, the <a href=/people/5703 target=_blank>Horatii</a>, the <a href=/people/7445 target=_blank>Cassii</a>, the <a href=/people/9802 target=_blank>Metelli</a>, and this man also, Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> whom you see before you; whom when he was carrying on a great and formidable war far from their walls, they assisted with supplies and money and at this very time they invoke as witnesses the Roman people whom now, at a time of great dearness of provisions they have relieved with a large supply of corn as they had often done before. They call them, I say, to witness that they wish this to be their privilege, — to have a place permitted to them and to their children, whenever there are any of distinguished virtue in our camps and in the tent of the general and among our standards; and in our line of battle; and that by these steps they should have a power of rising up to the freedom of the city. </p>                        </div>

For Titus <a href=/people/4601 target=_blank>Matrinius</a>, of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spoletum</a>, one of those men whom Caius <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> had presented with the freedom of the city, was indeed prosecuted, being a man of a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> colony, which was among the first for vigour and high character.

But still so great was the authority of Caius <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, that he did not employ true oratory of Lucius <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> his own relation, a man of extraordinary eloquence, but himself in a few words defended his conduct with the weight and wisdom which belonged to him, and proved his case to everybody's satisfaction.

But if the countenance of Caius <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, and his voice, — if that quickness of eye so advantageous to a general, — if his recent triumphs, and the authority of his presence, had such influence, then let his authority, and his exploits, and his memory, and the undying name of that most illustrious man, prevail still. Let there be this difference between agreeable citizens and brave ones, — that the former, while living, may have all the enjoyment of their influence, but that the authority of the latter may flourish without decay even after they are dead themselves, (if indeed any defender of this empire can be properly said to die at all.) </p>                        </div>

And I wish that those men in all quarters of the world who are the defenders of this empire, could all enter this city as citizens, and, on the other hand, that all the enemies of the republic could be got rid or out of it. Nor, indeed did that great poet of our country intend that exhortation which he put into the mouth of <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> to be peculiarly his language, but rather the common address of all generals “ The man who slays a foe, whate'er his race, <br />Come whence he will, I call my countryman.” And from what country an ally comes, all men consider and always have considered unimportant. Therefore, they have at all times adopted brave men as citizens from all quarters, and have often preferred the valour of men who may have been meanly born to the inactivity of the nobility. </p>                        </div>

But that has been done, not in order by our speaking to prove to you a matter which required proof so little, but in order to check the hostile disposition of all spiteful, and wicked, and envious men, whom the prosecutor has sought to inflame, hoping that some of the reports current among men who grieve over the prosperity of another might reach your ears, and have their effect on the result of this trial; and on that account you saw aspersions scattered about with great art in every part of his speech; especially with respect to the riches of Lucius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a>, which do not deserve to be brought into odium, and which, whatever their amount may be, are such as to seem to have been rather acquired by care than by any illicit or unfair means; and with respect to his luxury, which he attacked, not by bringing any definite charge of licentiousness against him, but by mere general abuse. Then, too, he attacked him about his farm at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>, which he recollected had belonged to Quintus <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, and to Lucius <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>; but he was not aware that <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> had bought it of a man who was a freedman, <a href=/people/8327 target=_blank>Sotericus</a> <a href=/people/10971 target=_blank>Marcius</a> by name; that it had come to <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> as part of the property of Venonius Vindicius; and also, he did not know that lands do not belong to any particular family, that they are accustomed to pass by sale to strangers, often even to the very lowest people, not being protected by the laws like guardianships. [57] It has been imputed to him also that he has become one of the tribe Crustumina, a privilege which he obtained by means of the law concerning bribery, and which is less invidious than the advantages acquired by those men who, by the assistance of the laws, obtain the power of delivering their opinion as praetor, and of wearing the praetexta. And then, too, the adoption of Theophanus was discussed; by means of which <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> gained nothing beyond being confirmed in his possession of the inheritances of his own relations. </p>                        </div>

They show their envy in the ordinary way; they attack him at their feasts; they abuse him at their conversations; they carp at him, not in a downright hostile spirit, but in a disparaging manner. [58] They who are enemies to the friends of Lucius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a>, or who envy them, are much more greatly to be feared by him. For who has ever been found who would confess himself an enemy to the man himself? Or who could be so with any reason? What good man has he not cultivated the friendship of? Who is there whose fortune and dignity he has not promoted? Living in the closest intimacy with the most influential man in the state, at a time of our greatest misfortunes and most bitter dissensions, he has never offended any one of either party, either by act or word, or even by a look. It was my fate, or the fate of the republic, that the whole weight of distress and ill-will at that time should fall upon me alone. <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> was so far from exulting in my disasters or in your dissensions, that while I was absent, he aided all my friends with his kind assistance, with his tears, with his exertions, and with consolation. [59] And I have been induced by their testimony in his behalf, and by their entreaties, to offer him my service now, which he has so well deserved, and which on my part is only a repayment of just and reasonable gratitude. And I hope, O judges, as you love and consider dear to you those men who were the chief agents in my preservation and safety, and in the restoration of my dignity, that so also the things which were done by this man to the extent of his power and of the opportunities which were afforded him, will be grateful to and approved of by you. He, then, is not now attacked by his own enemies, for he has none, but by those of his friends; enemies who are both numerous and powerful; men whom yesterday Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, in a very eloquent and dignified oration, desired to come forward and contend with him if they chose, but to abandon the unequal contest and unjust persecution which they were carrying on against this man. </p>                        </div>

And if my authority had in this matter much weight with those men, especially as they see that I am well instructed in such matters both by the variety of circumstances in which I have found myself, and by special experience in cases of this sort, I would exhort them to give up even those greater dissensions. For I have at all times considered it the part both of fearless citizens and of virtuous men to labour in the administration of the affairs of the republic in such a way as to defend whatever one really thinks best; nor have I myself ever failed in this labour or duty or line of exertion. But contention is only wise so long as it either does some good or, if it does not do any good, at all events does no harm to the state. [61] We ourselves have had wishes, we have urged points, we have tried to carry measures, and we have not succeeded. Other men have felt indignation; we have undergone real sorrow and distress. Why should we choose to destroy those things which exist rather than to preserve them if merely because we are not allowed to alter them exactly as we wish? The senate complimented <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caius Caesar</a> with the most honourable distinction of a supplication lasting for a number of days which was quite unprecedented. The senate again, though at a time when the treasury was in great difficulties, gave his victorious army a large sum for pay, appointed ten lieutenants to assist the commander-in-chief at his request, and by the Sempronian law decided not to send any one to supersede him. Of all these resolutions, I was the prime mover and the chief author; nor did I think myself bound to preserve a consistency with the previous differences which I had had with him, rather than to consult what was advantageous with regard to the present necessities of the republic and to unanimity. Other men may perhaps think differently. They are, maybe, firmer in their opinions. I find fault with no one; but I do not agree with all of them. Nor do I think it any proof of inconsistency to regulate one's opinions, as one would do a ship or a ship's course on a voyage, according to the weather which might be prevailing in the republic. <br /> [62] But if there be any people who never abandon any dislike which they have ever conceived against anybody, — (and I see that there are some such people,) — then let them fight with the leaders themselves, not with their train and followers. Some of them, perhaps, will consider that conduct obstinacy, and some will think it courage; but this attacking of the subordinate parties all will look upon as injustice, mixed with some little cruelty. But if there be some men, O judges, whose minds we cannot propitiate by any means whatever, at all events we feel sure that your inclinations are favourable to us, not because of our speeches, but because of your own natural humanity. </p>                        </div>

In his praetorship and in his consulship he appointed him prefect of the engineers; he thought highly of his prudence, he loved him for his integrity, he was grateful to him for his constant assistance and attention. He was at different times the partner of very many of his labours; he is perhaps even now the partaker of some of his benefits. And if they are to be an injury to my client in your judgment, I do not see what is ever to be an advantage to any one before such judges. <br /> [64] But since <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caius Caesar</a> is a great distance off, and is now in those places which, if we regard their situation, are the boundaries of the world, or, if we regard his exploits, of the Roman empire, do not, I entreat you, in the name of the immortal gods, O judges, do not allow such bitter news to be taken to him, as that his own prefect of engineers, the man of all others most dear to and most intimate with him, is crushed by your decision, not on account of any offence of his own, but because of his intimacy with him. Pity the man who is now before the court at his own peril, not on account of any offence of his own, but because of the action of this great and most illustrious man, — who is contesting not any charge which is brought against him, but a point of public law and of general interest. And if Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, and Publius <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>, and Quintus <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, and Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> the father of this man, and Lucius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, and Marcus <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>, and Caius <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, and the senate and people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and all those who have ever given a decision under similar circumstances and the federate states, and the allies and those ancient men of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> tribes whom I have mentioned are all ignorant of this law, consider whether it may not be more advantageous and honourable for you to err with those men for your guides than to be rightly instructed with this man for your teacher. <br />But if you see that you are now come to a decision about a law which is certain and clear and advantageous and well established and determined, then beware of establishing any new principle in a case which has been so loud and so repeatedly decided on. [65] And at the same time, O judges, place all these considerations before you: — first of all, that all those most illustrious men who have ever given any man of a federate city the freedom of this city are now on their trial after death; secondly, that the senate is so too, which has repeatedly decided in favour of such an act and the people which has voted it and the judges who have approved of it. Then consider this also that <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> does live and always has lived in such a manner that though investigations are appointed for every imaginable offence, still he is now brought before the court, not for the sake of any punishment which is sought to be inflicted on his vices, but for that at the rewards which have been conferred on his virtue. Add this consideration also; that you by your decision are about to determine whether you choose that for the future the friendship of illustrious men should be a calamity to men, or an ornament. Lastly of all, O judges, keep this fixed in your minds, that in this action you are about to decide, not on any crime imputed to Lucius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a>, but on a kindness shown by Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. </p>                        </div>
