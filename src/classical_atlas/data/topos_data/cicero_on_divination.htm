A really splendid and helpful thing it is — if only such a faculty exists — since by its means men may approach very near to the power of gods. And, just as we <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> have done many other things better than the Greeks, so have we excelled them in giving to this most extraordinary gift a name, which we have derived from divi, a word meaning gods, whereas, according to <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s interpretation, they have derived it from furor, a word meaning frenzy. </p>                        </div>

First of all — to seek authority from the most distant sources — the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>, on account of the vast plains inhabited by them, and because of the open and unobstructed view of the heavens presented to them on every side, took observations of the paths and movements of the stars, and, having made note of them, transmitted to posterity what significance they had for each person. And in that same nation the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a> — a name which they derived not from their art but their race — have, it is thought, by means of long-continued observation of the constellations, perfected a science which enables them to foretell what any man's lot will be and for what fate he was born. <br />The same art is believed to have been acquired also by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> through a remote past extending over almost countless ages. Moreover, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=ethnic long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=ethnic long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidians</a>, and their neighbours, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=ethnic long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylians</a> — nations which I once governed — think that the future is declared by the songs and flights of birds, which they regard as most infallible signs. </p>                        </div>

Or what war did she ever undertake without first seeking the counsel of the gods? [2] Nor is it only one single mode of divination that has been employed in public and in private. For, to say nothing of other nations, how many our own people have embraced! In the first place, according to tradition, <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, the father of this City, not only founded it in obedience to the auspices, but was himself a most skilful augur. Next, the other Roman kings employed augurs; and, again, after the expulsion of the kings, no public business was ever transacted at home or abroad without first taking the auspices. Furthermore, since our forefathers believed that the soothsayers' art had great efficacy in seeking for omens and advice, as well as in cases where prodigies were to be interpreted and their effects averted, they gradually introduced that art in its entirety from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Etruria</a>, lest it should appear that any kind of divination had been disregarded by them. </p>                        </div>

In this same category also were the frenzied prophecies of soothsayers and seers, which our ancestors frequently thought worthy of belief — like the prophecies of <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> Culleolus, during the Octavian War. Nor, indeed, were the more significant dreams, if they seemed to concern the administration of public affairs, disregarded by our Supreme Council. Why, even within my own memory, Lucius <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a>, who was consul with Publius <a href=/people/1250 target=_blank>Rutilius</a>, by a vote of the Senate rebuilt the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SJuS class=place long=12.4802 lat=41.891>temple</a> of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>, the <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a>, in accordance with a dream of <a href=/people/4906 target=_blank>Caecilia</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/7357 target=_blank>Balearicus</a>.

However certain very subtle arguments to prove the trustworthiness of divination have been gathered by philosophers. Of these — to mention the most ancient — <a href=/people/671 target=_blank>Xenophanes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=person long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophon</a>, while asserting the existence of gods, was the only one who repudiated divination in its entirety; but all the others, with the exception of <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, who babbled about the nature of the gods, approved of divination, though not in the same degree. For example, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> and all of the <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socratic</a> School, and <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> and his followers, continued in the faith of the ancient philosophers and in agreement with the Old <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAca class=place long=23.707 lat=37.992>Academy</a> and with the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetics</a>. Their predecessor, <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, who even wished to be considered an augur himself, gave the weight of his great name to the same practice; and that eminent author, <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a>, in many passages, strongly affirmed his belief in a presentiment of things to come. Moreover, <a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a>, the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a>, though he accepted divination by dreams and frenzy, cast away all other kinds; and my intimate friend, <a href=/people/2611 target=_blank>Cratippus</a>, whom I consider the peer of the greatest of the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetics</a>, also gave credence to the same kinds of divination but rejected the rest. </p>                        </div>

Then came <a href=/people/699 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a>, a man of the keenest intellect, who exhaustively discussed the whole theory of divination in two books, and, besides, wrote one book on oracles and another on dreams. And following him, his pupil, <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=person long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, published one book, <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> two, and my friend, <a href=/people/457 target=_blank>Posidonius</a>, five.

For a hasty acceptance of an erroneous opinion is discreditable in any case, and especially so in an inquiry as to how much weight should be given to auspices, to sacred rites, and to religious observances; for we run the risk of committing a crime against the gods if we disregard them, or of becoming involved in old women's superstition if we approve them.

But there is a question which you passed over in those books because, no doubt, you thought it more expedient to inquire into it in a separate discussion: I refer to divination, which is the foreseeing and foretelling of events considered as happening by chance. Now let us see, if you will, what efficacy it has and what its nature is. My own opinion is that, if the kinds of divination which we have inherited from our forefathers and now practise are trustworthy, then there are gods and, conversely, if there are gods then there are men who have the power of divination.

But neither is granted as readily as you think.

Of these methods of divining it behoves us, I think, to examine the results rather than the causes.

The same fate befell <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>; for, after the Greeks had begun to <br />Raise aloft their frequent clamours, showing scorn of augur's art, <br />Noise prevailed and not the omen: he then bade the ships depart. <br />But why cite such ancient instances? We see what happened to Marcus <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> when he ignored the announcement of unfavourable omens. It was on the charge of having on this occasion falsified the auspices that Gaius <a href=/people/1740 target=_blank>Ateius</a>, an honourable man and a distinguished citizen, was, on insufficient evidence, stigmatized by the then censor <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, who was your associate in the augural college, and an able one too, as I have often heard you say.

But even if the augury had been false it could not have been the cause of the disaster; for unfavourable auguries — and the same may be said of auspices, omens, and all other signs — are not the causes of what follows: they merely foretell what will occur unless precautions are taken. </p>                        </div>

Those diviners employ art, who, having learned the known by observation, seek the unknown by deduction. On the other hand those do without art who, unaided by reason or deduction or by signs which have been observed and recorded, forecast the future while under the influence of mental excitement, or of some free and unrestrained emotion. This condition often occurs to men while dreaming and sometimes to persons who prophesy while in a frenzy — like <a href=/people/3544 target=_blank>Bacis</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=person long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a>, <a href=/people/969 target=_blank>Epimenides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=person long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> and the <a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibyl</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384265PEry class=person long=26.4808 lat=38.3828>Erythraea</a>. In this latter class must be placed oracles — not oracles given by means of 'equalized lots' — but those uttered under the impulse of divine inspiration; although divination by lot is not in itself to be despised, if it has the sanction of antiquity, as in the case of those lots which, according to tradition, sprang out of the earth; for in spite of everything, I am inclined to think that they may, under the power of God, be so drawn as to give an appropriate response. Men capable of correctly interpreting all these signs of the future seem to approach very near to the divine spirit of the gods whose wills they interpret, just as scholars do when they interpret the poets. </p>                        </div>

But the rustic dared not do as he was bid. The order was repeated by the spectre with a warning not to put his power to the test. Not even then did the rustic dare obey. After that his son died and the same vision was repeated the third time. Thereupon he became ill and told his friends of his dream.

Greatly frightened at first by the dream he arose, and later, regaining his composure, decided that there was nothing to worry about and went back to bed. When he had gone to sleep the same person appeared to him and said: 'Since you would not help me when I was alive, I beg that you will not allow my dead body to remain unburied. I have been killed by the innkeeper, who has thrown my body into a cart and covered it with dung. I pray you to be at the city gate in the morning before the cart leaves the town,' Thoroughly convinced by the second dream he met the cart-driver at the gate in the morning, and, when he asked what he had in the cart, the driver fled in terror.

In it you seemed to be wandering sadly about in solitary places when Gaius <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, with his fasces wreathed in laurel, asked you why you were sad, and you replied that you had been driven from your country by violence. He then bade you be of good cheer, took you by the right hand, and delivered you to the nearest lictor to be conducted to his memorial temple, saying that there you should find safety. <a href=/people/248 target=_blank>Sallustius</a> thereupon, as he relates, cried out, 'a speedy and a glorious return awaits you.' He further states that you too seemed delighted at the dream. Immediately thereafter it was reported to me that as soon as you heard that it was in <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>' temple that the glorious decree of the Senate for your recall had been enacted on motion of the consul, a most worthy and most eminent man, and that the decree had been greeted by unprecedented shouts of approval in a densely crowded theatre, you said that no stronger proof could be given of a divinely inspired dream than this.

In such a case every vision presented to the mind is so devoid of thought and reason that the sleeper dreams that he is committing incest with his mother, or that he is having unlawful commerce indiscriminately with gods and men, and frequently too, with beasts; or even that he is killing someone and staining his hands with impious bloodshed; and that he is doing many vile and hideous things recklessly and without shame. </p>                        </div>

Hence its power to divine is much enhanced by the approach of death. For example, those in the grasp of a serious and fatal sickness realize the fact that death impends; and so, visions of dead men generally appear to them and then their desire for fame is strongest; while those who have lived otherwise than as they should, feel, at such a time, the keenest sorrow for their sins. </p>                        </div>

On the contrary, it is the healthy soul and not the sickly body that has the power of divination. </p>                        </div>

Neglect of this warning, while it was possible to heed it, was atoned for after the supreme disaster had occurred; for, adjoining the grove, an altar, which is now to be seen enclosed with a hedge, was dedicated to Aius the Speaker. The other illustration has been reported by many writers. At the time of the earthquake a voice came from <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>'s temple on the citadel commanding that an expiatory sacrifice be made of a pregnant <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a>.

Our ancestors, too, considered such 'omens' worthy of respect, and for that reason, before entering upon any business enterprise, used to say, 'May the issue be prosperous, propitious, lucky, and successful.'

'Oh! father, Persa is dead.' <a href=/people/10991 target=_blank>Paulus</a> clasped the child in a closer embrace and said, 'Daughter, I accept that as an omen.'

For the revelations made to seers when awake are made to us in sleep. While we sleep and the body lies as if dead, the soul is at its best, because it is then freed from the influence of the physical senses and from the worldly cares that weigh it down. And since the soul has lived from all eternity and has had converse with numberless other souls, it sees everything that exists in nature, provided that moderation and restraint have been used in eating and in drinking, so that the soul is in a condition to watch while the body sleeps.

He has the same view as to the interpretation of oracles and of frenzied utterances; for they all have their interpreters, just as poets have their commentators. Now it is clear that divine nature would have done a vain thing if she had merely created iron, copper, silver, and gold and had not shown us how to reach the veins in which those metals lie; the gift of field crops and orchard fruits would have been useless to the human race without a knowledge of how to cultivate them and prepare them for food; and building material would be of no service without the carpenter's art to convert it into lumber. So it is with everything that the gods have given for the advantage of mankind, there has been joined some art whereby that advantage may be turned to account.

For the theory in regard to the nature of the gods, so clearly developed in the second book of your work on that subject, includes this whole question. If we maintain that theory we shall establish the very point which I am trying to make: namely, 'that there are gods; that they rule the universe by their foresight; and that they direct the affairs of men — not merely of men in the mass, but of each individual.'

For he who knows the causes of future events necessarily knows what every future event will be. But since such knowledge is possible only to a god, it is left to man to presage the future by means of certain signs which indicate what will follow them. Things which are to be do not suddenly spring into existence, but the evolution of time is like the unwinding of a cable: it creates nothing new and only unfolds each event in its order. This connexion between cause and effect is obvious to two classes of diviners: those who are endowed with natural divination and those who know the course of events by the observation of signs. They may not discern the causes themselves, yet they do discern the signs and tokens of those causes. The careful study and recollection of those signs, aided by the records of former times, has evolved that sort of divination, known as artificial, which is divination by means of entrails, lightnings, portents, and celestial phenomena. </p>                        </div>

And the same thing may be said of men who, for a long period of time, have studied and noted the course of facts and the connexion of events, for they always know what the future will be; or, if that is putting it too strongly, they know in a majority of cases; or, if that will not be conceded either, then, surely, they sometimes know what the future will be.

Now, if it is known by observation and experience that these means of divination have their source in nature, it must be that the observations made and records kept for a long period of time have added much to our knowledge of this subject.

To this list of works must be added the six volumes which I wrote while holding the helm of state, entitled On the Republic — a weighty subject, appropriate for philosophic discussion, and one which has been most elaborately treated by <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, and the entire peripatetic school.

Is there, then, in such objects some quality that we can better perceive with the aid of prophecy and inspiration than we can with the aid of the senses alone? And is there any diviner, anywhere, who, if blind, like <a href=/people/468 target=_blank>Tiresias</a>, could tell the difference between white and black? Or, who, if deaf, could distinguish between different voices and different tones? Now you must admit that divination is not applicable in any case where knowledge is gained through the senses. <br />Nor is there any need of divination even in matters within the domain of science and of art. For, when people are sick, we, as a general rule, do not summon a prophet or a seer, but we call in a physician. Again, persons who want to learn to play on the harp or on the flute take lessons, not from a soothsayer, but from a musician. </p>                        </div>

And do you really believe that those who are credited with powers of divining, can, for that reason, tell whether the sun is larger than the earth, and whether it is as big as it seems to be? Or whether the moon shines by its own light or by that of the sun? Or do you think that they understand the motions of the sun and moon and of the five stars, which are called 'planets'? Your reputed diviners do not claim that they can answer any of these questions; nor will they profess to tell whether geometrical figures are correctly drawn or not, for that is the business of mathematicians, not of seers. <br />[4] Now let us consider matters within the purview of philosophy: When the question is as to what is morally right, or morally wrong, or as to what is neither the one nor the other, do we usually have our doubts resolved by diviners?

Such matters are usually referred to sages, not to diviners. <br />Furthermore, can any of the questions of dialectic or of physics be solved by divination? For example, is there one world, or are there many worlds? What are the primary elements from which all things are derived? Such problems belong to the science of physics. Again, suppose one should wish to know how to resolve the 'liar' fallacy, which the Greeks call 'ψευδόμενον'; or how to meet the 'heap' fallacy, known in Greek as sorites (which, if a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> equivalent were needed, could be represented by the word acervalis, but none is needed; for, just as the word 'philosophy' and many other words are of Greek origin and are in general use as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> words, so it is with sorites), — in both these cases the logician, and not the diviner, would speak. <br />Assume, next, that the inquiry is as to the best form of government, or as to what laws or what customs are beneficial and what are harmful, will you call soothsayers out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Etruria</a> to settle the question, or will you accept the decision of men of eminence chosen for their knowledge of statecraft? </p>                        </div>

But divination is not of use in every case, as my reasoning has shown; nor can any field or subject matter be found over which it may exercise control. <br />[5] Therefore I am inclined to think that there is no such thing as divination. There is a much-quoted Greek verse to this effect: <br />The best diviner I maintain to be <br />The man who guesses or conjectures best. <br />Now do you think that a prophet will 'conjecture' better whether a storm is at hand than a pilot? or that he will by 'conjecture' make a more accurate diagnosis than a physician, or conduct a war with more skill than a general? </p>                        </div>

I observed, also, that you defined divination to be 'the foreknowledge and foretelling of things which happen by chance.' In the first place, that is a contradiction of what you have admitted. For the foreknowledge possessed by a physician, a pilot, and a general is of 'things which happen by chance.'

Yet such coincidences 'happen by chance,' for though they happen frequently they do not happen always. What, then, is this thing you call divination — this 'foreknowledge of things that happen by chance' — and where is it employed? You think that 'whatever can be foreknown by means of science, reason, experience, or conjecture is to be referred, not to diviners, but to experts.' It follows, therefore, that divination of 'things that happen by chance' is possible only of things which cannot be foreseen by means of skill or wisdom. Hence, if someone had declared many years in advance that the famous Marcus <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>, who was consul three times, would perish in a shipwreck, this, by your definition, undoubtedly would have been a case of divination, since that calamity could not have been foreseen by means of any other skill or by wisdom.

Because of the perfectly regular movements of the moon the astronomers calculate when it will be opposite the sun and in the earth's shadow — which is 'the cone of night' — and when, necessarily, it will become invisible. For the same reason they know when the moon will be directly between the earth and the sun and thus will hide the light of the sun from our eyes.

'The artificial, you said, 'consists in part of conjecture and in part of long-continued observation; while the natural is that which the soul has seized, or, rather, has obtained, from a source outside itself — that is, from God, whence all human souls have been drawn off, received, or poured out.' Under the head of artificial divination you placed predictions made from the inspection of entrails, those made from lightnings and portents, those made by augurs, and by persons who depend entirely upon premonitory signs. Under the same head you included practically every method of prophecy in which conjecture was employed. </p>                        </div>

And although you could not give a reason for any kind of divination, still you carried on the war by marshalling an astonishing array of examples from fiction. Of such a course I wish to say emphatically that it is not becoming in a philosopher to introduce testimony which may be either true by accident, or false and fabricated through malice. You ought to have employed arguments and reason to show that all your propositions were true and you ought not to have resorted to so‑called occurrences — certainly not to such occurrences as are unworthy of belief.

In the first place, then, if you please, let us make 'an inspection' of entrails! Now can anybody be induced to believe that the things said to be predicted by means of entrails were learned by the soothsayers through 'long-continued observation'? How long, pray, did the observations last? How could the observations have continued for a long time?

You spoke of a mule bearing a colt. Such an event excites wonder because it seldom occurs; but if it had been impossible it would not have occurred. And it may be urged with effect against all portents that the impossible never has happened and that the possible need not excite any wonder. Now, in case of some new occurrence, ignorance of its cause is what excites our wonder; whereas, the same ignorance as to things of frequent occurrence does not. For the man who marvels that a mule has foaled does not understand how a mare foals and is ignorant of animal parturition in general. What he sees frequently causes him no astonishment even though he does not know how it happened. If something happens which he never saw before he considers it a portent.

The tradition is that, once upon a time, in the district of <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinii</a>, while a field was being ploughed, the ploughshare went deeper than usual and a certain <a href=/people/4699 target=_blank>Tages</a> suddenly sprang forth and spoke to the ploughman.

His whole address was devoted to an exposition of the science of soothsaying. Later, as new facts were learned and tested by reference to the principles imparted by <a href=/people/4699 target=_blank>Tages</a>, they were added to the original fund of knowledge. <br />This is the story as we get it from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Etruscans</a> themselves and as their records preserve it, and this, in their own opinion, is the origin of their art. </p>                        </div>

Why, even a mortal, if he has a proper sense of duty, does not warn his friends of imminent disasters which can in no way be escaped.

For, if we had the right to know what was going to happen, it should have been stated to us clearly: or, if the gods did not wish us to know, they should not have told us — even in riddles. <br />[26] Now every sort of conjecture — and divination depends on conjecture — is often applied by the wit of man to many different and even contradictory uses. As in judicial causes the prosecutor draws one inference and the lawyer for the defendant another from the same set of facts, and yet the inferences of both are plausible; so, in all investigations in which it is customary to employ conjecture, ambiguity is found. Moreover, in the case of things that happen now by chance now in the usual course of nature (sometimes too mistakes are caused by taking appearance for reality), it is the height of folly to hold the gods as the direct agents and not to inquire into the causes of such things. </p>                        </div>

'That was not a portent,' said the diviner; 'it would have been if the beam had been wrapped around the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a>.' By this answer he said plainly enough: 'Nothing that can happen is to be considered a portent.' <br />[29] You refer to a letter, written by Gaius <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a> to Marcus <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a>, stating that <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a>, father of Gaius, caught two <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> in his house and called together the soothsayers.

I shall speak of oracles when I get to natural divination. In addition I must discuss the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a>. But first let us consider auspices. 'To argue against auspices is a hard thing,' you say, 'for an augur to do.' Yes, for a <a href=/people/1401 target=_blank>Marsian</a>, perhaps; but very easy for a Roman. For we Roman augurs are not the sort who foretell the future by observing the flights of birds and other signs. And yet, I admit that <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, who founded the city by the direction of auspices, believed that augury was an art useful in seeing things to come — for the ancients had erroneous views on many subjects. But we see that the art has undergone a change, due to experience, education, or the long lapse of time. However, out of respect for the opinion of the masses and because of the great service to the State we maintain the augural practices, discipline, religious rites and laws, as well as the authority of the augural college. </p>                        </div>

Frightened by the visions and disregarding the jeers of his fellow-townsmen he set about doing as he had been directed. And so when he had broken open the stone, the lots sprang forth carved on oak, in ancient characters. The site where the stone was found is religiously guarded to this day.

This force is variously affected by those stars which are called 'planets' or wandering' stars. But when they have come into that sign of the Zodiac under which someone is born, or into a sign having some connexion with or accord with the natal sign, they form what is called a 'triangle' or 'square.' Now since, through the procession and retrogression of the stars, the great variety and change of the seasons and of temperature take place, and since the power of the sun produces such results as are before our eyes, they believe that it is not merely probable, but certain, that just as the temperature of the air is regulated by this celestial force, so also children at their birth are influenced in soul and body and by this force their minds, manners, disposition, physical condition, career in life and destinies are determined.

The theory that the medical art was imparted by means of dreams having been disproved, the basis of a belief in dreams is utterly destroyed. [60] </p>                        </div>

Surely you must assume, either that there is a Divine Power which, in planning for our good, gives us information by means of dreams; or that, because of some natural connexion and association — the Greeks call it συμπάθεια — interpreters of dreams know what sort of a dream is required to fit any situation and what sort of a result will follow any dream; or that neither of these suppositions is true, but that the usual result or consequence of every dream is known by a consistent system of rules based on long-continued observation. In the first place, then, it must be understood that there is no divine power which creates dreams. And indeed it is perfectly clear that none of the visions seen in dreams have their origin in the will of the gods; for the gods, for our sakes, would so interpose that we might be able to foresee the future. </p>                        </div>

On the other hand, how many treat them with disdain, and regard a belief in them as the superstition of a weak and effeminate mind! Moreover, why does God, in planning for the good of the human race, convey his warnings by means of dreams which men consider unworthy not only of worrying about, but even of remembering? For it is impossible that God does not know how people generally regard dreams; and to do anything needlessly and without a cause is unworthy of a god and is inconsistent even with the habits of right-thinking men. And hence, if most dreams are unnoticed and disregarded, either God is ignorant of that fact, or he does a vain thing in conveying information by means of dreams; but neither supposition accords with the nature of a god, therefore, it must be admitted that God conveys no information by means of dreams.

When the soul is supported by the bodily members and by the five senses its powers of perception, thought, and apprehension are more trustworthy.

Really? Then, it is possible, I suppose, to 'observe' dreams? If so, how? For they are of infinite variety and there is no imaginable thing too absurd, too involved, or too abnormal for us to dream about it. How, then, is it possible for us either to remember this countless and ever-changing mass of visions or to observe and record the subsequent results? Astronomers have recorded the movements of the planets and thereby have discovered an orderly course of the stars, not thought of before. But tell me, if you can, what is the orderly course of dreams and what is the harmonious relation between them and subsequent events? And by what means can the true be distinguished from the false, in view of the fact that the same dreams have certain consequences for one person and different consequences for another and seeing also that even for the same individual the same dream is not always followed by the same result? As a rule we do not believe a liar even when he tells the truth, but, to my surprise, if one dream turns out to be true, your <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoics</a> do not withdraw their belief in the prophetic value of that one though it is only one out of many; rather, from the character of the one true dream, they establish the character of countless others that are false. </p>                        </div>

This becomes especially evident when we consider that those who have the dreams deduce no prophecies from them; that those who interpret them depend upon conjecture and not upon nature; that in the course of the almost countless ages, chance has worked more miracles through all other agencies than through the agency of dreams; and, finally, that nothing is more uncertain than conjecture, which may be led not only into varying, but sometimes even into contradictory, conclusions.
