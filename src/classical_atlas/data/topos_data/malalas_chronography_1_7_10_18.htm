He had the measurement of his age, 6 feet, including his head, to make 96 finger-widths of this age, his hand-span 16 fingers, his forearm (cubit) 24 fingers, his foot 16 fingers. He lived 930 years. <br />His wife was called <a href=/people/5662 target=_blank>Eva</a>, and she bore three sons, Cain, <a href=/people/5395 target=_blank>Abel</a>, and <a href=/people/3469 target=_blank>Seth</a>, and two daughters Azouran (Azura) and Asouam (Awan). At God’s command, <a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a> put names to all the quadrupeds and winged things and amphibians and reptiles and fish and their offspring. His own name and the name of his wife were spoken to them by an angel. <br />His son <a href=/people/3469 target=_blank>Seth</a> had wisdom from God, and by God’s command put names on all the stars, and the five planets so they would be recognized by mankind. The first planet star he called <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a>, the second <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>, the third <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>, the fourth <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, the fifth <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>. He expounded the seven vowels from the five planets and two heavenly lights. He first discovered Hebrew letters and wrote them down. God called the two great heavenly lights, to the authority of the day the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, to the authority of the night the Moon. The very wise Fortunus the Roman chronicler wrote this, in an account I found in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>. <br /><a href=/people/3469 target=_blank>Seth</a> lived 912 years and took as his wife Asouam his own sister and had children with her, and there was a large generation of people and women.

After 1287 years, <a href=/people/3590 target=_blank>Enoch</a> was transferred.

The priests of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=ethnic long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judaeans</a> interpreted these Hebrew accounts of <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> as follows: The sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair, and took wives for themselves from all who were chosen, and they went in to them, as <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> puts it.

The sphere came down in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318355WJor class=place long=35.5465 lat=31.837>Jordan</a> river and was extinguished. They tell this story about the fire, and say <a href=/people/273 target=_blank>Phaethon</a> was the son of the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, and that he fell from the chariot to earth, which story <a href=/people/2769 target=_blank>Ovid</a> wrote poetically. The Chaeroneian <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a> told it more accurately. He said a sphere of fire came down in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=demonym long=7 lat=49>Celtic</a> country. The rest of the giants saw so many of them struck by lightning but remained unpersuaded. God was angry, and said to them, “Let my spirit not remain in these men, because they are flesh,” as is contained in the Mosaic scriptures. The most wise <a href=/people/1403 target=_blank>Peisander</a>, a poet of the Hellenes after the time of <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>, expressed poetically that these giants were men born from the earth, having feet of <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a>, and daring somehow to attack the highest divine forces. He called them dragon-footed, and said they were consumed with various punishments by the gods. <br />The most wise <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a> interpreted this poetry as follows, that for this reason the poet called these men dragon-footed, because their wits had been bestialized and they reckoned nothing of human virtues, but having feet they walked toward evil and unjust things of the earth. […] movement of the sun and the moon, he commanded some to be killed by lightning fire, others to have their bodies turned to stone, others to be shot with the swiftest arrows of death, others to be ripped apart with wounds as from a spear, the rest to be sunk under lots of water. Thus the giants or dragon-footed paid with their lives, dying nastily. The wise <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> said they were held in a deep plain, war with some in the high mountains and on land and in the hollows were dragged as creeping <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a> against them and were killed by those dwelling in the heights. </p>                        </div>

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a> have a hidden name for the Moon, and secretly called her <a href=/people/389 target=_blank>Io</a> until lately.

So he promulgated a law that the soldiers should take virgins, whom he called Broutides, in marriage. No one agreed to give their daughter to them.

He had a gold necklace on his throat. He stood upon four elephants, yoked with four wheels, as in a tall cart clad in golden petals, just as the carts of the archons of the provinces are clad in silver. </p>                        </div>

Eudaimonos was the City Eparch. He was holding troublemakers in prison from both of the factions. As he questioned various persons he learned the names of four men responsible for murder. The sentence for four of them was beheading, and for three impaling.
