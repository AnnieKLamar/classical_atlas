For <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a>, the blest, (and I am not reproaching his fortune, when I say this) the son of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, as they report, trembling at the rock which impends over his head, hangs in the air, and suffers this punishment, as they say indeed, because, although being a man, yet having the honor of a table in common with the Gods upon equal terms, he possessed an ungovernable tongue, a most disgraceful malady. He begat <a href=/people/170 target=_blank>Pelops</a>, and from him sprung <a href=/people/126 target=_blank>Atreus</a>, for whom the Goddess having carded the wool spun the thread of contention, and doomed him to make war on <a href=/people/598 target=_blank>Thyestes</a> his relation; (why must I commemorate things unspeakable?) But <a href=/people/126 target=_blank>Atreus</a> then killed his children — and feasted him. But from <a href=/people/126 target=_blank>Atreus</a>, for I pass over in silence the misfortunes which intervened, sprung <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, the illustrious, (if he was indeed illustrious,) and <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>; their mother <a href=/people/2136 target=_blank>Aerope</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=person long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>.

But why indeed must I accuse the injustice of <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a>? Yet persuaded he <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> to kill that mother that brought him forth, a deed which gained not a good report from all men. But nevertheless he did slay her, as he would not be disobedient to the God. I also took a share in the murder, but such as a woman ought to take. As did <a href=/people/663 target=_blank>Pylades</a> also who perpetrated this deed with us. From that time wasting away, the wretched <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> is afflicted with a grievous malady, but falling on his couch there lies, but his mother's blood whirls him to frenzy (for I dread to mention those Goddesses, the <a href=/people/1558 target=_blank>Eumenides</a>, who persecute him with terror). Moreover this is the sixth day since his slaughtered mother was purified by fire as to her body. During which he has neither taken any food down his throat, he has not bathed his limbs, but covered beneath his cloak, when indeed his body is lightened of its disease, on coming to his right mind he weeps, but at another time starts suddenly from his couch, as a colt from his yoke. </p>                        </div>

If what things are virtuous, and what are not virtuous, are plain to all, what man was ever more unwise that this man? who did not indeed consider justice, nor applied to the common existing law of the Grecians. For after that <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> breathed forth his last, struck by my daughter on the head, a most foul deed (for never will I approve of this), it behooved him indeed to lay against her a sacred charge of bloodshed, following up the accusation, and to cast his mother from out of the house; and he would have taken the wise side in the calamity, and would have kept to law, and would have been pious. But now has he come to the same fate with his mother. For with justice thinking her wicked, himself has become more wicked in slaying his mother. But thus much, <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, will I ask thee; If the wife that shared his bed were to kill him, and his son again kills his mother in return, and he that is born of him shall expiate the murder with murder, whither then will the extremes of these evils proceed? Well did our fathers of old lay down these things; they suffered not him to come into the sight of their eyes, not to their converse, who was under an attainder of blood; but they made him atone by banishment; they suffered however none to kill him in return. For always were one about to be attainted of murder, taking the pollution last into his hands. But I hate indeed impious women, but first among them my daughter, who slew her husband.

Let then thine age, which hinders me through fear from speaking, be removed out of the way of my words, and I will go on in a direct path; but now do I fear thy gray hairs. What could I do? for oppose the facts, two against two. My father indeed begat me, but thy daughter brought me forth, a field receiving the seed from another; but without a father there never could be a child. I reasoned therefore with myself, that I should assist the prime author of my birth rather than the aliment which under him produced me. But thy daughterI am ashamed to call her mother), in secret and unchaste nuptials, had approached the bed of another man; of myself, if I speak ill of her, shall I be speaking, but yet will I tell it. <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a> was her secret husband in her palace. Him I slew, and after him I sacrificed my mother, doing indeed unholy things, but avenging my father. But as touching those things for which thou threatenest that I must be stoned, hear, how I shall assist all Greece. For if the women shall arrive at such a pitch of boldness as to murder the men, making good their escape with regard to their children, seeking to captivate their pity by their breasts, it would be as nothing with them to slay their husbands, having any pretext that might chance; but I having done dreadful things (as thou sayest), have put a stop to this law, but hating my mother deservedly I slew her, who betrayed her husband absent from home in arms, the generalissimo of the whole land of Greece, and kept not her bed undefiled. But when she perceived that she had done amiss, she inflicted not vengeance on herself, but, that she might not suffer vengeance from her husband, punished and slew my father. By the Gods, (in no good cause have I named the Gods, pleading against a charge of murder,) had I by my silence praised my mother's actions, what then would the deceased have done to me? To my mother indeed the <a href=/people/1744 target=_blank>Furies</a> are present as allies, but would they not be present to him, who has received the greater injury? Would he not, detesting me, have haunted me with the <a href=/people/1744 target=_blank>Furies</a>? Thou then, O old man, by begetting a bad daughter, hast destroyed me; for through her boldness deprived of my father, I became a matricide. Dost see? <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a> slew not the wife of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, for she married not a husband on a husband, but her marriage-bed remains unpolluted in the palace. Dost see? <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, who, dwelling in his habitation in the midst of the earth, gives the most clear oracles to mortals, by whom we are entirely guided, whatever he may say, on him relying slew I my mother. 'Twas he who erred, not I: what could I do? Is not the God sufficient for me, who transfer the deed to him, to do away with the pollution? Whither then can any fly for succor, unless he that commanded me shall deliver me from death? But say not these things have been done not well; but say not fortunately for us who did them. But to whatsoever men their marriages are well established, there is a happy life, but to those to whom they fall not out well, with regard to their affairs both at home and abroad they are unfortunate. </p>                        </div>

Thou too, <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a>, who standest over that damsel with thy sword drawn, that thou mayest know what commands I bring with me. <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> indeed, whom thou minded to destroy, working <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> to anger, didst fail of thy purpose, she is here, whom ye see wrapt in the bosom of the sky, preserved, and not slain by thy hands. Her I preserved, and snatched from thy sword, commanded by my father <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. For being the daughter of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, it is right that she should live immortal.
