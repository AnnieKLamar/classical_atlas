In size and strength he surpassed all the offspring of <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>. As far as the thighs he was of human shape and of such prodigious bulk that he out-topped all the mountains, and his head often brushed the stars. One of his hands reached out to the west and the other to the east, and from them projected a hundred dragons' heads. From the thighs downward he had huge coils of <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>vipers</a>, which when drawn out, reached to his very head and emitted a loud hissing. His body was all winged :unkempt hair streamed on the wind from his head and cheeks; and fire flashed from his eyes. Such and so great was <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a> when, hurling kindled rocks, he made for the very heaven with hissings and shouts, spouting a great jet of fire from his mouth. But when the gods saw him rushing at heaven, they made for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> in flight, and being pursued they changed their forms into those of animals. However <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> pelted <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a> at a distance with thunderbolts, and at close quarters struck him down with an adamantine sickle, and as he fled pursued him closely as far as Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312331LCas class=place long=33.08 lat=31.2154>Casius</a>, which overhangs <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>. There, seeing the monster sore wounded, he grappled with him. But <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a> twined about him and gripped him in his coils, and wresting the sickle from him severed the sinews of his hands and feet, and lifting him on his shoulders carried him through the sea to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> and deposited him on arrival in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225CKor class=demonym long=22.5217 lat=38.5158>Corycian</a> cave. Likewise he put away the sinews there also, hidden in a bearskin, and he set to guard them the she-dragon <a href=/people/4968 target=_blank>Delphyne</a>, who was a half-bestial maiden. But <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> and <a href=/people/6144 target=_blank>Aegipan</a> stole the sinews and fitted them unobserved to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>.

Some say he was a son of <a href=/people/394 target=_blank>Agenor</a>, but others that he was a son of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, and he is variously alleged to have been blinded by the gods for foretelling men the future; or by <a href=/people/208 target=_blank>Boreas</a> and the <a href=/people/461 target=_blank>Argonauts</a> because he blinded his own sons at the instigation of their stepmother; or by <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, because he revealed to the children of <a href=/people/548 target=_blank>Phrixus</a> how they could sail from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=place long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchis</a> to Greece. The gods also sent the <a href=/people/1202 target=_blank>Harpies</a> to him. These were winged female creatures, and when a table was laid for <a href=/people/615 target=_blank>Phineus</a>, they flew down from the sky and snatched up most of the victuals, and what little they left stank so that nobody could touch it. When the <a href=/people/461 target=_blank>Argonauts</a> would have consulted him about the voyage, he said that he would advise them about it if they would rid him of the <a href=/people/1202 target=_blank>Harpies</a>. So the <a href=/people/461 target=_blank>Argonauts</a> laid a table of viands beside him, and the <a href=/people/1202 target=_blank>Harpies</a> with a shriek suddenly pounced down and snatched away the food. When <a href=/people/2087 target=_blank>Zetes</a> and <a href=/people/1919 target=_blank>Calais</a>, the sons of <a href=/people/208 target=_blank>Boreas</a>, saw that, they drew their swords and, being winged, pursued them through the air.

When <a href=/people/2578 target=_blank>Jason</a> swore to do so, she gave him a drug with which she bade him anoint his shield, spear, and body when he was about to yoke the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>; for she said that, anointed with it, he could for a single day be harmed neither by fire nor by iron. And she signified to him that, when the teeth were sown, armed men would spring up from the ground against him; and when he saw a knot of them he was to throw stones into their midst from a distance, and when they fought each other about that, he was taken to kill them. On hearing that, <a href=/people/2578 target=_blank>Jason</a> anointed himself with the drug, and being come to the grove of the temple he sought the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>, and though they charged him with a flame of fire, he yoked them. And when he had sowed the teeth, there rose armed men from the ground; and where he saw several together, he pelted them unseen with stones, and when they fought each other he drew near and slew them.

The kibisis is so called because dress and food are deposited in it. ] They had also the cap (of <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>). When the <a href=/people/5900 target=_blank>Phorcides</a> had shown him the way, he gave them back the tooth and the eye, and coming to the nymphs got what he wanted. So he slung the wallet (kibisis) about him, fitted the sandals to his ankles, and put the cap on his head. Wearing it, he saw whom he pleased, but was not seen by others.

But when they had fortified it, he would not pay them their wages. Therefore <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> sent a pestilence, and <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> a sea monster, which, carried up by a flood, snatched away the people of the plain. But as oracles foretold deliverance from these calamities if <a href=/people/1277 target=_blank>Laomedon</a> would expose his daughter <a href=/people/1581 target=_blank>Hesione</a> to be devoured by the sea monster, he exposed her by fastening her to the rocks near the sea.

These apples were not, as some have said, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, but on <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a> among the <a href=/people/801 target=_blank>Hyperboreans</a>. They were presented (by <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>) to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> after his marriage with <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>, and guarded by an immortal dragon with a hundred heads, offspring of <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a> and <a href=/people/2142 target=_blank>Echidna</a>, which spoke with many and divers sorts of voices. With it the <a href=/people/597 target=_blank>Hesperides</a> also were on guard, to wit, <a href=/people/8646 target=_blank>Aegle</a>, <a href=/people/2875 target=_blank>Erythia</a>, <a href=/people/597 target=_blank>Hesperia</a>, and <a href=/people/2027 target=_blank>Arethusa</a>. So journeying he came to the river <a href=/people/9294 target=_blank>Echedorus</a>. And <a href=/people/853 target=_blank>Cycnus</a>, son of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> and <a href=/people/3297 target=_blank>Pyrene</a>, challenged him to single combat. <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> championed the cause of <a href=/people/853 target=_blank>Cycnus</a> and marshalled the combat, but a thunderbolt was hurled between the two and parted the combatants. And going on foot through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyria</a> and hastening to the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450120WEri class=place long=12.0293 lat=44.9753>Eridanus</a> he came to the nymphs, the daughters of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and <a href=/people/554 target=_blank>Themis</a>. They revealed <a href=/people/428 target=_blank>Nereus</a> to him, and <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> seized him while he slept, and though the god turned himself into all kinds of shapes, the hero bound him and did not release him till he had learned from him where were the apples and the <a href=/people/597 target=_blank>Hesperides</a>. Being informed, he traversed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. That country was then ruled by <a href=/people/931 target=_blank>Antaeus</a>, son of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, who used to kill strangers by forcing them to wrestle. Being forced to wrestle with him, <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> hugged him, lifted him aloft, broke and killed him; for when he touched earth so it was that he waxed stronger, wherefore some said that he was a son of <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>. After <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> he traversed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. That country was then ruled by <a href=/people/867 target=_blank>Busiris</a>, a son of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> by <a href=/people/4756 target=_blank>Lysianassa</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/1212 target=_blank>Epaphus</a>. This <a href=/people/867 target=_blank>Busiris</a> used to sacrifice strangers on an altar of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> in accordance with a certain oracle. For <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> was visited with dearth for nine years, and <a href=/people/10078 target=_blank>Phrasius</a>, a learned seer who had come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, said that the dearth would cease if they slaughtered a stranger man in honor of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> every year. <a href=/people/867 target=_blank>Busiris</a> began by slaughtering the seer himself and continued to slaughter the strangers who landed. So <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> also was seized and haled to the altars, but he burst his bonds and slew both <a href=/people/867 target=_blank>Busiris</a> and his son <a href=/people/2475 target=_blank>Amphidamas</a>. And traversing Asia he put in to Thermydrae, the harbor of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361281PLin class=ethnic long=28.0882 lat=36.0913>Lindians</a>. And having loosed one of the bullocks from the cart of a cowherd, he sacrificed it and feasted. But the cowherd, unable to protect himself, stood on a certain mountain and cursed. Wherefore to this day, when they sacrifice to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, they do it with curses. And passing by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a> he slew <a href=/people/2284 target=_blank>Emathion</a>, son of <a href=/people/5362 target=_blank>Tithonus</a>, and journeying through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> to the outer sea he received the goblet from the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>. And having crossed to the opposite mainland he shot on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a> the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>, offspring of <a href=/people/2142 target=_blank>Echidna</a> and <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a>, that was devouring the liver of <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a>, and he released <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a>, after choosing for himself the bond of olive, and to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> he presented <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Chiron</a>, who, though immortal, consented to die in his stead. Now <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a> had told <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> not to go himself after the apples but to send <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a>, first relieving him of the burden of the sphere; so when he was come to <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a> in the land of the <a href=/people/801 target=_blank>Hyperboreans</a>, he took the advice and relieved <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a>. But when <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a> had received three apples from the <a href=/people/597 target=_blank>Hesperides</a>, he came to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, and not wishing to support the sphere, he said that he would himself carry the apples to <a href=/people/247 target=_blank>Eurystheus</a>, and bade <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> hold up the sky in his stead. <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> promised to do so, but succeeded by craft in putting it on <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a> instead. For at the advice of <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a> he begged <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a> to hold up the sky till he should put a pad on his head. When <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a> heard that, he laid the apples down on the ground and took the sphere from <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>. And so <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> picked up the apples and departed. But some say that he did not get them from <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a>, but that he plucked the apples himself after killing the guardian <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a>. And having brought the apples he gave them to <a href=/people/247 target=_blank>Eurystheus</a>. But he, on receiving them, bestowed them on <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, from whom <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> got them and conveyed them back again; for it was not lawful that they should be laid down anywhere. </p>                        </div>

When <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> was about to depart to fetch him, he went to <a href=/people/793 target=_blank>Eumolpus</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235PEle class=place long=23.5415 lat=38.0441>Eleusis</a>, wishing to be initiated. However it was not then lawful for foreigners to be initiated: since he proposed to be initiated as the adoptive son of Pylius. But not being able to see the mysteries because he had not been cleansed of the slaughter of the <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>centaurs</a>, he was cleansed by <a href=/people/793 target=_blank>Eumolpus</a> and then initiated.

And when they beheld <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, they stretched out their hands as if they should be raised from the dead by his might. And <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>, indeed, he took by the hand and raised up, but when he would have brought up <a href=/people/1493 target=_blank>Pirithous</a>, the earth quaked and he let go. And he rolled away also the stone of <a href=/people/1928 target=_blank>Ascalaphus</a>.

Seeing that it was an accident, the lad's father pardoned <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>; but <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> wished, in accordance with the law, to suffer the penalty of exile, and resolved to depart to <a href=/people/1409 target=_blank>Ceyx</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388224PHer class=place long=22.4313 lat=38.794>Trachis</a>. And taking <a href=/people/728 target=_blank>Deianira</a> with him, he came to the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384216WEve class=place long=21.552 lat=38.376>Evenus</a>, at which the <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>centaur</a> <a href=/people/1052 target=_blank>Nessus</a> sat and ferried passengers across for hire, alleging that he had received the ferry from the gods for his righteousness. So <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> crossed the river by himself, but on being asked to pay the fare he entrusted <a href=/people/728 target=_blank>Deianira</a> to <a href=/people/1052 target=_blank>Nessus</a> to carry over. But he, in ferrying her across, attempted to violate her. She cried out, <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> heard her, and shot <a href=/people/1052 target=_blank>Nessus</a> to the heart when he emerged from the river. Being at the point of death, <a href=/people/1052 target=_blank>Nessus</a> called <a href=/people/728 target=_blank>Deianira</a> to him and said that if she would have a love charm to operate on <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> she should mix the seed he had dropped on the ground with the blood that flowed from the wound inflicted by the barb. She did so and kept it by her. </p>                        </div>

So <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> put it on and proceeded to offer sacrifice. But no sooner was the tunic warmed than the poison of the <a href=/people/1205 target=_blank>hydra</a> began to corrode his skin; and on that he lifted <a href=/people/1097 target=_blank>Lichas</a> by the feet, hurled him down from the headland, and tore off the tunic, which clung to his body, so that his flesh was torn away with it. In such a sad plight he was carried on shipboard to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388224RTra class=place long=22.4 lat=38.75>Trachis</a>: and <a href=/people/728 target=_blank>Deianira</a>, on learning what had happened, hanged herself.

Now the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a> were in possession of an oracle which declared that they should be rid of the <a href=/people/974 target=_blank>Sphinx</a> whenever they had read her riddle; so they often met and discussed the answer, and when they could not find it the <a href=/people/974 target=_blank>Sphinx</a> used to snatch away one of them and gobble him up.

Different stories are told about his blindness and his power of soothsaying. For some say that he was blinded by the gods because he revealed their secrets to men. But <a href=/people/582 target=_blank>Pherecydes</a> says that he was blinded by <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>; for <a href=/people/3735 target=_blank>Chariclo</a> was dear to <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> ... and <a href=/people/468 target=_blank>Tiresias</a> saw the goddess stark naked, and she covered his eyes with her hands, and so rendered him sightless.

Hence, when <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> disputed whether the pleasures of love are felt more by women or by men, they referred to him for a decision. He said that if the pleasures of love be reckoned at ten, men enjoy one and women nine.

He cleaned it out, strung the shell with chords made from the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>kine</a> he had sacrificed, and having thus produced a lyre he invented also a plectrum.

But afterwards <a href=/people/388 target=_blank>Electra</a>, at the time of her violation, took refuge at the image, and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> threw the <a href=/people/12046 target=_blank>Palladium</a> along with <a href=/people/2150 target=_blank>Ate</a> into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilian</a> country; and <a href=/people/995 target=_blank>Ilus</a> built a temple for it, and honored it. Such is the legend of the <a href=/people/12046 target=_blank>Palladium</a>. And <a href=/people/995 target=_blank>Ilus</a> married <a href=/people/8639 target=_blank>Eurydice</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/201 target=_blank>Adrastus</a>, and begat <a href=/people/1277 target=_blank>Laomedon</a>, who married <a href=/people/10631 target=_blank>Strymo</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/4017 target=_blank>Scamander</a>; but according to some his wife was <a href=/people/10606 target=_blank>Placia</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/5343 target=_blank>Otreus</a>, and according to others she was <a href=/people/2075 target=_blank>Leucippe</a>; and he begat five sons, <a href=/people/5362 target=_blank>Tithonus</a>, <a href=/people/2804 target=_blank>Lampus</a>, <a href=/people/1521 target=_blank>Clytius</a>, <a href=/people/3311 target=_blank>Hicetaon</a>, <a href=/people/2273 target=_blank>Podarces</a>, and three daughters, <a href=/people/1581 target=_blank>Hesione</a>, <a href=/people/10524 target=_blank>Cilla</a>, and <a href=/people/3119 target=_blank>Astyoche</a>; and by a nymph <a href=/people/6063 target=_blank>Calybe</a> he had a son <a href=/people/3303 target=_blank>Bucolion</a>. </p>                        </div>

The first son born to her was <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>; and when a second babe was about to be born <a href=/people/2138 target=_blank>Hecuba</a> dreamed she had brought forth a firebrand, and that the fire spread over the whole city and burned it. When <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> learned of the dream from <a href=/people/2138 target=_blank>Hecuba</a>, he sent for his son <a href=/people/3099 target=_blank>Aesacus</a>, for he was an interpreter of dreams, having been taught by his mother's father <a href=/people/1976 target=_blank>Merops</a>. He declared that the child was begotten to be the ruin of his country and advised that the babe should be exposed. When the babe was born <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> gave it to a servant to take and expose on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397268LIda class=place long=26.8423 lat=39.6922>Ida</a>; now the servant was named <a href=/people/3120 target=_blank>Agelaus</a>. Exposed by him, the infant was nursed for five days by a bear; and, when he found it safe, he took it up, carried it away, brought it up as his own son on his farm, and named him <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a>. When he grew to be a young man, <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a> excelled many in beauty and strength, and was afterwards surnamed <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, because he repelled robbers and defended the flocks.

Afterwards <a href=/people/2138 target=_blank>Hecuba</a> bore sons, <a href=/people/892 target=_blank>Deiphobus</a>, <a href=/people/515 target=_blank>Helenus</a>, <a href=/people/6089 target=_blank>Pammon</a>, <a href=/people/1923 target=_blank>Polites</a>, <a href=/people/1866 target=_blank>Antiphus</a>, <a href=/people/2702 target=_blank>Hipponous</a>, <a href=/people/1494 target=_blank>Polydorus</a>, and <a href=/people/4360 target=_blank>Troilus</a>: this last she is said to have had by <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>.

As <a href=/people/255 target=_blank>Aeacus</a> was alone in the island, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> made the ants into men for him. And <a href=/people/255 target=_blank>Aeacus</a> married <a href=/people/5383 target=_blank>Endeis</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/1303 target=_blank>Sciron</a>, by whom he had two sons, <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a> and <a href=/people/258 target=_blank>Telamon</a>.

So <a href=/people/255 target=_blank>Aeacus</a> did offer prayers, and Greece was delivered from the dearth.
