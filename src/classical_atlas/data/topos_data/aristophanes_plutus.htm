A servant may give the best of advice, but if his master does not follow it, the poor slave must inevitably have his share in the disaster; for fortune does not allow him to dispose of his own body, it belongs to his master who has bought it. Alas! 'tis the way of the world. But the god <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Loxias</a>, who prophesies from a golden tripod, deserves my censure, for 'tis assured he is a physician and a cunning diviner; and yet my master is leaving him infected with mere madness and insists on following a blind man. Is this not opposed to all good sense? 'Tis for us, who see clearly, to guide those who don't; whereas he clings to the trail of a blind fellow and compels me to do the same without answering my questions with ever a word. (To <a href=/people/5557 target=_blank>Chremylus</a>.) Aye, master, unless you tell me why we are following this unknown fellow, I will not be silent, but I will worry and torment you, for you cannot beat me because of my sacred chaplet of laurel. </p>                        </div>

I am going to leave you no peace till you have told me who this man is; and if I ask it, 'tis entirely because of my interest in you. <br />CHREMYLUS: Well, be it so. I will reveal it to you as being the most faithful and the most rascally of all my servants. I honoured the gods and did what was right, and yet I was none the less poor and unfortunate. <br />CARIO: I know it but too well. <br />CHREMYLUS: Other amassed wealth — the temple-robbers, the orators, the informers, indeed every sort of rascal. <br />CARIO: I believe you. <br />CHREMYLUS: Therefore I came to consult the oracle of the god, not on my own account, for my unfortunate life is nearing its end, but for my only son; I wanted to ask <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, if it was necessary for him to become a thorough knave and renounce his virtuous principles, since that seemed to me to be the only way to succeed in life. <br />CARIO: And what did Phoibos cry from his garlands? </p>                        </div>

Why, the god was advising you thereby, and that in the clearest possible way, to bring up your son according to the fashion of your country. <br />CHREMYLUS: What makes you think that? <br />CARIO: Is it not evident to the blind, that nowadays to do nothing that is right is the best way to get on? <br />CHREMYLUS: No, that is not the meaning of the oracle; there must be another, that is nobler. If this blind man would tell us who he is and why and with what object he has led us here, we should no doubt understand what our oracle really does mean. <br />CARIO (to <a href=/people/641 target=_blank>Plutus</a>). Come, tell us at once who you are, or I give effect to my threat. (He menaces him.) And quick too, be quick, I say. <br />PLUTUS: I'll thrash you. <br />CARIO (to Chremylus).
