Recognize that thou art in bondage on a foreign soil, in a strange city, where thou seest none of all thy friends, luckless lady, cast on evil days.antistrophe 2) Yea, I did pity thee most truly, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> dame, when thou camest to this house; but from fear of my mistress I hold my peace, albeit I sympathize with thee, lest she, whom <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>'s daughter bore, discover my good will toward thee. (HERMIONE enters, in complete royal regalia.) <br />HERMIONE: With a crown of golden workmanship upon my head and about my body this embroidered robe am I come hither; no presents these I wear from the palace of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> or <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a>, but gifts my father <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> gave me together with a sumptuous dower from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=person long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=place long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconia</a>, to insure me freedom of speech. Such is my answer to you; (to the <br />CHORUS) but as for thee, slave and captive, thou wouldst fain oust me and secure this palace for thyself, and thanks to thy enchantment I am hated by my husband; thou it is that hast made my womb barren and cheated my hopes; for <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>'s daughters have clever heads for such villainy; yet will I check thee therefrom, nor shall this temple of the <a href=/people/590 target=_blank>Nereid</a> avail thee aught, no! neither its altar or shrine, but thou shalt die. But if or god or man should haply wish to save thee, thou must atone for thy proud thoughts of happier days now past by humbling thyself and crouching prostrate at my knees, by sweeping out my halls, and by learning, as thou sprinklest water from a golden ewer, where thou now art. Here is no <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>, no <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> with his gold, but a city of Hellas. Yet thou, miserable woman, hast gone so far in wantonness that thou canst lay thee down with the son of the very man that slew thy husband, and bear children to the murderer. Such is all the race of barbarians; father and daughter, mother and son, sister and brother mate together; the nearest and dearest stain their path with each other's blood, and no law restrains such horrors. Bring not these crimes amongst us, for here we count it shame that one man should have the control of two wives, and men are content to turn to one lawful love, that is, all who care to live an honourable life. <br />LEADER OF THE CHORUS Women are by nature somewhat jealous, and do ever show the keenest hate to rivals in their love. </p>                        </div>

Thou for instance, caitiff that thou art, didst thou ever wrest <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> from <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> with thy picked troops of Hellenes? thou that hast raised such a storm, at the word of thy daughter, a mere child, and hast entered the lists with a poor captive; unworthy I count thee of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>'s capture, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> still more disgraced by thy victory. Those who only in appearance are men of sense make an outward show, but inwardly resemble the common herd, save it be in wealth, which is their chiefest strength. Come now, <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, let us carry through this argument. Suppose I am slain by thy daughter, and she work her will on me, yet can she never escape the pollution of murder, and public opinion will make thee too an accomplice in this deed of blood, for thy share in the business must needs implicate thee. But even supposing I escape death myself, will ye kill my child? Even then, how will his father brook the murder of his child? <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> has no such coward's tale to tell of him; nay, he will follow duty's call; his actions will prove him a worthy scion of <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a> and <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>. Thy daughter will be thrust forth from his house; and what wilt thou say when seeking to betroth her to another? wilt say her virtue made her leave a worthless lord? Nay, that will be false. Who then will wed her? wilt thou keep her without a husband in thy halls, grown grey in widowhood? Unhappy wretch! dost not see the flood-gates of trouble opening wide for thee? How many a wrong against a wife wouldst thou prefer thy daughter to have found to suffering what I now describe? We ought not on trifling grounds to promote great ills; nor should men, if we women are so deadly a curse, bring their nature down to our level. No! if, as thy daughter asserts, I am practising sorcery against her and making her barren, right willingly will I, without any crouching at altars, submit in my own person to the penalty that lies in her husband's hands, seeing that I am no less chargeable with injuring him if I make him childless. This is my case; but for thee, there is one thing I fear in thy disposition; it was a quarrel for a woman that really induced thee to destroy poor <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a>'s town. <br />LEADER OF THE CHORUS Thou hast said too much for a woman speaking to men; that discretion hath shot away its last shaft from thy soul's quiver. <br />MENELAUS: Women, these are petty matters, unworthy, as thou sayest, of my despotic sway, unworthy too of Hellas.

I then have set myself to help my daughter because I consider her loss of wife's rights most grave; for whatever else a woman suffers is second to this; if she loses her husband's love she loses her life therewith. Now, as it is right <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a> should rule my slaves, so my friends and I should have control of his; for friends, if they be really friends, keep nothing to themselves, but have all in common. So if I wait for the absent instead of making the best arrangement I can at once of my affairs, I show weakness, not wisdom.

Now it was not so much regard for thy message that brought me thither, as the intention of carrying thee away from this house, if, as now, thou shouldst grant me a chance of saying so. For thou wert mine formerly, but art now living with thy present husband through thy father's baseness; since he, before invading <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>'s domains, betrothed thee to me, and then afterwards promised thee to thy present lord, provided he captured the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. So, as soon as <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>' son returned hither, I forgave thy father, but entreated the bridegroom to forego his marriage with thee, telling him all I had endured and my present misfortune; I might get a wife, I said, from amongst friends, but outside their circle 'twas no easy task for one exiled like myself from home. Thereat he grew abusive, taunting me with my mother's murder and those blood-boltered fiends. And I was humbled by the fortunes of my house, and though 'tis true, I grieved, yet did I bear my sorrow, and reluctantly departed, robbed of thy promised hand. Now therefore, since thou findest thy fortune so abruptly changed and art fallen thus on evil days and hast no help, I will take thee hence and place thee in thy father's hands. For kinship hath strong claims, and in adversity there is naught better than a kinsman's kindly aid. </p>                        </div>
