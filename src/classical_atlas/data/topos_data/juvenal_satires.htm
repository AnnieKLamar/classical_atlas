When did the palm <br />Open wider to greed? When did gambling arouse greater <br />Passion? See, they don’t flock to the gaming tables now <br />With their purses: they place the family treasure and play. <br />What battles you’ll see there, the croupier bringing forth <br />Warriors! It’s quite mad to go losing a hundred thousand, <br />Surely, and yet to begrudge a shirt to a shivering slave? <br />Who of our ancestors built such villas, dined in private <br />On seven courses? Now the paltry handout-basket sits <br />On the doorstep, snatched at by a toga-clad mob, <br />As the patron first takes a nervous look at the faces, <br />Lest they’ve come to make false claim in another’s name: <br />Known, and you’re in. He even instructs the herald to call <br />The ‘<a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a>’ elite, they too vex the threshold among us <br />All. ‘Give first to the praetor, and then to the tribune.’ <br />But a freedman is first. ‘I was the first, here.’ he says. <br />‘Why should I fear, why should I hesitate, though I was <br />Born by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>? The effeminate holes in my ears <br />Would proclaim it, if I denied it. Yet my five taverns <br />Bring in four hundred thousand, what more can the purple <br />Provide?

On his whim hangs the fate of a friend, who simply <br />Wants to speak of rain, heat, or the poor spring weather. <br />Thus, <a href=/people/1533 target=_blank>Crispus</a> never extended his arms against the flood, <br />Not being the kind of citizen to dare to offer his thoughts <br />Freely, nor one to put his life at risk for the sake of truth. <br />That’s how he managed eighty summers and as many <br />Winters, protected by such armour even in that court. <br />Hurrying along with him came his peer, <a href=/people/584 target=_blank>Acilius</a> Aviola, <br />With a young son, <a href=/people/1243 target=_blank>Glabrio</a>, whom a cruel death awaited, <br />So swiftly dealt by the master’s sword; though it’s long <br />Been a miracle to survive to old age among the nobility, <br />Which is why I prefer to remain a nobody on this earth. <br />It only brought that youth misery to appear as a naked <br />Hunter in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=demonym long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alban</a> arena, tackling bears at close quarters. <br />Who, after all, isn’t wise to aristocratic arts these days? <br />Who’d be amazed at your pretences now Lucius <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>? <br />It was easier in those days to impose on a bearded king. <br />No less in appearance, despite his humble background <br />Came <a href=/people/1903 target=_blank>Rubrius</a> <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a>, guilty of an old unmentionable <br />Offence, yet more perverse than a pathic scribbling satire. <br /><a href=/people/3430 target=_blank>Montanus</a>’s belly was present too, with weighty paunch; <br />And <a href=/people/1397 target=_blank>Crispinus</a> drenched in that morning’s perfume, <br />Scarcely less odorous than a funeral cortege or two; more <br />Ruthless still, <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, men killed at his slightest whisper; <br /><a href=/people/3602 target=_blank>Fuscus</a> whose guts <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=place long=25 lat=44.5>Dacia</a>’s vultures were destined to enjoy, <br />And who meditated battles in his marble villa; prudent Veiiento, <br />In company with the deadly Lucius <a href=/people/1881 target=_blank>Catullus</a> <a href=/people/5788 target=_blank>Messalinus</a>, <br />Inflamed with passion for a girl he had never seen, <br />He’d be a great and notable monster even in our day, <br />A blind sycophant, and a terrifying hired accomplice, <br />Worthy to be one of those beggars blowing obsequious <br />Kisses at the wheels of your carriage on the hill at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAri class=place long=12.6704 lat=41.7197>Aricia</a>. <br />None was more impressed with the turbot; for he made <br />A long speech to his left, though the fish was on his right, <br />Which is how he used to praise the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=demonym long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilician</a> fist fights, <br />And the wires that whisk lads high up above the stage. <br />Veiiento not to be outdone, like your fanatics, <a href=/people/1127 target=_blank>Bellona</a>, <br />Goaded to ritual frenzy, prophesied: ‘Here is the mighty <br />Omen of a magnificent and glorious triumph to come. <br />You’ll net a king, or Arvigarus will fall from his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=demonym long=-1.5 lat=53>British</a><br />Chariot.’ ‘This fish is a new species: do you see the spikes <br />Bristling from its spine?’ The only thing <a href=/people/820 target=_blank>Fabricius</a> failed <br />To mention was the turbot’s place of birth, and its age. </p>                        </div>

And isn’t it true that the net-men don’t <br />Associate with the lowly amateurs, that the shoulder-guards <br />And tridents of naked warriors are never kept in the amateur’s <br />Equipment locker? There’s a lowest class for such people <br />In every school, and heavier fetters for them in every prison. <br />Yet your wife makes you share the goblet with such objects, <br />With whom a yellow-haired whore from a ruined tomb <br />Would refuse to drink, despite the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=demonym long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alban</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406144USur class=demonym long=14.3764 lat=40.6284>Surrentine</a> wine. <br />It’s on their advice that women suddenly marry or divorce. <br />It’s with them they share life’s boredoms and anxieties.

Yet he’s not always <br />To be trusted: a hair-netted adulterer he’ll paint his eyelids <br />With mascara, and strut around with his saffron gown undone. <br />You should be the more suspicious, the smoother his voice, <br />The more often his right hand lingers near his chubby loins. <br />He’ll prove virile enough in bed; there he’ll remove his mask, <br />An expert Triphallus, dancing the part of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>’s <a href=/people/2353 target=_blank>Thais</a>. <br />‘Who do you think you’re fooling?

It’s the very height <br />Of pleasure for them, when loins already ripe with youth’s hot <br />Blood and its dark plectrum, are dragged away to the surgeons. <br />That’s why the testicles are allowed to drop and develop first <br />And afterwards when they’ve achieved two pounds in weight, <br /><a href=/people/1203 target=_blank>Heliodorus</a> has them off, to the barber’s loss but no one else’s. <br />It’s a truer, more wretched debility the slave-dealer’s boys are <br />Seared by, left shamed by the purse and chickpeas that remain, <br />But the man made a eunuch by his mistress is noticed by all, <br />From afar, as he enters the baths, and there’s no doubt he can <br />Challenge <a href=/people/806 target=_blank>Priapus</a>, who’s the guardian of vineyard and garden. <br />He may sleep with his mistress, <a href=/people/2121 target=_blank>Postumus</a>, but don’t entrust your <br /><a href=/people/1553 target=_blank>Bromius</a>, once he’s no longer smooth and hairless, to that eunuch. <br />And women both high and low feel the same lust these days; <br />The woman who treads the dirty pavement in bare feet, she’s <br />No better than one who’s borne on the shoulders of tall Syrians. <br />Just to watch the Games, Ogulnia is forced to hire a dress, forced <br />To hire attendants, a chair, the cushions, even the female friends, <br />And a nurse, and a yellow-haired girl, whom she can order about, <br />Yet she chooses to give away whatever’s left of the family silver, <br />Down to the very last dish, as presents for smooth-skinned athletes. <br />Many are short of things for the house, but none feel any shame <br />About being poor, nor will they temper their habits to their means. <br />Their husbands sometimes look ahead, and feel forebodings of <br />Cold and hunger, learning at last that lesson taught by the ants: <br />But a spendthrift woman has no idea of diminishing resources. <br />She’ll give not a thought to the cost of her pleasures, as if coins <br />Forever reborn keep burgeoning from an empty treasure chest, <br />Forever available to be gathered from a newly-replenished heap. </p>                        </div>

Eventually, <br />She’ll uncover her face and remove the first few layers of stucco. <br />She begins to be recognisable, bathes like <a href=/people/3075 target=_blank>Poppaea</a> in <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a>’ milk, <br />To obtain which fluid she’d take the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> along in her entourage, <br />Even if she chanced to be banished to chill Hyperborean climes. <br />She’ll arrive at her lover’s with pristine skin.

If the husband’s slept <br />With his back turned all night, her lady-secretary is in for it, <br />The wardrobe-master had best remove the clothes, the Liburnian <br />Litter-slaves are told they’re late, they must pay for their master’s <br />Slumbers. Sticks are broken on one slave, the whip and the strap <br />Scorch others; some women pay their torturers an annual wage. <br />They’re lashed while she daubs, and listens to her girlfriends, <br />Or inspects the broad gold stripe on some embroidered dress, <br />They’re beaten, as she reads her long vertical scroll of accounts, <br />And beaten, until the beaters are weary, and she cries: ‘Away, <br />With them!’ in a dreadful voice, once justice has been exacted. <br />Her house regime is no less cruel than a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> tyrant’s court. <br />If she has an assignation and wants to be beautified to a higher <br />Standard than usual, hurrying to make a rendezvous in the park, <br />Or, more likely, at the sanctuary of that brothel-keeper <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>, <br />Unlucky Psecas, the slave-girl, will be doing her mistress’s hair, <br />With her own scalp torn, and her breasts and shoulders bared, <br />‘Why’s this curl sticking out?’ and the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>-hide strap is ready <br />To exact a swift penalty for the foul crime of a twisted ringlet. <br />Why is it Psecas’ fault? How can it be the slave-girl’s fault if <br />Your own nose displeases you? Meanwhile another slave on <br />Her left, draws out and combs the hair, and coils it into a bun. <br />She’ll seek the advice of a slave of her mother’s promoted to <br />Spinning wool, after long service at hairpins; it’s her opinion <br />That’s sought first, then her inferiors in age and skill will give <br />Their views, as if their mistress’s reputation were at stake, as if <br />Life itself were at stake: with so much anxiety, is beauty sought. <br />Her head is weighed down with layer on layer, tier after tier, <br />Piled high: it’s an <a href=/people/902 target=_blank>Andromache</a> you’ll see from the front, from <br />Behind someone altogether shorter. See, if you will, if she <br />Hasn’t been granted, sadly, hips and thighs of meagre extent, <br />And, without high-heeled boots, is as short as a Pigmy maiden, <br />See is she hasn’t to rise up on tiptoe to be able to plant a kiss. </p>                        </div>

If you visited <br />The great halls of the noblemen, the <a href=/people/7362 target=_blank>Barea</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431131UCam class=ethnic long=13.0669 lat=43.1344>Camerinii</a>, <br /><a href=/people/170 target=_blank>Pelops</a> and <a href=/people/1167 target=_blank>Philomela</a> appointed the prefects and tribunes. <br />But don’t go envying the poets such a theatre nourished. <br />Who now will be your <a href=/people/1293 target=_blank>Maecenas</a>, <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> or <a href=/people/2926 target=_blank>Proculeius</a>, <br />Who’ll prove your second <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a>, or be another <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>? <br />Then reward matched genius, many found it worthwhile <br />To look pale, and go without wine, for all of December. <br />SatVII: 98-149 Historians And Advocates Do No Better <br />Is your labour any more profitable, you writers of histories? <br />They too consume even more time, and more midnight oil. <br />There’s no limit to them, indeed, the thousandth page tops <br />The growing pile, bankrupts you with that heap of papyrus, <br />As the vast number of facts, and the laws of the genre dictate. <br />Yet what’s the harvest, what’s the fruit of your ploughed soil? <br />Who’ll pay a historian what they pay him who reads the news? <br />‘A lazy tribe,’ they’ll say, ‘who love their couch in the shade.’ <br />And tell me what advocates earn from their representations, <br />And the huge bundle of briefs that accompany them to court. <br />They talk big, especially when a creditor might hear them, <br />Or when one, more pressingly still, nudges them in the side, <br />Clutching his large account book, to claim some dubious debt. <br />That’s when their mighty bellows breathe out immense lies, <br />And they cover themselves with spit; but if you want to know <br />Their true harvest, the wealth of a hundred such advocates <br />Weighs less than that of Lizard, the charioteer of the Reds. <br />The lords are seated, and you rise, a pale <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>, to support <br />Your client’s contested liberty in front of a boorish judge. <br />Strain and rupture your liver, you wretch, so, exhausted, <br />You can decorate your stairs with victory’s green palm. <br />What’s the reward for your speech? A tiny dried-up leg <br />Of pork, a jar of <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a> fry, or ancient onions, a month’s <br />Ration for a Moor, or wine brought down the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, five <br />Flasks for your four cases. If you come by one gold piece, <br />Part of that vanishes, by your contract with the lawyers. <br />‘Yet <a href=/people/116 target=_blank>Aemilius</a> names his fee, even when our work’s better.’ <br />That’s because a bronze chariot with four great <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> sits <br />In his vestibule, his ancestor himself on a fierce charger, <br />Looking menacing from the high saddle, with lowered <br />Spear, a one-eyed statue contemplating battle. Thus <br />Pedo is embarrassed, and <a href=/people/3885 target=_blank>Matho</a> fails, and it’s the end <br />For Tongilius, who disturbs the baths with his filthy crew, <br />And washes away with his great rhinoceros horn, weighs <br />Down his young Maedians’ long litter-poles on his way <br />Through the Forum to buy slave-boys, silver plate, agate <br />Vases or villas; and yet his efforts work. His purple and <br />Violet robes sell advocacy; it pays him to live with a stir <br />And appearance, that cost well beyond his true income, <br />His seaborne purple of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=demonym long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrian</a> weave acts as guarantor. <br />But prodigal <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> sets no limits to your expenditure. <br />In eloquence our trust? No one these days would give <br />Cicero two hundred, unless a huge ring lit his finger. <br />The first thing a litigant looks for, is whether you run <br />Eight slaves, possess ten clients, a litter to follow you, <br />Togas to walk in front. That’s why <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> for court hired <br />A sardonyx ring, and earned a higher fee than <a href=/people/6129 target=_blank>Basilus</a>, or <br /><a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a>. <a href=/people/736 target=_blank>Eloquence</a> rarely appears dressed in flimsy rags. <br />When is <a href=/people/6129 target=_blank>Basilus</a> allowed to bring on a tearful mother? <br />Who can stand <a href=/people/6129 target=_blank>Basilus</a> however well he speaks? If you <br />Make the decision to earn your living with your tongue, <br />Try Gaul, or better still Africa, the nurturer of advocacy. <br />SatVII: 150-215 Nor Do Teachers Of Rhetoric <br />Do you teach rhetoric? O <a href=/people/1359 target=_blank>Vettius</a>, what a mind of iron, <br />You need, when a crowded class slays ‘the cruel tyrant!’ <br />For, whatever they’ve just read, sitting, each in turn <br />Gives standing, chants the same thing in identical lines. <br />Such stale greens are simply murder for the poor teacher. <br />They all want to know about style, what sort of cases, <br />And the summing up, and the shots that are likely to be <br />Fired by the other side, but not a single one wants to pay. <br />‘You’re asking me to pay? But what have I learned?’ <br />‘It’s surely the teacher’s fault, if our young dunce feels <br />Nothing stir in the left side of his chest, as he fills my <br />Poor head for five days with his ‘dreadful <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>’. <br />It hardly matters what the set topic is: whether to march <br />From <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413162UCan class=place long=16.1515 lat=41.2964>Cannae</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, or after the thunder and lightning <br />Cautiously hold the troops back, drenched from the storm. <br />Just state your price, you can have it now: what wouldn’t <br />I give to make the father hear him as often I must?’ That’s <br />What six professors or more cry out with a single voice, <br />As they abandon ‘the rapist’ to take part in some real case; <br />The ‘dosing with poison’ is silent; the ‘wicked ungrateful <br />Husband’; the pounding out of a ‘cure for chronic blindness’. <br />So whoever descends from the grove of rhetoric to compete <br />In the fight, lest he lose the he pitiful reward that purchases <br />His ticket for the handout, which after all is the most he can <br />Expect, if he’ll follow my advice, he should definitely retire <br />And find himself an alternative path in life. If you discover <br />The tiny fee for which <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a> or <a href=/people/701 target=_blank>Pollio</a> teach the sons <br />Of the rich, you’ll tear <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a>’s Rhetoric in tiny pieces. <br />Building the nobleman’s baths costs him six thousand in gold, <br />More for the portico where he rides on rainy days. How can <br />He wait for blue skies, or spatter his equipage with fresh mud! <br />It’s better here, the hooves of his mule stay bright and clean. <br />And he’ll raise a dining hall elsewhere, resting on tall pillars <br />Made of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=demonym long=3 lat=36>Numidian</a> marble, trapping sunshine when it’s cold. <br />However much the place costs, someone will still be there to <br />Arrange the dishes skilfully, someone there to spice the food. <br />Twenty gold pieces, of all this show, will be fortune enough <br />For Quintilian: a son will cost his father less than nothing. <br />‘So how come Quintilian owns so much land?’ You have to <br />Make an exception for freaks of fate. The fortunate man is <br />Handsome and brave, wise and noble and generous as well, <br />On his black shoe is sewn the ivory crescent of the patrician. <br />The fortunate man is the greatest orator and javelin-thrower, <br />And, unless he has a cold, sings beautifully. It makes a huge <br />Difference you know what stars chance to greet you as you <br />Give your first cries, red-faced from your mother’s womb. <br />If <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> wishes, she’ll make a teacher of rhetoric, consul; <br />If she wishes, she’ll make a consul a teacher of rhetoric too. <br />What about <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>? <a href=/people/766 target=_blank>Ventidius</a> <a href=/people/837 target=_blank>Bassus</a>? What else <br />Was that but the stars, the strange mysterious power of fate? <br /><a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a> makes kings of slaves, and grants prisoners triumphs. <br />Nevertheless the fortunate man is rarer than a white <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>. <br />Many teachers have regretted their idle and barren chairs <br />Of Rhetoric, as <a href=/people/2073 target=_blank>Thrasymachus</a>’ suicide proves, and <a href=/people/7440 target=_blank>Carrinas</a><br /><a href=/people/1174 target=_blank>Secundus</a>’: you saw his poverty, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, yet only chose <br />To offer him cold hemlock. May the gods make the earth <br />On our ancestor’s graves weigh lightly, may they have <br />Flowering crocuses, and everlasting spring, in the tomb. <br />They thought a teacher held the sacred role of a parent. <br />When <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> as a young man learnt music in his native <br />Hills, he went in fear of the cane, and was careful not to <br />Mock at the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>’s tail of <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Chiron</a> the Centaur, his teacher; <br />But now <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a> and the rest are beaten by their young pupils, <br /><a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a>, so often called a <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, though only a Gallic one. <br />SatVII: 216-243 Or Schoolmasters <br />When do Celadus, and learned <a href=/people/10896 target=_blank>Palaemon</a>, pocket the rewards <br />A schoolteacher’s labour merits? Yet whatever it amounts to, <br />And it’s less than a teacher of rhetoric’s pay, even from that <br />The pupil’s unfeeling attendant nibbles a chunk for himself <br />As does the cashier who pays it. Yield to them, <a href=/people/10896 target=_blank>Palaemon</a>, <br />Be prepared to see some part of it vanish, as a pedlar does <br />When he haggles over a mat and a snow-white quilt for winter. <br />But make sure you get something, for sitting from midnight <br />Onwards where no blacksmith would sit, or a carder of wool <br />Used to drawing the staple out fine with a slant steel comb; <br />Make sure you get something, for breathing in the stench <br />Of as many lamps as boys, while your <a href=/people/3856 target=_blank>Horace</a> grows wholly <br />Discoloured, and soot clings tight to your blackened <a href=/people/118 target=_blank>Virgil</a>. <br />Though it’s rare to get paid without a tribune’s investigation. <br />Yet you parents lay down savage laws for the schoolmaster, <br />Demand he should stick to the rules in his use of grammar, <br />Should read the histories, and know all the authors as well <br />As he knows his fingernails. If by chance he’s asked a question <br />As he heads for the warm baths or the freeman <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a>’s spa, <br />He must know the name of <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a>’ nurse, of Anchemolus’s <br />Stepmother, and her birthplace, how many years <a href=/people/1149 target=_blank>Acestes</a> lived, <br />And how many jars of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> wine he handed to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a>. <br />You’ll demand he forms tender characters under his thumb, <br />As if he were moulding faces from wax; you’ll demand he acts <br />Like a father to that crowd, forbids them to play dubious games, <br />Or mutually indulge. It’s no light thing to keep watch on all <br />Those boys, with their hands and eyes quivering with purpose. <br />‘That’s your job,’ the parents say, yet come the turn of the year <br />You’ll get, in gold, what the crowd grants for one gladiatorial win. </p>                        </div>

Then, driven by necessity he resorted to <br />Taking a blade to the mast, so as to extricate himself from <br />His narrow strait: taking that ultimate risk, where the remedy <br />We adopt makes the vessel we’re journeying in even weaker. <br />Away then, commit your life to the winds, rely on a broken <br />Plank, four inches of pinewood away from death, or perhaps <br />Seven inches away from death, if the planking is extra thick; <br />And remember next time, along with your nets full of bread <br />And the bellied flagons, to take some axes for use in a storm. <br />But once the waves died down, and the passengers’ state <br />Improved, and destiny triumphed over the wind and sea; <br />Once the Fates began to weave a stronger thread, benign <br />Hands happily winding white wool into the yarn; and once <br />The wind arose, though no more than the lightest breeze, <br />The wretched vessel, ran on, its manoeuvrability impaired, <br />Every cloth spread to the wind, with the one remaining sail. <br />Now that the fierce southerly winds were abating, the sun <br />Returned bringing fresh hope of survival. Then the heights <br />Of Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=place long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alba</a>, loved by <a href=/people/1160 target=_blank>Iulus</a>, <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>’ son, and preferred <br />By him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417125ULav class=place long=12.4793 lat=41.6564>Lavinium</a>, his stepmother’s city, came in view, <br />Its peak named for the white <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> whose litter amazed the <br />Delighted <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a>, and the novel sight of her thirty teats. <br />At last the ship passed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscan</a> lighthouse and entered <br />The breakwaters of <a href=/people/2922 target=_blank>Portus</a> Augusti, that quiet the waves, <br />Those arms that leave <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>’s shore, stretch out and meet, <br />In the sea; no ancient harbour created by nature is more <br />Impressive. Then the master steered his crippled vessel <br />Into the inner roads of the harbour, so sheltered a pleasure <br />Boat from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PBai class=place long=14.0699 lat=40.8178>Baiae</a> could cross, where sailors, heads shaved <br />To fulfil their vow, tell, in safety, garrulous tales of peril. <br /></p>                        </div>

Yet hear this <br />Instance of savage barbarism, one that occurred in our own times. <br />Between two neighbouring towns on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/261326UTen class=place long=32.6701 lat=26.1418>Tentyra</a><br />And <a about=https://topostext.org/place/244329UOmb class=place long=32.9282 lat=24.4521>Ombos</a>, there flamed an ancient and enduring feud, <br />An undying hatred, an open wound, not amenable to being healed. <br />The fury of the people had been roused, on both sides, because each <br />Loathed their neighbour’s gods, considering those they worshipped <br />Themselves the only true divinities. So, when a sacred festival, was <br />Held by one tribe, the other’s chieftains and elders, decided as one <br />To seize this opportunity, and prevent their enemies from enjoying <br />The celebratory happiness of the day, and the delights of a banquet, <br />With tables positioned by the temples, at the crossroads, with their <br />Dining couches, often in continuous use all day and night, until the <br />Seventh dawn lights them. (The native <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> may be uncouth, <br />But as far as I can tell myself, scandalous <a about=https://topostext.org/place/313300UCan class=place long=30.0772 lat=31.3107>Canopus</a>, in its civilised <br />Extravagance, more than matches that of these barbarous masses.) <br />Added to which victory seemed certain over feasters, inarticulate <br />And staggering drunkenly with wine. On one side were dancers, <br />Men swaying to the sounds of a dark-skinned piper, with flowers, <br />Perfumes, in all their variety, their brows all wreathed in garlands: <br />On the other savage hatred. First they begin with sonorous insults: <br />With tempers blazing, these are the bugle-calls to start the brawl. <br />Then both sides come together with a cry, using their naked hands <br />As weapons. Scarcely a jaw remains unwounded, it’s hard to find <br />Any visage, perhaps there’s none, that’s lacking some nasal injury. <br />Already, throughout the ranks, mutilated faces are to be seen, <br />Features distorted, the bones gaping whitely through torn cheeks, <br />Or fists covered with blood from damaged eyes. Yet they realise <br />This is still some sort of puerile game, a childish attempt at battle, <br />Since there are no corpses yet to trample, and what’s the point <br />After all, of a fighting mob that’s thousands strong, if everyone <br />Emerges from this alive? So the fighting grows fiercer, and now <br />They start to gather stones from the ground, and bending their <br />Arms back, begin to hurl them; these the home-grown missiles <br />Rioters use, not the rocks that <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> or <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> wielded, nor as <br />Heavy as the one with which <a href=/people/1525 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> struck <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> on the hip, <br />Merely the sort of stones a strength inferior to theirs, belonging <br />To those born in our times, can manage to lift high and launch. <br />For the human race was already in decline when <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> lived. <br />Now the earth produces men who are sinful but worthless, <br />Such that any god who saw them, would laugh, in derision. <br />Let me turn back to my tale. The one side, having gathered <br />Reinforcements, dared to take up their weapons and renew <br />The fierce fight, sending a hail of hostile arrows, into the air. <br />Chased by the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/244329UOmb class=place long=32.9282 lat=24.4521>Ombos</a>, those of Dendera, that town <br />Blessed by the palm-trees’ shade, turned their backs in swift <br />Retreat. One man, in panic, slipped as he fled, fell precipitately, <br />And was captured. He was immediately chopped in a hundred <br />Pieces, one man providing enough substance to feed the mob, <br />Who triumphantly devoured him, even gnawing at his bones, <br />Thinking it far too tedious a wait to barbecue him, or cook <br />Him in a pot over a blazing fire, content to eat the body raw. <br />I’d like to celebrate the fact, though, that they chose not to <br />Desecrate your gift to the world, <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a>, the fire you <br />Stole from highest heaven. My congratulations to that fierce <br />Element: that delights me too. Yet no cannibals that chew <br />Human flesh, ever dined on any other corpse more willingly. <br />Lest you ask, or are in doubt, about the perpetrators of that <br />Crime, let me say it was not merely the first who dined well, <br />But the very last spectator, also, seeing the whole body quite <br />Consumed, drew his fingers over the ground to taste the blood. </p>                        </div>

There’s no more desirable gift the gods can grant <br />Than to join a successful unit, one blessed with good luck. <br />I wouldn’t mind being a nervous recruit at that camp gate, <br />Under its auspicious stars. The hour of benign fate, after <br />All, is even more powerful than a recommendation to <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a><br />From <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>, or <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>, his mother, whom <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269SHer class=place long=26.8857 lat=37.6718>Samos</a> delights. <br />Let me first deal with the benefits enjoyed by all soldiers, <br />Not the least being that no civilian will dare to assault you, <br />Rather if he’s beaten himself, he’ll give out that he wasn’t, <br />Reluctant to show the praetor his missing teeth, the lumps <br />On his face, the black swollen bruises, and the eye he has <br />Still retained, although the doctor’s making no promises. <br />If he seeks redress for it, he’ll get a hobnailed boot for a <br />Judge, and swollen calf-muscles lining the wide bench, <br />Since the old military law, the rules of <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a>, are <br />Still in force, and soldiers can’t attend court outside the <br />Camp, away from the standard. ‘A centurion’s military <br />Enquiry is totally fair,’ you’ll say ‘and I shall have my <br />Revenge, if, as in my case, it’s a well- proven complaint.’ <br />But the entire division is hostile, and all the units will act <br />As one to ensure your redress is troublesome, and worse <br />Than the injury incurred. It would be worthy, therefore, <br />Of Vagellius’ the blusterer’s mulish mind, for your two <br />Legs alone to offend all those heavy boots, with their <br />Thousands of nails. Besides who would accompany you <br />So far from the city, who’d be your <a href=/people/663 target=_blank>Pylades</a> and venture <br />Beyond the massive Embankment? Let your tears cease, <br />And don’t bother friends who’ll only make their excuses. <br />When the judge says ‘Call the witness!’ if the man who <br />Saw the assault has the nerve to say, ‘I saw it,’ he’ll be <br />Worthy of the long hair and beard of one of our honest <br />Ancestors. It’s easier to find a false witness against a <br />Civilian than one who’ll tell a truth that reflects badly <br />On a military man’s honour, and his superior status. <br />Now let’s note the other rewards and benefits of taking <br />The military oath. Imagine some devious neighbour has <br />Stolen a valley, some tract of land from my family estate, <br />Rooting out the sacred stone at the heart of the boundary, <br />That I honour, at the Terminalia, with cakes and polenta, <br />Or that a debtor continually refuses to repay me a loan, <br />Claiming his signature’s forged, my document worthless, <br />Then I’m forced to wait for the sessions, when the whole <br />World files its suits; and then accept a thousand delays <br />And frustrations. Often, though we’re all ready, we have <br />To disperse, because the benches aren’t there, eloquent <br /><a href=/people/4907 target=_blank>Caedicius</a> is still in his cloak, <a href=/people/3602 target=_blank>Fuscus</a> is passing water, <br />That’s how we fight each other in the Forum’s soft sand. <br />But those who wear armour, and hang a sword by their <br />Side, have the hours of their hearings adjusted to suit, <br />Their money not wasted on some never-ending case. <br />Plus, it’s only soldiers who’ve the right to cash earned <br />While their fathers still live, For it’s held that wealth <br />Acquired in the service should not form part of that <br />Which the father wholly controls. So Coranus who <br />Follows the standard, and garners a soldier’s pay, <br />Is courted by his own doddering parent. The son is <br />Duly promoted, and earns the reward for his efforts. <br />To the general no doubt it seems crucial that a brave <br />Man, should also be rendered the most successful, <br />That those who delight in medals and decorations... </p>                        </div>
