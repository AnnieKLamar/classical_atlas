After many centuries the tomb of <a href=/people/1688 target=_blank>Dictys</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353252PKno class=place long=25.1631 lat=35.2978>Cnossos</a> (formerly the seat of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> king) collapsed with age. Then shepherds, wandering near the ruins, stumbled upon a little box skilfully enclosed in tin. Thinking it was treasure, they soon broke it open, but brought to light, instead of gold or some other kind of wealth, books written on linden tablets. Their hopes thus frustrated, they took their find to Praxis, the owner of that place. Praxis had the books transliterated into the Attic alphabet (the language was Greek) and presented them to the Roman Emperor <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>. <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> rewarded him richly. When these little books had by chance come into my hands, I, as a student of true history, was seized with the desire of making a free translation into Latin; I felt I had no special talent but wanted only to occupy my leisure time. I have preserved without abridgment the first five volumes which deal with the happenings of the War, but have reduced into one volume the others which are concerned with the Return of the Greeks. Thus, my <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a>, I have sent them to you. Favor my work as it deserves, and in reading <a href=/people/1688 target=_blank>Dictys</a> . . . PREFACE <a href=/people/1688 target=_blank>Dictys</a>, a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353252PKno class=place long=25.1631 lat=35.2978>Cnossos</a> and a contemporary of the <a href=/people/1152 target=_blank>Atreidae</a>, knew the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> language and alphabet, which <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a> brought to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=place long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaea</a>. He accompanied the leaders <a href=/people/291 target=_blank>Idomeneus</a> and <a href=/people/608 target=_blank>Meriones</a> with the army that went against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. (<a href=/people/291 target=_blank>Idomeneus</a> and <a href=/people/608 target=_blank>Meriones</a> were the sons of <a href=/people/10993 target=_blank>Deucalion</a> and <a href=/people/2807 target=_blank>Molus</a> respectively.) They chose him to write down a history of this campaign. Accordingly, writing on linden tablets and using the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> alphabet, he composed nine volumes about the whole war. Time passed. In the thirteenth year of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>'s reign an earthquake struck at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353252PKno class=place long=25.1631 lat=35.2978>Cnossos</a> and, in the course of its devastation, laid open the tomb of <a href=/people/1688 target=_blank>Dictys</a> in such a way that people, as they passed, could see the little box. And so shepherds who had seen it as they passed stole it from the tomb, thinking it was treasure. But when they opened it and found the linden tablets inscribed with characters unknown to them, they took this find to their master. Their master, whose name was <a href=/people/7671 target=_blank>Eupraxides</a>, recognized the characters, and presented the books to <a href=/people/1250 target=_blank>Rutilius</a> <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a>, who was at that time governor of the island. Since <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a>, when the books had been presented to him, thought they contained certain mysteries, he, along with <a href=/people/7671 target=_blank>Eupraxides</a> himself, carried them to <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>. <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, having received the tablets and having noticed that they were written in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> alphabet, ordered his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> philologists to come and decipher whatever was written. When this had been done, since he realized that these were the records of an ancient man who had been at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, he had them translated into Greek; thus a more accurate text of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> War was made known to all. Then he bestowed gifts and Roman citizenship upon <a href=/people/7671 target=_blank>Eupraxides</a>, and sent him home. The Greek Library, according to <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>'s command, acquired this history that <a href=/people/1688 target=_blank>Dictys</a> had written, the contents of which the following text sets forth in order. </p>                        </div>

Everything was to be equally divided among them, excepting only the rule of his cities and lands.

Soon afterwards, either because of heavenly wrath or atmospheric contamination, a plague began to attack us. Day after day it raged with greater and greater violence, destroying many thousands as it passed indiscriminately through herds and army, laying waste everything that stood in its way, there being no abatement, no end to death. While our leaders were seeking some remedy, a certain woman, divinely inspired, revealed the reason for our affliction: the wrath of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a>; the goddess was exacting punishment from the army for the sacrilege of slaying the she-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> in which she especially delighted, nor would she relent until the perpetrator of this awful crime had made full atonement by sacrificing his oldest daughter. When this solution was brought to the army, all of our leaders approached <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>. Begging and then threatening, they tried to make him offer the remedy quickly, but he obstinately and absolutely refused. And so they reviled him and finally stripped him of his command. But in order that their huge army, being leaderless, might not become an undisciplined mob, they chose four men to share the command: <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>, <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a>, <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> the son of <a href=/people/258 target=_blank>Telamon</a>, and <a href=/people/291 target=_blank>Idomeneus</a>.

The gist of this letter was as follows: <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> refused to sail for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> until he had married their oldest daughter, <a href=/people/708 target=_blank>Iphigenia</a>, whom they had promised to him; therefore, she should send <a href=/people/708 target=_blank>Iphigenia</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384236UAul class=place long=23.5925 lat=38.4335>Aulis</a>, along with the dowry, as quickly as possible.

Within a few days he returned to the camp and appeared unexpectedly with the girl in the grove of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a>. When <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> knew what had happened, he wanted to flee, either because of his love for his daughter or because he wanted no part in so criminal a sacrifice. <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>, however, learned of his plans and, in a long speech, by means of that art of persuasion in which he was more pleasing and effective than anyone else in Greece, prevailed upon him to stay. </p>                        </div>

What had happened, he said, was not his fault, but theirs. He had not know that they who had come were closest friends and cherished relatives. They should have sent ahead messengers to announce their arrival, and he would have gone and met them, bidden them welcome, and made them at home; they would have been his guests, and he would have sent them off with gifts when they thought they must go. As for the expedition against <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>, he refused to take part; he was prevented by the closest bonds of kinship, for his wife <a href=/people/3119 target=_blank>Astyoche</a>, the mother of his son <a href=/people/665 target=_blank>Eurypylus</a>, was one of <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>'s daughters. Then he quickly commanded that his people be told to stop preparing for war and freely granted our men the right to debark. <a href=/people/1924 target=_blank>Tlepolemus</a> and the other envoys were put in the care of <a href=/people/665 target=_blank>Eurypylus</a>; and thus, their mission accomplished, they returned to the ships to tell <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> and the other nobles about the peace and concord with <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephus</a>. </p>                        </div>

But before he could reach the temple, the two <a href=/people/3322 target=_blank>Ajaxes</a> killed a great number of his men and put him to flight. <a href=/people/1324 target=_blank>Chryses</a> (who, as we have said above, was the priest of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395261USmi class=person long=26.117 lat=39.536>Sminthian</a> <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>) feared harm from both armies and pretended to favour those from each side who approached him. During the sacrifice, <a href=/people/448 target=_blank>Philoctetes</a>, who was standing in the temple near the altar, was suddenly bitten by a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>. Everyone who saw what had happened raised a shout, and <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> rushed forward and slew the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>.

As soon as <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had attacked and insulted the Greeks, we did not yield to temptation and hasten to arms.

But we got nothing from <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> and his princes, nothing but haughty, threatening words and hidden treacheries. Therefore, with the failure of our mission, it was to be expected, I think, that we should take up arms and obtain by force what we had been unable to get by friendly means.

Finally this silence was broken by <a href=/people/2909 target=_blank>Panthus</a>, who said in a loud voice: <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> you are addressing people who are unable to do as they please. We are unable to remedy this situation. And next <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a> said: Since we are wise and prudent men, we grant you everything you say; and if we had the power, we would advise accordingly. But, as you see, others with whom personal greed counts more than the common welfare are in control of our state. Then <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a> ordered the leaders of the foreign forces to be introduced: those who had come because of their treaties with <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>, and those who were hired mercenaries. When these had been introduced, <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> made a second speech. They were all, he said, the wickedest men. They were no different from <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, who was the worst of criminals, for they had deserted the good and the true to follow him. Each of them knew that if they approved of this terrible crime they would be setting an evil example which, being disseminated especially through the peoples nearby, would serve as a model for similar or even more sorrowful acts. Then each of the elders silently pondered how terrible might be the results of this horrible crime. Being moved to disgust and shrinking from their own evil example, they went on record, voting in their usual way, that <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> had suffered injustice. Only <a href=/people/2815 target=_blank>Antimachus</a>, opposing everyone else, voted in <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s behalf. Thereupon they chose two men to go and tell <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> about all that had happened.

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> should learn from this example and fear that the neighboring regions might enter into similar schemes and plot the destruction of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>.

On hearing this, <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a> was saddened and wept, remembering his brother's crime.

If, however, the envoys would enumerate the various articles that had been carried off with <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>, all of these things, he thought, should be returned.

They also were informed that those of us who were left were growing weak as the plague proceeded to rage. Accordingly, exhorting each other and taking up arms, they rushed from the gates along with their allies and made an attack. Their forces were arranged in the plain in two divisions: <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a> was leading the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a>, <a href=/people/1279 target=_blank>Sarpedon</a> the allies.

And this caused <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> to fear he might lose his glorious position. Speaking in the council, he said that he was deeply concerned for the welfare of the army and that <a href=/people/3738 target=_blank>Astynome</a>, without any further delay, should be returned to her father, especially if thus we would rid ourselves of the plague. He asked only to be given <a href=/people/1389 target=_blank>Hippodamia</a>, the bond-maid of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, to take the place of the prize he was losing. Although everyone thought his request was mean and dishonorable, nevertheless we were moved to grant it. As for <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, to whom <a href=/people/1389 target=_blank>Hippodamia</a> had been given because of his many marvellous deeds, he showed no signs of his feelings; so great was the love and concern for our army in the heart of this excellent youth. Thus <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> was flouting everyone's wishes, but since no one openly opposed him, he thought that he had our unanimous approval. Accordingly, he ordered attendants to fetch <a href=/people/1389 target=_blank>Hippodamia</a>; and they were prompt to obey. At the same time we had <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> and <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> take <a href=/people/3738 target=_blank>Astynome</a>, along with a great number of sacrificial victims, across to the shrine of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>. When these had completed the sacrifice, the force of the plague gradually seemed to abate. People were no longer becoming ill, and those who were already inflicted seemed to improve, as if their prayers had been divinely answered.

He said that it had been the will of the gods for him to go to war. The gods were the authors of good and evil for every mortal; so long as he had been permitted to be happy, the might of none of his enemies had succeeded against him. He who had fathered fifty sons by different mothers had been considered the most blessed of all kings, until the birth of the youngest, <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. He had been unable to avoid the future, even though the gods had revealed the events that <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Alexander</a> would cause. When <a href=/people/2138 target=_blank>Hecuba</a> was pregnant, she had told him how she had dreamt of a torch in whose flames Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397268LIda class=place long=26.8423 lat=39.6922>Ida</a> and then, as the fire continued, the shrines of the gods and finally the whole state had been consumed, excepting only the homes of <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a> and <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a>. The interpreters had said that this dream portended the fall of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. Accordingly, they had decided to kill the baby at birth. But <a href=/people/2138 target=_blank>Hecuba</a>, with a woman's tenderness toward her child, had given him secretly to shepherds to rear on Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397268LIda class=place long=26.8423 lat=39.6922>Ida</a>. When he was grown, and they knew what had happened, he was so handsome that no one, not even his fiercest enemy, could bear to kill him. Then he had married <a href=/people/2958 target=_blank>Oinone</a>. Soon, however, having been seized with a desire of seeing faraway regions and kingdoms, he had gone on that journey on which he carried off <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>; some god was urging him, driving him on.

Not even the thought of the deaths of their sons and relatives could persuade them to reject her. Only <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a>, his wisest counselor in peace and war, was for this; <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a>, in the beginning, when <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Alexander</a> returned from Greece, even disowned his own son, <a href=/people/1197 target=_blank>Glaucus</a>, because he had gone along on that journey. Now <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> was being destroyed and he, the king, was near to death.

While they were eating, they praised the prowess of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> and told <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a> about the numerous brave deeds of his father. Their words delighted him and moved him to say that he would strive, with might and main, to prove himself a worthy son. After the dinner was over, they left to spend the night in their huts. At dawn the next day <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a>, on leaving camp, was met by <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> and <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>.

Then all our leaders and kings, having armed our men and set them in order, went out to battle. <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a> commanded the center. With him were the <a href=/people/3641 target=_blank>Myrmidones</a> and also <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> (whom <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a>, as befitted their close relationship, honored in place of his father). The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> were very upset, for they saw that, while their own allies were daily defecting, a new contingent, led by an illustrious leader, had come to the aid of the Greeks. Nevertheless, they took up arms, as <a href=/people/665 target=_blank>Eurypylus</a> urged them to do. He, having gained the support of the princes, created a combined force consisting of his own men and those of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> and, leading them out of the gate, deployed them for battle; he himself commanded the center. (<a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> stayed behind in the city and, for the first time, refused to fight; he was a devoted worshiper of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> and detested the crime <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had committed against this god.) When the signal for battle was given, the two sides clashed and fought with all their might; great numbers were slain. <a href=/people/665 target=_blank>Eurypylus</a>, chancing upon <a href=/people/1863 target=_blank>Peneleus</a>, drove him back and pinned him with his spear; then he attacked <a href=/people/1977 target=_blank>Nireus</a> even more savagely, and cut him down; and finally, having put to flight our men in front, he was fighting in the very midst of our forces. But <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a>, on seeing this, drove up close and knocked <a href=/people/665 target=_blank>Eurypylus</a> out of his chariot; then he dismounted himself and, sword in hand, quickly finished <a href=/people/665 target=_blank>Eurypylus</a> off. Thereupon our men, as <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a> ordered, carried the body out of the battle and back to the ships. When the barbarians — they had placed all their hopes in <a href=/people/665 target=_blank>Eurypylus</a> — saw this sight, they deserted the battle and fled for the walls, leaderless, without any definite order. And as they fled, great numbers were killed. </p>                        </div>

Then, the council so willing, we cremated <a href=/people/665 target=_blank>Eurypylus</a> and sent his bones, in an urn, back to his father, for we remembered his father's kindness and friendship. Also, there were separate funerals for <a href=/people/1977 target=_blank>Nireus</a> and <a href=/people/1863 target=_blank>Peneleus</a>; each was cremated by his own people.

Accordingly, we sent <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> and <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> to fetch him. After these had promised him leave to spend the rest of his life somewhere in seclusion, he placed himself in their power. When he had been brought to the ships, he made a long speech at a meeting of the council, in which he told his reason for leaving his parents and people: he feared not death but the gods, whose shrines <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had desecrated, a crime which neither <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> nor himself was able to bear. As for <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, he, fearing our anger, had stayed behind with <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a> and old <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a>, his father. It was from an oracle of <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a>, <a href=/people/515 target=_blank>Helenus</a> said, that he had learned of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>'s imminent fall, and thus had made up his mind to come to us as a suppliant.

Accordingly, <a href=/people/1324 target=_blank>Chryses</a>, having nodded for us to keep silent, took <a href=/people/515 target=_blank>Helenus</a> aside and learned everything, which then he reported to us. Thus we were informed of the very time of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>'s fall and how <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> and <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a> would help us.

Accordingly, they plotted sedition against the princes and <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>. Having summoned <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> and the sons of <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a>, they were planning to return <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> to <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, along with the things that had been carried off.

Thus he came to the ships, and we welcomed him gladly. <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>, especially, told how faithful and kind he had been to the Greeks: his counsel and the aid of his sons had saved <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> treachery.

Then, in a long speech, <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a> told how the gods were always punishing <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> rulers for ill-considered acts. <a href=/people/1277 target=_blank>Laomedon</a>, he said, had lied to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> — a famous story — and thus his kingdom had been destroyed. Then, through the influence of <a href=/people/1581 target=_blank>Hesione</a>, <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>, who was still young and had had no share in all that had happened, had come to power; thereafter, becoming evil and foolish, he had been accustomed to attack everyone; he had killed and committed personal injuries, being sparing of his own property while seeking that of another. Such was the example which spread, like the worst of plagues, to his sons, who abstained from nothing either sacred or profane. <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a> said that he himself was a very different person from <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>, in spite of the fact that they both were related to the Greeks by the same line of descent. <a href=/people/1581 target=_blank>Hesione</a>, the daughter of <a href=/people/303 target=_blank>Danaus</a>, was the mother of <a href=/people/388 target=_blank>Electra</a>, and <a href=/people/388 target=_blank>Electra</a> was the mother of <a href=/people/1325 target=_blank>Dardanus</a>; <a href=/people/1325 target=_blank>Dardanus</a> had married <a href=/people/9922 target=_blank>Olizone</a>, the daughter of <a href=/people/615 target=_blank>Phineus</a>; their child was <a href=/people/913 target=_blank>Erichthonius</a>, who was the father of <a href=/people/1235 target=_blank>Tros</a>; and <a href=/people/1235 target=_blank>Tros</a> was the father of <a href=/people/995 target=_blank>Ilus</a>, <a href=/people/1283 target=_blank>Ganymede</a>, and <a href=/people/7057 target=_blank>Cleomestra</a>. <a href=/people/7057 target=_blank>Cleomestra</a> was the mother of <a href=/people/1415 target=_blank>Assaracus</a>, and <a href=/people/1415 target=_blank>Assaracus</a> had begotten <a href=/people/1378 target=_blank>Capys</a>, the father of <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a>. <a href=/people/995 target=_blank>Ilus</a> had begotten <a href=/people/5362 target=_blank>Tithonus</a> and <a href=/people/1277 target=_blank>Laomedon</a>, and <a href=/people/1277 target=_blank>Laomedon</a> was the father of <a href=/people/3311 target=_blank>Hicetaon</a>, <a href=/people/2804 target=_blank>Lampus</a>, <a href=/people/2577 target=_blank>Thymoetes</a>, <a href=/people/3303 target=_blank>Bucolion</a>, and finally <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>.

But <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> had disregarded every bond of kinship and had acted with especial insolence and hatred toward his own relations. When he had finished this speech, he asked us to choose representatives for the purpose of talking with him about peace; as this was the reason the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> elders had sent him.

Thereupon these plotted together, in secret, and decided, among other things, that <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, contingent upon his remaining faithful, should share the spoils, nor should his house be harmed in any way; as for <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a>, half of <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>'s wealth should be given to him; and one of his sons, whomever he chose, should rule over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. When they felt that their plans were complete, <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a> was sent back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> to make a report far different from what they had really decided.

But <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a> postponed his report until the next day, and so they dispersed and went home. Then, at a banquet, in the presence of <a href=/people/5995 target=_blank>Talthybius</a>, <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a> advised his sons to consider nothing so important in life as their long-standing friendship with Greece and recalled, with evident admiration, the honor, good faith, and guilelessness of individual Greeks. After the meal, they parted company. But at daybreak <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a> and <a href=/people/5995 target=_blank>Talthybius</a> went to the meeting of the council.

If I may briefly touch on the past evils we have suffered, when has our city ever found rest, once it was lost in this quagmire of sorrows? When have we ever been without tears? When have you allies ever seen your misfortunes decrease? When have our friends, parents, relatives, and sons not been dying in battle? And, to sum up the rest of our sorrows with a personal allusion, what suffering have I not endured in the case of <a href=/people/1197 target=_blank>Glaucus</a>, my son? His death, however, was not so painful to me as the fact that he had accompanied <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Alexander</a> in the abduction of <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>. But enough of the past. Let us, at least, look to the future with caution and wisdom. The Greeks are faithful and true; they are rich in kindness and pious in doing their duty. <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> is a witness to this, for, in the very heat of the battle, he reaped the fruit of their pity. The Greeks were not so rash as to declare war against us until we had treated their envoys — even their envoys! — with treachery and guile. It is my opinion that <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> and his sons were to blame in this matter, and also <a href=/people/2815 target=_blank>Antimachus</a>, who has recently paid for his guilt with the loss of his sons. But the real blame for everything that has happened rests upon <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>, that woman whom not even the Greeks really want to recover. Why should we keep this woman on whose account no nation, no people, has ever been friendly or even non-hostile to us? Shall we not, rather, eagerly beg the Greeks to take her again? And shall we not offer complete compensation for all the ways we have harmed them? Shall we not be reconciled with such men at least in the future? For my own part, I am leaving; I am going away. I refuse to share in these crimes any longer. There was a time when it was pleasing to live in this city; until now we had allies and friends; our relatives were safe, our country unharmed. But now we have partially or totally lost all of these things. Who can deny it? I can no longer endure to remain with those whose work is all destined to ruin along with the fall of their country. Until now, it is true, we have found some way to bury our dead; the enemy granted this favor. But now the altars and shrines of the gods have been criminally desecrated with human blood. And thus, being unable to hold our dear ones' funerals, we will suffer even more than when they died. At least prevent this from happening now. Our native land must be redeemed with gold and other ransom of this sort. There are many in our city who are rich; each must give whatever he can. We must offer the Greeks, in return for our lives, what they will have soon enough if they kill us. Let us give even the ornaments of our temples, if otherwise we cannot save our city. As for <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>, let only him keep all his wealth, let only him consider riches more important than his people, let him, the brooding miser, have even the things they carried off with <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> and see how best to use his country's sorrows. Now our sins have found us out, and we are conquered. </p>                        </div>

Thus the council broke up. About midnight, <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> came to <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a> secretly. She suspected that they were about to return her to <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> and feared that she would be punished for having abandoned her home.

Those in the council, being thrown into confusion, ran outside and, thinking that the princes, as usual, had done some treacherous deed, they rushed to the temple of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>. Soon afterwards, however, they learned, from those who came from the citadel, that the sons of <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, his children by <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>, had perished, crushed when the roof of their home had collapsed. The names of these sons were Bunomus, <a href=/people/2270 target=_blank>Corythus</a>, and <a href=/people/5713 target=_blank>Idaeus</a>. The business of the council was thus deferred, and our leaders went off to <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a>'s, there to dine and spend the night.

(The <a href=/people/12046 target=_blank>Palladium</a> was an ancient statue in the temple of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>; it was made of wood, and had fallen from heaven and taken its place when <a href=/people/995 target=_blank>Ilus</a> was building the temple, and all but the roof was complete.) <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a> agreed to help our men, just as they urged, in very way; he would do whatever they wanted.

They had been constrained, they said, to act according to the will of the princes, by whom they were hated and counted as naught. They had not taken up arms against Greece willingly, for those who must follow another's command must look to his nod and try to obey it.

Moreover, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> had already suffered enough for their ill-advised acts. After a long discussion of this point and that, finally the question of tribute was raised. <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> asked for five thousand talents of gold, and a like number of silver, besides one hundred thousand measures of wheat, for a period of ten years. Then all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> were silent, except for <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a>.

Moreover, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> had never had as much gold and silver as Greece was demanding, not even before she had gone to the expense of hiring auxiliaries.

When our leaders had been assembled, they told them all that had been said and done, and how <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a> had carried the <a href=/people/12046 target=_blank>Palladium</a> off. Thereupon, since all our leaders thought best, the rest of the soldiers were given the news. </p>                        </div>

Using his prophetic powers (he had not been informed), he was able to give a detailed account of everything that had happened so far. And he also said that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> was doomed now that the <a href=/people/12046 target=_blank>Palladium</a>, the safeguard of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, had been carried away. We must, he said, offer a <a href=/people/12276 target=_blank>Wooden Horse</a> to <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>; this gift would prove fatal to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. The <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> must be so large that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> would have to breach their walls; <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a> would urge and advise them to do this. As <a href=/people/515 target=_blank>Helenus</a> was speaking, the thought of his father, <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>, and of his brothers who were still living caused him to burst into tears; his grief was so strong that he lost all control of himself and collapsed. When he had come to his senses and was able to rise, <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a> took him in charge. He had him guarded for fear he might somehow inform the enemy about what had happened. But <a href=/people/515 target=_blank>Helenus</a>, seeing himself under guard, told <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a> there was nothing to worry about, for he would prove faithful and, after <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>'s fall, would live with <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a> in Greece many years. And so, following <a href=/people/515 target=_blank>Helenus</a>' advice, we brought in a great deal of wood for building the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. <a href=/people/2226 target=_blank>Epeus</a> and <a href=/people/12000 target=_blank>Ajax</a> the son of <a href=/people/1143 target=_blank>Oileus</a> were in charge of this work. </p>                        </div>

When dinnertime came, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> held a public banquet in honor of the Greeks and in celebration of the peace they were making. <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a> was host and graciously served every need of our men.

Thereupon the envoys were escorted into the council, and they and the elders shook hands. It was decided to ratify the peace on the following day. Sacred oaths must be sworn, for the purpose of which altars must be raised in the center of the plain where all could see. When preparations had been made, <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> and <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> were first to sear. Calling on Highest <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Mother Earth</a>, <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, Moon, and Ocean to be their witnesses, they promised to abide by the agreements which they had made with <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a>. Then they walked through the center of the portions of the sacrificial victims. (Two victims had been brought, the portions of which had been laid out, half in an easterly direction and half in the direction of our ships.) <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> and <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> were followed by <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a>, who took the same oath. After ratifying the terms of the peace in this way, both sides returned to their people. The barbarians heaped highest praises upon <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a>, reverencing him like a god whenever he approached. They believed that he alone was responsible for the treaty and peace with the Greeks. Now everywhere, as both sides wished, war had ceased. Greeks felt free to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> came among the ships.

It towered to an immense height. Wheels were put beneath its feet to make it easier to draw along. It was the greatest offering ever to be given to <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>. Everyone said so. At <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a> and <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> were making sure that the exact amount of gold and silver, in accordance with the terms of the peace, was carried to the temple of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>. And we, having learned that the allies of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> had left, were careful to keep the terms of the peace. There was no more killing and no more wounding, lest the barbarians suspect that we were breaking agreements. When the <a href=/people/12276 target=_blank>Wooden Horse</a> had been built, complete in all points, we drew it out to the walls. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> were told to receive it religiously as a sacred offering to <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>. They poured from their gates and joyously welcomed the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. A sacrifice was made, and they drew it nearer the city. When, however, they saw that the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> was too large to pass through their gates, they decided, their enthusiasm blinding them to any objections, to tear down their walls. Thus they all joined in, and tore down their walls, those walls which had stood for centuries unharmed, and which, as tradition told, were the masterwork of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a> and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>. When the work of demolition was almost complete, the Greeks purposely caused a delay. We said that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> must pay the gold and silver they had promised before they could draw the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. Thus there was an interval of time during which, the walls being half demolished, <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> hired all of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> carpenters to help repair the ships.

There was, in short, no end to death and slaughter. Parents and children were killed, while loved ones watched and lamented, and then the latter were killed — a pitiable sight. With equal dispatch, the buildings of the city were set on fire and destroyed; the only homes to be saved were those of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> and <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a>, where guards had been posted. <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>, seeing what was happening, fled to the altar of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> that stood in front of the palace.

There was almost no one who was willing to offend a man of such greatness, for we vividly remembered his deeds on offense and defense. Only <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> and <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> stood in his way; they based their claims to the <a href=/people/12046 target=_blank>Palladium</a> on the fact that they had carried it off. But <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> swore that <a href=/people/761 target=_blank>Antenor</a>, who had hoped thereby to win their friendship, had carried the <a href=/people/12046 target=_blank>Palladium</a> off; and this, he said, had caused them no trouble and made no demands on their courage. Thereupon <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> modestly yielded to <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>. But not so <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, who contended, with all of his force, that he should have the <a href=/people/12046 target=_blank>Palladium</a>. <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> and <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> favored the cause of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, for they remembered how <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> had been saved, just a little before, by his aid.

Many good men had assented. But <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, still loving his wife, had gone the rounds, and plead for her life, and finally, through the intercession of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, had won her back unharmed. And so we decided between <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> and <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, judging only their merits in this particular case.

Accordingly, <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, and <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> increased their guard and kept careful watch for their personal safety. With the coming of night, as we departed, we all cursed and reviled the two kings, blaming them for letting the lust for a women endanger the army. At daybreak we found <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>, out in the open, dead; upon closer investigation, we discovered that he had been killed with a sword. A great tumult arose among our leaders and men, and soon a full-grown rebellion was under way. We felt that just as <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>, our wisest counsellor in war and peace, had been treacherously slain, so now <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>, our most distinguished commander, had met a similar end. <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> and <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> stayed in their huts, guarded by trusted companions, and avoided any possible violence. Meanwhile <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a> brought wood and cremated the body of <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>; then he gathered the remains in a golden urn and had them buried in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400263URho class=place long=26.3003 lat=40.0093>Rhoeteum</a>.

Who knows how the war might have ended? <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, knowing that he was hated by the army, feared personal violence, and fled across to <a href=/people/6059 target=_blank>Ismaros</a>.

Then a meeting of the council was called, and we decided to hold a public funeral, to last for three days, in honor of <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>. When the third day came to an end, all of our kings cut off their hair, which then they placed on the tomb. From this time on, we began to revile <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> and <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, saying that they were not the sons of <a href=/people/126 target=_blank>Atreus</a> but of <a href=/people/3456 target=_blank>Plisthenes</a>, and therefore ignoble. They, hoping that if they were gone our hatred would vanish, begged us to let them depart without harm. This we permitted; and so, like outcasts or exiles, they were the first to set sail. We gave the sons of <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> to <a href=/people/361 target=_blank>Teucer</a>.

There he laid many plots against <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a>, but the people prevented him from carrying out these plans. <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a>, it was decided unanimously, should go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> and there stand trial before the court of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=place long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagus</a>.

When <a href=/people/291 target=_blank>Idomeneus</a> asked <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> how he had met such misfortunes, he told the story of his wanderings from the beginning.

Finally, however, <a href=/people/882 target=_blank>Polyphemus</a> — he was the king — had taken pity upon them and agreed to a truce.

Thus, having been forcibly deprived of the girl, they were driven away — out through the island of <a href=/people/289 target=_blank>Aeolus</a>, on to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411127IKir class=place long=12.75 lat=41.1>island</a> of <a href=/people/245 target=_blank>Circe</a>, and then to the island of <a href=/people/829 target=_blank>Calypso</a>.

For no apparent reason and all unexpectedly, a great horde of locusts had attacked our island and was destroying all of the crops in the fields. The response of the oracle, in answer to our many prayers and supplications, was that living creatures must die, divinely slain, before the crops of our island would grow and abound. The people at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> prohibited us from sailing home at this time; the weather, they said, was unfavorable and dangerous. Nevertheless, <a href=/people/840 target=_blank>Lycophron</a> and Ixaeus — they were the two who had come along with me — refused to obey this injunction. Thus they sailed. When, however, they were half way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>, a bolt of lightning struck them dead. And then, just as the god had predicted, with the same bolt of lightning, the locusts departed, swallowed up by the sea, and the crops of our island began to increase. </p>                        </div>

He wanted to give thanks to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> for the fact that <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, who had murdered his father, had paid for his crime. <a href=/people/902 target=_blank>Andromache</a> was left behind at home, along with <a href=/people/1647 target=_blank>Laodamas</a>, her only surviving son by <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>. Now <a href=/people/1148 target=_blank>Hermione</a>, after the departure of her husband, was tortured by the thought of her captive rival, and summoned her father, <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>. Then, bitterly complaining about her poor treatment — how <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a> preferred a captive woman to her — she urged <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> to kill <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>'s son. <a href=/people/902 target=_blank>Andromache</a>, however, having learned of this plot, saved her son and escaped with the aid of the people, who pitied her fate; furthermore, these heaped abuses upon <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, and were barely prevented from killing him. </p>                        </div>

Thereupon he urged <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> to carry out the plot, for he himself was planning to kill <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a> when he returned. He hated <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a> for having married <a href=/people/1148 target=_blank>Hermione</a>; she had been promised to him. Accordingly, the first thing he did was to send some trusted scouts to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> to find out when <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a> would come. <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, being thus apprised of <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a>' plans, returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>, for he wanted no part in such a crime. Then the scouts who had been sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> reported that <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a> was not to be found in that place. And thus <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> was forced to set out in search of his man. When he returned — but not on the same day he had left — everyone believed that he had accomplished his purpose. Within a short time the popular story was that <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a> was dead and that <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> had treacherously slain him. Then <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377228PMyk class=place long=22.7561 lat=37.7308>Mycenae</a>, taking <a href=/people/1148 target=_blank>Hermione</a> with him. She had been promised to him. Meanwhile <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a> and <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a>, having heard of their grandson's death, set out to learn for themselves exactly how he had died. They discovered that he had been buried at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> (where then they performed his funeral rites according to custom), but that he had died in a place where <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> had never been seen. This, however, the people refused to believe, so strong was their presumption of <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a>' treachery. Furthermore, <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a>, seeing that <a href=/people/1148 target=_blank>Hermione</a> and <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> were married, sent <a href=/people/902 target=_blank>Andromache</a> off to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398206RMol class=ethnic long=20.6 lat=39.8>Molossians</a>. <a href=/people/902 target=_blank>Andromache</a> was pregnant by <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a>, and <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a> feared that <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> and <a href=/people/1148 target=_blank>Hermione</a> might try to kill the baby. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly, he summoned all those in his area who were skilled in interpreting dreams, and told them everything, but especially this dream he frequently had: A form, half human and half divine, and beautiful to behold, suddenly arose form the same place. As he passionately reached out his arms and tried to embrace it, he received a rebuke, in a human voice: such a union was wicked, a union between those of the same flesh and blood, one of whom was destined to die at the hands of the other. And while he pondered and wondered how this could be, a shaft, hurled by the apparition's command, appeared to arise from the sea and, coming between them, caused them to part. Everyone who was there interpreted this vision as fatal to him; and, furthermore, they begged him to beware of the treacherous acts of his son. Accordingly, <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a>, because of his father's suspicions, was sent to the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382206IKep class=place long=20.59 lat=38.2>Cephalenia</a>, there to farm where trusted guards could watch him. Furthermore, <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, by withdrawing into a region that was hidden and remote, strove to avoid what his dream had foretold. </p>                        </div>

He was carrying a spear, whose point was the bone of a sea bird, the turtle-dove, which was the symbol of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411127IKir class=place long=12.75 lat=41.1>Aeaea</a>, where he was born. When he learned where <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> was living off in the country, he went to that place; but the guards there prohibited him entry. Persisting but always being resisted, he began to shout that this was disgraceful, a crime, to prevent a song from embracing his father. But the guards, not knowing that <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> had fathered a second son and believing that this was <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a> who had come to murder the king, resisted ever more fiercely. And thus <a href=/people/1979 target=_blank>Telegonus</a>, becoming more and more angry because of this increasingly vehement opposition, ended by killing or wounding many of the guards. <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, having learned what was happening, thought that this was a young man whom <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a> had sent to harm him. Accordingly, he entered the fray and let fly with his spear, which he always carried for protection. <a href=/people/1979 target=_blank>Telegonus</a>, however, parried the blow; and then, aiming to make a mortal wound and letting fly with his own remarkable weapon, he hit his father. <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, as he fell, was thankful for this sort of fate. It was all for the best, he thought; by dying at he hands of a foreigner he would prevent <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a>, whom he dearly loved, from being guilty of parricide. Still breathing, he asked the young man who he was and where he was from and how he had dared to kill <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, the son of <a href=/people/520 target=_blank>Laertes</a>, a man famous for virtues in war and peace. And then <a href=/people/1979 target=_blank>Telegonus</a> realized that this was his father whom he had slain. He wept in a very pitiable way and pulled his hair with both his hands, being terribly tortured because he had caused his father's death. Then, as <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> had asked, he told him his name and the name of his mother and the name of the island where he was born; and he showed him the point of the spear. And so <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> knew that his recurring dream had been correctly interpreted; he had been fatally struck by one whom he had never suspected. And thus, within three days, he died, a man advanced in years, whose strength, however, was as yet unimpaired. End </p>                        </div>
