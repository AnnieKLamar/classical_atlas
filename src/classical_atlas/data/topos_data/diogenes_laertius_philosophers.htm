The dialogue of inquiry also has two main divisions, the one of which aims at training the mind and the other at victory in controversy.

For induction is an argument which by means of certain true premisses properly infers a truth resembling them. And there are two kinds of induction, the one proceeding by way of contradiction, the other from agreement. In the kind which proceeds by contradiction the answer given to every question will necessarily be the contrary of the respondent's position, e.g. My father is either other than or the same as your father. If then your father is other than my father, by being other than a father he will not be a father.

This is the kind of induction which proceeds by contradiction and dispute, and <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> used it, not for laying down positive doctrines but for refutation. The other kind of induction by agreement appears in two forms, the one proving the particular conclusion under discussion from a particular, the other proceeding by way of the universal [by means of particular facts]. The former is suited to rhetoric, the latter to dialectic. For instance, under the first form the question is raised, Did so-and-so commit a murder?

For instance, the question put is whether the soul is immortal, and whether the living come back from the dead. And this is proved in the dialogue On the Soul by means of a certain general proposition, that opposites proceed from opposites. And the general proposition itself is established by means of certain propositions which are particular, as that sleep comes from waking and vice versa, the greater from the less and vice versa.

The natural rulers are the males, not only among men, but also among the other animals; for the males everywhere exert wide-reaching rule over the females. Rule according to custom is such authority as attendants exercise over children and teachers over their pupils. Hereditary rule is exemplified by that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonian</a> kings, for the office of king is confined to a certain family.

To the question, What do people gain by telling lies? his answer was, Just this, that when they speak the truth they are not believed. Being once reproached for giving alms to a bad man, he rejoined, It was the man and not his character that I pitied. He used constantly to say to his friends and pupils, whenever or wherever he happened to be lecturing, As sight takes in light from the surrounding air, so does the soul from mathematics. Frequently and at some length he would say that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> were the discoverers of wheat and of laws; but, though they used wheat, they had no use for laws. </p>                        </div>

When <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> offered him dried figs, he saw that he had prepared something caustic to say if he did not take them; so he took them and said <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> had lost his figs and his jest into the bargain. And on another occasion he took them when they were offered, lifted them up aloft, as you do babies, and returned them with the exclamation, Great is <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>. Three things he declared to be indispensable for education: natural endowment, study, and constant practice.

Being asked how the educated differ from the uneducated, As much, he said, as the living from the dead. He used to declare education to be an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity. Teachers who educated children deserved, he said, more honour than parents who merely gave them birth; for bare life is furnished by the one, the other ensures a good life.

The theoretical part includes physics and logic, although logic is not an independent science, but is elaborated as an instrument to the rest of science.

The end of love was not merely intercourse but also philosophy. According to him the wise man would fall in love and take part in politics; furthermore he would marry and reside at a king's court. Of three kinds of life, the contemplative, the practical, and the pleasure-loving life, he gave the preference to the contemplative.

The soul is the realization of a natural body, since bodies may be divided into (a) artificial bodies made by the hands of craftsmen, as a tower or a ship, and (b) natural bodies which are the work of nature, such as plants and the bodies of animals.

He was renowned for his industry, being indeed driven by extreme poverty to work for a living. Thus, while by night he used to draw water in gardens, by day he exercised himself in arguments: hence the nickname Phreantles or Well-lifter was given him. He is said to have been brought into court to answer the inquiry how so sturdy a fellow as he made his living, and then to have been acquitted on producing as his witnesses the gardener in whose garden he drew water </p>                        </div>

Nevertheless, whenever he had contended against <a href=/people/561 target=_blank>Cleanthes</a>, he would afterwards feel remorse, so that he constantly came out with the lines: <br />Blest in all else am I, save only where <br />I touch <a href=/people/561 target=_blank>Cleanthes</a>: there I am ill-fortuned. </p>                        </div>

He has also given an account of all the orderly happenings in the universe, and declares the sun to be no larger than it appears. Another of his sayings is: Of soul thou shalt never find boundaries, not if thou trackest it on every path; so deep is its cause. Self-conceit he used to call a falling sickness (epilepsy) and eyesight a lying sense.

All things come into being by conflict of opposites, and the sum of things flows like a stream. Further, all that is is limited and forms one world. And it is alternately born from fire and again resolved into fire in fixed cycles to all eternity, and this is determined by destiny. Of the opposites that which tends to birth or creation is called war and strife, and that which tends to destruction by fire is called concord and peace.

This process he calls the downward path. Then again earth is liquefied, and thus gives rise to water, and from water the rest of the series is derived. He reduces nearly everything to exhalation from the sea. This process is the upward path. Exhalations arise from earth as well as from sea; those from sea are bright and pure, those from earth dark. Fire is fed by the bright exhalations, the moist element by the others. He does not make clear the nature of the surrounding element. He says, however, that there are in it bowls with their concavities turned towards us, in which the bright exhalations collect and produce flames.

The moon, which is nearer to the earth, traverses a region which is not pure. The sun, however, moves in a clear and untroubled region, and keeps a proportionate distance from us. That is why it gives us more heat and light. Eclipses of the sun and moon occur when the bowls are turned upwards; the monthly phases of the moon are due to the bowl turning round in its place little by little.

The first principles of the universe are atoms and empty space; everything else is merely thought to exist. The worlds are unlimited; they come into being and perish. Nothing can come into being from that which is not nor pass away into that which is not. Further, the atoms are unlimited in size and number, and they are borne along in the whole universe in a vortex, and therby generate all composite things – fire, water, air, earth; for even these are conglomerations of given atoms. And it is because of their solidity that these atoms are impassive and unalterable. The sun and the moon have been composed of such smooth and spherical masses [i.e. atoms], and so also the soul, which is identical with reason.

Rather they are seen to be exactly as and what sensation itself makes them individually claim to be. </p>                        </div>
