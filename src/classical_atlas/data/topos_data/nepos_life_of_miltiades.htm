                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0588.abo001:praef'><b>&sect; praef</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Preface: I do not doubt that there will be many, <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, who will think this kind of writing trifling in its nature, and not sufficiently adapted to the characters of eminent men, when they shall find it related who taught <a href=/people/150 target=_blank>Epaminondas</a> music, or see it numbered among his accomplishments, that he danced gracefully, and played skilfully on the flutes. But these will be such, for the most part, as, being unacquainted with Greek literature, will think nothing right but what agrees with their own customs. <br />If these readers will but understand that the same things are not becoming or unbecoming among all people, but that every thing is judged by the usages of men's forefathers, they will not wonder that we, in setting forth the excellencies of the Greeks, have had regard to their manners. For to <a href=/people/198 target=_blank>Cimon</a>, an eminent man among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, it was thought no disgrace to have his half-sister, by the father's side, in marriage, as his countrymen followed the same practice; but such a union, according to the order of things among us, is deemed unlawful. In Greece it is considered an honour to young men to have as many lovers as possible. At <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemon</a> there is no widow so noble that will not go upon the stage, if engaged for a certain sum. Through the whole of Greece it was accounted a great glory to be proclaimed a conqueror at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>; while to appear upon the stage, and become a spectacle to the public, was a dishonour to no one in that nation; but all these practices are, with us, deemed partly infamous, partly mean, and at variance with respectability. On the other hand, many things in our habits are decorous, which are by them considered unbecoming; for what Roman is ashamed to bring his wife to a feast, or whose consort does not occupy the best room in the house, and live in the midst of company? But in Greece the case is far otherwise; for a wife is neither admitted to a feast, except among relations, nor does she sit anywhere but in the innermost apartment of the house, which is called the gynaeconitis, and into which nobody goes who is not connected with her by near relationship. But both the size of my intended volume, and my haste to relate what I have undertaken, prevent me from saying more on this point. We will therefore proceed to our subject, and relate in this book the lives of eminent commanders. </p>                        </div>

The number of the party being great, and many applying for a share in the expedition, some chosen from among them were sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, to consult <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> what leader they should take in preference to any other; for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> at the time had possession of those parts, with whom they would be obliged to contend in war. The <a href=/people/10998 target=_blank>Pythia</a> expressly directed them, when they put the question, to take <a href=/people/260 target=_blank>Miltiades</a> as their commander, as, if they did so, their undertakings would be successful. Upon this answer from the oracle, <a href=/people/260 target=_blank>Miltiades</a> set out for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403265LChe class=place long=26.5 lat=40.3333>Chersonese</a> with a fleet, accompanied by a chosen body of men, and touched at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=place long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnos</a>, when, wishing to reduce the people of the island under the power of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, and requesting the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=ethnic long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnians</a> to surrender of their own accord, they, in mockery, replied that they would do so, whenever he, leaving home with a fleet, should reach <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=place long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnos</a> by the aid of the wind Aquilo; for this wind, rising from the north, is contrary to those setting out from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. <a href=/people/260 target=_blank>Miltiades</a>, having no time for delay, directed his course to the quarter to which he was bound, and arrived at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403265LChe class=place long=26.5 lat=40.3333>Chersonese</a>. </p>                        </div>

Nor was he less aided, in this proceeding, by good conduct than by good fortune, for after he had, by the valour of his men, routed the troops of the enemy, he settled affairs with the greatest equity, and resolved upon residing in the country himself. He held, indeed, among the inhabitants, the authority of a king, though he wanted the name; and he did not attain this influence more by his power than by his justice. Nor did he the less, on this account, perform his duty to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, from whom he had come. From these circumstances it happened that he held his office in perpetuity, not less with the consent of those who had sent him, than of those with whom he had gone thither. <br />Having settled the affairs of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403265LChe class=place long=26.5 lat=40.3333>Chersonese</a> in this manner, he returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=place long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnos</a>, and called on the people to deliver up their city to him according to their promise; for they had said that when he, starting from home, should reach their country by the aid of the north wind, they would surrender themselves; and he had now a home, he told them, in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403265LChe class=place long=26.5 lat=40.3333>Chersonese</a>.

He constructed a bridge over the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, by which he might lead across his forces. Of this bridge he left as guardians, during his absence, the chiefs whom he had brought with him from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390271RAio class=place long=27.1 lat=39>Aeolia</a>, and to whom he had given the sovereignty of their respective cities; for he thought that he should most easily keep under his power such of the inhabitants of Asia as spoke Greek, if he gave their towns to be held by his friends, to whom, if he should be crushed, no hope of safety would be left. Among the number of those, to whom the care of the bridge was then entrusted, was <a href=/people/260 target=_blank>Miltiades</a>. <br />As several messengers brought word that <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> was unsuccessful in his enterprise, and was hard pressed by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, <a href=/people/260 target=_blank>Miltiades</a>, in consequence, exhorted the guardians of the bridge not to lose an opportunity, presented them by by fortune, of securing the liberty of Greece; for if <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> should be destroyed, together with the army that he had taken with him, not only Europe would be safe, but also those who, being Greeks by birth, inhabited Asia, would be freed from the dominion of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, and from all danger. This, he said, might easily be accomplished, for, if the bridge were broken down, the king would perish in a few days, either by the sword of the enemy, or by famine. After most of them had assented to this proposal, <a href=/people/887 target=_blank>Histiaeus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=person long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a>, prevented the design from being executed; saying that the same course would not be expedient for those who held sovereign command, as for the multitude, since their authority depended on the power of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, and, if he were cut off, they would be deprived of their governments, and suffer punishment at the hands of their subjects; and that he himself, therefore, was so far from agreeing in opinion with the rest, that he thought nothing more advantageous for them than that the kingdom of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> should be upheld. As most went over to this opinion, <a href=/people/260 target=_blank>Miltiades</a>, not doubting that his proposal, since so many were acquainted with it, would come to the ears of the king, quitted the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403265LChe class=place long=26.5 lat=40.3333>Chersonese</a>, and went again to reside at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>.

These generals of the king, having brought up their fleet to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a>, soon took <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=place long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretria</a>, carried off all the citizens of the place, and sent them into Asia to the king. They then went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, and drew up their forces in the plain of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381241LMaB class=place long=24.0002 lat=38.144>Marathon</a>, which is distant from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> about ten miles. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, though alarmed at this sudden descent, so near and so menacing, sought assistance nowhere but from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a>, and despatched <a href=/people/5178 target=_blank>Phidippides</a>, a courier of the class called hemerodromoi, to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemon</a>, to acquaint them how speedy assistance they needed. At home, meanwhile, they appointed ten captains to command the army, and among them <a href=/people/260 target=_blank>Miltiades</a>. <br />Among these captains there was a great discussion, whether they should defend themselves within the walls, or march out to meet the enemy, and decide the contest in the field. <a href=/people/260 target=_blank>Miltiades</a> was the only one extremely urgent that a camp should be formed as soon as possible; for, he said, if that were done, not only would courage be added to their countrymen, when they saw that there was no distrust of their valour, but the enemy, from the same cause, would be less bold, if they saw that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> would venture to oppose them with so small a force. </p>                        </div>

On the arrival of these, the number of ten thousand armed men was made up; a band which was animated with an extraordinary ardour to fight. Hence it happened that <a href=/people/260 target=_blank>Miltiades</a> had more influence than his colleagues, for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, incited by his authority, led out their forces from the city, and pitched their camp in an eligible place. The next day, having set themselves in array at the foot of the hills opposite the enemy, they engaged in battle with a novel stratagem, and with the utmost impetuosity. For trees had been strewed in many directions, with this intention, that, while they themselves were covered by the high hills, the enemy's cavalry might be impeded by the spread of trees, so that they might not be surrounded by numbers. <a href=/people/1263 target=_blank>Datis</a>, though he saw that the ground was unfavourable for his men, yet, depending on the number of his force, was desirous to engage, and the rather, because he thought it of advantage to fight before the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> came to the enemy's assistance. He led into the field, therefore, a hundred thousand foot and ten thousand <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and proceeded to battle. In the encounter the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, through their valour, had so much the advantage, that they routed ten times the number of the enemy, and threw them into such a consternation, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> betook themselves, not to their camp, but to their ships. Than this battle there has hitherto been none more glorious; for never did so small a band overthrow so numerous a host. </p>                        </div>

In the discharge of this commission he obliged most of them to return to their duty; some he took by assault. Being unable to gain over by persuasion one of their number, the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371252PPar class=place long=25.1483 lat=37.0844>Paros</a>, which was vain of its strength, he drew his troops out of his ships, invested the town, and cut off all their supplies; soon after, he erected his vineae and tortoises, and came close up to the walls. When he was on the point of taking the town, a grove on the mainland, which was some distance off, but visible from the island, was set on fire, by I know not what accident, in the night; and when the flame of it was seen by the townsmen and besiegers, it was imagined by both that it was a signal given by the men of the king's fleet; whence it happened that both the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371252PPar class=ethnic long=25.1483 lat=37.0844>Parians</a> were deterred from surrendering, and <a href=/people/260 target=_blank>Miltiades</a>, fearing that the royal fleet was approaching, set fire to the works which he had erected, and returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> with the same number of ships with which he had set out, to the great displeasure of his countrymen.

He was at this time ill of the wounds which he had received in besieging the town, and, as he could not plead for himself, his brother <a href=/people/8435 target=_blank>Tisagoras</a> spoke for him. The cause being heard, he was not condemned to death, but sentenced to pay a fine, which was fixed at fifty talents, a sum equivalent to that which had been spent on the fleet. As he could not pay this money, he was thrown into prison, and there ended his life. </p>                        </div>
