But yet, according to my observation, we have had as strange occurrences of a later date in the Roman times as any we have received from antiquity; for proof whereof, I have here matched several stories of the ancients with modern instances, and cited my authorities. <br /><a href=/people/1263 target=_blank>Datis</a>, an eminent <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> commander, drew out three hundred thousand men to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381241LMaB class=place long=24.0002 lat=38.144>Marathon</a>, a plain of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, where he encamped and declared war against the inhabitants. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> made no reckoning at all of so barbarous a rabble, but sent out nine thousand men against him, under the command of <a href=/people/4132 target=_blank>Cynaegirus</a>, <a href=/people/2012 target=_blank>Polyzelus</a>, <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a>, and <a href=/people/260 target=_blank>Miltiades</a>. Upon the joining of battle, <a href=/people/2012 target=_blank>Polyzelus</a> was struck blind at the sight of a wonderful apparition; <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a>'s body was struck through with a great many lances, continuing in an upright posture even when he was dead; <a href=/people/4132 target=_blank>Cynaegirus</a> had both his hands cut off upon laying hold of a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> ship that was endeavoring to get away.

L. <a href=/people/4159 target=_blank>Glauco</a>, a patrician, laid hold of the vessel that <a href=/people/144 target=_blank>Asdrubal</a> was in, and lost both his hands upon it. — <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> <a href=/people/2533 target=_blank>Milesius</a> gives this account in his First Book of the Affairs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=person long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, and <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> <a href=/people/3470 target=_blank>Siculus</a> had it from him. </p>                        </div>

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, in a very great surprise, sent <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a>, the brother of <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a>, to discover the motions of the enemy, notwithstanding a dream of his father <a href=/people/1269 target=_blank>Neocles</a>, that his son had lost both his hands.

Whereupon he was immediately seized, bound, and carried to <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, who was just then about to sacrifice an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> to the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>. The fire was kindled upon the altar, and <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a> put his right hand into it, without so much as shrinking at the pain. He was ordered upon this to be untied; and told the king that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> were all of the same resolution, and that, if he pleased, he should see him burn his left hand too. This gave <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> an apprehension of him, so that he caused him to be still kept in custody. — This I find in <a href=/people/1500 target=_blank>Agatharchides</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=person long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samian</a>, in the Second Book of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> History. <a href=/people/3670 target=_blank>Porsena</a>, a king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenia</a>, encamped himself beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, and made war upon the Romans, cutting off the supplies, till they were brought to great want of provisions. The Senate were at their wits' end what to do, till <a href=/people/1024 target=_blank>Mucius</a>, a nobleman, got leave of the consuls to take four hundred of his own quality to advise with upon the matter. <a href=/people/1024 target=_blank>Mucius</a>, upon this, put himself into the habit of a private man, and crossed the river; where finding one of the king's officers giving orders for the distribution of necessaries to the soldiers, and taking him for the king himself, he slew him. He was taken immediately and carried to the king, where he put his right hand into a fire that was in the room, and with a smile in the middle of his torments, — Barbarian, says he, I can set myself at liberty without asking you leave; and be it known to you, that I have left four hundred men in the camp as daring as myself, that have sworn your death. This struck <a href=/people/3670 target=_blank>Porsena</a> with such a terror, that he made peace with the Romans upon it. — <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> <a href=/people/2533 target=_blank>Milesius</a> is my author for this, in the Third Book of his History. </p>                        </div>
