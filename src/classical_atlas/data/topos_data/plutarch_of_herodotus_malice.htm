For it is not only (as <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> says) an extreme injustice, to make a show of being just when one is not so; but it is also the highest malignity, to pretend to simplicity and mildness and be in the mean time really most malicious. Now since he principally exerts his malice against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=ethnic long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=ethnic long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthians</a>, though without sparing any other, I think myself obliged to defend our ancestors and the truth against this part of his writings, since those who would detect all his other lies and fictions would have need of many books. But, as <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> has it, the face of persuasion is prevalent, especially when delivered in good language, and such as has power to conceal both the other absurdities and the ill-nature of the writer. King <a href=/people/35 target=_blank>Philip</a> told the Greeks who revolted from him to Titus <a href=/people/149 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, that they had got a more polished, but a longer-lasting yoke. So the malice of <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> is indeed more polite and delicate than that of <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>, yet it pinches closer, and makes a more severe impression, — not unlike to those winds which, blowing secretly through narrow chinks, are sharper than those that are more diffused. Now it seems to me very convenient to delineate, as it were, in a rough draught, those signs and marks that distinguish a malicious narration from a candid and unbiassed one, applying afterwards every point we shall examine to such as appertain to them. </p>                        </div>

Therefore <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a> would not clearly relate the faults of <a href=/people/285 target=_blank>Cleon</a>, which were very numerous; and as for <a href=/people/1429 target=_blank>Hyperbolus</a> the orator, having touched at him in a word and called him an ill man, he let him go. <a href=/people/910 target=_blank>Philistus</a> also passed over all those outrages committed by <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> on the barbarians which had no connection with the Grecian affairs. For the excursions and digressions of history are principally allowed for fables and antiquities, and sometimes also for encomiums.

For these, sailing to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>, drove away <a href=/people/346 target=_blank>Periander</a>'s guards from the temple, and taking the children aboard their ships, carried them safe to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer class=place long=19.9156 lat=39.6063>Corcyra</a>; as it is recorded by <a href=/people/915 target=_blank>Antenor</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=person long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a>, and by <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236PCha class=person long=23.6153 lat=38.4597>Chalcidian</a> in his foundations.

And since he cannot altogether take from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> the glory of having delivered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> from the tyrants, he endeavors to cloud and disgrace that most honorable act by as foul a passion.

For they not only made a thousand other excursions and fights at the beginning of the month, without staying for the full moon; but wanted so little of being present at this very battle, which was fought the sixth day of the month <a href=/people/12203 target=_blank>Boedromion</a>, that at their coming they found the dead still lying in the field. And yet he has written thus of the full moon: It was impossible for them to do these things at that present, being unwilling to break the law; for it was the ninth day of the month, and they said, they could not go forth on the ninth day, the orb of the moon being not yet full. And therefore they stayed for the full moon. But thou, O <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>, transferest the full moon from the middle to the beginning of the month, and at the same time confoundest the heavens, days, and all things; and yet thou dost pretend to be the historian of Greece!

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> suspected this to have been done by a plot of the <a href=/people/1344 target=_blank>Alcmaeonidae</a>, who by agreement showed a shield to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> when they were got into their ships. They therefore doubled the cape of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376240LSou class=place long=24.0247 lat=37.6498>Sounion</a>. Let us in this place take no notice of his calling the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=ethnic long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretrians</a> slaves, who showed as much courage and gallantry in this war as any other of the Grecians, and suffered things unworthy their virtue. Nor let us insist much on the calumny with which he defames the <a href=/people/1344 target=_blank>Alcmaeonidae</a>, some of whom were both the greatest families and noblest men of the city. But the greatness of the victory itself is overthrown, and the end of that so celebrated action comes to nothing, nor does it seem to have been a fight or any great exploit, but only a light skirmish with the barbarians, as the envious and ill-willers affirm, if they did not after the battle fly away, cutting their cables and giving themselves to the wind, to carry them as far as might be from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> coast, but having a shield lifted up to them as a signal of treason, made straight with their fleet for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, in hope to surprise it, and having at leisure doubled the point of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376240LSou class=place long=24.0247 lat=37.6498>Sounion</a>, were discovered above the port <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379237DPha class=place long=23.7062 lat=37.9373>Phalerum</a>, so that the chief and most illustrious men, despairing to save the city, would have betrayed it. For a little after, acquitting the <a href=/people/1344 target=_blank>Alcmaeonidae</a>, he charges others with the treason. For the shield indeed was shown, nor can it be denied, says he, as if he had seen it himself. But this could no way be, since the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> obtained a solid victory; and if it had been done, it could not have been seen by the barbarians, flying in a hurry amidst wounds and arrows into their ships, and leaving every one the place with all possible speed.

For why art thou so eager to catch him, if thou wilt let him go when he is caught? Thus you first accuse, then apologize; and you write calumnies against illustrious men, which again you refute. And you discredit yourself; for you heard no one but yourself say that the <a href=/people/1344 target=_blank>Alcmaeonidae</a> lifted up a shield to the vanquished and flying barbarians. And in those very things which you allege for the <a href=/people/1344 target=_blank>Alcmaeonidae</a>, you show yourself a sycophant. For if, as here you write, the <a href=/people/1344 target=_blank>Alcmaeonidae</a> were more or no less enemies to tyrants than <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a>, the son of <a href=/people/1713 target=_blank>Phaenippus</a> and father of <a href=/people/919 target=_blank>Hipponicus</a>, where will you place their conspiracy, of which you write in your First Book, that assisting <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Pisistratus</a> they brought him back from exile to the tyranny and would not have driven him away till he was accused of unnaturally abusing his wife? Such then are the repugnances of these things; and by his intermixing the praises of <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a>, the son of <a href=/people/1713 target=_blank>Phaenippus</a>, amidst the crimes and suspicions of the <a href=/people/1344 target=_blank>Alcmaeonidae</a>, and joining to him his son <a href=/people/919 target=_blank>Hipponicus</a>, who was (as <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> himself says) one of the richest men in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, he confesses that he brought in <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a> not for any necessity of the story, but to ingratiate himself and gain favor with <a href=/people/919 target=_blank>Hipponicus</a>. </p>                        </div>

And of this, he says, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=demonym long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a> ambassadors afterwards put <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a> in mind, when they attended him at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus class=place long=48.247 lat=32.191>Susa</a>, and the King said, he esteemed no city more his friend than <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>. Then adding, as his manner is, to cover the matter, he says: Of these things I know nothing certainly; but this I know, that all men have faults, and that the worst things were not done by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a>; but I must tell such things as are reported, though I am not bound to believe them all; and let this be understood of all my narrations. For it is farther said that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a>, when they were not able to sustain the war against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>, called the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> into Greece, willing to suffer any thing rather than the present trouble. Therefore, as himself reports the Ethiopian to have said of the ointment and purple, Deceitful are the beauties, deceitful the garments of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, may not any one say also of him, Deceitful are the phrases, deceitful the figures of <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>'s speeches; as being perplexed, unsound, and full of ambiguities? For as painters set off and render more eminent the luminous part of their pictures by adding shadows, so he by his denials extends his calumnies, and by his dubious speeches makes his suspicions take deeper impression. If the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a> joined not with the other Greeks, but stood out through an emulation of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>' command and valor, it cannot be denied but that they acted in a manner not beseeming their nobility and descent from <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>. For it had been more honorable for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a> under the rule of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370247PSip class=ethnic long=24.745 lat=36.975>Siphnians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374244PKyt class=ethnic long=24.395 lat=37.409>Cythnians</a> to have defended the Grecian liberty, than contending with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> for superiority to have avoided so many and such signal combats. And if it was they who brought the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> into Greece, because their war against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> succeeded ill, how came it to pass, that they did not at the coming of <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> openly join themselves to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>? Or if they would not fight under the King, why did they not, being left at home, make incursions into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=place long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconia</a>, or again attempt <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374227PThy class=place long=22.733 lat=37.395>Thyreae</a>, or by some other way disturb and infest the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>? For they might have greatly damaged the Grecians, by hindering the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> from going with so great an army to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233LPlB class=place long=23.3012 lat=38.2446>Plataea</a>. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> bears witness to <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>, whilst he charges the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a> with some things falsely, with others ignorantly, and with others as hating them and having a quarrel with them. For he affirms that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> at first upon necessity inclined to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, in which he says the truth; and prophesying of the other Grecians that they would betray the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>, he added, that they would not do it willingly, but upon necessity, one city being taken after another. But he does not allow the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a> the same plea of necessity, although they sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399227LTem class=place long=22.576 lat=39.877>Tempe</a> five hundred men under the command of Mnamias, and to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388225FThe class=place long=22.536 lat=38.795>Thermopylae</a> as many as <a href=/people/212 target=_blank>Leonidas</a> desired, who also alone with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383232PThe class=ethnic long=23.1549 lat=38.2935>Thespians</a> stood by him, the rest leaving him after he was surrounded. But when the barbarian, having possessed himself of the avenues, was got into their confines, and <a href=/people/475 target=_blank>Demaratus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=person long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a>, favoring in right of hospitality <a href=/people/4085 target=_blank>Attaginus</a>, the chief of the oligarchy, had so wrought that he became the King's friend and familiar, whilst the other Greeks were in their ships, and none came on by land; then at last being forsaken did they accept conditions of peace, to which they were compelled by great necessity. For they had neither the sea and ships at hand, as had the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>; nor did they dwell far off, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a>, who inhabited the most remote parts of Greece; but were not above a day and half's journey from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> army, whom they had already with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383232PThe class=ethnic long=23.1549 lat=38.2935>Thespians</a> alone resisted at the entrance of the straits, and were defeated. But this writer is so equitable, that having said, The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>, being alone and deserted by their allies, would perhaps have made a composition with <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, he yet abuses the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a>, who were driven to the same act by the same necessity. But when he could not wholly obliterate this most great and glorious act of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a>, yet went he about to deface it with a most vile imputation and suspicion, writing thus: The confederates who had been sent returned back, obeying the commands of <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a>; there remained only with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383232PThe class=ethnic long=23.1549 lat=38.2935>Thespians</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a>: of these, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a> stayed against their wills, for <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a> retained them as hostages; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383232PThe class=ethnic long=23.1549 lat=38.2935>Thespians</a> most willingly, as they said they would never depart from <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a> and those that were with him. Does he not here manifestly discover himself to have a peculiar pique and hatred against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a>, by the impulse of which he not only falsely and unjustly calumniated the city, but did not so much as take care to render his contradiction probable, or to conceal, at least from a few men, his being conscious of having knowingly contradicted himself? For having before said that <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a>, perceiving his confederates not to be in good heart nor prepared to undergo danger, wished them to depart, he a little after adds that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a> were against their wills detained by him; whereas, if he had believed them inclined to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, he should have driven them away though they had been willing to tarry. For if he thought that those who were not brisk would be useless, to what purpose was it to mix among his soldiers those that were suspected? Nor was the king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> and general of all Greece so senseless as to think that four hundred armed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a> could be detained as hostages by his three hundred, especially the enemy being both in his front and rear. For though at first he might have taken them along with him as hostages; it is certainly probable that at last, having no regard for him, they would have gone away from him, and that <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a> would have more feared his being encompassed by them than by the enemy. Furthermore, would not <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a> have been ridiculous, to have sent away the other Greeks, as if by staying they should soon after have died, and to have detained the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a>, that being himself about to die, he might keep them for the Greeks? For if he had indeed carried them along with him for hostages, or rather for slaves, he should not have kept them with those that were at the point of perishing, but have delivered them to the Greeks that went away. There remained but one cause that might be alleged for <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a>'s unwillingness to let them go, to wit, that they might die with him; and this our historian himself has taken away, writing thus of <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a>'s ambition: <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a> considering these things, and desirous that this glory might redound to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> alone, sent away his confederates rather for this than because they differed in their opinions. For it had certainly been the height of folly to keep his enemies against their wills, to be partakers of that glory from which he drove away his confederates. But it is manifest from the effects, that <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a> suspected not the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a> of insincerity, but esteemed them to be his steadfast friends. For he marched with his army into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>, and at his request obtained that which was never granted to any other, to sleep within the temple of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>; and the next morning he related to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a> the vision that had appeared to him. For he imagined that he saw the most illustrious and greatest cities of Greece irregularly tost and floating up and down on a very stormy and tempestuous sea; that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>, being carried above all the rest, was lifted up on high to heaven, and suddenly after disappeared. And this indeed had a resemblance of those things which long after befell that city. </p>                        </div>

When his wife, at his departure, asked him what commands he had for her; he, turning to her, said, I command you to marry good men, and bring them good children.

Yet <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a>, who was not a citizen of any of the confederate cities, but of one that was suspected to take part with the Medians, having made mention of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390232SArt class=place long=23.217 lat=39.0097>Artemisium</a>, brake forth into this exclamation: This is the place where the sons of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> laid the glorious foundation of liberty. But <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>, by whom, as some will have it, Greece is honored, makes that victory a work of bribery and theft, saying that the Greeks, deceived by their captains, who had to that end taken money, fought against their wills. Nor does he here put an end to his malice. All men in a manner confess that, although the Greeks got the better at sea, they nevertheless abandoned <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390232SArt class=place long=23.217 lat=39.0097>Artemisium</a> to the barbarians after they had received the news of the overthrow at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388225FThe class=place long=22.536 lat=38.795>Thermopylae</a>. For it was to no purpose for them to stay there and keep the sea, the war being already within <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388225FThe class=place long=22.536 lat=38.795>Thermopylae</a>, and <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> having possessed himself of the avenues. But <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> makes the Greeks contriving to fly before they heard any thing of <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a>'s death. For thus he says: But they having been ill-treated, and especially the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, half of whose ships were sorely shattered, consulted to take their flight into Greece. But let him be permitted so to name (or rather reproach) this retreat of theirs before the fight; but having before called it a flight, he both now styles it a flight, and will again a little after term it a flight; so bitterly does he adhere to this word flight. Presently after this, says he, there came to the barbarians in the pinnace a man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389231PHis class=place long=23.0905 lat=38.9466>Hestiaea</a>, who acquainted them with the flight of the Grecians from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390232SArt class=place long=23.217 lat=39.0097>Artemisium</a>. They, because the thing seemed incredible, kept the messenger in custody, and sent forth some light galleys to discover the truth. But what is this you say? That they fled as conquered, whom the enemies after the fight could not believe to have fled, as having got much the better? Is then this a fellow fit to be believed when he writes of any man or city, who in one word deprives Greece of the victory, throws down the trophy, and pronounces the inscriptions they had set up to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> Proseoa (Eastward-looking) to be nothing but pride and vain boasting? The tenor of the inscription was as follows: When <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> youth had in a naval fight All Asia's forces on this sea o'erthrown, And all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> army put to flight, Than which a greater scarce was ever known, To show how much <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> they respected, This trophy to her honor they erected. Moreover, not having described any order of the Greeks, nor told us what place every city of theirs held during the sea-fight, he says that in this retreat, which he calls their flight, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=ethnic long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthians</a> sailed first and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> last. </p>                        </div>

And yet a little after he will say, that thirteen cities of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=ethnic long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocians</a> were burned by the barbarians, their country laid waste, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386229SAba class=place long=22.8956 lat=38.6366>temple</a> which was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386229PAba class=place long=22.917 lat=38.587>Abae</a> set on fire, and all of both sexes put to the sword, except those that by flight escaped to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385226LPar class=place long=22.6219 lat=38.5354>Parnassus</a>. Nevertheless, he puts those who suffered all extremities rather than lose their honesty in the same rank with those who most affectionately sided with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>. And when he could not blame the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=ethnic long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocians</a>' actions, he sat at his desk devising false causes and framing suspicions against them, and bidding us judge them not by what they did, but by what they would have done if the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> had not taken the same side, as if they had been shut out from treason because they found the place already occupied by others! Now if any one, going about to excuse the revolt of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, should say that they would not have done it but for the hatred they bare the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=ethnic long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocians</a>, — whom when they saw joined to the Greeks, they against their inclinations followed the party of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, — would not such a one be thought most shamefully to flatter, and for the sake of others to prevert the truth, by feigning good causes for evil actions? Indeed, I think, he would. Why then would not he be thought openly to calumniate, who says that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=ethnic long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocians</a> chose the best, not for the love of virtue, but because they saw the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> on the contrary side? For neither does he refer this device to other authors, as he is elsewhere wont to do, but says that himself found it out by conjecture. He should therefore have produced certain arguments, by which he was persuaded that they, who did things like the best, followed the same counsels with the worst. For what he alleges of their enmities is ridiculous. For neither did the difference between the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig class=ethnic long=23.425 lat=37.75>Aiginetans</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, nor that between the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236PCha class=ethnic long=23.6153 lat=38.4597>Chalcidians</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=ethnic long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretrians</a>, nor yet that between the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=ethnic long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthians</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a>, hinder them from fighting together for Greece. Nor did the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, their most bitter enemies, divert the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> from their friendship with the barbarians, by joining the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> party themselves. For the common danger did so bury their private grudges, that banishing their other passions, they applied their minds either to honesty for the sake of virtue, or to profit through the impulse of necessity. And indeed, after that necessity which compelled them to obey the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> was over, they returned again to the Greeks, as <a href=/people/3409 target=_blank>Lacrates</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=person long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a> has openly testified of them.

So unable he is to praise without dispraising, that if he commends one man he must condemn a whole city or people. But in this there give testimony against him, of the more ancient writers <a href=/people/637 target=_blank>Hellanicus</a>, and of the later <a href=/people/225 target=_blank>Ephorus</a>, one of which says that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=ethnic long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxians</a> came with six ships to aid the Greeks, and the other with five.

For the writers of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=demonym long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxian</a> annals say, that they had before beaten back <a href=/people/1889 target=_blank>Megabates</a>, who came to their island with two hundred ships, and after that had put to flight the general <a href=/people/1263 target=_blank>Datis</a>, who had set their city on fire. Now if, as <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> has elsewhere said, the barbarians burned their city so that the men were glad to save themselves by flying into the mountains, most surely had they just cause rather to send aid to the destroyers of their country than to help the protectors of the common liberty. But that he framed this lie not so much to honor <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a>, as to cast infamy on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=ethnic long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxians</a>, is manifest from his omitting and wholly passing over in silence the valiant acts then performed by <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a>, of which <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> gives us an account in this epigram: When as the Greeks at sea the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> did meet, And had near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380236ASSB class=place long=23.573 lat=37.952>Salamis</a> a naval fight, <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> as third led up the fleet, Charging the enemy with all his might; He took five of their ships, and did another, Which they had taken from the Greeks, recover. </p>                        </div>

And about the farther part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379235PSal class=demonym long=23.5408 lat=37.952>Salaminian</a> coast, he was met by a pinnace, out of which one spake thus to him: Thou indeed, <a href=/people/1551 target=_blank>Adimantus</a>, fliest, having betrayed the Grecians; yet they overcome, and according to their desires have the better of their enemies.

For neither is it probable, that such honor would have been shown to a coward and a traitor after his decease; nor would he have dared to give his daughters the names of Nausinica, Acrothinius, and Alexibia, and his son that of <a href=/people/1364 target=_blank>Aristeas</a>, if he had not performed some illustrious and memorable action in that fight. Nor is it credible that <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> was ignorant of that which could not be unknown even to the meanest <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=demonym long=28.7 lat=37.01>Carian</a>, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a> women alone made that glorious and divine prayer, by which they besought the Goddess <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> to inspire their husbands with a love of fighting against the barbarians. For it was a thing divulged abroad, concerning which <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> made an epigram to be inscribed on the brazen image set up in that temple of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> which is said to have been founded by <a href=/people/165 target=_blank>Medea</a>, when she desired the Goddess, as some affirm, to deliver her from loving her husband <a href=/people/102 target=_blank>Jason</a>, or, as others say, to free him from loving <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a>. The tenor of the epigram follows: For those who, fighting on their country's side, Opposed th' imperial Mede's advancing tide, We, votaresses, to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363230PKyt class=place long=23.0291 lat=36.2295>Cythera</a> pray'd; Th' indulgent power vouchsafed her timely aid, And kept the citadel of Hellas free From rude assaults of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>'s archery.

He then persuaded them to send forth the army, telling them that the fortification on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a>, by which they had fenced in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a>, would be of no avail if the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> joined themselves with <a href=/people/252 target=_blank>Mardonius</a>. This counsel then drew <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a> with his army to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233LPlB class=place long=23.3012 lat=38.2446>Plataea</a>; but if any private business had kept that <a href=/people/5556 target=_blank>Chileus</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375224PTeg class=place long=22.429 lat=37.464>Tegea</a>, Greece had never been victorious. </p>                        </div>

He says that, contending for the second place with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375224PTeg class=ethnic long=22.429 lat=37.464>Tegeatans</a> they made mention of the <a href=/people/324 target=_blank>Heraclidae</a>, alleged their acts against the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a>, and the sepulchres of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=ethnic long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesians</a> that died under the walls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Cadmea</a>, and at last ambitiously brought down their discourse to the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381241LMaB class=place long=24.0002 lat=38.144>Marathon</a>, saying, however, that they would be contented with the command of the left wing. A little after, he says, <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> yielded them the first place, desiring them to fight in the right wing against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and give them the left, who excused themselves as not skilled in fighting against the barbarians. Now it is a ridiculous thing, to be unwilling to fight against an enemy unless one has been used to him. But he says farther, that the other Greeks being led by their captains to encamp in another place, as soon as they were moved, the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> fled with joy towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233LPlB class=place long=23.3012 lat=38.2446>Plataea</a>, and in their flight came as far as <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>'s temple. In which place indeed he charges them all in general with disobedience, cowardice, and treason. At last he says, that only the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375224PTeg class=ethnic long=22.429 lat=37.464>Tegeates</a> fought with the barbarians, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a>; equally defrauding all the other cities of their part in the honor of the victory, whilst he affirms that none of them joined in the fight, but that all of them, sitting still hard by in their arms, betrayed and forsook those who fought for them; that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378226PPhl class=ethnic long=22.648 lat=37.846>Phliasians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a> indeed, when they heard <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a> had got the better, came in late, and falling on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=demonym long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Theban</a> <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, were all cut off; that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=ethnic long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthians</a> were not at the battle, and that after the victory, by pressing on over the hills, they escaped the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=demonym long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Theban</a> cavalry. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a>, after the barbarians were overthrown, going before with their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, affectionately assisted them in their flight; to return them thanks (forsooth) for the marks they had stigmatized them with at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388225FThe class=place long=22.536 lat=38.795>Thermopylae</a>! Now what rank the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=ethnic long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthians</a> had in the fight at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233LPlB class=place long=23.3012 lat=38.2446>Plataea</a> against the barbarians, and how they performed their duty, you may hear from <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> in these verses: I' th' midst were men, in warlike feats excelling, Who Ephyre, full of springs, inhabited, And who in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>, <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucus</a>' city, dwelling, Great praise by their great valor merited; Of which they to perpetuate the fame, To th' Gods of well-wrought gold did offerings frame. For he wrote not these things, as one that taught at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a> or that made verses in honor of the city, but only as recording these actions in elegiac verses. But <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>, whilst he desires to prevent that objection by which those might convince him of lying who should ask, Whence then are so many mounts, tombs, and monuments of the dead, at which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233PPla class=ethnic long=23.2733 lat=38.2213>Plataeans</a>, even to this day, celebrate funeral solemnities in the presence of the Greeks? — has charged, unless I am mistaken, a fouler crime than that of treason on their posterity. For these are his words: As for the other sepulchres that are seen in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233PPla class=place long=23.2733 lat=38.2213>Plataea</a>, I have heard that their successors, being ashamed of their progenitors' absence from this battle, erected every man a monument for posterity's sake. Of this treacherous deserting the battle <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> was the only man that ever heard. For if any Greeks withdrew themselves from the battle, they must have deceived <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a>, <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>. Neither yet did the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> exclude the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig class=ethnic long=23.425 lat=37.75>Aiginetans</a> who were their adversaries from the inscription, nor convince the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=ethnic long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthians</a> of having fled from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380236ASSB class=place long=23.573 lat=37.952>Salamis</a> before the victory, Greece bearing witness to the contrary. Indeed <a href=/people/3802 target=_blank>Cleadas</a>, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233PPla class=person long=23.2733 lat=38.2213>Plataean</a>, ten years after the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> war, to gratify, as <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> says, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig class=ethnic long=23.425 lat=37.75>Aiginetans</a>, erected a mount bearing their name. How came it then to pass that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>, who were so jealous of each other that they were presently after the war ready to go together by the ears about the setting up a trophy, did not yet repel those Greeks who fled in a fear from the battle from having a share in the honor of those that behaved themselves valiantly, but inscribed their names on the trophies and colossuses, and granted them part of the spoils? Lastly they set up an altar, on which was engraven this epigram: The Greeks, by valor having put to flight The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and preserved their country's right, Erected here this altar which you see, To <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, preserver of their liberty. Did <a href=/people/3802 target=_blank>Cleadas</a>, O <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>, or some other, write this also, to oblige the cities by flattery? What need had they then to employ fruitless labor in digging up the earth, to make tombs and erect monuments for posterity's sake, when they saw their glory consecrated in the most illustrious and greatest donaries? <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a> indeed, when he was aspiring to the tyranny, set up this inscription in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>: <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a>, of Greeks the general, When he the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> in fight had overthrown, Offered to <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a> a memorial Of victory, this monumental stone. In which he gave the glory to the Greeks, whose general he professed himself to be. Yet the Greeks not enduring but utterly misliking it, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>, sending to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, caused this to be cut out, and the names of the cities, as it was fit, to be engraven instead of it. Now how is it possible that the Greeks should have been offended that there was no mention made of them in the inscription, if they had been conscious to themselves of deserting the fight? or that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> would have erased the name of their leader and general, to insert deserters and such as withdrew themselves from the common danger? For it would have been a great indignity, that <a href=/people/3696 target=_blank>Sophanes</a>, <a href=/people/5405 target=_blank>Aeimnestus</a>, and all the rest who showed their valor in that fight, should calmly suffer even the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374244PKyt class=ethnic long=24.395 lat=37.409>Cythnians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367244PMel class=ethnic long=24.4199 lat=36.7389>Melians</a> to be inscribed on the trophies; and that <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>, attributing that fight only to three cities, should raze all the rest out of those and other sacred monuments and donaries. </p>                        </div>

To wit, when <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> himself was present, the barbarians were with much difficulty compelled by scourges to fight with the Greeks; but at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233LPlB class=place long=23.3012 lat=38.2446>Plataea</a>, having taken other resolutions, as <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> says, they were no way inferior in courage and strength; but their garments being without armor was prejudicial to them, since being naked they fought against a completely armed enemy. What then is there left great and memorable to the Grecians of those fights, if the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> fought with unarmed men, and the other Greeks, though present, were ignorant of the battle; if empty monuments are set up everywhere, and tripods and altars full of lying inscriptions are placed before the Gods; if, lastly, <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> only knows the truth, and all others that give any account of the Greeks have been deceived by the fame of those glorious actions, as the effect of an admirable prowess?

These things delight, please, and affect all men.
