And now I shall begin by tracing the origin of this great upheaval. <br />When <a href=/people/433 target=_blank>Dido</a> long ago fled across the sea from the land of <a href=/people/2015 target=_blank>Pygmalion</a>, leaving behind her the realm polluted by her brother's guilt, she landed on the destined shore of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. There she bought land for a price and founded a new city, where she was permitted to lay strips of a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>'s hide round the strand. Here — so remote antiquity believed — <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a> elected to found for the exiles a nation to last for ever, preferring it to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>, and to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377228PMyk class=place long=22.7561 lat=37.7308>Mycenae</a>, the city of <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> and her chosen dwelling-place. But when she saw <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> lifting her head high among aspiring cities, and even sending fleets across the sea to carry her victorious standards over all the earth, then the goddess felt the danger close and stirred up in the minds of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a> a frenzy for war. But the effort of their first campaign was crushed, and the enterprise of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> was wrecked on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> sea; and then <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a> took up the sword again for a fresh conflict. </p>                        </div>

Then, rejoicing in that man of blood, and aware of the fierce storm of disasters in store for the realm of <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a>, she spoke thus: In defiance of me, the exile from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> brought <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401264UDar class=place long=26.3725 lat=40.086>Dardania</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=place long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latium</a>, together with his household gods — deities that were twice taken prisoners; and he gained a victory and founded a kingdom for the Teucrians at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417125ULav class=place long=12.4793 lat=41.6564>Lavinium</a>.

With these words she fired the youthful warrior for deeds of battle. <br />By nature he was eager for action and faithless to his plighted word, a past master in cunning but a strayer from justice.

Often too the servants who slept at his door were roused and terrified by a fierce cry that broke the desolate silence, and found their master dripping with sweat, while he fought battles still to come and waged imaginary warfare. <br />When he was a mere child, his father's passion had kindled in <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> this frenzy against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and the realm of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a>, and started him on his glorious career. <a href=/people/235 target=_blank>Hamilcar</a>, sprung from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=demonym long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrian</a> house of ancient Barcas, reckoned his long descent from <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a>.

Thus nobly born and a proved warrior, <a href=/people/235 target=_blank>Hamilcar</a>, as soon as <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> could speak and utter his first distinct words, sowed war with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> in the boy's heart; and well he knew how to feed angry passions. <br />In the centre of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> stood a temple, sacred to the spirit of <a href=/people/433 target=_blank>Elissa</a>, the foundress, and regarded with hereditary awe by the people.

The freedom of the inhabitants and their ancestral glory were preserved by treaty; and by it the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> were forbidden to rule the city. <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> leader broke the treaty and brought his camp-fires close and shook the wide plains with his marching host. He himself, shaking his head in fury, rode round the walls on his panting steed, taking the measure of the terrified buildings. He bade them open their gates at once and desert their rampart; he told them that, now they were besieged, their treaties and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> would be far away, and that they could not hope for quarter, if defeated: Decrees of the Senate, he cried, law and justice, honour and Providence, are all in my hand now. In eager haste he confirmed his taunts by hurling his javelin and struck <a href=/people/3407 target=_blank>Caicus</a> through his armour, as he stood on the wall and uttered idle threats. Pierced right through the middle, down he fell; his body at once slipped down from the steep rampart; and in death he restored to his conqueror the spear warmed with his blood. Then with loud shouting the soldiers followed the example of their leader, and wrapped the walls round with a black cloud of missiles. Their prowess was seen and not hidden by their numbers; turning his face to the general, each man fought as if he were the only combatant. One hurled volleys of bullets with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397032IGym class=demonym long=3.25 lat=39.65>Balearic</a> sling: standing erect, he brandished the light thong thrice round his head, and launched his missile in the air, for the winds to carry; another poised whizzing stones with strong arm; a third threw a lance speeded by a light strap. </p>                        </div>

They attack the rampart with bare hands and, when thrust down from the walls, leave there their severed limbs. A high mound was erected and placed parties of combatants above the city. But the besieged were protected and the enemy kept away from the gates by the falarica, which many arms at once were wont to poise.

This weapon often confounded <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> when it carried aloft the smoking limbs of his men by its swift stroke; and, when in its flight it struck the side of a huge tower, it kindled a fire which burnt till all the woodwork of the tower was utterly consumed, and buried men and arms together under the blazing ruins.

Mindful of the future and musing on the war to come, <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a>, prophet-like, uttered this advice from his lofty soul. Thus many a veteran pilot, when from his high poop he sees by tokens that the gale will soon fall upon his canvas, reefs his sails in haste upon the topmast. But tears, and grief mixed with resentment, made them all eager to hasten the unknown future. Senators were chosen to approach <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>; if he turned a deaf ear to his engagements and fought on, they must then turn their steps to the city of Carthafre and declare war without delay against men unmindful of the gods. </p>                        </div>

Not yet was his rage sated; for he fixed her head on a lofty pike, for all to see, and bade men bear it in front of the Punic army, and drive the chariot with speed to the town. Blind to his doom and deserted by divine favour, <a href=/people/961 target=_blank>Theron</a> fought on; but death was near him. For <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> came up, with wrath and menace expressed in every feature; with frenzied heart he raged at the slaughter of <a href=/people/3347 target=_blank>Asbyte</a>, and at the horrid trophy of her head borne aloft. And, as soon as his shield of glittering brass shone out, and the armour on his swift limbs, rattling afar, thundered forth doom, the enemy were suddenly stricken with fear and fled in haste towards the town.

Thus panic drove the frightened soldiers headlong, and they rushed on blindly. Ah! how sweet is the light of heaven! Why do men shun with such terror the death that must some day come, and the sentence pronounced against them at birth? They curse their design, and lament their sally from the protection of the gates and the wall. <a href=/people/961 target=_blank>Theron</a> can hardly stop their flight, using force sometimes and sometimes loud threats: Stand fast, my men; yon enemy belongs to me; stand fast — victory in a mighty combat is coming to me. </p>                        </div>

When the snow thawed, it swallowed down the men in its opened jaws, and, as it rushed down from a height, buried whole companies beneath an avalanche.

Here, where now you see the altar and the shady groves, the dove — marvellous to tell — chose out a leader of the flock, and stood between the horns of his fleecy head, and prophesied to the people of Marmarica. Later, trees sprang suddenly from the earth, and a grove of ancient oaks; and, as the branches now reach the skies, so they grew on their first day. Hence the grove is sacred and awful from ancient times, and is worshipped with steaming altars. While we marvelled at his words, the doors suddenly flew open with a terrible crash, and a brighter light suddenly struck upon our eyes. Before the altar stood the priest, conspicuous in his snow-white robe, and the people thronged eagerly to the doors. Then when I had uttered the message with which I was charged, behold! the god suddenly entered the breast of the prophet. The trees clashed against one another, and a deep humming noise passed through the resounding grove; and then a </p>                        </div>

Soon the combatants were separated only by as much ground as a lance sped by a thong can cover, when suddenly all eyes and thoughts were turned to the sky by a portent appearing in the clear and cloudless heavens.

But now an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>, coming up from the East, forced the hawk at last to fly for refuge to the unsubstantial clouds.

And now <a href=/people/5945 target=_blank>Quirinius</a>, to whom flight was a thing unknown, and whose dauntless heart chose death with wounds in front, when the battle went against them, showed mighty daring, while those around him trembled.

Cruel too was the doom by which brave Leponticus fell. For when he boldly threw himself in the consul's way, catching hold of the reins, and, though on foot, reaching up to the level of the rider's face, down came the heavy sword on the centre of his forehead, and the head, split in two, fell upon the shoulders. Then Batus, while he fought madly against <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>'s <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and warded off attacks with his shield, was stretched on the yellow sand by a blow from the steed, and his face was crushed out of recognition by the stamping hoofs.

His wrath grew fiercer as they got closer, and he fastened his gaze upon the coveted victim.

Well, learn it now! As he spoke, he threw his spear, whose knotted strength and firehardened point were fit to batter down even a city gate. With a dreadful sound it flew; but it went too far, misjudging the distance to be crossed, and the foe was too close; so it passed over the consul's head. </p>                        </div>

Through the many folds of linen it sped and through the shield fashioned of hide, and pierced with the length of its point his inmost breast.

Even so, when masons build on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscan</a> shore, they hurl a mass of stone from a height upon the water with a mighty noise, to battle with the sea and the invisible currents below: the sea roars; and the deep, parted by the blow, receives the huge mass as it crashes beneath the angry water. Deprived of their leader, the Gauls had recourse to flight; all their confidence and all their valour depended upon a single life. So the hunter on the top of Mount Picanus harries the haunts of wild beasts, and all through the untrodden thickets spreads fell destruction in their crowded lairs; while the fire is silently gathering strength and flame, the tops of the pinetrees are gradually wrapt in black darkness, and the thick smoke goes eddying to the sky; but soon flames blaze out suddenly over the whole mountain: a crackling is heard, the wild beasts flee, the birds flee, and the heifers are startled in the lowland valleys far away. <br />When <a href=/people/343 target=_blank>Mago</a> saw that the ranks of Gaul had turned back and that their first effort had failed (and that people is incapable of a second), he summoned to battle his own men and the cavalry of his country. </p>                        </div>

The general, standing erect, matched his strength against the onset of the waves, and held up the rushing river with his shield. But behind him also the foaming flood with roaring blast bedewed with its spray the topmost plume of his helmet.

Soon the foliage of the fir-tree was seared, and the leaves of pine and alder; soon nothing was left of the poplar but the trunk, and the tree sent off into the sky the birds that were wont to nest on its branches. The devouring flame sucked the moisture from the very bottom of the stream and licked it up; and the blood upon the banks was dried up and caked by the fierce heat.

The <a href=/people/952 target=_blank>Naiads</a>, in their green cave far below, comforted and cherished the boy, when he shrank from his bride's embrace and that watery world.

The Roman general was marching over the uneven ground, ahead even of his standards; all his cavalry hastened in confusion after him; the skirmishers were not arrayed in separate companies; the footmen were mixed up with the body of cavalry; and the unwarlike rabble of camp-followers filled the air with ominous uproar, and went into battle like fugitives. Then, in addition, the lake itself breathed forth a black and blinding mist, so that the doomed army could see nothing on any side; and the sky, hidden beneath night's dark robe, was gloomy with pitch-black clouds. Nor did <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> forget his cunning. He lay in hiding with sword in rest; no advance of his blocked the progress of the foe. Their course was free; and far and wide, as in the stillness of peace, stretched the unguarded shore — the shore, from which there would soon be no returning; for, the path narrowing as it passed into the closing gorge, their route led into the trap; and a double doom, with the cliffs on one side and the barrier of the lake on the other, kept them fast in the toils. </p>                        </div>

For Tauranus, while following the stragglers, had found his way to a high wood, where he leant his back against an ancient elm-tree and tried to shield himself with its trunk against attack; and there with his last words he summoned the comrades he had left behind. In vain; for the spear of Sychaeus pierced him, and, after swiftly passing through his body, lodged in the tree that stood in its path. <br />What ailed ye, O men? Was it divine wrath or disastrous panic that possessed your minds, when you gave up fighting and sought help in trees? Fear is indeed an evil counsellor in danger: the stern issue proved that cowardice gives bad advice.

Then, as one climbed above another in his eagerness to reach a place of safety, some fell to the ground, deceived by the rotten boughs and decay of the treacherous tree, while others hung in terror in the lofty tree-top, a mark for missiles. Eager to destroy them all in their distress by the same death, Sychaeus changed his weapon: he laid down his shield and caught up at once his brazen battle-axe. His comrades lent a hand, and the tree, yielding to repeated blows, creaked with a crashing sound. The wretched fugitives toss to and fro when the trunk is smitten; as, when the blast of the West- wind rocks ancient groves, the bird and her nest also are tossed about, and she can scarce find foothold on the swaying tree-top. At last the unfriendly oak, a sorry refuge in trouble, fell under the blows of many axes, and crushed the men's limbs in its far-spreading downfall. <br />Other forms of disaster followed.

The victim fell and, as he died, bit the earth with bleeding mouth.

Recognizing the face of their proud conqueror, he cried: Art thou he whom the <a href=/people/566 target=_blank>Boii</a> so much dreaded? I intend this weapon to decide whether blood will flow, when such a hero is wounded. And you, my countrymen, shrink not from offering up this victim to our noble dead.

Now the hour of vengeance summons him. Then the consul was overwhelmed with missiles that rained from all sides alike; and, covered by the shower that hurtled through the sky, he left to none the power of boasting that his hand had slain <a href=/people/504 target=_blank>Flaminius</a>. When the leader was slain, the fighting ceased. For the foremost soldiers closed their ranks; and then, enraged against Heaven and themselves for their defeat, and thinking it worse than death to see the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> conquer, they hastened eagerly to pile over the body of <a href=/people/504 target=_blank>Flaminius</a> and <br />walked in front of their conqueror's chariot to the temple of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>. </p>                        </div>

Then, as the trembling wretch called on his companions with his latest utterance, the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> seized him and swallowed him down with a gulp of its black throat — I looked back and saw it — and buried him in its beastly maw.

But the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> attacked him in midstream, carried his body to the bank, and there devoured it — a dreadful form of death! <br /> Thus I alone was suffered to escape from the monster so terrible and deadly. I ran as fast as grief would let me, and told all to the general. He groaned aloud, in pity for the cruel fate of his men. Then, eager as he ever was for war and battle and conflict with the foe, and burning with a passion for great achievements, he ordered his men to arm instantly, and his cavalry, well tried in many a fight, to take the field. </p>                        </div>

No levy was held: the clan of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, unhelped by the State, made up an army. From a single house — marvellous to tell! — there went forth an army of patricians to fight side by side. Three hundred leaders sprang to arms, and with any one of them in command you might have fought a campaign with confidence.

The smoke-grimed door welcomed a willing guest; the meal was set, in the fashion of that simple age, in front of the hearth; nor was the happy host aware that he entertained a god; but, as his fathers used lo do, he ran hither and thither with kindly zeal, tasking his failing strength. At last the feast was set — fruit in clean baskets, and dainties dripping dew which he hastened to cull from his well-watered garden.

Then in confused haste she hurried back to her chamber, and suddenly trembled and stood still, fearing to touch that sacred couch. Next in her distraction, she first clasps the beauteous image of radiant lulus, and then, quickly turning her whole mind to your likeness, hangs upon your image, making her plaint to you and hoping for an answer. <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a> never abandons hope. Now she leaves the palace and goes back in frenzy to the harbour, in case some wind may shift its course and blow you back.

Also, though a bad citizen, skilful to stir up trouble and kindle hatred, he was helpless in the field, unpractised in the conduct of war, and not approved by any deed of valour; but he hoped to gain martial glory by his tongue and sounded the war-cry from the Rostrum. Therefore he bestirred himself; and, professing to blame <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> for delay, he attacked the Senate in a speech to the people, as if he were already victorious; The supreme power is yours, he said, and from you I, the consul, ask directions for the conduct of the war.

Back they went to camp; and <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> loudly lamented, because he saw that to-morrow the command would devolve on a madman, and that he had saved the lives of his men to no purpose. For <a href=/people/79 target=_blank>Varro</a>, in fierce anger and resenting the postponement of battle, addressed him thus: Is this the way, <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a>, you show gratitude and repay me for saving your life } Is this the reward of those who rescued you from the laws and from a jury that meant mischief? Better bid our men at once surrender to the foe the swords and weapons which you called back from battle; or snatch them yourself from their grasp. But you, my men, whose faces I saw wet with tears when <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> ordered you to turn your backs in retreat, break with custom and anticipate the word of command for battle: let each man be his own commander and rush to action as soon as the first rays of the sun are thrown on the summit of Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418161UGar class=place long=16.06 lat=41.83>Garganus</a>. I shall open the gates of the camp myself with no delay. Rush ahead, and make up for the opportunity you were robbed of today. Thus in his excitement he tried to animate the sick hearts of his men with a fatal desire for battle. Meanwhile <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> underwent a change: he felt and looked now as when he stood after the battle and the field lay before him strewn with Roman corpses; for the imminent disaster pressed upon his very sight. So sits a mother stunned and senseless, when all hope of her son's life is lost, and she cherishes with a last fruitless embrace the limbs that are not yet cold. He spoke thus: By the walls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> so often shaken, </p>                        </div>

And now <a href=/people/5240 target=_blank>Satricus</a> had come with his king among the foreign invaders; and the <a href=/people/12044 target=_blank>Gaetulians</a> were willing enough, when occasion required, to use his services to interpret Latin speech. But when the chance was given him of revisiting his native town and he could hope to see his father's house again, he summoned night to aid his enterprise and stole out of the hated camp. But he fled unarmed: to carry a shield might betray his design, and he started home with no weapon in his hand. Therefore he scanned the armour of the dead who lay on the field, and armed himself with weapons taken from the corpse of <a href=/people/1752 target=_blank>Mancinus</a>. Now he felt less fear; but it was his own son, slain a few hours before by a Libyan foe, whose limbs he had stripped, and from whose lifeless body he had taken the spoils which now he carried. Now when night came and sleep began, his other son, <a href=/people/5260 target=_blank>Solimus</a>, came forth from the Roman camp, to relieve in his allotted turn the watch at the gate, and searched for the body of his brother, <a href=/people/1752 target=_blank>Mancinus</a>, among the corpses lying on the field; he wished to bury the hapless youth secretly. He had not hastened far when he saw an armed enemy coming towards him from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> camp.

But then, when he saw no soldiers following close behind, but only a single man walking alone in the dark, he sprang up from the tomb and threw his javelin at his father's unprotected back. </p>                        </div>

Then the young man, fired with sudden wrath, cried out: No true son of <a href=/people/5240 target=_blank>Satricus</a>, no native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420139USul class=place long=13.9256 lat=42.0468>Sulmo</a>, should I be, and no brother of <a href=/people/1752 target=_blank>Mancinus</a> — and I would own myself no worthy descendant of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=person long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> <a href=/people/5260 target=_blank>Solimus</a>, if I suffered this man to escape unpunished!

The old man, who recognized <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> by the light he shed, was no laggard: willingly he urged on his troop of sons into the fierce conflict, bidding them hurl their weapons thick and fast, and disregard his fire-breathing nostrils and the flames that came from his helmet.

And now Crista was fain to set an example for the contest that summoned them: see, his spear flies swiftly past through the space between. But the point could not penetrate the many plates of the golden corslet; the spear hung down, and the feeble blow betrayed the failing powers of the thrower.

The men, though weary, made haste to do his bidding. They dispersed to the neighbouring copses and felled the trees; and the high woods on the leafy hills resounded with the axe. Here ash-trees and tall poplars with white foliage were smitten and cleft by sturdy arms, and there holm-oaks, planted by a former generation. Down came oaks and pine-trees that love the shore, and cypresses that deck the funeral train and mourn beside the pyre.

Moreover, the senators oppressed the people, the masses welcomed the unpopularity of the senate, and civil discord made the parties clash. Meanwhile the old men, more corrupt themselves, outdid the headstrong follies of the young. Men notorious for humble birth and obscure origin asserted their claims, expecting and demanding to hold office before others, and to rule the sinking state.

And, if the Romans refused to share their curule chair and to admit a partner, with a second set of axes, to the high office, then one who would avenge the rebuff was near and in full view.

When <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> saw this avalanche of arms and men advancing, he lost courage and confidence.

Behold, <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a>! Then he called the hero's ghost to watch, while he drove his sharp spear through the ribs of the fugitive.

That day first proved, what none would have dared to believe, though the gods had promised it — that the Libyan leader could be withstood in battle.

The hind had become the deity of the city; the people believed that it had <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a> for its mistress, and offered incense to it as to other deities. This animal was long-lived: it was fortunate enough to prolong a green old age through a thousand years of activity, and numbered as many centuries as the city founded by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> exiles; but now death came to it at last. For a fierce pack of <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a> had entered the city in the darkness of night — an evil omen in time of war — and the hind, startled by their sudden onset, had sallied forth from the gates at early dawn, and sought, in wild alarm, the fields that lay near the walls.

When the command of <a href=/people/152 target=_blank>Fulvius</a> made him free to accept the challenge, he rushed forth jubilant, and rode over the open plain, sending up a billowy cloud of gathering dust. Disdaining the help of a thong or the use of a knotted strap to add force to his weapon, <a href=/people/2791 target=_blank>Taurea</a> brandished his spear with the strength of his unaided arm.

Boldness is the way to win a war. Valour without speed has never risen triumphant over danger. When there is great work to be done, do it instantly; dark death hovers over your head while you are acting. Thus he spoke, and departed. Next the ghost of <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> flitted up; in the upper world he was rich, but death had set him on a level with beggars. <br />And now <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> saw a figure moving along the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000GEly class=place long=23.73603 lat=37.96393>Elysian</a> path, whose hair rippled over his shining shoulders and was duly confined by a purple fillet.

Then, when he heard his conqueror's voice, the poor wretch, recalling his life as it were from <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a> in fear and trembling, tore from his chin the straps that bound his useless helmet, and asked for mercy at the same time.

For me it is right to save my enemy. The noble warrior is he, whose first and last thought is to keep faith even in time of war. You began it and saved me from death before I saved you. I should deserve the troubles I have met, and should deserve to meet again with worse troubles, if my right hand failed to clear a path for you through fire and sword. With these words he raised <a href=/people/7374 target=_blank>Beryas</a> willingly from the ground and granted a life in exchange for the life he had received. <br />Then <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>, having won his first battle on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> soil, moved forward with his army unmolested </p>                        </div>

Brought up in Africa, they showed their mixed origin, combining <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> cunning with the frivolity of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a>. <br /><a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> saw all this; and, now that the rebellion seemed a thing past mending and the enemy were beginning war unprovoked, he called the gods of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> to witness, with the rivers and lakes and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153WAre class=place long=15.2929 lat=37.0573>Arethusa</a>'s spring, that he was challenged to war against his will, and forced by the enemy to don those arms that he had long refused to put on. Then he assailed the walls with a tornado of missiles and thundered in arms against the city. The same ardour carried all his men along; they vied with one another in activity. There was a tower, a building of many floors that rose up to the sky; the genius of a Greek had given it ten stories and had used up many a shady tree for the work. From it the besieged busily launched lighted torches and stones, and filled the air with the menace of burning pitch. Then <a href=/people/2398 target=_blank>Cimber</a> aimed from a distance and threw a fire-brand, and the fatal weapon stuck fast in the side of the tower. The fire, fed and strengthened by the wind, spread the growing peril through the interior of the tower; climbing triumphant up the lofty structure and its ten successive stories, it quickly devoured the crackling timbers, till the victorious flames licked the tottering summit, while a huge cloud of smoke spouted up to the sky. Wreaths of smoke filled all the interior with black darkness, and not a single man escaped; as if struck by sudden lightning, the building crumbled down into ashes. </p>                        </div>

For when they came close to the buildings of the city, at a point where the harbour water laps gently against the walls, they were discomfited by the cunning device of an unexpected weapon. A spar like a ship's mast, skilfully rounded and with all its knots planed away, carried an ironclawed grapnel at its extremity; and this spar, when let down from the height of the wall, caught up the attackers with its iron claws, and, when it was hauled back, landed them within the city. Nor did this engine of war catch up men only: it often hoisted up a war-ship, when it struck the vessel from above with the descending steel of its unyielding jaws. As soon as it had fixed its iron point in the nearest ship and raised the vessel up into the air, then a piteous sight was seen: the cables were suddenly let go by machinery, and lowered their prey with such force and speed that the ship and her company were swallowed up whole by the sea. In addition to these devices, small loopholes were skilfully bored in the wall, through which weapons could be shot secretly and safely; for the high wall protected the marksmen. But their task was not free from danger; for weapons thrown by the enemy might come back in revenge by the same narrow openings. Thus the ingenuity of a Greek and cunning more powerful than force kept <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> and all his threats at bay by sea and land, and the mighty armament stood helpless before the walls. <br />There was living then in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a> a man who sheds immortal glory on his city, a man whose genius far surpassed that of other sons of earth.

By strength of limb he had burst the chains and started the ship; he dipped his oars and would have pulled the vessel along, had not the spear of <a href=/people/6596 target=_blank>Laronius</a>, hastily hurled, pinned him fast to the wooden thwart, as he rose with effort to his oar. </p>                        </div>

Neither helm nor prow was spared: each was broken up to use as a weapon; and floating missiles were picked up, to use again.

The Roman soldiers carried their victorious standards into the empty camp. Never did a captured city offer more plunder; and this, as <a href=/people/144 target=_blank>Hasdrubal</a> had foreseen, delayed the swords in their work of slaughter.

He paid highly for soldiers and spent lavishly on war the wealth he had gained by war. The zeal of that spirited people was quickened by masses of gold and silver which he had got from mines far away and sent on ahead of his march.

But the aged consul saw it and resented such fierceness and such arrogance in the heart of the barbarian: hurling his javelin, he robbed <a href=/people/404 target=_blank>Nabis</a> of his victim and his life at one blow, and proved victorious over the victor. <br /><a href=/people/144 target=_blank>Hasdrubal</a> heard with grief the cry with which <a href=/people/404 target=_blank>Nabis</a> fell, and hastened up.

In the front line under their standards the Gauls were stationed, men of great stature. Their ranks were broken by a sudden and violent attack in wedgelike formation; tired out by their straggling march, breathless after prolonged exertion, and distressed by the heat, they turned and fled with the unsteadiness characteristic of their nation. The Romans speared their backs; and the arrows flew close behind them and cut off their retreat.

Scarcely had the first hoof flashed into full view, when a wild storm of shouting rose up to heaven. Bending forward like the drivers, each man gazed at the chariot he favoured, and at the same time shouted to the flying <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. The course was shaken by the enthusiasm of the spectators, and excitement robbed every man of his senses.

They met with such fury as befits men maddened by the passion for a throne; and, falling dead together, they carried to the shades hearts glutted with abundant bloodshed. The swords, driven home with equal effort by both, pierced the vital parts, and the mortal wounds were followed by last words, till their ghastly spirits fled into the reluctant air, still uttering curses. Even in death their enmity persisted; for, when a common pyre was consuming their bodies together, the flame refused to unite and parted asunder; and their ashes refused to rest together. The other swordsmen received different gifts, according to their valour and skill. Some carried off <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> trained to plough the soil, and others took from among the Moorish captives </p>                        </div>

The maiden was beautiful; and her father <a href=/people/144 target=_blank>Hasdrubal</a> was famous. As soon as <a href=/people/301 target=_blank>Syphax</a> received her in the lofty marriage-chamber, as if the flame of the marriage-torch had set him on fire for the first time, he made over his resources to his Punic father-in-law and broke his treaty of friendship with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> by presenting his forces as a bridal gift to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. <br />Not the least of <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>'s cares was to warn <a href=/people/301 target=_blank>Syphax</a>; and envoys were sent and uttered threats.

But his warning was vain; for the bridegroom's ears were stopped. Therefore the general, angered by the failure of his counsel, had recourse to the sword; he appealed to the solemn oaths of alliance which the king had broken, and then began active warfare, leaving no device untried. As the enemy's tents were wattled with light rushes and reeds from the marshes, like the lonely cabins dear to the Moorish herdsman, <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> attacked the camp while darkness concealed his stratagem, and in the silence of night scattered fire-brands undetected. </p>                        </div>

The dread scourge sped like a whirlwind over the whole camp; the fire-god devoured his dry food with loud panting breath; and every tent spouted flame. Many, starting from their sleep, felt the fire before they saw it; and the flames stifled the cries of many for aid. The fire-god spread everywhere victorious, and seized men and arms in his fierce embrace. The plague broke all bounds, and the burnt-out camp flew up in white ash to the topmost clouds. The fire, crackling doom, made a great leap to surround the quarters of <a href=/people/301 target=_blank>Syphax</a> himself, and would have devoured him, had not an attendant, fearing disaster, dragged him, uttering many a curse, from the bed he slept on. <br />But presently, when the Massylian and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> generals had united their forces behind a common rampart, and fresh troops summoned from all the kingdom had mitigated the disaster of the night, anger and shame and love for his bride — a third incentive — filled the king's heart with inordinate passion: he breathed out savage threats and ground his teeth, to think that his face had been scorched by the fire in the camp, and that he had with difficulty been rescued from the foe, a naked man in the midst of his discomfited soldiers. No man on earth, he declared, could ever have conquered <a href=/people/301 target=_blank>Syphax</a> in bright daylight or in face of the sun.

Each man said to himself: See, see! how the Massylian king rides in front of his army and challenges us to battle! May mine be the arm to win this glory! He has profaned the altars of the gods and broken his word pledged to our stainless general. Let him be content with having escaped once from his camp on fire! Such were their thoughts, as they hurled their javelins with a will. The first flying spear lodged in the fiery nostrils of the king's charger. With blood dripping from his face, the animal reared up and beat the air with his forefeet; then he fell down, in rage and pain, and, tossing from side to side the part pierced by the spear-point, betrayed his rider into the hands of the enemy. They fell upon him; and, though he strove to draw the weapon from the wound and by it to raise his injured limbs from the ground, flight was impossible, and they seized him. Then chains and fetters were laid upon him — a sorry sight, and a warning never to trust prosperity — and the hands that had wielded the sceptre were tightly bound.
