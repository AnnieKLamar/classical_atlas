No one lives here. This was this place, <a href=/people/866 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a>, son of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, bravest and best of all the Greeks, where, many years ago, I left <a href=/people/448 target=_blank>Philoctetes</a>, son of <a href=/people/2131 target=_blank>Poeas</a>, a man from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388224RMal class=person long=22.4 lat=38.8>Malis</a>. I abandoned him, acting on orders from our two commanders. His foot was dripping with infectious sores, painful ulcers. He kept screaming all the time. His strange, wild howling rang throughout the camp. <br />He cried so much we could not pray in peace or make libations and burnt sacrifice. But what's the point in talking of that now? This is no time to tell long stories, for if he learns I'm here, then my whole scheme, the one I think will catch him quickly, fails. Look, your job is to carry out the tasks we still have left to do — to find a rock somewhere round here which has two openings, so shaped that when it's cool there are two seats facing the sun, and when it's hot, the breeze wafts sleep in through the chamber tunnel.

Then signal me, if you see those features there or somewhere else. After that I'll tell you my entire plan. Then both of us will carry out my scheme. 30 [NEOPTOLEMUS sets out searching, moving up towards the opening of the cave] <br />NEOPTOLEMUS: Lord <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, that task you mentioned — <br />I think we're close. I see a cave up here quite like the one you mentioned. <br />ODYSSEUS: Above you? Or below? I don't see it. NEOPTOLEMUS [approaching the mouth of the cave] <br />It's up here. High up. I can't hear a sound — no footsteps. <br />ODYSSEUS: Watch out. He may be there, in bed asleep. <br />NEOPTOLEMUS [peering into the cave] The place is empty. I don't see anyone. <br />ODYSSEUS: Anything in there which might indicate some human lives inside? <br />NEOPTOLEMUS: Yes, there is — a bed of leaves pressed down. Someone lives here. 40 <br />ODYSSEUS: Is it empty otherwise? Nothing else hidden in the cave? <br />NEOPTOLEMUS: There's a wooden cup, crudely made, some wretched craftsman's work — and kindling, too, set to light a fire. <br />ODYSSEUS: What you describe must be the things he owns. <br />NEOPTOLEMUS: Look here, there's something else. Rags left to dry — [NEOPTOLEMUS inspects the rags] Agh, they're full of pus! The stench! <br />ODYSSEUS: This is the spot. Obviously our man lives here and is nearby. </p>                        </div>

You have to trick him, lead his mind astray. When he asks who you are and where you're from, say you're <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>' son — no deception there.

Then <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> spoke up — it so happened he was there nearby — Yes, boy, they did. And rightly, too, because I rescued them. I was there to save their master's body. In my rage I began to heap on him every insult I could think of, all at once. If he meant to steal those weapons from me, then there was nothing I was holding back.

I will not disobey what you have said. <br />NEOPTOLEMUS: And I, too, will consent to this, as well. 1860 <br />HERCULES: Then do not spend a long time waiting here. <br />A stern wind will blow to urge you onward. The time is right to sail. <br />PHILOCTETES: All right, then, let me salute this land as I depart. Farewell, you cave that shared my vigil, and farewell, you nymphs of streams and meadows, you pounding headlands beaten by the sea, where in the inner spaces of my den the blasts from <a href=/people/1011 target=_blank>South Wind</a> often soaked my head, where the Hermaion Mount often echoed the cries I screamed out in my storms of pain. <br />But now, you <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=demonym long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycian</a> streams and waters, I am leaving you, going away at last, beyond all hopes I ever entertained. Farewell, you sea-encircled land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=place long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnos</a>, send me away content on a fair voyage, to the place ordained by mighty <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a>, by opinions of my friends, and by the god who conquers all and has brought this about. <br />CHORUS: Let's all leave in a group, once we have prayed to the ocean nymphs, so they will come and guide us safely on our journey home. [They all move off together] </p>                        </div>
