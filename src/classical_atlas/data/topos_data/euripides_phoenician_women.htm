He is still living in the palace, but sick in mind through his misfortunes he imprecates the most unhallowed curses on his children, that they may share this house with the sharpened sword. But these two, dreading lest the Gods should bring to completion these curses, should they dwell together, in friendly compact determined that <a href=/people/881 target=_blank>Polynices</a> the younger son should first go a willing exile from this land, but that <a href=/people/542 target=_blank>Eteocles</a> remaining here should hold the sceptre for a year, changing in his turn; but after that he sat on the throne of power, he moves not from his seat, but drives <a href=/people/881 target=_blank>Polynices</a> an exile from this land.

But I to quell this strife persuaded my son to come to his brother, confiding in a truce before he grasped the spear. And the messenger who was sent declares that he will come. But, O thou that inhabitest the shining clouds of heaven, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, preserve us, give reconciliation to my children; it becomes thee, if thou art wise, not to suffer the same man always to be unfortunate. </p>                        </div>

But what groan responsive to my sufferings, or what lament of music shall I invoke to my tears, to my tears, O house, O house, bearing these three kindred bodies, my mother, and her children, the joy of the fury? who destroyed the entire house of <a href=/people/173 target=_blank>Oidipus</a>, what time intelligently he unfolded the difficult song of the fierce monster, having thereby slain the body of the fierce musical <a href=/people/974 target=_blank>Sphinx</a>. Alas me! my father; what Grecian, or what Barbarian, or what other of the noble in birth, of mortal blood, in time of old ever bore such manifest sufferings of so many ills? Wretched I, how do I lament! What bird, sitting on the highest boughs of the oak or pine, will sing responsive to my lamentations, who have lost my mother? who weep the strain of grief in addition to these moans for my brothers, about to pass my long life in floods of tears. — Which shall I bewail? On which first shall I scatter the first offerings rent from my hair? On my mother's two breasts of milk, or upon the death-wounds of my two brothers? Alas! alas! Leave thine house, bringing thy sightless eye, O aged father, <a href=/people/173 target=_blank>Oidipus</a>, show thy wretched age, who within thy palace having poured the gloomy darkness over thine eyes, draggest on a long life.
