And even if, in our comparison, we analyse each life, as we would a poem or a picture, we shall find that the rise to political power and repute in consequence of innate excellence and strength, rather than of inherited advantages, is common to both. 2 But in the case of <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> was not yet great when he rose to eminence, and the leaders and generals with whom he dealt were men of moderate and uniform fortunes. The highest assessment of property in those days was five hundred bushels of grain, the second three hundred, the third and last two hundred. 3 Whereas <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, coming from a little town and from ways of life deemed rustic, plunged headlong into the boundless sea of Roman politics when they were no longer conducted by such men as <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a>, <a href=/people/820 target=_blank>Fabricius</a>, and <a href=/people/585 target=_blank>Atilius</a>, nor welcomed as magistrates and leaders poor men who had mounted the rostrum after working with their own hands at the plough and the mattock, but were wont to have regard rather for great families and their wealth, largesses, and solicitation, while those who sought office, such was now the power and arrogance of the people, were wantonly handled. 4 It was not the same thing to have <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a> for a rival, who was of no illustrious family and had only moderate possessions (he is said to have been worth three, or, at most, five talents when he entered public life), as it was to compete for pre-eminence with such men as <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio Africanus</a>, <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>, and <a href=/people/149 target=_blank>Quintus Flamininus</a>, having no other advantage than a tongue which spoke boldly for the right. </p>                        </div>

To this, more justly than to fortune and the guardian genius of the man, we may ascribe the fact that he was never visited with disgrace. That was a great tribute which was paid <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> the philosopher by <a href=/people/740 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, when he wrote concerning him, after his death, that in addition to all his other gifts, the man had also the gift of persuasion. </p>                        </div>

But the ability to conduct a household enters in no small degree into this higher political capacity, as most believe. For the city is but an organised sum of households, and has public vigour only as its citizens prosper in their private lives. When <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a> banished both silver and gold from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>, 2 and introduced there a coinage of iron that had been ruined by fire, he did not set his fellow citizens free from the duty of domestic economy. He merely removed the swollen and feverish wantonness of wealth, and so provided that all alike might have an abundance of the necessary and useful things of life. He did this because, better than any other ancient legislator, he foresaw that the helpless, homeless, and poverty-stricken citizen was a greater menace to the commonwealth than one who was rich and ostentatious. 3 <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, then, was no whit less efficient in the conduct of his household than in that of the city. He not only increased his own substance, but became a recognized teacher of domestic economy and agriculture for others, and compiled many useful precepts on these subjects. <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a>, on the other hand, was so poor as to bring even his righteousness into disrepute, as ruining a household, reducing a man to beggary, and profiting everybody rather than its possess or. 4 And yet <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> has much to say by way of exhorting us to righteousness allied with domestic economy, and abuses idleness as a source of injustice; <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> also says well:—<br />Labour I never liked, <br />Nor household thrift, which breeds good children.<br />But ships equipped with oars were ever my delight,<br />Battles and polished javelins and arrows, <br />implying that the men who neglect their households are the very ones to live by injustice. </p>                        </div>

Indeed, the poverty of <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> would seem to have been a blemish on his political career, if, as most writers state, he had not foresight enough to leave his poor daughters a marriage portion, or even the cost of his own burial. 6 And so it fell out that the family of <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> furnished <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> with praetors and consuls down to the fourth generation, for his grandsons, and their sons after them, filled the highest offices of state. Whereas, though <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> was foremost of the Greeks, the abject poverty of his descendants forced some to ply a fortune-teller's trade, and others, for very want, to solicit the public bounty, while it robbed them all of every ambition to excel, or even to be worthy of their great ancestor. </p>                        </div>

Poverty is never dishonourable in itself, but only when it is a mark of sloth, intemperance, extravagance, or thoughtlessness. When, on the other hand, it is the handmaid of a sober, industrious, righteous, and brave man, who devotes all his powers to the service of the people, it is the sign of a lofty spirit that harbours no mean thoughts. 2 It is impossible for a man to do great things when his thoughts are busy with little things; nor can he aid the many who are in need when he himself is in need of many things. A great equipment for public service consists, not in wealth, but in contented independence, which requires no private superfluities, and so puts no hindrance in the way of serving the commonwealth. God alone is absolutely free from wants; but that is the most perfect and god-like quality in human excellence which reduces man's wants to their lowest terms. 3 For as a body which is well tempered and vigorous needs no superfluous food or raiment, so a healthy individual or family life can be conducted with the simplest outlays. A man should make his gains tally with his needs. He who heaps up much substance and uses little of it, is not contented and independent. If he does not need it, he is a fool for providing what he does not crave; and if he craves it, he makes himself wretched by parsimoniously curtailing his enjoyment of it. <br />Indeed, I would fain ask <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> himself this question: </p>                        </div>

But if it be a fine thing, as indeed it is, to eat ordinary bread, and to drink such wine as labourers and servants drink, and not to want purple robes nor even plastered houses, then <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> and <a href=/people/150 target=_blank>Epaminondas</a> and <a href=/people/382 target=_blank>Manius</a> <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a> and <a href=/people/11011 target=_blank>Gaius</a> <a href=/people/820 target=_blank>Fabricius</a> were perfectly right in turning their backs on the gaining of what they scorned to use. 5 Surely it was not worth while for a man who, like <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, esteemed turnips a delectable dish and cooked them himself, while his wife was kneading bread, to babble so much about a paltry copper, and write on the occupation in which one might soonest get rich. Great is the simple life, and great its independence, but only because it frees a man from the anxious desire of superfluous things. 6 Hence it was that <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a>, as we are told, remarked at the trial of <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a> that only those who were poor in spite of themselves should be ashamed of their poverty; those who, like himself, chose poverty, should glory in it. And surely it were ridiculous to suppose that the poverty of <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> was due to his sloth, when, without doing anything disgraceful, but merely by stripping a single Barbarian, or seizing a single tent, he might have made himself rich. So much on this head. </p>                        </div>

For had he wished to beget more sons as good, he should have planned at the outset to marry a woman of family, instead of contenting himself, as long as he could do so secretly, with the society of a low concubine, and when he was discovered, making a man his father-in‑law whom he could most easily persuade, rather than one whose alliance would bring him most honour. </p>                        </div>
