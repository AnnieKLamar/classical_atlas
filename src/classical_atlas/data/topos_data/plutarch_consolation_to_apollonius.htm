For he was a sweet and modest young man, devout towards the Gods, obedient to his parents, and obliging to his friends; indeed doing all things that were just. But when the tears of his funeral were scarcely dry, I thought it a time very improper to call upon you and put you in mind that you should bear this accident like a man; for when this unexpected affliction made you languish both in body and mind, I considered then that compassion was more seasonable than advice. For the most skilful physicians do not put a sudden stop to a flux of humors, but give them time to settle, and then foment the swelling by softening and bringing it to a head with medicines outwardly applied. </p>                        </div>

Soft words alleviate a wounded heart, If you in time will mitigate the smart. <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> hath said wisely to this purpose: Our applications should suited be Unto the nature of the malady; Of sorrow we should wipe the tender eyes, But the immoderate weeper should chastise For of all the passions which move and afflict the mind of man, sorrow in its nature is the most grievous; in some they say it hath produced madness, others have contracted incurable diseases, and some out of the vehemence of it have laid violent hands upon themselves. </p>                        </div>

I dislike those who boast so much of hard and inflexible temper which they call apathy, it being a disposition which never happens and never could be of use to us; for it would extinguish that sociable love we ought to have for one another, and which it is so necessary above all things to preserve. But to mourn excessively and to accumulate grief I do affirm to be altogether unnatural, and to result from a depraved opinion we have of things; therefore we ought to shun it as destructive in itself, and unworthy of a virtuous man; but to be moderately affected by grief we cannot condemn. It were to be wished, saith <a href=/people/1532 target=_blank>Crantor</a> the Academic, that we could not be sick at all; but when a distemper seizeth us, it is requisite we should have sense and feeling in case any of our members be plucked or cut off. For that talked-of apathy can never happen to a man without great detriment; for as now the body, so soon the very mind would be wild and savage. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg076:4'><b>&sect; 4</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore in such accidents, it is but reasonable that they who are in their right senses should avoid both extremes, of being without any passion at all and of having too much; for as the one argues a mind that is obstinate and fierce, so the other doth one that is soft and effeminate. He therefore hath cast up his accounts the best, who, confining himself within due bounds, hath such ascendant over his temper, as to bear prosperous and adverse fortune with the same equality, whichsoever it is that happens to him in this life. He puts on those resolutions as if he were in a popular government where magistracy is decided by lot; if it luckily falls to his share, he obeys his fortune, but if it passeth him, he doth not repine at it. So we must submit to the dispensation of human affairs, without being uneasy and querulous. Those who cannot do this want prudence and steadiness of mind to bear more happy circumstances; for amongst other things which are prettily said, this is one remarkable precept of <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>: If <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> prove extravagantly kind, Above its temper do not raise thy mind; If she disclaims thee like a jilting dame, Be not dejected, but be still the same, Like gold unchanged amidst the hottest flame. For it is the part of a wise and well-educated man, not to be transported beyond himself with any prosperous events, and so, when the scene of fortune changeth, to observe still the comeliness and decency of his morals. For it is the business of a man that lives by rule, either to prevent an evil that threatens him, or, when it is come, to qualify its malignity and make it as little as he can, or put on a masculine brave spirit and so resolve to endure it. For there are four ways that prudence concerns herself about any thing that is good; she is either industrious to acquire or careful to preserve, she either augments or useth it well. These are the measures of prudence, and consequently those of all other virtues, by which we ought to square ourselves in either fortune. For no man lives who always happy is. And, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, you should not hinder what ought to be done: Those things which in their nature ought to be. </p>                        </div>

One considering this matter hath not said much from the purpose: Think not thyself, O <a href=/people/126 target=_blank>Atreus</a>' son, forlorn; Thou always to be happy wast not born. Even <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>'s self must be a shade, For thou of frail materials art made. <a href=/people/2830 target=_blank>Sorrow</a> and joy alternately succeed; 'Spite of thy teeth, the Gods have so decreed. These verses are <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>'s. If thou, O <a href=/people/5296 target=_blank>Trophimus</a>, of all mankind, Uninterrupted happiness couldst find; If when thy mother brought thee forth with pain, Didst this condition of thy life obtain, That only prosperous gales thy sails should fill, And all things happen 'cording to thy will; If any of the Gods did so engage, Such usage justly might provoke thy rage, Matter for smart resentment might afford, For the false Deity did break his word. But if thou unexcepted saw'st the light, Without a promise of the least delight, I say to thee (gravely in tragic style) Thou ought to be more patient all the while. In short, — and to say more there's no one can: Which is a name of frailty, thou'rt a man; A creature more rejoicing is not found, None more dejected creeps upon the ground. Though weak, yet he in politics refines, Involves himself in intricate designs; With nauseous business he himself doth cloy, And so the pleasure of his life destroy. In great pursuits thou never hast been cross'd No disappointments have thy projects lost; Nay, such hath been the mildness of thy fate, Hast no misfortune had of any rate; If <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> is at any time severe, Serene and undisturbed thou must appear. But though this be the state of all sublunary things, yet such is the extravagant pride and folly of some men, that if they are raised above the common by the greatness of their riches or functions of magistracy, or if they arrive to any eminent charge in the commonwealth, they presently swell with the titles of their honor, and threaten and insult over their inferiors; never considering what a treacherous Goddess <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> is, and how easy a revolution it is for things that are uppermost to be thrown down from their height and for humble things to be exalted, and that these changes of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> are performed quickly and in the swiftest moments of time. To seek for any certainty therefore in that which is uncertain is the part of those who judge not aright of things: Like to a wheel that constantly goes round, One part is up whilst t'other's on the ground. </p>                        </div>

Our fortunes and our passions too are subject to the same mortality; indeed all things in this world are in perpetual flux: Which no man can avoid with all his care. It is an expression of <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a>, that we are held to the dark bottom of hell by necessities as hard as iron. And <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> says: No worldly wealth is firm and sure; But for a day it doth endure. And also: From small beginnings our misfortunes grow, And little rubs our feet do overthrow; A single day is able down to cast Some things from height, and others raise as fast. <a href=/people/876 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379237DPha class=person long=23.7062 lat=37.9373>Phalereus</a> affirms that this was truly said, but that the poet had been more in the right if for a single day he had put only a moment of time. For earthly fruits and mortal men's estate Turn round about in one and selfsame rate; Some live, wax strong, and prosper day by day, While others are cast down and fade away. And <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> hath it in another place, What are we, what are we not? Man is but a shadow's dream. He used an artificial and very perspicuous hyperbole to draw human life in its genuine colors; for what is weaker than a shadow? Or what words can be found out whereby to express a shadow's dream? <a href=/people/1532 target=_blank>Crantor</a> hath something consonant to this, when, condoling <a href=/people/5043 target=_blank>Hippocles</a> upon the loss of his children, he speaks after this manner: These are the things which all the old philosophers talk of and have instructed us in; which though we do not agree to in every particular, yet this hath too sharp a truth in it, that our life is painful and full of difficulties; and if it doth not labor with them in its own nature, yet we ourselves have infected it with that corruption. For the inconstancy of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> joined us at the beginning of our journey, and hath accompanied us ever since; so that it can produce nothing that is sound or comfortable unto us; and the bitter potion was mingled for us as soon as we were born. For the principles of our nature being mortal is the cause that our judgment is depraved, that diseases, cares, and all those fatal inconveniences afflict mankind. But what need of this digression? Only that we may be made sensible that it is no unusual thing if a man be unfortunate; but we are all subject to the same calamity. For as <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> saith, <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> surpriseth us unawares, robs us of those things we have got by the sweat of our industry, and spoils the gaudy appearance of a prosperous condition; and this she doth when she pleaseth, not being stinted to any periods of time. These and things of the like nature it is easy for a man to ponder with himself, and to hearken to the sayings of ancient and wise men; among whom divine <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> is the chief, who sung after this manner: Of all that breathes or grovelling creeps on earth, Most man is vain! calamitous by birth: Today, with power elate, in strength he blooms; The haughty creature on that power presumes: Anon from Heaven a sad reverse he feels; Untaught to bear, 'gainst Heaven the wretch rebels. For man is changeful, as his bliss or woe; Too high when prosperous, when distress'd too low.

By this it may appear, that he who comforts another who is macerating himself with grief, and demonstrates to him, by reckoning up their several misfortunes, that he suffers nothing but what is common to him with other men, takes the surest way to lessen the opinion he had of his condition, and brings him to believe that it is not altogether so bad as he took it to be. </p>                        </div>

And it is great to speak this sentence with courage: Where is the slave who never fears to die? Or this: And shadows never scare me, thanks to hell. But what is it at length in death, that is so grievous and troublesome? For I know not how it comes to pass that, when it is so familiar and as it were related to us, it should seem so terrible. How can it be rational to wonder, if that cleaves asunder which is divisible, if that melts whose nature is liquefaction, if that burns which is combustible, and so, by a parity of reason, if that perisheth which by nature is perishable? For when is it that death is not in us? For, as <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heraclitus</a> saith, it is the same thing to be dead and alive, asleep and awake, a young man and decrepit; for these alternately are changed one into another. For as a potter can form the shape of an animal out of his clay and then as easily deface it, and can repeat this backwards and forwards as often as he pleaseth, so Nature too out of the same materials fashioned first our grandfathers, next our fathers, then us, and in process of time will engender others, and again others upon these. For as the flood of our generation glides on without any intermission and will never stop, so in the other direction the stream of our corruption flows eternally on, whether it be called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392205WAch class=place long=20.4831 lat=39.2348>Acheron</a> or <a href=/people/1315 target=_blank>Cocytus</a> by the poets. So that the same cause which first showed us the light of the sun carries us down to infernal darkness. And in my mind, the air which encompasseth us seems to be a lively image of the thing; for it brings on the vicissitudes of night and day, life and death, sleeping and waking. For this cause it is that life is called a fatal debt, which our fathers contracted and we are bound to pay; which is to be done calmly and without any complaint, when the creditor demands it; and by this means we shall show ourselves men of sedate passions. </p>                        </div>

The casting of these lots is very just, For good and bad lie in one common dust. <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> hath it so: The Gods unequal have us mortals vexed, For to one good, two evils are annexed: They pay a single joy with double care, And fools such dispensations cannot bear. <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> so: Why at a mortal's death dost thou complain? Thou know'st not what may be his future gain. And <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> so: Dost thou not know the state of human things?

For if death is sleep, and no hurt happens to those who are in that innocent condition, it is manifest that neither are the dead ill dealt with. To what purpose should I talk of that which is so tritely known amongst all, that the most profound sleep is always the sweetest? <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> particularly attests it: His senses all becalmed, he drew his breath, His sleep was sound, and quiet like to death. And in many places he saith thus: She met <a href=/people/257 target=_blank>Death</a>'s brother, <a href=/people/422 target=_blank>Sleep</a>.

The very body, saith <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, procures us infinite disquiet only to supply its daily necessities with food; but if any diseases are coincident, they hinder our contemplations, and stop us in our researches after truth. Besides, it distracts us with irregular desires, fears, and vain amours, setting before us so many fantastic images of things, that the common saying is here most true, that on account of the body we can never become wise. For wars, popular seditions, and shedding of blood by the sword are owing to no other original than this care of the body and gratifying its licentious appetites; for we fight only to get riches, and these we acquire only to please the body; so that those who are thus employed have not leisure to be philosophers. And after all, when we have retrieved an interval of time to seek after truth, the body officiously interrupts us, is so troublesome and importune, that we can by no means discern its nature. Therefore it is evident that, if we will clearly know any thing, we must divest ourselves of the body, and behold things as they are in themselves with the mind itself, that at last we may attain what we so much desire, and what we do profess ourselves the most partial admirers of, which is wisdom. And this we cannot consummately enjoy till after death, as reason teacheth us. For if so be that we can understand nothing clearly as long as we are clogged with flesh, one of these things must needs be, either that we shall never arrive at that knowledge at all, or only when we die; for then the soul will exist by itself, separate from the body; and whilst we are in this life, we shall make the nearest advances towards it, if we have no more to do with the body than what decency and necessity require, if we break off all commerce with it, and keep ourselves pure from its contagion, till God shall give us a final release, and then being pure and freed from all its follies, we shall converse (it is likely) with intelligences as pure as ourselves, with our unaided vision beholding perfect purity, — and this is truth itself. For it is not fit that what is pure should be apprehended by what is impure." Therefore, if death only transports us to another place, it is not to be looked upon as an evil, but rather as an exceeding good, as <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> hath demonstrated. The words of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> to his judges seem to me to be spoken even with inspiration: To fear death, gentlemen, is nothing else than to counterfeit the being wise, when we are not so. For he that fears death pretends to know what he is ignorant of; for no man is certain whether death be not the greatest good that can befall a man, but they positively dread it as if they were sure it was the greatest of evils. Agreeably to this said one after this manner: Let no man fear what doth his labors end; and death sets us free even from the greatest evils. </p>                        </div>

She, being extremely taken with the piety of her sons, petitioned the Goddess that she would bestow upon them the best present that could be given to men; accordingly she cast them into that deep sleep out of which they never awoke, taking this way to recompense their filial zeal with death. <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> writes of <a href=/people/2365 target=_blank>Agamedes</a> and <a href=/people/786 target=_blank>Trophonius</a>, that after they had built a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SApo class=place long=22.5011 lat=38.48225>temple</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, they requested of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> a reward for their work. It was answered them that they should have it within seven days, but in the mean while they were commanded to live freely and indulge their genius; accordingly they obeyed the dictate, and the seventh night they died in their beds.

His father was Elysius the Terinean, who was a man of the first condition for his estate and virtue, being rich and honorable, and this being his only son and heir to all his fortune, which was very great, he had a strong jealousy upon him that he was poisoned, and not knowing how he should come to the information of it, he went into the vault where they invoke the dead, and after having offered sacrifice, as it is enjoined by the law, he slept in the place; when all things were in a midnight silence, he had this vision. His father appeared to him, to whom after having related his lamentable misfortune, he earnestly desired the ghost that he would assist him in finding out the cause. He answered that he was come on purpose to do it. But first, saith he, receive from this one what he hath brought thee, and thereby thou wilt understand the reason of all thy sorrow. The person that the father meant was very like to <a href=/people/7684 target=_blank>Euthynous</a> both for years and stature; and the question being put to him who he was, he answered, I am the genius of thy son; and at the same time he reached out a book to him, which he opened and found these verses written therein: 'Tis ignorance makes wretched men to err; <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a> did to happiness thy son prefer.

For this would produce a privation of sense, and consequently a complete freedom from all solicitude and care; and if no good, so no evil would befall us. For good and evil alike must by nature inhere in that which has existence and essence; but to that which is nothing, and wholly abolished out of the nature of things, neither of the two can belong. Therefore, when men die, they return to the same condition they were in before they were born. For as, before we came into the world, we were neither sensible of good nor afflicted with evil, so it will be when we leave it; and as those things which preceded our birth did not concern us, so neither will those things which are subsequent to our death: The dead secure from sorrow safe do lie, 'Tis the same thing not to be born and die. For it is the same state of existence after death as it was before we were born. Unless perhaps you will make a difference between having no being at all and the utter extinction of it, after the same manner that you make a distinction between an house and a garment after they are ruined and worn out, and at the time before the one was built and the other made. And if in this case there is no difference, it is plain that there is none between the state before we were born and that after we are dead. It is elegantly said by <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a>, that death, which is called an evil, hath this peculiarly distinct from all that are thought so, that when it is present it gives us no disturbance, but when remote and in expectation only, it is then that it afflicts us. And indeed many out of the poorness of their spirit, having entertained most injurious opinions of it, have died even to prevent death. <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> hath said excellently to this purpose: It was united, it is now dissolved; it returns back whence it came, — earth to earth, the spirit to regions above. What in all this is grievous? Nothing at all. But that which <a href=/people/1142 target=_blank>Cresphontes</a> in <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> saith of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>: For if he dwells below, beneath the earth, With those whose life is gone, his strength is nought, I would have changed into these words: For if he dwells below, beneath the earth, With those whose life is gone, his woes are o'er. This Laconic too is very noble: Others before and after us will be, Whose age we're not permitted e'er to see. And again: These neither did live handsomely nor die, Though both should have been done with decency. But <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> hath spoken incomparably well of those who labor under daily indispositions: I hate the man who studies to defeat The power of death with artificial meat, To baffle and prevent his fate does think, And lengthens out his life with magic drink. Whereas, when he a burden doth become, Then he should die, because he's troublesome. Old age in modesty should then give place, And so make way unto a brisker race. But <a href=/people/1431 target=_blank>Merope</a> moved the passion of the theatre with these masculine expressions: My sons by death are ravished from my side, And I'm a widow, who was once a bride. I am not thus selected to be crossed, Others their sons and husbands too have lost. And we may not incongruously add these: What is become of that magnificence? Where is King <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> with his opulence? Or where is <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> with his mighty pride, Who with a bridge did curb the raging tide? Inhabitants of darkness they became, And now are living only in their fame. Their riches have perished with their bodies. </p>                        </div>

But the way to dry up these sorrows is so expedite and easy, that every vulgar poet hath prescribed it. Consider what consolation a comedian puts in the mouth of one who comforts another upon so sad an occasion: If this with certainty thou could'st have known, That <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> always would have kindness shown, That nothing but what's good would him befall, His death thou justly might'st untimely call. But if calamities were imminent, And <a href=/people/257 target=_blank>Death</a> the fatal mischief did prevent, To give to things the character that's due, <a href=/people/257 target=_blank>Death</a> was the most obliging of the two. It therefore being uncertain whether it was for his advantage that he departed this life and was freed from all the miseries that attend it, we had thereby lost all that we fancied we could enjoy in him whilst he was living. And <a href=/people/284 target=_blank>Amphiaraus</a> in the poet doth not do amiss when he consoles the mother of <a href=/people/1576 target=_blank>Archemorus</a>, who was even sick with grief for the untimely death of her infant son. He speaks: There is no man whom sorrow doth not seize; Our children die while others we beget. At last we die ourselves, and mortals grieve As they give dust to dust; but human life Must needs be reaped like a full crop of corn. One man must live, another die: why weep For this, which by necessity must be? There is no hardship in necessity. </p>                        </div>

For that musician is not to be commended who plays upon variety of instruments, nor that orator that makes multiplicity of speeches, nor the pilot that conducts many ships, but he of each faculty that doth one of them well; for the beauty of a thing doth not consist in length of time, but in the virtue and seasonable moderation wherewith it is transacted. This is that which is called happy and grateful to the Gods. And for this reason it is that poets celebrate those who have died before they have become old, and propose them for examples, as the most excellent men and of divine extraction, as him for instance, Beloved by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and him who gilds the skies, Yet short his date of life. And we see in every thing that preference is not given so much to age as to maturity. For amongst trees and plants, those are accounted the most generous which bring forth abundance of fruit, and that early ripe. And amongst living creatures too, those are the most valued which supply us with the accommodations of life in a short time. Besides, if we compare the space of our life with eternity, we shall find no difference betwixt long and short; for according to <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>, thousands and millions of years are but as a point to what is infinite, or rather the smallest part of that point.

Dost thou not think that if these had the soul and reason of a man, they would be so affected, and that things would happen to them after the same manner as to us? — that those who died before the meridian would be lamented with tears and groans? — and that we should call them happy who lived their day out?

If upon their own, because they have lost that pleasure they thought they should have enjoyed in them, or are deprived of that profit they expected or that relief they flattered themselves they should receive from them in their old age, then self-love and personal interest prescribe the measures of their sorrow; so that upon the result they do not love the dead so much as themselves and their own interest. But if they lament upon the account of the deceased, that is a grief easily to be shaken off, if they only consider that by their very death they will be out of the sphere of any evil that can reach them, and believe the wise and ancient saying, that we should always augment what is good, and extenuate the evil. Therefore if grief is a good thing, let us enlarge and make it as great as we can; but if it is numbered amongst the evils, as in truth it ought to be, let us endeavor all we can to suppress it, make it as inconsiderable as we can, and at last utterly efface it. How easy this is to be done, I will make appear by an illustrious example of consolation. They say that an ancient philosopher came to the Queen <a href=/people/509 target=_blank>Arsinoe</a>, who was then sorrowful for the death of her son, and discoursed her after this manner: At the time that <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> distributed honors amongst his under-deities, it happened that <a href=/people/1975 target=_blank>Grief</a> was absent; but he came at last when all the dignities were disposed of, and then desired that he might have some share in the promotions. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, having no better vacancies left, bestowed upon him sorrow and funeral tears. He made this inference from the story: Therefore, saith he, as other daemons love and frequent those who give them hospitable reception, so sadness will never come near you, if you do not give it encouragement; but if you caress it with those particular honors which it challengeth as its due, which are sighs and tears, it will have an unlucky affection for you, and will always supply you with fresh occasion that the observance may be continued.

Besides, the indication of our love to the deceased consists not in grieving ourselves for him, but in paying respect to his fame by honorable remembrance. For no good man deserves elegies, but panegyrics; and we should rather celebrate his loss by an honorable remembrance, than lament it; and offer up rather first-fruits of joy to the Gods, and not tears which sorrow extorts from us. For he who ceaseth to be amongst men becomes partaker of a divine life, is free from the servitude of the body, and all those solicitous cares which they who are embarrassed with a mortal life of necessity must undergo till they have finished the course which Providence hath marked out for them; and this life Nature hath not given us as a perpetual possession, but hath clogged it with restrictions and conditions of fate. </p>                        </div>

To whom that of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> may be appositely applied: Whilst others they lament with weeping eyes, The darkness of the night doth them surprise. Wherefore in this case we should often thus reason with ourselves: Shall we put an end to our sorrow, or shall we grieve all the days of our life? To make it infinite is the last degree of infatuation; for we have seen those who have been in the deepest circumstances of dejection to be so mitigated by time, that they have banqueted upon those tombs which before they could not endure the sight of without screeching out and beating their breasts, but which they can now dance round with music and all the postures of jollity. Therefore to be obstinate in our grief is the resolution of madness. If then thou hast purposed within thyself that it shall have an end, join this consideration with it, that time will assuage it too; for what is once done even the Deity himself cannot unravel; therefore that which hath happened to us beyond our hope and contrary to our opinion hath palpably shown us what is wont from the same causes to befall others.

I think it best to quote the expressions of the philosopher himself, in his book entitled <a href=/people/1475 target=_blank>Eudemus</a>, or Of the Soul, wherein he speaks after this manner: Wherefore, thou best and happiest of mankind, if we think those blessed and happy who have departed this life, then it is not only unlawful but even blasphemy to speak any thing that is false or contumelious of them, since they are now changed into a better and more refined nature. And this my opinion is so old, that the original and author of it is utterly unknown; but it hath been derived down to us even from eternity, so established is the truth of it. Besides, thou seest what is so familiar in men's mouths, and hath been for many years a trite expression. What is that, saith he? He answered him: It is best not to be born at all; and next to that, it is more eligible to die than to live; and this is confirmed even by divine testimony. Pertinently to this they say that <a href=/people/410 target=_blank>Midas</a>, after hunting, asked his captive <a href=/people/344 target=_blank>Silenus</a> somewhat urgently, what was the most desirable thing amongst men. At first he would return no answer, but was obstinately silent. At last, when <a href=/people/410 target=_blank>Midas</a> would not give over importuning him, he broke out into these words, though very unwillingly: 'Thou seed of an evil genius and precarious offspring of hard fortune, whose life is but for a day, why dost thou compel me to tell thee those things it is better thou wert ignorant of? For those live the least disturbed who know not their misfortunes; but for men, the best for them is not to be born at all, nor to be made partakers of the most excellent nature; not to be is best for both sexes. This should have the first place in our choice; and the next to this is, when we are born, to die as soon as we can.' It is plain therefore, that he declared the condition of the dead to be better than that of the living.

The good we obtain hardly and with anxious endeavor, but the evil easily befalls us; for they say evils are linked together, and by a mutual dependence of causes follow one another, but the good lie scattered and disjoined, and with great difficulty are brought within the compass of our life. Therefore we seem to have forgot our condition; for not only is it true, as <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> hath it, that The things we do possess are not our own; but in general no man can claim a strict propriety in any thing he hath: When Gods do riches lend, it is but just That when they please we should resign our trust. We ought not therefore to take it amiss if they demand those things which they lent us only for a small time; for even your common brokers, unless they are unjust, will not be displeased if they are called upon to refund their pawns, and if one of them is not altogether so ready to deliver them, thou mayst say to him without any injury, Hast thou forgot that thou receivedst them upon the condition to restore them? The same parity of reason holds amongst all men. The Gods have put life into our hands by a fatal necessity, and there is no prefixed time when what is so deposited will be required of us, as the brokers know not when their pawns will be demanded. If therefore any one is angry when he is dying himself, or resents the death of his children, is it not very plain, that he hath forgot that he himself is a man and that he hath begotten children as frail as himself? For a man that is in his wits cannot be ignorant that he is a mortal creature, and born to this very end that he must die. If <a href=/people/479 target=_blank>Niobe</a>, as it is in the fable, had had this sentence always at hand, that she must at length die, and could not In the ever-flowering bloom of youth remain, Nor loaded with children, like a fruitful tree, Behold the sun's sweet light: she would never have sunk to such a degree of desperation as to desire to throw off her life to ease the burthen of her sorrow, and call upon the Gods to hurry her into the utmost destruction. There are two sentences inscribed upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphic</a> oracle, hugely accommodated to the usages of man's life, Know Thyself, and Nothing Too Much; and upon these all other precepts depend. And they themselves accord and harmonize with each other, and each seems to illustrate the energy of the other; for in Know thyself is included Nothing too much; and so again in the latter is comprised Know thyself. And <a href=/people/356 target=_blank>Ion</a> hath spoken of it thus: This sentence, Know thyself, is but a word; But only <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> himself could do the thing.

Wherefore they are querulous and cry out upon every occasion, inveighing against the bitterness of their mishaps. Their complaints we may not unfitly obviate with this expression: The Gods do hurt thee not, but thou thyself: even thou thyself through perverseness and want of good instruction. And by reason of this false and deceiving opinion they accuse any kind of death; for if one die upon his travel, they exclaim after this manner: The wretch, his father being absent, dies; Nor did his aged mother close his eyes. If he die in his own country, with his parents about him, they lament that he is ravished out of their hands, and hath left them nothing but regret for his loss. If he die silent, giving them no instructions at parting, they complain thus: His tender dying words I did not hear, Which I in my remembrance still should bear. If he spoke any thing before he breathed out his soul, they keep those last accents as fuel to maintain their sorrow still kindled. If he die a sudden death, they cry out that he is snatched away; if chronical pains waste him, they will tell you that the slow distemper hath emaciated him to death. Thus every appearance, take it which way you will, is sufficient to stir up your complaints. These things the poets have introduced, and the chiefest among them, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, who sung after this manner: As a poor father, helpless and undone, Mourns o'er the ashes of an only son, Takes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn, And pours in tears ere yet they close the urn.

So we should think that nothing has befallen them which they should have sought to shun: For nought that cometh by necessity is hard, neither of those things which fall out by a precedent ratiocination or a subsequent. And many by a timely death have been withdrawn from greater calamities; so that it hath been good for some never to have been born at all; for others, that as soon as life hath been blown in it should be extinguished; for some, that they should live a little longer; and for others again, that they should be cropped in the prime of their youth. These several sorts of deaths should be taken in good part, since <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a> is inevitable. Therefore it becomes men well educated to consider that those who have paid their debt to mortality have only gone before us a little time; that the longest life is but as a point in respect of eternity, and that many who have indulged their sorrow to excess have themselves followed in a small while those that they have lamented, having reaped no profit out of their complaints, but macerated themselves with voluntary afflictions. Since then the time of our pilgrimage in this life is but short, we ought not to consume ourselves with sordid grief, and so render ourselves unhappy by afflicting our minds and tormenting our bodies; but we should endeavor after a more manly and rational sort of life, and not associate ourselves with those who will be companions in grief and by flattering our tears will only excite them the more, but rather with those who will diminish our grief by solemn and generous consolation.

Fix'd is the term to all the race of earth, And such the hard condition of our birth: No force can then resist, no flight can save, All sink alike, the fearful and the brave.

They report of <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a> that, when he was reading natural philosophy to his pupils and reasoning with them, sudden news was brought him of the death of his son. He presently stopped short in his lecture, and said this to his auditors, I knew that I begot my son mortal. And of <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a>, who was surnamed <a href=/people/3220 target=_blank>Olympius</a> for his wisdom and the strength of his eloquence, when he heard that both his sons were dead, <a href=/people/11003 target=_blank>Paralus</a> and <a href=/people/727 target=_blank>Xanthippus</a>, how he behaved himself upon this accident <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a> tells us in these words. When his sons, saith he, being in the first verdure of their youth and handsome lads, died within eight days, he bore the calamity without any repining; for he was of a pacific temper, from whence there was every day an accession of advantages towards the making him happy, the being free from grief, and thereby acquiring a great reputation amongst his fellow-citizens. For every one that saw him bear this calamity with so brave a resolution thought him magnanimous, and indeed entertained an higher opinion of him than he strictly deserved; for he was conscious to himself of some weakness and defects in cases of this nature. Now after he had received the news of the death of his sons, he put on a garland according to the custom of his country, and being clothed in white, he made an harangue to the people, was the author of safe and rational counsels, and stirred up the courage of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> to warlike expeditions. Chronicles tell us, that when an express came out of the field to <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> the <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socratic</a> as he was sacrificing, which acquainted him that his son perished in the fight, he pulled the garland from his head, and enquired after what manner he fell; and it being told him that he died gallantly, making a great slaughter of his enemies, after he had paused awhile to recollect his thoughts and quiet his first emotion of concern with reason, he adorned his head again, finished the sacrifice, and spoke thus to the messengers: I did not make it my request to the Gods, that my son might be immortal or long-lived, for it is not manifest whether this was convenient for him or not, but that he might have integrity in his principles and be a lover of his country; and now I have my desire. <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=person long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a>, as he was consulting with his friends concerning some affairs, heard a great noise; and crying out and asking what was the matter, he was told the accident, that his son was killed with a fall from the top of the house. He was not at all surprised or astonished at the disaster, but commanded the dead body to be delivered to the women, that they might bury it according to custom. But he went on with his first deliberations, and re-assumed his discourse in that part where this accident had broken it off. It is said that <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> the orator imitated him upon the loss of his only and dearest daughter; about which <a href=/people/1038 target=_blank>Aeschines</a>, thinking to upbraid him, spoke after this manner: Within seven days after the death of his daughter, before he had performed the decencies of sorrow, and paid those common rites to the memory of the deceased, he put on a garland, clothed himself in white, and sacrificed, thereby outraging decency, though he had lost his only daughter, the one which had first called him father. Thus did <a href=/people/1038 target=_blank>Aeschines</a> with the strokes of his oratory accuse <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, not knowing that he rather deserved a panegyric upon this occasion, when he rejected his sorrow and preferred the love of his country to the tenderness and compassion he ought to have for his relations. King <a href=/people/12218 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>, when he heard the death of his son <a href=/people/2369 target=_blank>Alcyoneus</a> who was slain in battle, looking steadily upon the messengers of these sad tidings, after a little interval of silence and with a modest countenance, spoke thus: O <a href=/people/2369 target=_blank>Alcyoneus</a>, thou hast fallen later than I thought thou wouldst, so brisk wast thou to run upon the thickest of thy enemies, having no regard either to thy own safety or to my admonitions. Every one praiseth these men for the bravery of their spirit, but none can imitate what they have done, through the weakness of their minds which proceeds from want of good instruction. But although there are many examples extant, both in the Greek and Roman stories, of those who have borne the death of their relations not only with decency but courage, I think these that I have related to be a sufficient motive to thee to keep tormenting grief at a distance, and so ease thyself of that labor which hath no profit in it and is all in vain. </p>                        </div>

But perhaps, my dear <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, thou wilt thus object to me: My young <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> was blessed by fortune in his life, and I ought first to have died that he might bury me; for this is according to nature. According to our human nature, I confess; but Providence hath other measures, and that supreme order which governs the world is very different; for thy son being now made happy, it was not requisite according to nature that he should tarry in this life longer than the time prefixed him, but that, having consummated the term of his duration, he should perform his fatal journey, Nature recalling him to herself. But he died untimely, you may say. Upon that account he is the happier, not having been sensible of those evils which are incident to life. For <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> said truly: The time of being here we style amiss; We call it life, but truly labor 'tis. Thy <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> died in the beautiful flower of his years, a youth in all points perfect, who gained the love, and provoked the emulation of all his contemporaries He was dutiful to his father and mother, obliging to his domestics, was a scholar, and (to comprehend all in a word) he was a lover of mankind. He had a veneration for the old men that were his friends, as if they had been his parents, had an affection for his companions and equals, reverenced his instructors, was hospitable and mild to his guests and strangers, gracious to all, and beloved by all, as well for his attractive countenance as for his lovely affability. Therefore, being accompanied with the applauses of thy piety and his own, he hath only made a digression from this mortal life to eternity, as if he had withdrawn from the entertainment before he grew absurd, and before the staggerings of drunkenness came upon him, which are incident to a long old age. Now if the sayings of the old philosophers and poets are true, as there is probability to think, that honors and high seats of dignity are conferred upon the righteous after they are departed this life, and if, as it is said, a particular region is appointed for their souls to dwell in, you ought to cherish very fair hopes that your son stands numbered amongst those blest inhabitants. </p>                        </div>

There all the richly scented plants do grow, And there the crimson-colored roses blow; Each flower blooming on its tender stalk, And all these meadows are their evening walk. There trees peculiarly delight the sense, With their exhaled perfumes of frankincense. The boughs their noble burdens cannot hold, The weight must sink them when the fruit is gold. Some do the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> unto the manege bring, Others unto the tuneful lute do sing; There's plenty to excess of every thing. The region always doth serene appear, The sun and pious flames do make it clear, Where fragrant gums do from the altars rise, When to the Gods they offer sacrifice. And proceeding farther, in another lamentation he spake thus concerning the soul: Just we that distribution may call, Which to each man impartially doth fall. It doth decide the dull contentious strife, And easeth the calamities of life. <a href=/people/257 target=_blank>Death</a> doth its efforts on the body spend; But the aspiring soul doth upwards tend. Nothing can damp that bright and subtile flame, Immortal as the Gods from whence it came. But this sometimes a drowsy nap will take, When all the other members are awake. Fancy in various dreams doth to it show, What punishments unto each crime is due; What pleasures are reserved for pious deeds, And with what scourges the incestuous bleeds. </p>                        </div>

The things which are written by him in his Dialogue concerning the Soul I will send you by themselves, illustrated with my commentaries upon them, according to your request. I will now only quote those which are opportune and to the present purpose, and they are the words of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> to <a href=/people/1619 target=_blank>Callicles</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, who was the companion and scholar of <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a> the rhetorician. For so saith <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> in <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>: Hear then, saith he, a most elegant story, which you, I fancy, will think to be a fable, but I take it to be a truth, for the things which I shall tell you have nothing but reality in them. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, and <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Pluto</a>, as <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> tells us, divided amongst themselves the kingdom which they received by inheritance from their father; but there was a law established concerning men in the reign of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a>, which was then valid and still remains in force amongst the Gods, that that mortal which had led a just and pious life should go, when he died, into the fortunate <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000GEly class=place long=23.73603 lat=37.96393>islands of the blest</a>, and there dwell in happiness, free from all misery; but he that had lived impiously and in contempt of the Gods should be shackled with vengeance, and be thrust into that prison which they call <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a>. In the time of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a>, and in the first beginning of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>'s empire, the living judged the living, and that the same day that they were to die; whereupon the decisions of the bench were not rightly managed. Therefore <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Pluto</a> and his curators under him came out of these fortunate islands, and complained to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> that men were sent to both places who were not worthy. I, saith <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, will take care that this thing be not practised for the future; for the reason that the sentences are now unjustly passed is that the guilty come clothed to the tribunal, and whilst they are yet alive. For some of profligate dispositions are yet palliated with a beautiful outside, with riches, and titles of nobility; and so when they come to be arraigned, many will offer themselves as witnesses to swear that they have lived very pious lives. The judges are dazzled with these appearances, and they sit upon them too in their robes; so that their minds are (as it were) covered and obscured with eyes and ears, and indeed with the encumbrance of the whole body. The judges and the prisoners being clothed is thus a very great impediment. Therefore in the first place the foreknowledge of death is to be taken away; for now they see the end of their line, and <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a> has been commanded to see that this be no longer allowed. Next they ought to be divested of all dress and ornament, and come dead to the tribunal. The judge himself is to be naked and dead too, that with his own soul he may view the naked soul of each one so soon as he is dead, when he is now forsaken of his relations, and has left behind him all his gayeties in the other world; and so justice will be impartially pronounced. Deliberating on this with myself before I received your advice, I have constituted my sons judges, <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> and <a href=/people/718 target=_blank>Rhadamanthus</a> from Asia, and <a href=/people/255 target=_blank>Aeacus</a> from Europe; these therefore, after they have departed this life, shall assume their character, and exercise it in the field, and in the road where two ways divide themselves, the one leading to the fortunate islands, and the other to the deep abyss; so <a href=/people/718 target=_blank>Rhadamanthus</a> shall judge the Asians, and <a href=/people/255 target=_blank>Aeacus</a> the Europeans. But to <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> I will grant the authority of a final appeal, that if any thing hath escaped the notice of the others, it shall be subjected to his cognizance, as to the last resort of a supreme judge; that so it may be rightly decided what journey every one ought to take. These are the things, <a href=/people/1619 target=_blank>Callicles</a>, which I have heard and think to be true; and I draw this rational inference from them, that death in my opinion is nothing else but the separation of two things nearly united, which are soul and body." </p>                        </div>

I have paid likewise that deference which became me to the ashes of thy son, who is the darling of the Gods, such an honor being most acceptable to those whom fame hath consecrated to immortality. Thou wilt therefore do handsomely to believe the reasons I have urged to thee, and gratify thy deceased son, by shaking off this unprofitable sorrow, which eats into thy mind and afflicts thy body, and again returning to that course of humor which nature hath chalked out and the former customs of thy life have made familiar to thee. For as, when thy son lived amongst us, he could not without the deepest regret see thee or his mother sad, so now that he is amongst the Gods enjoying the intimacy of their conversation, such a prospect from thence must be much more displeasing. Therefore take up the resolutions of a good and generous man and of one who loved his son, and so extricate thyself, the mother of the lad, thy kinsmen and friends at once from this great infelicity. Betake thyself to a more tranquil sort of life; which, as it will be acceptable to thy son, will also be extremely pleasing to all of us who have that concern for thee that we ought to have. </p>                        </div>
