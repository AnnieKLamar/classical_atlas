The storm lasted for three days: the north winds blew violently from the headlands towards the open; the blackening sea grew rough, the waters were white with foam; the billows everywhere broke over each other, some dashing against the rocks, while others swelled and burst. It was utterly impossible to work: we betook ourselves to the huts on the bank, collected a few fragments of wood, the remains of the oaks which had been felled by the ships' carpenters, and lighted a fire to relieve the piercing cold. At last the fourth day came, a truly halcyon day, as we may conclude from the clearness of the air, and brought us wealth and fortune in abundance. For, as soon as the sun rose, and its first beams glittered on the sea, we quickly launched our little bark, which had lately been drawn up on land, and, putting our nets aboard, set to work. We cast them not far from land. Ha! what an enormous haul we made! The heavily-laden net, carried under water, almost dragged down the corks with it. Immediately the fish salesmen gathered round, with their yokes over their shoulders, from which hung baskets on either side; and, having purchased our fish for money down, hastened from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379237DPha class=place long=23.7062 lat=37.9373>Phalerum</a> to the city. We had enough to satisfy them all, and besides, took back to our wives and children a quantity of small fry, enough to keep them not only for one, but for several days, if bad weather should come on. </p>                        </div>

By day we are scorched by the heat of the sun, by night we explore the deep by the light of torches, and yet, in the words of the proverb, we are pouring the contents of our pitchers into the cask of the <a href=/people/1622 target=_blank>Danaides</a> — so idle and useless are our efforts! We have not even sea nettles or Pelorian mussels to fill our belly; but the master collects both the fish and the money. But all that he gets from us is not enough for him: he is continually searching our little bark. Only lately, when we sent the lad <a href=/people/12141 target=_blank>Hermon</a> to him from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379237HMou class=place long=23.658 lat=37.938>Munychia</a> with the fish, he ordered us to bring him some sponges and sea-wool, which grows in fairly large quantities in the pool of <a href=/people/1387 target=_blank>Eurynome</a>. Before he had finished giving these orders, <a href=/people/12141 target=_blank>Hermon</a> left his load of fishes, the boat, and ourselves, and went off on a rowing-boat, with some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=demonym long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodian</a> dyers whose acquaintance he had made. Thus the master has to mourn the loss of a slave; we, that of a true companion. </p>                        </div>

With good reason, then, do the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> name it Aneisidora, because it bestows gifts, whereby we live and enjoy health. The sea is cruel, and a sailor's life is full of perils. My judgment is right: I have learnt this by experience and instruction. I remember that, once, when I wanted to sell some fish, I heard one of those fellows who hang about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BSPo class=place long=23.72265 lat=37.97635>Painted Stoa</a>, a bare-footed wretch with livid features, reciting verses and declaiming against the folly of sailors. He said that the verses were written by a certain <a href=/people/93 target=_blank>Aratus</a>, an astronomer. I cannot repeat all that he said; but, as far as I remember, one of the verses ran as follows: <br />A thin partition keeps off destruction. <br />Why, then, wife, should we not be wise, and, even though it be late, avoid a life that is so near death? We have children; and, although our poverty prevents us from leaving them anything considerable, we shall at least be able to leave them in blessed ignorance of the stormy waves and the dangers of the deep. They will be brought up to an agricultural life, and will enjoy a life of security, untroubled by alarm. </p>                        </div>

They either remain within the gates and occupy themselves with public affairs, or, devoting themselves to agriculture, wait quietly for the crops that are their support; but we, whose life is spent upon the water, find land death to us, even as the fishes, who are unable to breathe the air. Whatever, then, is the matter with you, my dear Tritonis, that you leave the shore and your yarn, and are constantly running into the city, visiting the <a href=/people/6744 target=_blank>Oschophoria</a> and <a href=/people/3413 target=_blank>Lenaea</a> in the company of wealthy <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> ladies?

So I, who have often addressed myself to the winds — since I never had the courage to consult you, my dear wife — have now decided to speak out, and beg you to assist me with your advice, if you have anything better to suggest. Listen now to the state of things as to which I want your opinion. My affairs are, as you know, in a very embarrassed condition, and I find it very hard to get a living, for there are hardly any fish in the sea. This rowing-boat which you see, with its numerous crew, is a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365342PCor class=demonym long=34.151 lat=36.464>Corycian</a> bark manned by <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>. They want me to become a partner in their venture, and promise me vast wealth. I confess that my mouth waters for the gold and garments which they hold out to me as an inducement; but I have not the heart to become a murderer and stain with gore these hands of mine, which the sea has kept pure from evil-doing, from my childhood to the present day; and yet, on the other hand, it is hard and unendurable to live in continual poverty. The decision of my choice lies in your hands: to whatever course you are favourably inclined, I will follow you, dear wife; for the advice which friends give us often cuts the knot of indecision. </p>                        </div>

The winds, driven together, threaten every moment to disturb the sea. The <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphins</a>, leaping lightly over the swelling waves, herald the approach of stormy weather: those who are skilled in astronomy say that <a href=/people/94 target=_blank>Taurus</a> is rising in the heavens.

But, lately, when <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a> and some of his friends hired my skiff, that they might go for a sail as the sea was calm and take part in a fishing expedition, I learned what luxuries they provided themselves with both on land and sea. Finding the wooden seats in the boat disagreeable, <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a> stretched himself out upon some foreign carpets and rugs, declaring that he could not lie down upon the bare boards, which he no doubt thought harder than stone. He next asked us to make an awning for him, by spreading out the linen sails overhead, because he could not endure the heat of the sun's rays: whereas not only we sailors, but all who are only moderately wealthy, as a rule seek every opportunity of warming ourselves in the sun; for the sea and cold go together. Certainly <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a> had not merely brought his male friends, but he was accompanied by a number of very pretty women, all musicians. The name of one was Crumatium, who played on the flute; another, <a href=/people/1527 target=_blank>Erato</a>, was a harpist; and <a href=/people/9370 target=_blank>Euepes</a> beat the cymbals. Thus my bark was full of music, the sea resounded with song, and mirth and gaiety prevailed. To me alone this afforded no enjoyment.

After I taken him to the stable, and sold the figs to one of my friends, someone took me to the theatre, where he put me into a good place, and gave me a treat of all kinds of spectacles. Although I forgot what else I saw — since I am not at all clever at understanding or giving an account of such things — I remember one thing, which struck me dumb with astonishment. A man came forward with a three-legged table. On this he placed three little cups, under which he hid some little round white pebbles, such as we find on the bank of a torrent. At one time he put them separately, one under each cup; at another time he showed them, all together, under one cup; then he made them disappear from the cups, I don't know how, and showed them, the next moment, in his mouth. After this he swallowed them, called some of the spectators on to the platform, and pulled out of their nose, head, and ears the pebbles which he ended by juggling away altogether.

The banqueters vied with one another in drinking, and the contest went on without stopping, until drunkenness overcame them all, and at length they became drowsy and fell asleep, even the servants. I looked round to see if I could filch some of the plate; but since this had been put away out of sight, in a place of safety, while they were still sober, I took a napkin under my arm and ran away in such a hurry that, during my flight, I lost one of my slippers.

I won some money — would to Heaven I never had! What right had I, weak as I was, to pit myself against stalwart young men? When I had swept in all the stakes, and they were entirely cleaned out, they all fell upon me; some beat me with their fists, others pelted me with stones, and others tore my clothes. But I kept tight hold of my money, resolved to die rather than surrender any of my winnings to them. For I time I resisted bravely, enduring the blows they dealt me, and the wrenching of my fingers; I was like a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=person long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a> who is being flogged at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224SArt class=place long=22.435 lat=37.083>altar</a> of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>.

What a banquet you missed, when Scamonides gave a feast in honour of his daughter's birthday. Having recently invited a number of the wealthiest and noblest in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, he thought it his duty also to grace the festivities with the presence of philosophers. Amongst those was <a href=/people/2879 target=_blank>Euthycles</a> the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a>, an old man with a long beard, dirty, filthy-headed, decrepit, with more wrinkles in his forehead than a leather pouch. There were also present <a href=/people/4713 target=_blank>Themistagoras</a> the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a>, not an unpleasant person to look at, with a fine curly beard; <a href=/people/10500 target=_blank>Zenocrates</a> the <a href=/people/10981 target=_blank>Epicurean</a>, with carefully trimmed locks, and a long and venerable beard; the famous <a href=/people/5454 target=_blank>Archibius</a> the <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagorean</a>, as he is called, with a very pale face, waving hair that reached down to his chest, a long and pointed chin, a turned-up nose, lips drawn in and tightly compressed, an indication of his reserve. Suddenly <a href=/people/2907 target=_blank>Pancrates</a> the <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynic</a>, violently thrusting the other aside, forced his way in, leaning on a staff of holm-oak, which, in place of thick knots, was studded with brass nails, and carrying an empty wallet, conveniently slung for carrying away the remains of the feast. All the other guests, from beginning to end, maintained a uniform and orderly behaviour; but the philosophers, as the entertainment went on, and the wine-cup went round, began to behave in a most extraordinary fashion. <a href=/people/2879 target=_blank>Euthycles</a> the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a>, overcome by his years and having eaten and drunk too much, lay stretched out at full length, snoring loudly. The <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagorean</a>, breaking through his silence, began to trill the Golden Verses to a kind of musical air. The excellent <a href=/people/4713 target=_blank>Themistagoras</a>, who, according to the doctrine of the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetics</a>, places happiness not in bodily or mental advantages alone, but also in external enjoyment, asked for more pastry, and plenty of different dainties; <a href=/people/10500 target=_blank>Zenocrates</a> the <a href=/people/10981 target=_blank>Epicurean</a> took the girl who played the harp in his arms, looking at her wantonly and lasciviously with half-shut eyes, declaring that this quieted the desires of the flesh, and was the perfection of enjoyment. The <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynic</a>, with the indifference of his sect, let down his cloak and publicly made water, and then proceeded to copulate with <a href=/people/1326 target=_blank>Doris</a> the singing-girl, so that everyone could see him, declaring that nature was the principle of generation. No one took any notice of us parasites; none of those who were invited had a chance of showing what they could do to amuse the company, although Phoebiades, the lute-player, was there, and the comic mimes <a href=/people/3246 target=_blank>Sannyrion</a> and Philistiades were not absent. But it was all in vain; these were not thought worth looking at; the nonsense of the sophists was the only thing that met with approval. </p>                        </div>

The lad has copied his instructor most faithfully; he has paid more attention to imitating his life and manners than to learning his doctrines. Seeing that his master, during the day, was solemn and severe and always lecturing the young men, while at night he covered his head with his cloak and haunted the brothels, he has admirably copied his model; and for the last four days he has been madly in love with Acalanthis of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237XKer class=person long=23.7188 lat=37.9781>Ceramicus</a>. She is a friend of mine, and professes to love me; she knows that the youth is mad with desire, but refuses to yield to him, and declares that he shall not enjoy her favours until I give my consent to it, for she has left the decision to me. O <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, goddess of sensual love, bestow every blessing upon this excellent woman; she has behaved more like a friend than a prostitute! Since that time I have been loaded with handsome presents; if they pour in upon me even more abundantly, as time goes on, nothing shall prevent me from ransoming her from her master and making her my lawful wife. For she to whom I owe my support has every right to share my comforts. </p>                        </div>

One of its passengers is the wonderful merchant, whose lavish open-handedness makes the wealthiest and most generous of our citizens seem mean and niggardly by comparison.

He is not squandering his patrimony, but all the money he spends has been honestly earned by himself. He is fond of music, makes his stay in the city very agreeable to all, and is never rude to anybody. He is very pleasant to look at; you would say that his face was the dancing-ground of the Hours, and that <a href=/people/656 target=_blank>Persuasion</a> was seated on his lips. His wit is refined, his conversation agreeable.

When I went to him to get shaved, he received me most politely, made me sit down in a high chair, and put a clean cloth around my neck; then he gently drew the razor over my cheeks, and took off my thick hairs. But, in doing this, he was cunning and mischievous, for he only half shaved me, and left one part of my face rough, while the other was smooth. I, knowing nothing of the trick he had played me, went as usual to <a href=/people/765 target=_blank>Pasion</a>'s house, without waiting to be invited. When the guests saw me, they nearly killed themselves with laughing. I could not make out what had excited their mirth, until one of them came forward into the middle of the room and caught hold of and pulled at the hairs which had been left. I took a knife, and, feeling greatly annoyed, uprooted them somehow; and now I intend to look for a big stick and go and break the rascal's skull.

When I first saw him, I thought it would be a regular piece of luck for me, if I could give up a city life and retire to the country, and live with a friend who passed his life quietly working on his farm; then I need no longer think about making money by questionable practices in the courts, but could wait patiently to enjoy the fruits of the earth. Having determined to do this, I made friends with <a href=/people/4940 target=_blank>Corydon</a>, dressed myself like a countryman, clad myself in a sheepskin, took up a mattock, and got myself up as a regular ditcher. As long as I did this for amusement, it was endurable, and I thought I had made a very good bargain, since I was free from blows and insults, and the unequal footing on which I stood with my wealthy patrons; but when he made a daily practice of ordering me to work, and I had either to plough, clear the stony ground, dig holes, or plant in the ditches, then this kind of life became unbearable; I repented of my foolish act, and longed for the city again. When I returned after my long absence, I did not meet with the same reception as before; instead of being looked upon as a wit, I was considered rough and uncultivated, in fact, a regular boor. All the houses of the wealthy were from that time forth shut against me, and hunger knocked at the doors of my belly. Hard pressed for the bare necessaries of life, I joined a band of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=person long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarian</a> brigands, who lie in wait for travellers near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380232LSki class=demonym long=23.283 lat=37.9782>Scironian</a> rocks; and since then I have gained a dishonest livelihood without working.
