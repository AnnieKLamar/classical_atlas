But the aim of my narrative is not to write of the casual doings of distinguished men, but their main achievements. For if even the playful moods of virtue are worth recording, then it would be absolutely impious to be silent about her serious aims. To those who desire to read this narrative it will tell its tale, not indeed with complete certainty as to all matters -- for it was impossible to collect all the evidence with accuracy -- nor shall I separate out from the rest the most illustrious philosophers and orators, but I shall set down for each one his profession and mode of life.</p>                        </div>

He has read precise and detailed commentaries, and therefore, if he misses the truth, he may refer his error to others, like a diligent pupil who has fallen into the hands of inferior teachers; or, if he does go right, may have the truth on his side when he utters criticisms and be guided by those who are worthy of respect; that thus his own work may be perfectly blameless and secure from criticism, seeing that he followed those in whose steps it was his duty to follow. And inasmuch as there were few, or to say the truth, hardly any writers on this subject, nothing that has been composed by earlier authors will be concealed from my readers, nor what has come down by oral tradition to the present day, but the proper weight will be assigned to both sources; I mean that in written documents nothing has been altered, while what depends on hearsay, and hence is liable to become chaotic and confused by the lapse of time, has now been fixed and given stability by being written down, so that it is for the future a settled and abiding tradition.</p>                        </div>

For he was a follower of the <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagorean</a> doctrine, and he did much to publish to the world the divine and vivifying character of that philosophy. But <a href=/people/986 target=_blank>Philostratus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=person long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnos</a> wrote a full account of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, and entitled his book The Life of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, though he ought to have called it The Visit of God to Mankind. <a href=/people/711 target=_blank>Carneades</a> also lived about this time, a celebrated figure among the <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynics</a>, if indeed we ought to take any account of the <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynic</a> school, among whom were <a href=/people/1297 target=_blank>Musonius</a>, <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, and <a href=/people/621 target=_blank>Menippus</a>, and several others also; but these were the more celebrated.

Thus, for example, the inspired <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a> records in statements scattered here and there in his books, both his own life and that of his teacher; and he says that <a href=/people/753 target=_blank>Ammonius</a> died at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. But he does not entitle these records a Life, though he might well have done so, since his most successful work is that entitled The Parallel Lives of men most celebrated for their deeds and achievements. But his own life and that of his teacher he scattered piecemeal throughout every one of his books; so that if one should keep a sharp look-out for these references and track them as they occur and appear, and read them intelligently one after another, one would know most of the events of their lives. <a href=/people/3037 target=_blank>Lucian</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375385USam class=person long=38.53 lat=37.526>Samosata</a>, who usually took serious pains to raise a laugh, wrote a life of <a href=/people/3578 target=_blank>Demonax</a>, a philosopher of his own time, and in that book and a very few others was wholly serious throughout. <br />This much, then, I place on record, and am aware that some things have perhaps escaped me, but other things have not. And in that, after expending much thought and pains so that the result might be a continuous and definite account of the lives of the most celebrated philosophers and rhetoricians, I fell short of my ambition, I have had the same experience as those who are madly and feverishly in love. For they, when they behold the beloved and the adored beauty of her visible countenance, bow their heads, too weak to fix their gaze on that which they desire, and dazzled by its rays.</p>                        </div>

Now the period I describe is somewhat interrupted and broken up by reason of the calamities of the State. <br />Still a third crop of men began with the days of <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> and <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> (for the second which came next after <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> has been commemorated and made clear to all). As for those unlucky Emperors who lasted for a year only, they are not worthy of record; I mean, for example, <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>, <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>, <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a>, and, following them, <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a> and those who ruled after these men; and no one must suppose that I pay serious attention to them. Anyhow, to speak cursorily and in brief, the tribe of the best philosophers lasted on even into the reign of <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a>. And surely this is part of the felicity that belongs to emperors, that in history the date which marks the superlative virtue of a philosopher is that which dates the superlative luck of an emperor. Therefore let no one take it amiss if I, recording as I do the period for which it was possible for me to obtain evidence, or with which I could make an appropriate beginning, embark on my narrative at this point.</p>                        </div>

Altars in honour of <a href=/people/3458 target=_blank>Plotinus</a> are still warm, and his books are in the hands of educated men, more so than the dialogues of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>. Nay, even great numbers of the vulgar herd, though they in part fail to understand his doctrines, nevertheless are swayed by them. <a href=/people/1320 target=_blank>Porphyry</a> set forth his whole life so fully that no one could bring forward more evidence. Moreover, he is known to have interpreted many of his books. But a life of <a href=/people/1320 target=_blank>Porphyry</a> himself no one has written, so far as I know. However, from what I have gathered in my reading of the evidence that has been handed down, I have learned the following facts concerning him.</p>                        </div>

His disciples were overwhelmed with amazement, but <a href=/people/5048 target=_blank>Iamblichus</a> said, Let us go to the next spring, and he rose and led the way, with a thoughtful air. Then he went through the same performance there also, and summoned another <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> like the first in all respects, except that his hair was darker and fell loose in the sun. Both the boys embraced <a href=/people/5048 target=_blank>Iamblichus</a> and clung to him as though he were genuinely their father. He restored them to their proper places and went away after his bath, reverenced by his pupils. After this the crowd of his disciples sought no further evidence, but believed everything from the proofs that had been revealed to them, and hung on to him as though by an unbreakable chain. Even more astonishing and marvellous things were related of him, but I wrote down none of these since I thought it a hazardous and sacrilegious thing to introduce a spurious and fluid tradition into a stable and well-founded narrative. Nay even this I record not without hesitation, as being mere hearsay, except that I follow the lead of men who, though they distrusted other signs, were converted by the experience of the actual revelation. Yet no one of his followers recorded it, as far as I know. And this I say with good reason, since <a href=/people/7167 target=_blank>Aedesius</a> himself asserted that he had not written about it, nor had any other ventured to do so.</p>                        </div>

He was of very small stature and his body was very little larger than a pigmy's, but even the body that he seemed to have was really all soul and intelligence; to such a degree did the corruptible element in him fail to increase, since it was absorbed into his diviner nature. Therefore, just as the great <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> says, that in contradistinction to human bodies, divine bodies dwell within souls, thus also of him one might say that he had migrated into a soul, and that he was confined and dominated there by some supernatural power. Now <a href=/people/5427 target=_blank>Alypius</a> had many followers, but his teaching was limited to conversation, and no one ever published a book by him. On this account they very eagerly betook themselves to <a href=/people/5048 target=_blank>Iamblichus</a>, to fill themselves full as though from a spring that bubbles over and does not stay within its limits. Now as the renown of both men increased and kept pace they encountered one another by chance or met in their courses like planets, and round them in a circle sat an audience as though in some great seat of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. Now <a href=/people/5048 target=_blank>Iamblichus</a> was waiting to have questions put to him rather than to ask them, but <a href=/people/5427 target=_blank>Alypius</a>, contrary to all expectation, postponed all questioning about philosophy and giving himself up to making an effect with his audience said to <a href=/people/5048 target=_blank>Iamblichus</a>: Tell me, philosopher, is a rich man either unjust or the heir of the unjust, yes or no?

So it was with <a href=/people/5048 target=_blank>Iamblichus</a> when he set out to praise by telling the exact truth; for though he clearly shows how severe were the punishments and sufferings in the law courts in his day, yet the causes of these things and their purposes he was</p>                        </div>

But in my account of the sainted <a href=/people/12208 target=_blank>Julian</a> I have related these matters more fully. When <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> had succeeded to the throne and had been allotted his proper portion of the Empire, that is to say the countries that extend from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> to the East, he at once relieved <a href=/people/7144 target=_blank>Ablabius</a> of his authority, and gathered about himself a different set of favourites. <a href=/people/7144 target=_blank>Ablabius</a> spent his time in luxury on an estate that he had long before made ready in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a>, which provided him a safe retreat of regal splendour and complete idleness; meanwhile all men marvelled that he did not aspire to be emperor. Then <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a>, from his father's city hard by, dispatched certain swordsmen to him in considerable numbers, and to the leaders he gave orders that they should hand him a letter. Those who delivered the letter into his hands prostrated themselves before him, as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> are accustomed to prostrate themselves before the emperor. He received the document with great arrogance, and, freed from all apprehension, he demanded the imperial purple from those who had come, while his expression became more stern, and he inspired terror in the spectators. They replied that their task had only been to bring the letter, but that those who had been entrusted with this other mission were at the door. Thereupon he insolently summoned them within, and was inflated with pride. But those who were then admitted were more in number and all carried swords, and instead of the purple robe they brought him purple death, and hacked him to pieces like some animal cut up at a public feast. Thus did the shade of <a href=/people/1028 target=_blank>Sopater</a> avenge itself on <a href=/people/7144 target=_blank>Ablabius</a> the fortunate.</p>                        </div>

When they arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, Sapor was reported to be and actually was tyrannical and savage towards those who approached him; nevertheless, when <a href=/people/3024 target=_blank>Eustathius</a>, for the embassy in general, was allowed access to the king, the latter could not but admire the expression of his eyes which was at once amiable and proudly indifferent, in spite of the many preparations that the king had devised in order to dazzle and overawe the man.

He listened to them, and then investigated and sifted the evidence of men who were famed in this science and had a wide renown, and cross-examined them, asking what was the size, colour, and shape of the omens. Then, as his manner was, he smiled at them, on hearing the true facts (for as falsehood has no place in the choir of the gods, so too it has none in their utterance), and said: Nay, these omens did not foretell this visit from me.

When a harvest beyond all expectation was the result -- the owner himself was there, and with him was the little girl Sosipatra -- men's amazement was boundless, and they went so far as to suspect the intervention of the gods. The owner of the estate invited them to his table, and treated them with the highest consideration; and he reproached the other labourers on the estate with not obtaining the same results.

While his mind was full of this lie was overcome by sleep, and the others left the table, and taking the girl with them they very tenderly and scrupulously handed over to her the whole array of garments in which she had been initiated, and added certain mystic symbols thereto; and they also put some books into Sosipatra's chest, and gave orders that she should have it sealed. And she, no less than her father, took the greatest delight in those men. When the day began to break and the doors were opened, and people began to go to their work, the men also, according to their custom, went forth with the rest. Then the girl ran to her father bearing the good news, and one of the servants went with her to carry the chest. Her father asked for all the money belonging to him that happened to be available, and from his stewards all that they had for their necessary expenses, and sent to call those men, but they were nowhere to be seen. Then he said to Sosipatra: What is the meaning of this, my child? After a brief pause she replied: Now at last I understand what they said.</p>                        </div>

This proved very clearly that they who had appeared were blessed spirits. They then departed and went whithersoever it was; but her father took charge of the girl, now fully initiated, and though without pride, filled with divine breath, and he permitted her to live as she pleased and did not interfere in any of her affairs, except that sometimes he was ill pleased with her silence. And as she grew to the full measure of her youthful vigour, she had no other teachers, but ever on her lips were the works of the poets, philosophers, and orators; and those works that others comprehend but incompletely and dimly, and then only by hard work and painful drudgery, she could expound with careless ease, serenely and painlessly, and with her light swift touch would make their meaning clear. Then she decided to marry. Now beyond dispute <a href=/people/3024 target=_blank>Eustathius</a> of all living men was alone worthy to wed her.

Immediately after this prophecy -- for such was the will of the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> -- she married <a href=/people/3024 target=_blank>Eustathius</a>, and her words had the same force as an immutable oracle, so absolutely did it come to pass and transpire as had been foretold by her. <br />I must relate also what happened after these events. After the passing of <a href=/people/3024 target=_blank>Eustathius</a>, Sosipatra returned to her own estate, and dwelt in Asia in the ancient city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=place long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamon</a>, and the famous <a href=/people/7167 target=_blank>Aedesius</a> loved and cared for her and educated her sons. In her own home Sosipatra held a chair of philosophy that rivalled his, and after attending the lectures of <a href=/people/7167 target=_blank>Aedesius</a>, the students would go to hear hers; and though there was none that did not greatly appreciate and admire the accurate learning of <a href=/people/7167 target=_blank>Aedesius</a>, they positively adored and revered the woman's inspired teaching. <br />Now there was one <a href=/people/3935 target=_blank>Philometor</a>, a kinsman of hers, who, overcome by her beauty and eloquence, and recognizing the divinity of her nature, fell in love with her; and his passion possessed him and completely overmastered him. Not. only was he completely conquered by it but she also felt its onslaught. So she said to <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, who was one of the most distinguished pupils of <a href=/people/7167 target=_blank>Aedesius</a> and was moreover his kinsman: <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, pray find out what ailment I have, that I may not be troubled by it.</p>                        </div>

Once, for example, when they were all met at her house -- <a href=/people/3935 target=_blank>Philometor</a> however was not present but was staying in the country -- the theme under discussion and their inquiry was concerning the soul. Several theories were propounded, and then Sosipatra began to speak, and gradually by her proofs disposed of their arguments; then she fell to discoursing on the descent of the soul, and what part of it is subject to punishment, what part immortal, when in the midst of her bacchie and frenzied flow of speech she became silent, as though her voice had been cut off, and after letting a short interval pass she cried aloud in their midst: What is this?

She died leaving the three sons of whom she had spoken. The names of two of them I need not record. But <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> was worthy of his parents, for he settled at the Canobic mouth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> and devoted himself wholly to the religious rites of that place, and strove with all his powers to fulfil his mother's prophecy. To him resorted all the youth whose souls were sane and sound, and who hungered for philosophy, and the temple was filled with young men acting as priests. Though he himself still appeared to be human and he associated with human beings, he foretold to all his followers that after his death the temple would cease to be, and even the great and holy temples of <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Serapis</a> would pass into formless darkness and be transformed, and that a fabulous and unseemly gloom would hold sway over the fairest things on earth.

And these books of theirs anyhow bore upon none of the ancient philosophers, but were wills and copies of wills, contracts of sales and suchlike documents, which are highly esteemed in that life which is prone to dissolute folly and licence. Thus it proved that Sosipatra could also divine correctly what should happen after these events. But I need not write down even the names of these men, for my narrative is eager to lead on to those that are not unworthy but worthy. An exception must be made of one of her sons; his name was <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, and I mentioned him just now; he crossed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, and then so greatly admired and preferred the mouth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/313300UCan class=place long=30.0772 lat=31.3107>Canobus</a>, that he wholly dedicated and applied himself to the worship of the gods there, and to their secret rites. He made rapid progress towards affinity with the divine, despised his body, freed himself from its pleasures, and embraced a wisdom that was hidden from the crowd. On this matter I may well speak at greater length. He displayed no tendency to theurgy and that which is at variance with sensible appearances, perhaps because he kept a wary eye on the imperial views and policy which were opposed to these practices. But all admired his fortitude and his unswerving and inflexible character, and those who were then pursuing their studies at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> used to go down to him to the seashore. </p>                        </div>

For he would utter not a word to any one of them, but fixing his eyes and gazing up at the sky he would lie there speechless and unrelenting, nor did anyone ever see him lightly enter into converse with any man on such themes as these. <br />Now, not long after, an unmistakable sign was given that there was in him some diviner element.

Only the floor of the temple of <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Serapis</a> they did not take, simply because of the weight of the stones which were not easy to move from their place. Then these warlike and honourable men, after they, had thrown everything into confusion and disorder and had thrust out hands, unstained indeed by blood but not pure from greed, boasted that they had overcome the gods, and reckoned their sacrilege and impiety a thing to glory in. <br />Next, into the sacred places they imported monks, as they called them, who were men in appearance but led the lives of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>, and openly did and allowed countless unspeakable crimes.

For they collected the bones and skulls of criminals who had been put to death for numerous crimes, men whom the law courts of the city had condemned to punishment, made them out to be gods, haunted their sepulchres, and thought that they became better by defiling themselves at their graves. Martyrs the dead men were called, and ministers of a sort, and ambassadors from the gods to carry men's prayers, -- these slaves in vilest servitude, who had been consumed by stripes and carried on their phantom forms the scars of their villainy.

The very pupils of his eyes were, so to speak, winged; he had a long grey beard, and his glance revealed the agile impulses of his soul. There was a wonderful harmony in his person, both to the eye and ear, and all who conversed with him were amazed as to both these faculties, since one could hardly endure the swift movements of his eyes or his rapid flow of words. In discussion with him no one ventured to contradict him, not even the most experienced and most eloquent, but they yielded to him in silence and acquiesced in what he said as though it came from the tripod of an oracle; such a charm sat on his lips. He came of an honourable family and possessed ample means; and he had two lawful brothers whom he kept from holding the very highest rank because he held it himself. They were Claudianus who settled in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> and taught there, and Nymphidianus who became very distinguished as a sophist at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a>. <br /><a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> was one of those who had been saturated with the wisdom of <a href=/people/7167 target=_blank>Aedesius</a>; moreover he received the honour of being the teacher of the Emperor <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a>.

But even in the face of these difficulties he displayed the greatness of his genius.

Now since they had nothing to teach him and <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a> had nothing to learn from them, he begged his cousin's permission to attend the schools of the sophists and lectures on philosophy. He, as the gods so willed, permitted this, because he wished <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a> to browse among books and to have leisure for them, rather than leave him to reflect on his own family and his claim to empire.

But if thou dost desire to accomplish aught, beloved child of wisdom as thou art, such signs and tokens of thy soul do I discern, go to those who are true sons of mine.

At the close of his exposition <a href=/people/1157 target=_blank>Eusebius</a> would add that these are the only true realities, whereas the impostures of witchcraft and magic that cheat the senses are the works of conjurors who are insane men led astray into the exercise of earthly and material powers.

When we had arrived there and had saluted the goddess: 'Be seated, ' said he, 'my well-beloved friends, and observe what shall come to pass, and how greatly I surpass the common herd.' When he had said this, and we had all sat down, he burned a grain of incense and recited to himself the whole of some hymn or other, and was so highly successful in his demonstration that the image of the goddess first began to smile, then even seemed to laugh aloud. We were all much disturbed by this sight, but he said: 'Let none of you be terrified by these things, for presently even the torches which the goddess holds in her hands shall kindle into flame.' And before he could finish speaking the torches burst into a blaze of light. Now for the moment we came away amazed by that theatrical miracle-worker. But you must not marvel at any of these things, even as I marvel not, but rather believe that the thing of the highest importance is that purification of the soul which is attained by reason.

By birth he was descended from the <a href=/people/1941 target=_blank>Eumolpidae</a>. He it was who in the presence of the author of this book foretold the overthrow of the temples and the ruin of the whole of Greece, and he clearly testified that after his death there would be a hierophant who would have no right to touch the hierophant's high seat, because he had been consecrated to the service of other gods and had sworn oaths of the uttermost sanctity that he would not preside over temples other than theirs. Nevertheless he foretold that this man would so preside, though he was not even an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>. To such prophetic power did he attain that he prophesied that in his own lifetime the sacred temples would be razed to the ground and laid waste, and that that other would live to see their ruin and would be despised for his overweening ambition; that the worship of the Goddesses would come to an end before his own death, and that deprived of his honour his life would no longer be that of a hierophant, and that he would not reach old age.

He was of a too secretive disposition, and his learning was recondite and abstruse; moreover, his memory was extraordinarily good, and he had collected all the teachings of the ancients and had them ever on his tongue. In appearance he was very handsome and tall, and he might have been thought uneducated, because it was so hard to induce him to engage in disputation, and he kept his own convictions hidden as though he were guarding a treasure, and used to term prodigals those who too lightly gave out their views on these matters.

For this reason, therefore, he usually maintained his reserve. His bearing was deliberate and lofty, and he preserved this bearing not only when he was with his friends and disciples, but the authority of his manner remained with him from youth to old age. Hence <a href=/people/9133 target=_blank>Chrysanthius</a> used to say to the author of this work that the manners of <a href=/people/7167 target=_blank>Aedesius</a> were sociable and democratic, and after their competitions in literature and disputations, he would go for a walk in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=place long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamon</a> accompanied by the more distinguished of his pupils. And their teacher used to implant in his pupils a feeling of harmony, and of responsibility towards mankind when he observed that they were intolerant and overbearing because of their pride in their own opinions; and when they spread their wings further than those of <a href=/people/1088 target=_blank>Icarus</a>, though they were even more fragile, he would lead them gently down, not into the sea, but to the land and to human life. While he thus instructed them, he himself, if he met a woman selling vegetables, was pleased to see her and would stop in his walk to speak to her and discuss the price she charged, and say that her shop was making a good profit; and at the same time he used to talk with her about the cultivation of vegetables. He would behave in the same fashion to a weaver, or a smith, or a carpenter. Thus the more diligent of his pupils were trained in this affability, especially <a href=/people/9133 target=_blank>Chrysanthius</a> and all who in that school resembled <a href=/people/9133 target=_blank>Chrysanthius</a>.</p>                        </div>

In this prooemium he let fall only one allusion to a grievance, when he pointed out how headlong the proconsular authority had been, since not even after sufficient proof of their guilt was it proper for them to undergo and suffer such treatment.

Meanwhile they all longed to applaud, but sat cowering as though forbidden to do so by a sign from heaven, and a mystic silence pervaded the place. Then he lengthened his speech into a second prooemium as follows (for this part Tuscianus remembered): If, then, men may with impunity commit any injustice and bring accusations and win belief for what they say, before the defence is heard, so be it!

Yet it is convenient here and now to go over the facts in more precise detail, seeing that I had unerring knowledge of him and was admitted to his conversation and teaching. And that is a very great privilege, and has immense power to excite the gratitude due to a teacher; but even this great and inexpressible gratitude falls very far short of what the author owes to <a href=/people/8210 target=_blank>Prohaeresius</a> for his intimate friendship. The compiler of this book had crossed over from Asia to Europe and to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> in the sixteenth year of his age. Now <a href=/people/8210 target=_blank>Prohaeresius</a> had reached his eighty-seventh year, as he himself stated. At this advanced age his hair was curly and very thick, and because of the number of grey hairs it was silvered over and resembled sea foam. His powers of oratory were so vigorous, and he so sustained his worn body by the youthfulness of his soul, that the present writer regarded him as an ageless and immortal being, and heeded him as he might some god who had revealed himself unsummoned and without ceremony.</p>                        </div>

His height was greater than anyone would be inclined to believe, in fact one would hardly guess it correctly. For he seemed to stand nine feet high, so that he looked like a colossus when one saw him near the tallest men of his own time.

They busied themselves with these plots, but meanwhile his friends were beforehand and were smoothing the path of his return, and when <a href=/people/8210 target=_blank>Prohaeresius</a> came back (a precise account of all this was given me by an eyewitness, Tuscianus of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=person long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a>, who would have been a <a href=/people/8210 target=_blank>Prohaeresius</a>, had not <a href=/people/8210 target=_blank>Prohaeresius</a> existed); when, I say, he did return, like some <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> arriving home after a long absence, he found a few of his friends safe and sound (among whom was Tuscianus), and these looked to him for aid after this incredible miracle. Filled with good hopes on finding them there, he said: Wait for the proconsul to come. The latter came sooner than could have been believed possible. On his arrival at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> he called a meeting of the sophists, and by this means threw all their plans into confusion. They assembled slowly and reluctantly, and since they had to obey the voice of necessity they discussed, each according to his ability, certain questions that were proposed to them, while they were provided with applause by persons who had received their instructions and had been invited for the purpose. Then the meeting broke up, and the friends of <a href=/people/8210 target=_blank>Prohaeresius</a> felt discouraged. But the proconsul summoned them a second time, as though to award them honours, ordered them all to be detained, and suddenly he called in <a href=/people/8210 target=_blank>Prohaeresius</a>.</p>                        </div>

Then from his chair the sophist first delivered a graceful prelude by way of preliminary speech, in which he extolled the greatness of extempore eloquence, then with the fullest confidence he rose for his formal discussion.

Then, turning his face towards the scribes, he said: Observe carefully whether I remember all the arguments that I used earlier. And, without faltering over a single word, he began to declaim the same speech for the second time.

Thereupon he asked for something worthy of his character, namely several considerable islands that should pay tribute to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> to provide it with a corn supply. <a href=/people/2733 target=_blank>Constans</a> not only gave him these, but added the highest possible distinction by bestowing on him the title of stratopedarch, lest any should resent his acquisition of so great a fortune from the public funds. It was necessary for the pretorian prefect to confirm this gift; for the prefect had lately arrived from Gaul. Accordingly, after the competitions in eloquence that I have described, <a href=/people/8210 target=_blank>Prohaeresius</a> approached <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a> and begged him to confirm the favour, and summoned not only professional advocates for his cause but almost all the educated men of Greece; for on account of the prefect's visit they were all at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>.

Then, as he declaimed, his gestures became more lively, and he displayed all his sophistic art in handling the theme. The fact that he obtained the honour that he asked for shows what his eloquence must have been. <br />His wife came from Asia, from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379278UTra class=place long=27.8354 lat=37.8598>Tralles</a>, and her name was Amphiclea.

However, the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> of <a href=/people/2533 target=_blank>Milesius</a> proved able to meet this crisis, and by composing lovely harmonies and expending all his gifts of charm and gaiety he recalled him to reason.

He seemed to be peculiarly suited to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, because he knew how to flatter and fawn on the great; while in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> he was regarded as a seditious person. At the same time <a href=/people/8210 target=_blank>Prohaeresius</a> wished to increase his own reputation by sending a man who had been initiated into the sharp practices of political oratory. As for his talent for rhetoric, it is enough to say that he was an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a>; for this race passionately loves the poetic arts, whereas the <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> who inspires serious study has departed from them.</p>                        </div>

And indeed he was so clever in adapting and assimilating himself to all sorts of men that he made the very polypus look foolish 141; and everyone who talked with him thought to behold in him a second self. At any rate those who had had this experience used to declare that he was a sort of picture or wax impression of all the manifold and various characters of mankind. In a gathering of many men of various sorts one could never have detected who it was that he preferred. Hence those who pursued modes of life directly opposed to one another would applaud in him qualities that were directly opposed, and everyone without exception was convinced that it was his views that <a href=/people/3416 target=_blank>Libanius</a> admired; so multiform was he, so completely all things to all men. He too avoided marriage, though in fact a woman lived with him, a person of a social position inferior to his own. <br />His style of eloquence in his declamations was altogether feeble, lifeless, and uninspired, and it is very evident that he had not had the advantage of a teacher; indeed he was ignorant of most of the ordinary rules of declamation, things that even a schoolboy knows. But in his Letters and other familiar addresses he succeeds in rousing himself and rises to the level of the ancient models. His writings are full of charm and facetious wit, while a refined elegance pervades the whole and is at the service of his eloquence.</p>                        </div>

For he forthwith rose to great renown at the courts of the rulers of the barbarians, and held the first rank there; and while throughout the Roman empire he was highly regarded, among the barbarians he was worshipped like a god; since some he restored from chronic diseases and snatched others from death's door. Indeed that which men had reckoned his misfortune proved to be the occasion of nothing but good fortune; so that even the emperors gave up fighting against the man's power so universally displayed, and permitted him to return from exile.</p>                        </div>

From his childhood this boy was a creature winged for every excellence, and of the two <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> as <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> describes them, his soul possessed only the good steed, nor did his intellect ever sink; but he was a devoted student, keenwitted, and assiduous in the worship of the gods; and so completely was he emancipated from human weaknesses, that though a mortal man he was all soul. At any rate his body was so light in its movements that it would seem incredible and would take a genuine poet to describe to what a height it rose aloft. His kinship and affinity with the gods was so unceremonious and familiar that he had only to place the garland on this head and turn his gaze upwards to the sun, and immediately deliver oracles which, moreover, were always infallible and were composed after the fairest models of divine inspiration. Yet he neither knew the art of writing verse nor was trained in the science of grammar; but for him the god took the place of all else. Though he had never been ill during his allotted span of life, he died when he was about twenty years of age. On this occasion also his father showed himself a true philosopher. For whether it was that the greatness of the calamity reduced him to a state of apathy, or whether he rejoiced with his son in the latter's blessed portion, the fact is that he remained unshaken. The youth's mother also, observing her husband, rose above the ordinary feminine nature and put away from her all loud lamentation, that her grief might have its due dignity. </p>                        </div>

And when many great public and universal calamities and disturbances befell, which shook all men's souls with terror, he alone remained unshaken by the storm; so much so that one would have thought that he was really elsewhere than on earth. About this time Hellespontius came to see him, and they met and conversed, though only after some delay. When, however, they did actually meet, Hellespontius was so captivated that he abandoned all else and was ready to live under the same roof as <a href=/people/9133 target=_blank>Chrysanthius</a> and to renew his youth by studying with him. For he regretted that he had so long wandered in error, and had arrived at old age before learning anything useful. Accordingly he bent his whole mind to this task. But it chanced that <a href=/people/9133 target=_blank>Chrysanthius</a> had to have a vein cut open as was his custom, and the author was present in obedience to his orders; and when the doctors prescribed that the blood should be allowed to flow freely, the author in his anxiety to apply the right treatment declared that the bloodletting was beyond all reason, and gave orders that it should be stopped then and there; for the author of this work had considerable knowledge of medicine. Hellespontius hearing what had happened came at once, indignant and loudly lamenting that it was a great calamity that a man of so great an age should lose so much blood from his arm. But when he heard <a href=/people/9133 target=_blank>Chrysanthius</a> talking and saw that he was unharmed, he directed his remarks to the author and said:</p>                        </div>

The author replied that he knew what was the proper treatment, whereupon Hellespontius made as though he would collect his books and go to <a href=/people/9133 target=_blank>Chrysanthius</a> for a lesson; but he really left the city. Presently he began to suffer from a pain in his stomach, and he turned aside to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404289PBry class=place long=28.8827 lat=40.3756>Apamea</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a> and there departed this life, after laying the strictest injunctions on his comrade <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a>, who was present, to admire none but <a href=/people/9133 target=_blank>Chrysanthius</a>. <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=place long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardis</a> and did as he said, and reported these facts. <br />Now <a href=/people/9133 target=_blank>Chrysanthius</a>, at the same season in the following year, that is at the beginning of summer, had recourse to the same remedy, and though the author of this work had given instructions to the doctors beforehand that they must wait for him as usual, they arrived without his knowledge. <a href=/people/9133 target=_blank>Chrysanthius</a> offered his arm to them, and there was an excessive flux of blood, the result of which was that his limbs relaxed and he suffered acute pain in his joints, so that he had to stay in bed. <a href=/people/12210 target=_blank>Oribasius</a> was immediately called in, and for the sake of <a href=/people/9133 target=_blank>Chrysanthius</a> he almost succeeded, so extraordinary was his professional skill, in doing violence to the laws of nature, and by means of hot and soothing fomentations he almost restored the vigour of youth to those rigid limbs. Nevertheless old age gained the victory; for his eightieth year was now approaching, and the influence of his age was doubly felt when his temperature was so greatly changed by the excessive application of heat. After an illness of four days he departed to a destiny that was worthy of him.</p>                        </div>
