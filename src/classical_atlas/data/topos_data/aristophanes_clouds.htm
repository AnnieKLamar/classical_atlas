I heard the cock crow long ago and my slaves are snoring still! Ah! 'twas not so formerly. Curses on the War! has it not done me ills enough? Now I may not even chastise my own slaves. Again there's this brave lad, who never wakes the whole long night, but, wrapped in his five coverlets, farts away to his heart's content. Come! let me nestle in well and snore too, if it be possible ... oh! misery, 'tis vain to think of sleep with all these expenses, this stable, these debts, which are devouring me, thanks to this fine cavalier, who only knows how to look after his long locks, to show himself off in his chariot and to dream of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>! And I, I am nearly dead, when I see the moon bringing the third decade in her train and my liability falling due.... Slave! light the lamp and bring me my tablets. Who are all my creditors? Let me see and reckon up the interest. What is it I owe? ... Twelve minae to <a href=/people/6765 target=_blank>Pasias</a>.... What! twelve minae to <a href=/people/6765 target=_blank>Pasias</a>? ... Why did I borrow these? Ah! I know! 'Twas to buy that thoroughbred, which cost me so dear. How I should have prized the stone that had blinded him! <br />PHIDIPPIDES (in his sleep). That's not fair, <a href=/people/486 target=_blank>Philo</a>! Drive your chariot straight, I say. <br />STREPSIADES: 'Tis this that is destroying me. He raves about <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, even in his sleep. <br />PHIDIPPIDES (still sleeping). How many times round the track is the race for the chariots of war? <br />STREPSIADES: 'Tis your own father you are driving to death ... to ruin. Come! what debt comes next, after that of <a href=/people/6765 target=_blank>Pasias</a>? ... Three minae to <a href=/people/3528 target=_blank>Amynias</a> for a chariot and its two wheels. <br />PHIDIPPIDES (still asleep). Give the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> a good roll in the dust and lead him home. <br />STREPSIADES: Ah! wretched boy! 'tis my money that you are making roll. My creditors have distrained on my goods, and here are others again, who demand security for their interest. <br />PHIDIPPIDES (awaking). What is the matter with you, father, that you groan and turn about the whole night through? <br />STREPSIADES: I have a bum-bailiff in the bedclothes biting me. </p>                        </div>

Oh! curses on the go-between who made me marry your mother! I lived so happily in the country, a commonplace, everyday life, but a good and easy one — had not a trouble, not a care, was rich in <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>, in <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and in olives. Then forsooth I must marry the niece of <a href=/people/789 target=_blank>Megacles</a>, the son of <a href=/people/789 target=_blank>Megacles</a>; I belonged to the country, she was from the town; she was a haughty, extravagant woman, a true <a href=/people/7528 target=_blank>Coesyra</a>. On the nuptial day, when I lay beside her, I was reeking of the dregs of the wine-cup, of cheese and of wool; she was redolent with essences, saffron, tender kisses, the love of spending, of good cheer and of wanton delights. I will not say she did nothing; no, she worked hard ... to ruin me, and pretending all the while merely to be showing her the cloak she had woven for me, I said, Wife, you go too fast about your work, your threads are too closely woven and you use far too much wool. <br />A SLAVE: There is no more oil in the lamp. <br />STREPSIADES: Why then did you light such a guzzling lamp? Come here, I am going to beat you! <br />SLAVE: What for? <br />STREPSIADES: Because you have put in too thick a wick.... Later, when we had this boy, what was to be his name? 'Twas the cause of much quarrelling with my loving wife. She insisted on having some reference to a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> in his name, that he should be called <a href=/people/727 target=_blank>Xanthippus</a>, <a href=/people/4480 target=_blank>Charippus</a> or <a href=/people/3549 target=_blank>Callippides</a>. I wanted to name him Phidonides after his grandfather. We disputed long, and finally agreed to style him <a href=/people/5178 target=_blank>Phidippides</a>.... She used to fondle and coax him, saying, Oh! what a joy it will be to me when you have grown up, to see you, like my father, <a href=/people/789 target=_blank>Megacles</a>, clothed in purple and standing up straight in your chariot driving your steeds toward the town. And I would say to him, When, like your father, you will go, dressed in a skin, to fetch back your <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> from <a href=/people/5887 target=_blank>Phelleus</a>. Alas! he never listened to me and his madness for <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> has shattered my fortune. But by dint of thinking the livelong night, I have discovered a road to salvation, both miraculous and divine. If he will but follow it, I shall be out of my trouble! First, however, he must be awakened, but let it be done as gently as possible. How shall I manage it? <a href=/people/5178 target=_blank>Phidippides</a>! my little <a href=/people/5178 target=_blank>Phidippides</a>! <br />PHIDIPPIDES: What is it, father! <br />STREPSIADES: Kiss me and give me your hand. <br />PHIDIPPIDES: There!

And you, great high-priest of subtle nonsense, tell us your desire. To you and <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> alone of all the hollow orationers of today have we lent an ear — to <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a>, because of his knowledge and his great wisdom, and to you, because you walk with head erect, a confident look, barefooted, resigned to everything and proud of our protection. <br />STREPSIADES: Oh! <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>!

I tell you, that the Clouds, when full of rain, bump against one another, and that, being inordinately swollen out, they burst with a great noise. <br />STREPSIADES: How can you make me credit that? <br />SOCRATES: Take yourself as an example. When you have heartily gorged on stew at the <a href=/people/11002 target=_blank>Panathenaea</a>, you get throes of stomach-ache and then suddenly your belly resounds with prolonged growling. <br />STREPSIADES: Yes, yes, by <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>!

Firstly, it was required of a child, that it should not utter a word. In the street, when they went to the music-school, all the youths of the same district marched lightly clad and ranged in good order, even when the snow was falling in great flakes. At the master's house they had to stand, their legs apart, and they were taught to sing either, <a href=/people/429 target=_blank>Pallas</a>, the Terrible, who overturneth cities, or A noise resounded from afar in the solemn tones of the ancient harmony. If anyone indulged in buffoonery or lent his voice any of the soft inflexions, like those which today the disciples of <a href=/people/3453 target=_blank>Phrynis</a> take so much pains to form, he was treated as an enemy of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> and belaboured with blows. In the wrestling school they would sit with outstretched legs and without display of any indecency to the curious. When they rose, they would smooth over the sand, so as to leave no trace to excite obscene thoughts. Never was a child rubbed with oil below the belt; the rest of their bodies thus retained its fresh bloom and down, like a velvety peach. They were not to be seen approaching a lover and themselves rousing his passion by soft modulation of the voice and lustful gaze. At table, they would not have dared, before those older than themselves, to have taken a radish, an aniseed or a leaf of parsley, and much less eat fish or thrushes or cross their legs. </p>                        </div>

Why, 'tis I who had you taught how to refute what is right, and now you would persuade me it is right a son should beat his father. <br />PHIDIPPIDES: I think I shall convince you so thoroughly that, when you have heard me, you will not have a word to say. <br />STREPSIADES: Well, I am curious to hear what you have to say. <br />CHORUS: Consider well, old man, how you can best triumph over him. His brazenness shows me that he thinks himself sure of his case; he has some argument which gives him nerve. Note the confidence in his look! But how did the fight begin? tell the Chorus; you cannot help doing that much. <br />STREPSIADES: I will tell you what was the start of the quarrel. At the end of the meal you wot of, I bade him take his lyre and sing me the air of <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>, which tells of the fleece of the ram. He replied bluntly, that it was stupid, while drinking, to play the lyre and sing, like a woman when she is grinding barley. <br />PHIDIPPIDES: Why, by rights I ought to have beaten and kicked you the very moment you told me to sing! <br />STREPSIADES: That is just how he spoke to me in the house, furthermore he added, that <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> was a detestable poet. However, I mastered myself and for a while said nothing. Then I said to him, 'At least, take a myrtle branch and recite a passage from <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a> to me.' — 'For my own part,' he at once replied, 'I look upon <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a> as the first of poets, for his verses roll superbly; 'tis nothing but incoherence, bombast and turgidness.' Yet still I smothered my wrath and said, 'Then recite one of the famous pieces from the modern poets.' Then he commenced a piece in which <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> shows, oh! horror! a brother, who violates his own uterine sister. Then I could no longer restrain myself, and attacked him with the most injurious abuse; naturally he retorted; hard words were hurled on both sides, and finally he sprang at me, broke my bones, bore me to earth, strangled and started killing me! </p>                        </div>

If you said broo, broo, well, I brought you your milk; if you asked for mam mam, I gave you bread; and you had no sooner said, caca, than I took you outside and held you out. And just now, when you were strangling me, I shouted, I bellowed that I would let all go; and you, you scoundrel, had not the heart to take me outside, so that here, though almost choking, I was compelled to ease myself. <br />CHORUS: Young men, your hearts must be panting with impatience.
