But either of these two has earned more money from his wisdom than any artisan from his art.

For recently, my most excellent friend, as I was finding fault with some things in certain speeches as ugly and praising other things as beautiful, a man threw me into confusion by questioning me very insolently somewhat after this fashion: How, if you please, do you know, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, said he, [286d] what sort of things are beautiful and ugly? For, come now, could you tell me what the beautiful is? And I, being of no account, was at a loss and could not answer him properly; and so, as I was going away from the company, I was angry with myself and reproached myself, and threatened that the first time I met one of you wise men, I would hear and learn and practise and then go back to the man who questioned me to renew the wordy strife. So now, as I say, you have come at the right moment; [286e] just teach me satisfactorily what the absolute beautiful is, and try in replying to speak as accurately as possible, that I may not be confuted a second time and be made ridiculous again. For you doubtless know clearly, and this would doubtless be but a small example of your wide learning. <br />HIPPIAS: Yes, surely, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, a small one, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, and, I may say, of no value. <br />SOCRATES: Then I shall learn it easily, and nobody will confute me any more. <br />HIPPIAS: Nobody, surely; for in that case my profession would be </p>                        </div>

What an uncultivated person, who has the face to mention such worthless things in a dignified discussion! <br />SOCRATES: That's the kind of person he is, <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a>, not elegant, but vulgar, thinking of nothing but the truth. But nevertheless the man must be answered, and I will declare my opinion beforehand: if the pot were made by a good potter, were smooth and round and well fired, as are some of the two-handled pots, those that hold six choes, very beautiful ones — [288e] if that were the kind of pot he asked about, we must agree that it is beautiful; for how could we say that being beautiful it is not beautiful? <br />HIPPIAS: We could not at all, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>. <br />SOCRATES: Then, he will say, a beautiful pot also is beautiful, is it not? Answer. <br />HIPPIAS: Well, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, it is like this, I think. This utensil, when well wrought, is beautiful, but absolutely considered it does not deserve to be regarded as beautiful in comparison with a mare and a maiden and all the beautiful things. </p>                        </div>

For I am sure that after this he will say: Yes, but, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, if we compare maidens with gods, [289b] will not the same thing happen to them that happened to pots when compared with maidens? Will not the most beautiful maiden appear ugly?

So it seems, I shall say; or what do you, my friend, advise me to say? <br />HIPPIAS: That is what I advise; for, of course, in saying that the human race is not beautiful in comparison with gods, you will be speaking the truth. <br />SOCRATES: But if I had asked you, he will say, in the beginning what is beautiful and ugly, [289d] if you had replied as you now do, would you not have replied correctly? But do you still think that the absolute beautiful, by the addition of which all other things are adorned and made to appear beautiful, when its form is added to any of them — do you think that is a maiden or a mare or a lyre? <br />HIPPIAS: Well, certainly, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, if that is what he is looking for, nothing is easier than to answer and tell him what the beautiful is, by which all other things are adorned and by the addition of which they are made to appear beautiful.

If we say this, <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a>, I too understand, he will perhaps say, that you have all along been ashamed to say that these pleasures are beautiful, [299b] because they do not seem so to people; but that is not what I asked, what seems to most people to be beautiful, but what is so. We shall, then, I fancy, say, as we suggested, We say that that part of the pleasant which comes by sight and hearing is beautiful. Do you think the statement is of any use, <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a>, or shall we say something else? <br />HIPPIAS: Inevitably, in view of what has been said, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, we must say just that. <br />SOCRATES: Excellent! he will say. </p>                        </div>

No, we shall say, that which is pleasant through each of these would not in the least be pleasant through both — for that is what you appear to us to mean — but we said [299d] that either of these pleasant things would be beautiful alone by itself, and both together. Is not that the reply we shall make? <br />HIPPIAS: Certainly. <br />SOCRATES: Does, then, he will say, any pleasant thing whatsoever differ from any pleasant thing whatsoever by this, by being pleasant? I ask not whether any pleasure is greater or smaller or more or less, but whether it differs by just this very thing, by the fact that one of the pleasures is a pleasure and the other is not a pleasure. We do not think so. Do we? <br />HIPPIAS: No, we do not. <br />SOCRATES: Is it not, then, he will say, for some other reason than because they are pleasures that you chose these pleasures out from the other pleasures [299e] — it was because you saw some quality in both, since they have something different from the others, in view of which you say that they are beautiful? For the reason why that which is pleasant through sight is beautiful, is not, I imagine, because it is through sight; for if that were the cause of its being beautiful, the other pleasure, that through hearing, would not be beautiful; it certainly is not pleasure through sight.
