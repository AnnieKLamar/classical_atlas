For both alike gave many signal proofs of daring and valour as soldiers, as well as of skill and foresight as commanders; 2 except that some may give the preference to <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a>, because he was continually successful and victorious in many struggles by sea, as well as by land, and declare him therefore the more consummate general. It is certainly true of each that, when he was at home and in command, he always conducted his country's cause with manifest success, and, contrariwise, inflicted even more manifest injury upon it when he went over to the enemy. 3 As statesmen, if the exceeding wantonness of <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a>, and the stain of dissoluteness and vulgarity upon all his efforts to win the favour of the multitude, won the loathing of sober-minded citizens, it was equally true that the utter ungraciousness of <a href=/people/10971 target=_blank>Marcius</a>, together with his pride and oligarchical demeanour, won the hatred of the Roman people. 4 Neither course, then, is to be approved; although the man who seeks to win the people by his favours is less blameworthy than those who heap insults on the multitude, in order to avoid the appearance of trying to win them. For it is a disgrace to flatter the people for the sake of power; but to get power by acts of terror, violence, and oppression, is not only a disgrace, it is also an injustice. </p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a> is particularly denounced for the malicious deceit by which he cheated the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonian</a> ambassadors, as <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a> relates, and put an end to the peace. 2 But this policy of his, although it did plunge the city again into war, made it nevertheless strong and formidable, by reason of the alliance with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376224UMan class=place long=22.3933 lat=37.6181>Mantineia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a> which <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a> secured for it.

It is true, indeed, that <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a> also, through his anger, was the cause of great calamities to his countrymen. 4 But just as soon as he saw that they were repentant, he showed them his goodwill, and after he had been driven away a second time, he did not exult over the mistakes of their generals, nor look with indifference upon their bad and perilous plans, but did precisely what <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> is so highly praised for doing to <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a>: he came to the men who were then in command, although they were not his friends, and told them plainly what they ought to do. 5 <a href=/people/10971 target=_blank>Marcius</a>, however, in the first place, did injury to his whole city, although he had not been injured by the whole of it, but the best and strongest part of it shared his wrongs and his distress; in the second place, by resisting and not yielding to the many embassies and supplications with which his countrymen tried to heal his single wrath and folly, he made it clear that he had undertaken a fierce and implacable war for the overthrow and destruction of his country, not that he might recover and regain it. </p>                        </div>

When he was at home, he mastered his adversaries to his heart's content; it was when he was absent that their calumnies prevailed. 2 <a href=/people/10971 target=_blank>Marcius</a>, on the contrary, was with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> when they condemned him, and with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416133RVol class=ethnic long=13.3 lat=41.6>Volscians</a> when they slew him. The deed was not in accordance with justice or right, it is true, and yet his own acts supplied an excuse for it, because, after rejecting the terms of peace publicly offered, and suffering himself to be persuaded by the private solicitations of the women, he did not put an end to hostilities, but allowed the war to continue, while he threw away for ever its golden opportunity. </p>                        </div>

If, on the other hand, he cared nothing for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416133RVol class=ethnic long=13.3 lat=41.6>Volscians</a>, but was prosecuting the war merely to satisfy his own anger, and then stopped it abruptly, the honourable course had been, not to spare his country for his mother's sake, but his mother together with his country; since his mother and his wife were part and parcel of the native city which he was besieging. 4 But after giving harsh treatment to public supplications, entreaties of embassies, and prayers of priests, then to concede his withdrawal as a favour to his mother, was not so much an honour to that mother, as it was a dishonour to his country, which was thus saved by the pitiful intercession of a single woman, and held unworthy of salvation for its own sake. Surely the favour was invidious, and harsh, and really no favour at all, and unacceptable to both parties; for he retired without listening to the persuasions of his antagonists, and without gaining the consent of his comrades-in‑arms. </p>                        </div>

Such men pay no court to the multitude, professing not to want their honours, and then are vexed if they do not get them. Certainly there was no tendency to importune or court the favour of the multitude in men like <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a>, and <a href=/people/150 target=_blank>Epaminondas</a>; 6 but owing to their genuine contempt for what a people has the power to give and take away, though they were repeatedly ostracised, defeated at elections, and condemned in courts of justice, they cherished no anger against their countrymen for their ingratitude, but showed them kindness again when they repented, and were reconciled with them when they asked it. Surely he who least courts the people's favour, ought least to resent their neglect, since vexation over failure to receive their honours is most apt to spring from an excessive longing after them. </p>                        </div>
