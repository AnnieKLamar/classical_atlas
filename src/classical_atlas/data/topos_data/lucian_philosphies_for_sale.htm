This is performed by the use of the far-famed syllogism. <br />SEVENTH D: Syllogism! I warrant him a tough customer. <br />CHRYS: Take a case. You have a child? <br />SEVENTH D: Well, and what if I have? <br />CHRYS: A crocodile catches him as he wanders along the bank of a river, and promises to restore him to you, if you will first guess correctly whether he means to restore him or not. Which are you going to say? <br />SEVENTH D: A difficult question. I don't know which way I should get him back soonest. In Heaven's name, answer for me, and save the child before he is eaten up. <br />CHRYS: Ha, ha. I will teach you far other things than that. <br />SEVENTH D: For instance? <br />CHRYS: There is the 'Reaper.' There is the 'Rightful Owner.' Better still, there is the '<a href=/people/388 target=_blank>Electra</a>' and the 'Man in the Hood.' <br />SEVENTH D: Who was he? and who was <a href=/people/388 target=_blank>Electra</a>? <br />CHRYS: She was the <a href=/people/388 target=_blank>Electra</a>, the daughter of <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, to whom the same thing was known and unknown at the same time. She knew that <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> was her brother: yet when he stood before her she did not know (until he revealed himself) that her brother was <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a>. As to the Man in the Hood, he will surprise you considerably. Answer me now: do you know your own father? <br />SEVENTH D: Yes. <br />CHRYS: Well now, if I present to you a man in a hood, shall you know him? eh? <br />SEVENTH D: Of course not. </p>                        </div>

Therefore you don't know your own father. <br />SEVENTH D: Why, no. But if I take his hood off, I shall get at the facts. Now tell me, what is the end of your philosophy? What happens when you reach the goal of virtue? <br />CHRYS: In regard to things external, health, wealth, and the like, I am then all that Nature intended me to be. But there is much previous toil to be undergone. You will first sharpen your eyes on minute manuscripts, amass commentaries, and get your bellyful of outlandish terms. Last but not least, it is forbidden to be wise without repeated doses of hellebore. <br />SEVENTH D: All this is exalted and magnanimous to a degree. But what am I to think when I find that you are also the creed of cent-per-cent, the creed of the usurer? Has he swallowed his hellebore? is he made perfect in virtue? <br />CHRYS: Assuredly. On none but the wise man does usury sit well. Consider. His is the art of putting two and two together, and usury is the art of putting interest together. The two are evidently connected, and one as much as the other is the prerogative of the true believer; who, not content, like common men, with simple interest, will also take interest upon interest. For interest, as you are probably aware, is of two kinds. There is simple interest, and there is its offspring, compound interest. Hear Syllogism on the subject. 'If I take simple interest, I shall also take compound. But I shall take simple interest: therefore I shall take compound.' <br />SEVENTH D: And the same applies to the fees you take from </p>                        </div>

I take the fee in my pupil's interest, not because I want it. The world is made up of diffusion and accumulation. I accordingly practise my pupil in the former, and myself in the latter. <br />SEVENTH D: But it ought to be the other way. The pupil ought to accumulate, and you, 'sole millionaire,' ought to diffuse. <br />CHRYS: Ha! you jest with me? Beware of the shaft of insoluble syllogism. <br />SEVENTH D: What harm can that do? <br />CHRYS: It cripples; it ties the tongue, and turns the brain. </p>                        </div>
