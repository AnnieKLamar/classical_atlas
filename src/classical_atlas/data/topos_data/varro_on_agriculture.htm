                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0684.phi002:1.1.1'><b>&sect; 1.1.1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Book I <br />Had I possessed the leisure, Fundania, I should write in a more serviceable form what now I must set forth as I can, reflecting that I must hasten; for if man is a bubble, as the proverb has it, all the more so is an old man. For my eightieth year admonishes me to gather up my pack before I set forth from life. 2 Wherefore, since you have bought an estate and wish to make it profitable by good cultivation, and ask that I concern myself with the matter, I will make the attempt; and in such wise as to advise you with regard to the proper practice not only while I live but even after my death. 3 And I cannot allow the <a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibyl</a> to have uttered prophecies which benefited mankind not only while she lived, but even after she had passed away, and that too people whom she never knew — for so many years later we are wont officially to consult her books when we desire to know what we should do after some portent — and not do something, even while I am alive, to help my friends and kinsfolk. 4 Therefore I shall write for you three handbooks to which you may turn whenever you wish to know, in a given case, how you ought to proceed in farming. And since, as told, the gods help those who call upon them, I will first invoke them — not the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, as <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> and <a href=/people/337 target=_blank>Ennius</a> do, but the twelve councillor-gods; and I do not mean those urban gods, whose images stand around the forum, bedecked with gold, six male and a like number female, but those twelve gods who are the special patrons of husbandmen. 5 First, then, I invoke <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> and <a href=/people/12080 target=_blank>Tellus</a>, who, by means of the sky and the earth, embrace all the fruits of agriculture; and hence, as we are told that they are the universal parents, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> is called the Father, and <a href=/people/12080 target=_blank>Tellus</a> is called Mother Earth. And second, <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sol</a> and <a href=/people/339 target=_blank>Luna</a>, whose courses are watched in all matters of planting and harvesting. Third, <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a> and <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Liber</a>, because their fruits are most necessary for life; for it is by their favour that food and drink come from the farm. 6 Fourth, Robigus and <a href=/people/12068 target=_blank>Flora</a>; for when they are propitious the rust will not harm the grain and the trees, and they will not fail to bloom in their season; wherefore, in honour of Robigus has been established the solemn feast of the Robigalia, and in honour of <a href=/people/12068 target=_blank>Flora</a> the games called the <a href=/people/5668 target=_blank>Floralia</a>. Likewise I beseech <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a> and <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>, of whom the one protects the oliveyard and the other the garden; and in her honour the rustic <a href=/people/7029 target=_blank>Vinalia</a> has been established. And I shall not fail to pray also to Lympha and Bonus Eventus, since without moisture all tilling of the ground is parched and barren, and without success and good issue it is not tillage but vexation. 7 Having now duly invoked these divinities, I shall relate the conversations which we had recently about agriculture, from which you may learn what you ought to do; and if matters in which you are interested are not treated, I shall indicate the writers, both Greek and Roman, from whom you may learn them. <br />Those who have written various separate treatises in Greek, one on one subject, another on another, are more than fifty in number. </p>                        </div>

And so, after first showing what matter should be omitted, I shall treat of the subject, following the natural divisions. My remarks will be derived from three sources: what I have myself observed by practice on my own land, what I have read, and what I have heard from experts. </p>                        </div>

I found there Gaius <a href=/people/3843 target=_blank>Fundanius</a>, my father-in-law, Gaius <a href=/people/2084 target=_blank>Agrius</a>, a Roman knight of the <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socratic</a> school, and <a href=/people/2779 target=_blank>Publius</a> Agrasius, the tax-farmer, examining a map of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> painted on the wall. What are you doing here? said I. Has the festival of the Sementivae brought you here to spend your holiday, as it used to bring our fathers and grandfathers? 2 I take it, replied <a href=/people/2084 target=_blank>Agrius</a>, that the same reason brought us which brought you — the invitation of the sacristan. If I am correct, as your nod implies, you will have to await with us his return; he was summoned by the aedile who has supervision of this temple, and has not yet returned; and he left a man to ask us to wait for him. Do you wish us then meanwhile to follow the old proverb, 'the Roman wins by sitting still,' until he returns? By all means, replied <a href=/people/2084 target=_blank>Agrius</a>; and reflecting that the longest part of the journey is said to be the passing of the gate, he walked to a bench, with us in his train. </p>                        </div>

For my part, replied <a href=/people/2084 target=_blank>Agrius</a>, I think there is none which is so wholly under cultivation. Consider first: <a href=/people/132 target=_blank>Eratosthenes</a>, following a most natural division, has divided the earth into two parts, 4 one to the south and the other to the north; and since the northern part is undoubtedly more healthful than the southern, while the part which is more healthful is more fruitful, we must agree that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> at least was more suited to cultivation than <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>. In the first place, it is in Europe; and in the next place, this part of Europe has a more temperate climate than we find farther inland. For the winter is almost continuous in the interior, and no wonder, since its lands lie between the arctic circle and the pole, where the sun is not visible for six months at a time; wherefore we are told that even navigation in the ocean is not possible in that region because of the frozen sea. 5 Well, remarked <a href=/people/3843 target=_blank>Fundanius</a>, do you think that anything can germinate in such a land, or mature if it does germinate? That was a true saying of <a href=/people/1225 target=_blank>Pacuvius</a>, that if either day or night be uninterrupted, all the fruits of the earth perish, from the fiery vapour or from the cold. For my part, I could not live even here, where the night and the day alternate at moderate intervals, if I did not break the summer day with my regular midday nap; 6 but there, where the day and the night are each six months long, how can anything be planted, or grow, or be harvested? On the other hand, what useful product is there which not only does not grow in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, but even grow to perfection? What spelt shall I compare to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=demonym long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campanian</a>, what wheat to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=demonym long=16.3 lat=41>Apulian</a>, what wine to the Falernian, what oil to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415140UVen class=demonym long=14.0461 lat=41.4845>Venafran</a>? Is not <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> so covered with trees that the whole land seems to be an orchard? 7 Is that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>, which <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> calls 'the vine-clad,' more covered with vines than this land, or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>, which the same poet calls 'the rich in corn,' more covered with wheat? In what land does one iugerum bear ten and fifteen cullei of wine, as do some sections of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>? Or does not Marcus <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> use this language in his <a href=/people/5146 target=_blank>Origines</a>? 'The land lying this side of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a> and beyond the district of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a>, which was allotted to colonists, is called Gallo-Roman. In that district, at several places, ten cullei of wine are produced to the iugerum.' Is not the same true of the district of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443119UFav class=place long=11.8841 lat=44.2856>Faventia</a>? The vines there are called by this writer trecenariae, from the fact that the iugerum yields three hundred amphorae. And he added, turning to me, At least your friend, <a href=/people/10971 target=_blank>Marcius</a> <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a>, the engineer officer, used to tell me that the vines on his estate at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443119UFav class=place long=11.8841 lat=44.2856>Faventia</a> bore this quantity. 8 The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> seems to have had two things particularly in view in his farming: whether the land would yield a fair return for the investment in money and labour, and whether the situation was healthful or not. If either of these elements is lacking, any man who, in spite of that fact, desires to farm has lost his wits, and should be taken in charge by his kinsmen and family. For no sane man should be willing to undergo the expense and outlay of cultivation if he sees that it cannot be recouped; or, supposing that he can raise a crop, if he sees that it will be destroyed by the unwholesomeness of the situation. 9 But, I think, there are some gentlemen present who can speak with more authority on these subjects; for I see Gaius <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> <a href=/people/4697 target=_blank>Stolo</a> and Gnaeus Tremelius <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a> approaching, one of them a man whose ancestors originated the bill to regulate the holding of land (for that law which forbids a Roman citizen to hold more than 500 iugera was proposed by a <a href=/people/4697 target=_blank>Stolo</a>),17 and who has proved the appropriateness of the family name by his diligence in farming; he used to dig around his trees so thoroughly that there could not be found on his farm a single one of those suckers which spring up from the roots and are called stolones. Of the same farm was that Gaius <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> who, when he was tribune of the plebs, 365 years after the expulsion of the kings, was the first to lead people, for the hearing of laws, from the comitium into the farm of the forum. 10 The other whom I see coming is your colleague, who was of the Commission of Twenty for parcelling the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=demonym long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campanian</a> lands, Gnaeus Tremelius <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a>, a man distinguished by all virtues, who is esteemed the Roman most skilled in agriculture. And justly so, I exclaimed. For his estates, because of their high cultivation, are a more pleasing sight to many than the country seats of others, furnished in a princely style. When people come to inspect his farmsteads, it is not to see collections of pictures, as at <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>'s, but collections of fruit. The top of the Via Sacra, I added, where fruit brings its weight in gold, is a very picture of his orchard. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0684.phi002:1.2.11'><b>&sect; 1.2.11</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;While we were speaking they came up, and <a href=/people/4697 target=_blank>Stolo</a> inquired: We haven't arrived too late for dinner? For I do not see Lucius Fundilius, our host. Do not be alarmed, replied <a href=/people/2084 target=_blank>Agrius</a>, for not only has that egg which shows the last lap of the chariot race at the games in the circus not been taken down, but we have not even seen that other egg which usually heads the procession at dinner. 12 And so, while you and we are waiting to see the latter, and our sacristan is returning, tell us what end agriculture has in view, profit, or pleasure, or both; for we are told that you are now the past-master of agriculture, and that <a href=/people/4697 target=_blank>Stolo</a> formerly was. First, remarked <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a>, we should determine whether we are to include under agriculture only things planted, or also other things, such as <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, which are brought on to the land. 13 For I observe that those who have written on agriculture, whether in Punic, or Greek, or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a>, have wandered too far from the subject. For my part, replied <a href=/people/4697 target=_blank>Stolo</a>, I do not think that they are to be imitated in every respect, but that certain of them have acted wisely in confining the subject to narrower limits, and excluding matters which do not bear directly on this topic. Thus the whole subject of grazing, which many writers include under agriculture, seems to me to concern the herdsman rather than the farmer. 14 For that reason the persons who are placed in charge of the two occupations have different names, one being called vilicus, and the other magister pecoris. The vilicus is appointed for the purpose of tilling the ground, and the name is derived from villa, the place into which the crops are hauled (vehuntur), and out of which they are hauled by him when they are sold. For this reason the peasants even now call a road veha, because of the hauling; and they call the place to which and from which they haul vella and not villa. In the same way, those who make a living by hauling are said facere velaturam. 15 Certainly, said <a href=/people/3843 target=_blank>Fundanius</a>, grazing and agriculture are different things, though akin; just as the right pipe of the tibia is different from the left, but still in a way united, inasmuch as the one is the treble, while the other plays the accompaniment of the same air. 16 You may even add this, said I, that the shepherd's life is the treble, and the farmer's plays the accompaniment, if we may trust that most learned man, <a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a>. In his sketch of Greek life from the earliest times, he says that in the primitive period, when people led a pastoral life, they were ignorant even of ploughing, of planting trees, and of pruning, and that agriculture was adopted by them only at a later period. Wherefore the art of agriculture 'accompanies' the pastoral because it is subordinate, as the left pipe is to the stops of the right.20 17 You and your piping, retorted <a href=/people/2084 target=_blank>Agrius</a>, are not only robbing the master of his flock and the slaves of their peculium — the grazing which their master allows them — but you are even abrogating the homestead laws, among which we find one reciting that the shepherd may not graze a young orchard with the offspring of the she-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>, a race which astrology, too, has placed in the heavens, not far from the Bull. 18 Be careful, <a href=/people/2084 target=_blank>Agrius</a>, interrupted <a href=/people/3843 target=_blank>Fundanius</a>, that your citation cannot be wide of the mark; for it is also written in the law, 'a certain kind of flock.' For certain kinds of animals are the foes of plants, and even poisonous, such as the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> of which you spoke; for they destroy all young plants by their browsing, and especially vines and olives. 19 Accordingly there arose a custom, from opposite reasons, that a victim from the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> family might be led to the altar of one god, but might not be sacrificed on the altar of another; since, because of the same hatred, the one was not willing to see a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>, while the other was pleased to see him die. So it was that he-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> were offered to father <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a>, the discoverer of the vine, so that they might pay with their lives for the injuries they do him; while, on the other hand, no member of the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> family was sacrificed to <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a> on account of the olive, because it is said that any olive plant which they bite becomes sterile; for their spittle is poisonous to its fruit. 20 For this reason, also, they are not driven into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAkr class=place long=23.7257 lat=37.9717>Acropolis</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> except once a year, for a necessary sacrifice — to avoid the danger of having the olive tree, which is said to have originated there, touched by a she-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>. Cattle are not properly included in a discussion on agriculture, said I, except those which enhance the cultivation of the land by their labour, such as those which can plough under the yoke. 21 If that is so, replied Agrasius, how can <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> be kept off the land, when manure, which enhances its value very greatly, is supplied by the herds? By that method of reasoning, retorted <a href=/people/2084 target=_blank>Agrius</a>, we may assert that slave-trading is a branch of agriculture, if we decide to keep a gang for that purpose. The error lies in the assumption that, because <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> can be kept on the land and be a source of profit there, they are part of agriculture. It does not follow; for by that reasoning we should have to embrace other things quite foreign to agriculture; as, for instance, you might keep on your farm a number of spinners, weavers, and other artisans. <br />Very well, said <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a>, let us exclude grazing from agriculture, and whatever else anyone wishes. 22 Am I, then, said I, to follow the writings of the elder and the younger <a href=/people/10228 target=_blank>Saserna</a>, and consider that how to manage clay-pits is more related to agriculture than mining for silver or other mining such as undoubtedly is carried out on some land? 23 But as quarries for stone or sand-pits are not related to agriculture, so too clay-pits. This is not to say that they are not to be worked on land where it is suitable and profitable; as further, for instance, if the farm lies along a road and the site is convenient for travellers, a tavern might be built; however profitable it might be, still it would form no part of agriculture.b For it does not follow that whatever profit the owner makes on account of the land, or even on the land, should be credited to the account of agriculture, but only that which, as the result of sowing, is born of the earth for our enjoyment. 24 You are jealous of that great writer, interrupted <a href=/people/4697 target=_blank>Stolo</a>, and you attack his potteries carpingly, while passing over the excellent observations he makes bearing very closely on agriculture, so as not to praise them. 25 This brought a smile from <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a>, who knew the books and despised them; and Agrasius, thinking that he alone knew them, asked <a href=/people/4697 target=_blank>Stolo</a> to give a quotation. This is his recipe for killing bugs, he said: 'Soak a wild cucumber in water, and wherever you sprinkle the water the bugs will not come.' And again, 'Grease your bed with <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> gall, mixed with vinegar.' 26 And still it is good advice, said <a href=/people/3843 target=_blank>Fundanius</a>, glancing at <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a>, even if he did write it in a book on agriculture. Just as good, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, he replied, as this one for the making of a depilatory: 'Throw a yellow <a href=/people/10983 target=_blank>frog</a> into water, boil it down to one-third, and rub the body with it.' It would be better for you to quote from that book, said I, a passage which bears more closely on the trouble from which <a href=/people/3843 target=_blank>Fundanius</a> suffers; for his feet are always hurting him and bringing wrinkles to his brow. 27 Tell me, pray, exclaimed <a href=/people/3843 target=_blank>Fundanius</a>; I would rather hear about my feet than how beet-roots ought to be planted.24 I will tell you, said <a href=/people/4697 target=_blank>Stolo</a>, with a smile, in the very words in which he wrote it (at least I have heard Tarquenna say that when a man's feet begin to hurt he may be cured if he will think of you): 'I am thinking of you, cure my feet. The pain go in the ground, and may my feet be sound.'25 He bids you chant this thrice nine times, touch the ground, spit on it, and be fasting while you chant. 28 You will find many other marvels in the books of the Sasernas, said I, which are all just as far away from agriculture and therefore to be disregarded. Just as if, said he, such things are not found in other writers also. Why, are there not many such items in the book of the renowned <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, which he published on the subject of agriculture, such as his recipes for placenta, for libum, and for the salting of hams?26 You do not mention that famous one of his composing, said <a href=/people/2084 target=_blank>Agrius</a>: 'If you wish to drink deep at a feast and to have a good appetite, eat some half-dozen leaves of raw cabbage with vinegar before dinner.' </p>                        </div>

You should have some knowledge of these before you cast your seed, which is the first step in all production. Equipped with this knowledge, the farmer should aim at two goals, profit and pleasure; the object of the first is material return, and of the second enjoyment. The profitable plays a more important rôle than the pleasurable; 2 and yet for the most part the methods of cultivation which improve the aspect of the land, such as the planting of fruit and olive trees in rows, make it not only more profitable but also more saleable, and add to the value of the estate. For any man would rather pay more for a piece of land which is attractive than for one of the same value which, though profitable, is unsightly. 3 Further, land which is more wholesome is more valuable, because on it the profit is certain; while, on the other hand, on land that is unwholesome, however rich it may be, misfortune does not permit the farmer to reap a profit. For where the reckoning is with death, not only is the profit uncertain, but also the life of the farmers; so that, lacking wholesomeness, agriculture becomes nothing else than a game of chance, in which the life and the property of the owner are at stake. 4 And yet this risk can be lessened by science; for, granting that healthfulness, being a product of climate and soil, is not in our power but in that of nature, still it depends greatly on us, because we can, by care, lessen the evil effects. For if the farm is unwholesome on account of the nature of the land or the water, from the miasma which is exhaled in some spots; or if, on account of the climate, the land is too hot or the wind is not salubrious, these faults can be alleviated by the science and the outlay of the owner. The situation of the buildings, their size, the exposure of the galleries, the doors, and the windows, are matters of the highest importance. 5 Did not that famous physician, <a href=/people/197 target=_blank>Hippocrates</a>, during a great pestilence save not one farm but many cities by his skill? But why do I cite him?

The chief divisions of agriculture are four in number, resumed <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a>: First, a knowledge of the farm, comprising the nature of the soil and its constituents; second, the equipment needed for the operation of the farm in question; third, the operations to be carried out on the place in the way of tilling; and fourth, the proper season for each of these operations. 4 Each of these four general divisions is divided into at least two subdivisions the first comprises questions with regard to the soil as such, and those which pertain to housing and stabling. The second division, comprising the movable equipment which is needed for the cultivation of the farm, is also subdivided into two: the persons who are to do the farming, and the other equipment. The third, which covers operations, is subdivided: the plans to be made for each operation, and where each is to be carried on. The fourth, covering the seasons, is subdivided: those which are determined by the annual revolution of the sun, and those determined by the monthly revolution of the moon. I shall discuss first the four chief divisions, and then the eight subdivisions in more detail. </p>                        </div>

As there are two kinds of conformation, the natural and that which is added by cultivation, in the former case one piece of land being naturally good, another naturally bad, and in the latter case one being well tilled, another badly, I shall discuss first the natural conformation. 2 There are, then, with respect to the topography, three simple types of land — plain, hill, and mountain; though there is a fourth type consisting of a combination of these, as, for instance, on a farm which may contain two or three of those named, as may be seen in many places. Of these three simple types, undoubtedly a different system is applicable to the lowlands than to the mountains, because the former are hotter than the latter; and the same is true of hillsides, because they are more temperate than either the plains or the mountains. 3 These qualities are more apparent in broad stretches, when they are uniform; thus the heat is greater where there are broad plains, and hence in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=place long=16.3 lat=41>Apulia</a> the climate is hotter and more humid, while in mountain regions, as on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408144LVes class=place long=14.425 lat=40.8216>Vesuvius</a>, the air is lighter and therefore more wholesome. Those who live in the lowlands suffer more in summer; those who live in the uplands suffer more in winter; the same crops are planted earlier in the spring in the lowlands than in the uplands, and are harvested earlier, while both sowing and reaping come later in the uplands. 4 Certain trees, such as the fir and the pine, flourish best and are sturdiest in the mountains on account of the cold climate, while the poplar and the willow thrive here where the climate is warmer; the arbute and the oak do better in the upland, the almond and the mariscan fig in the lowlands. On the foothills the growth is nearer akin to that of the plains than to that of the mountains; on the higher hills the opposite is true. 5 Owing to these three types of configuration different crops are planted, grain being considered best adapted to the plains, vines to the hills, and forests to the mountains. Usually the winter is better for those who live in the plains, because at that season the pastures are fresh, and pruning can be carried on in more comfort. On the other hand, the summer is better in the mountains, because there is abundant forage at that time, whereas it is dry in the plains, and the cultivation of the trees is more convenient because of the cooler air. 6 A lowland farm that everywhere slopes regularly in one direction is better than one that is perfectly level, because the latter, having no outlet for the water, tends to become marshy. Even more unfavourable is one that is irregular, because pools are liable to form in the depressions. These points and the like have their differing importance for the cultivation of the three types of configuration. </p>                        </div>

Thus our ancestors, on the same amount of land but not so well laid out, made less wine and grain than we do, and of a poorer quality; for plants which are placed exactly where each should be take up less ground and screen each other less from the sun, the moon, and the air. 3 You may prove this by one of several experiments; for instance, a quantity of nuts which you can hold in a modius measure with their shells whole, because the shells naturally keep them compacted, you can scarcely pack into a modius and a half when they are cracked. 4 As to the second point, trees which are planted in a row are warmed by the sun and the moon equally on all sides, with the result that more grapes and olives form, and that they ripen earlier; which double result has the double consequence that they yield more must and oil, and of greater value. </p>                        </div>

It is in respect of this chiefly that a farm is considered good or bad; for it determines what crops, and of what variety, can be planted and raised on it, as not all crops can be raised with equal success on the same land. As one type is suited to the vine and another to grain, so of others — one is suited to one crop, another to another. 6 Thus near Cortynia, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>, there is said to be a plane tree which does not shed its leaves in winter, and another in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, according to <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>. Likewise at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397165PSyb class=place long=16.491 lat=39.714>Sybaris</a>, which is now called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397164PTho class=place long=16.49 lat=39.716>Thurii</a>, there is said to be an oak tree of like character, in sight of the town; and that near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/241329UEle class=place long=32.886 lat=24.0848>Elephantine</a> neither the fig nor the vine sheds its leaves — which is quite the opposite of what happens with us. For the same reason there are many trees which bear two crops a year, such as the vine on the coast near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a>, and the apple in the district of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393163UCon class=place long=16.2608 lat=39.2886>Consentia</a>. 7 The fact that trees produce more fruit in uncultivated spots, and better fruit under cultivation, proves the same thing. For the same reason there are plants which cannot live except in marshy ground, or actually in the water and not in every kind of water. Some grow in ponds, as the reeds near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424129URea class=place long=12.8589 lat=42.402>Reate</a>, others in streams, as the alder trees in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>, and still others in the sea, as the palms and squills of which <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> writes. 8 When I was in command of the army in the interior of Transalpine Gaul near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>, I visited a number of spots where neither vines nor olives nor fruit trees grew; where they fertilized the land with a white chalk which they dug; where they had no salt, either mineral or marine, but instead of it used salty coals obtained by burning certain kinds of wood. 9 <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, you know, interjected <a href=/people/4697 target=_blank>Stolo</a>, in arranging plots according to the degree of existence, formed nine categories: first, land on which vines can bear a large quantity of wine of good quality; second, land suited for a watered garden; third, for an osier bed; fourth, for olives; fifth, for meadows; sixth, for a grain field; seventh, for a wood lot: eighth, for an orchard; ninth, for a mast grove. 10 I know he wrote that, replied <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a>, but all authorities do not agree with him on this point. There are some who assign the first place to good meadows, and I am one of them. Hence our ancestors gave the name prata to meadow-land as being ready (parata). <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a> Vopiscus, once an aedile, in pleading a case before the censors, spoke of the plains of Rosea as the nursing-ground of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, such that if a rod were left there overnight, it would be lost the next morning on account of the growth of the grass. </p>                        </div>

In my opinion, it depends on the kind of vineyard, for there are several: for some are low-growing and without props, as in Spain; others tall, which are called 'yoked,' as generally in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. For this latter class there are two names, pedamenta and iuga: those on which the vine runs vertically are called pedamenta (stakes), and those on which it runs transversely are called iuga (yokes); and from this comes the name 'yoked vines.' 2 Four kinds of 'yokes' are usually employed, made respectively of poles, of reeds, of cords, and of vines: the first of these, for example, around Falernum, the second around <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415156UArg class=place long=15.611 lat=41.553>Arpi</a>, the third around <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, the fourth around <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Mediolanum</a>. There are two forms of this trellising: in straight lines, as in the district of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412161UCan class=place long=16.0651 lat=41.2205>Canusium</a>, or yoked lengthways and sideways in the form of the compluvium, as is the practice generally in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. If the material grows on the place the vineyard does not mind the expense; and it is not burdensome if much of it can be obtained in the neighbourhood. 3 The first class I have named requires chiefly a willow thicket, the second a reed thicket, the third a rush bed or some material of the kind. For the fourth you must have an arbustum, where trellises can be made of the vines, as the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Mediolanum</a> do on the trees which they call opuli (maples), and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412161UCan class=ethnic long=16.0651 lat=41.2205>Canusians</a> on lattice-work in fig trees. 4 Likewise, there are, as a rule, four types of props. The best for common use in the vineyard is a stout post, called ridica, made of oak or juniper. The second best is a stake made from a branch, and preferably from a tough one, so that it will last longer; when one end has rotted in the ground the stake is reversed, what had been the top becoming the bottom. The third, which is used only as a substitute when the others are lacking, is formed of reeds; bundles of these, tied together with bark, are planted in what they call cuspides, earthenware pipes with open bottoms so that the casual water can run out. The fourth is the natural prop, where the vineyard is formed of vines growing across from tree to tree; such traverses are called by some rumpi. 5 The limit to the height of the vineyard is the height of a man, and the intervals between the props should be sufficient to allow a yoke of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> to plough between. The most economical type of vineyard is that which furnishes wine to beaker without the aid of trellises. There are two kinds of these: one in which the ground serves as a bed for the grapes, as in many parts of <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>. The <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>foxes</a> often share the harvest with man in such vineyards, and if the land breeds <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mice</a> the yield is cut short unless you fill the whole vineyard with traps, as they do in the island <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408134IPan class=place long=13.4332 lat=40.7965>Pandateria</a>. 6 In the other type only those branches are raised from the ground which give promise of producing fruit. These are propped on forked sticks about two feet long, at the time when the grapes form, so that they may not wait until the harvest is over to learn to hang in a bunch by means of a string or the fastening which our fathers called a cestus. In such a vineyard, as soon as the master sees the back of the vintager he takes his forks back to hibernate under cover so that he may be able to enjoy their assistance without cost the next year. In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424129URea class=place long=12.8589 lat=42.402>Reate</a> practise this custom. 7 This variation in culture is caused chiefly by the fact that the nature of the soil makes a great difference; where this is naturally humid the vine must be trained higher, because while the wine is forming and ripening it does not need water, as it does in the cup, but sun. And that is the chief reason, I think, that the vines climb up trees. </p>                        </div>

The word terra is used in three senses, the general, the specific, and the mixed. It is used in the general sense when we speak of the orbis terrae, or of the terra of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> or any other country; for in that designation are included rock, and sand, and other such things. The word is used specifically in the second sense when it is employed without the addition of a qualifying word or epithet. 2 It is used in the third or mixed sense, of the element in which seed can be planted and germinate — such as clay soil, rocky soil, etc. In this last sense of the word there are as many varieties of earth as when it is used in the general sense, on account of the different combinations of substances. For there are many substances in the soil, varying in consistency and strength, such as rock, marble, rubble, sand, loam, clay, red ochre, dust, chalk, ash, carbuncle (that is, when the ground becomes so hot from the sun that it chars the roots of plants); 3 and soil, using the word in its specific sense, is called chalky or . . . according as one of these elements predominates — and so of other types of soil. The classes of these vary in such a way that there are, besides other subdivisions, at least three for each type: rocky soil, for instance, may be very rocky, or moderately rocky, or almost free of rocks, and in the case of other varieties of mixed soil the same three grades are distinguished. 4 And further, each of these three grades contains three grades: one may be very wet, one very dry, one intermediate. And these distinctions are not without the greatest importance for the crops; thus the intelligent farmer plants spelt rather than wheat on wet land, and on the other hand barley rather than spelt on dry land, while he plants either on the intermediate. 5 Furthermore, even finer distinctions are made in all these classes, as, for instance, in loamy soil it makes a difference whether the loam be white or red, as the whitish loam is not suited to nurseries, while the reddish is well adapted. Thus there are three chief distinctions in soil, according as it is poor, rich, or medium; the rich being able to produce many kinds of vegetation, and the poor quite the opposite. In thin soil, as, for instance, in <a href=/people/8225 target=_blank>Pupinia</a>, you see no sturdy trees, nor vigorous vines, nor stout straw, nor mariscan figs, and most of the trees are covered with moss, as are the parched meadows. 6 On the other hand, in rich soil, like that in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Etruria</a>, you can see rich crops, land that can be worked steadily, sturdy trees, and no moss anywhere. In the case of medium soil, however, such as that near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a>, the nearer it comes to not being thin than to being sterile, the more it is suited to all kinds of growth than if it inclined to the poorer type. 7 <a href=/people/1154 target=_blank>Diophanes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=person long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a> makes a good point, remarked <a href=/people/4697 target=_blank>Stolo</a>, when he writes that you can judge whether land is fit for cultivation or not, either from the soil itself or from the vegetation growing on it: from the soil according as it is white or black, light and crumbling easily when it is dug, of a consistency not ashy and not excessively heavy; from the wild vegetation growing on it if it is luxuriant and bearing abundantly its natural products.

A steading facing the east has the best situation, as it has the shade in summer and the sun in winter. If you are forced to build on the bank of a river, be careful not to let the steading face the river, as it will be extremely cold in winter, and unwholesome in summer. 2 Precautions must also be taken in the neighbourhood of swamps, both for the reasons given, and because there are bred certain minute creatures which cannot be seen by the eyes, which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and there cause serious diseases. What can I do, asked <a href=/people/3843 target=_blank>Fundanius</a>, to prevent disease if I should inherit a farm of that kind? Even I can answer that question, replied <a href=/people/2084 target=_blank>Agrius</a>; sell it for the highest cash price; or if you can't sell it, abandon it. 3 <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a>, however, replied: See that the steading does not face in the direction from which the infected wind usually comes, and do not build in a hollow, but rather on elevated ground, as a well-ventilated place is more easily cleared if anything obnoxious is brought in. Furthermore, being exposed to the sun during the whole day, it is more wholesome, as any animalculae which are bred near by and brought in are either blown away or quickly die from the lack of humidity. 4 Sudden rains and swollen streams are dangerous to those who have their buildings in low-lying depressions, as are also the sudden raids of robber bands, who can more easily take advantage of those who are off their guard. Against both these dangers the more elevated situations are safer. </p>                        </div>

Such liquid products as wine and oil should be set away in store-rooms on level ground, and jars for oil and wine should be provided; while dry products, such as beans and hay, should be stored in a floored space. A place should be provided for the hands to stay in when they are tired from work or from cold or heat, where they can recover in comfort. 2 The overseer's room should be next to the entrance, where he can know who comes in or goes out at night and what he takes; and especially if there is no porter. Especially should care be taken that the kitchen be conveniently placed, because there in winter there is a great deal going on before daylight, in the preparation and eating of food. Sheds of sufficient size should also be provided in the barnyard for the carts and all other implements which are injured by rain; for if these are kept in an enclosure inside the walls, but in the open, they will not have to fear thieves, yet they will be exposed to injurious weather. 3 On a large farm it is better to have two farm-yards: one, containing an outdoor reservoir — a pond with running water, which, surrounded by columns, if you like, will form a sort of fish-pond; for here the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> will drink, and here they will bathe themselves when brought in from ploughing in the summer, not to mention the geese and hogs and <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> when they come from pasture; and in the outer yard there should be a pond for the soaking of lupines and other products which are rendered more fit for use by being immersed in water. 4 As the outer yard is often covered with chaff and straw trampled by the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, it becomes the handmaid of the farm because of what is cleaned off it. Hard by the steading there should be two manure pits, or one pit divided into two parts; into one part should be cast the fresh manure and from the other the rotted manure should be hauled into the field; for manure is not so good when it is put in fresh as when it is well rotted. The best type of manure pit is that in which the top and sides are protected from the sun by branches and leaves; for the sun ought not to dry out the essence which the land needs. It is for this reason that experienced farmers arrange it, when possible, so that water will collect there, for in this way the strength is best retained; and some people place the privies for the servants on it. </p>                        </div>

This shed, which is sometimes called a nubilarium, should be built hard by the floor on which you are to thresh the grain; it should be of a size proportioned to that of the farm, and open only on one side, that next to the threshing floor, so that you can easily throw out the grain for threshing, and quickly throw it back again, if it begins to 'get cloudy.' You should have windows on the side from which it can be ventilated most easily. 6 A farm is undoubtedly more profitable, so far as the buildings are concerned, said <a href=/people/3843 target=_blank>Fundanius</a>, if you construct them more according to the thrift of the ancients than the luxury of the moderns; for the former built to suit the size of their crops, while the latter build to suit their unbridled luxury. Hence their farms cost more than their dwelling-houses, while now the opposite is usually the case. In those days a steading was praised if it had a good kitchen, roomy stables, and cellars for wine and oil in proportion to the size of the farm, with a floor sloping to a reservoir, because often, after the new wine is laid by, not only the butts which they use in Spain but also the jars which are used in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> are burst by the fermentation of the must. 7 In like manner they took care that the steading should have everything else that was required for agriculture; while in these times, on the other hand, the effort is to have as large and handsome a dwelling-house as possible; and they vie with the 'farm houses' of <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> and <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, which they have built to the great damage of the state. What men of our day aim at is to have their summer dining-rooms face the cool east and their winter dining-rooms face the west, rather than, as the ancients did, to see on what side the wine and oil cellars have their windows; for in a cellar wine requires cooler air on the jars, while oil requires warmer. Likewise you should see that, if there be a hill, the house, unless something prevents, should be placed there by preference. </p>                        </div>

There are four types of such defences: the natural, the rustic, the military, and the masonry type; and each of these types has several varieties. The first type, the natural, is a hedge, usually planted with brush or thorn, having roots and being alive, and so with nothing to fear from the flaming torch of a mischievous passer-by. 2 The second type, the rustic, is made of wood, but is not alive. It is built either of stakes planted close and intertwined with brush; or of thick posts with holes bored through, having rails, usually two or three to the panel, thrust into the openings; or of trimmed trees placed end to end, with the branches driven into the ground. The third, or military type, is a trench and bank of earth; but the trench is adequate only if it can hold all the rain water, or has a slope sufficient to enable it to drain the water off the land. 3 The bank is serviceable which is close to the ditch on the inside, or so steep that it is not easy to climb. This type of enclosure is usually built along public roads and along streams. At several points along the Via <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPSa class=place long=12.4985 lat=41.9107>Salaria</a>, in the district of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420126UCru class=place long=12.5482 lat=42.0127>Crustumeria</a>, one may see banks combined with trenches to prevent the river from injuring the fields. Banks built without trenches, such as occur in the district of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424129URea class=place long=12.8589 lat=42.402>Reate</a>, are sometimes called walls. 4 The fourth and last type of fence, that of masonry, is a wall, and there are usually four varieties: that which is built of stone, such as occurs in the district of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>; that of burned brick, such as occurs in the Ager Gallicus; that of sun-dried brick, such as occurs in the Sabine country; and that formed of earth and gravel in mounds, such as occurs in Spain and the district of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>. </p>                        </div>

These considerations are the same in number: whether the neighbourhood is unsafe; whether it is such that it is not profitable to transport our products to it, or to bring back from it what we need; third, whether roads or streams for transportation are either wanting or inadequate; and fourth, whether conditions on the neighbouring farms are such as to benefit or injure our land. 2 Taking up the first of the four: the safety or lack of safety of the neighbourhood is important; for there are many excellent farms which it is not advisable to cultivate because of the brigandage in the neighbourhood, as in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a> certain farms near . . . . , and in Spain on the borders of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-83RLus class=place long=-8.3 lat=39>Lusitania</a>. Farms which have near by suitable means of transporting their products to market and convenient means of transporting thence those things needed on the farm, are for that reason profitable. For many have among their holdings some into which grain or wine or the like which they lack must be brought, and on the other hand not a few have those from which a surplus must be sent away. 3 And so it is profitable near a city to have gardens on a large scale; for instance, of violets and roses and many other products for which there is a demand in the city; while it would not be profitable to raise the same products on a distant farm where there is no market to which its products can be carried. Again, if there are towns or villages in the neighbourhood, or even well-furnished lands and farmsteads of rich owners, from which you can purchase at a reasonable price what you need for the farm, and to which you can sell your surplus, such as props, or poles, or reeds, the farm will be more profitable than if they must be fetched from a distance; sometimes, in fact, more so than if you can supply them yourself by raising them on your own place. 4 For this reason farmers in such circumstances prefer to have in their neighbourhood men whose services they can call upon under a yearly contract — physicians, fullers, and other artisans — rather than to have such men of their own on the farm; for sometimes the death of one artisan wipes out the profit of a farm. This department of a great estate rich owners are wont to entrust to their own people; for if towns or villages are too far away from the estate, they supply themselves with smiths and other necessary artisans to keep on the place, so that their farm hands may not leave their work and lounge around holiday-making on working days, rather than make the farm more profitable by attending to their duties. </p>                        </div>

The rule should rather be stated thus: that no one shall leave the farm without the direction of the overseer, nor the overseer without the direction of the master, on an errand which will prevent his return this day, and that no oftener than is necessary for the farm business. 6 A farm is rendered more profitable by convenience of transportation: if there are roads on which carts can easily be driven, or navigable rivers near by. We know that transportation to and from many farms is carried on by both these methods. The manner in which your neighbour keeps the land on the boundary planted is also of importance to your profits. For instance, if he has an oak grove near the boundary, you cannot well plant olives along such a forest; for it is so hostile in its nature that your trees will not only be less productive, but will actually bend so far away as to lean inward toward the ground, as the vine is wont to do when planted near the cabbage. As the oak, so large numbers of large walnut trees close by render the border of the farm sterile. </p>                        </div>

Some divide these into two parts: men, and those aids to men without which they cannot cultivate; others into three: the class of instruments which is articulate, the inarticulate, and the mute; the articulate comprising the slaves, the inarticulate comprising the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, and the mute comprising the vehicles. 2 All agriculture is carried on by men — slaves, or freemen, or both; by freemen, when they till the ground themselves, as many poor people do with the help of their families; or hired hands, when the heavier farm operations, such as the vintage and the haying, are carried on by the hiring of freemen; and those whom our people called obaerarii and of whom there are still many in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>. 3 With regard to these in general this is my opinion: it is more profitable to work unwholesome lands with hired hands than with slaves; and even in wholesome places it is more profitable thus to carry out the heavier farm operations, such as storing the products of the vintage or harvest. As to the character of such hands <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> gives this advice: that such hands should be selected as can bear heavy work, are not less than twenty-two years old, and show some aptitude for farm labour. You may judge of this by the way they carry out their other orders, and, in the case of new hands, by asking one of them what they were in the habit of doing for their former master. <br />Slaves should be neither cowed nor high-spirited. 4 They ought to have men over them who know how to read and write and have some little education, who are dependable and older than the hands whom I have mentioned; for they will be more respectful to these than to men who are younger. Furthermore, it is especially important that the foremen be men who are experienced in farm operations; for the foreman must not only give orders but also take part in the work, so that his subordinates may follow his example, and also understand that there is good reason for his being over them — the fact that he is superior to them in knowledge. </p>                        </div>

Avoid having too many slaves of the same nation, for this is a fertile source of domestic quarrels. The foremen are to be made more zealous by rewards, and care must be taken that they have a bit of property of their own, and mates from among their fellow-slaves to bear them children; for by this means they are made more steady and more attached to the place. Thus, it is on account of such relationships that slave families of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> have the best reputation and bring the highest prices. 6 The good will of the foremen should be won by treating them with some degree of consideration; and those of the hands who excel the others should also be consulted as to the work to be done. When this is done they are less inclined to think that they are looked down upon, and rather think that they are held in some esteem by the master. 7 They are made to take more interest in their work by being treated more liberally in respect either of food, or of more clothing, or of exemption from work, or of permission to graze some <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> of their own on the farm, or other things of this kind; so that, if some unusually heavy task is imposed, or punishment inflicted on them in some way, their loyalty and kindly feeling to the master may be restored by the consolation derived from such measures. </p>                        </div>

Writing of oliveyards and vineyards, he gives two formulas. The first is one in which he shows how an oliveyard of 240 iugera should be equipped; on a place of this size he says that the following thirteen slaves should be kept: an overseer, a housekeeper, five labourers, three teamsters, one muleteer, one swineherd, one shepherd. The second he gives for a vineyard of 100 iugera, on which he says should be kept the following fifteen slaves: an overseer, a housekeeper, ten labourers, a teamster, a muleteer, a swineherd. 2 <a href=/people/10228 target=_blank>Saserna</a> states that one man is enough for eight iugera, and that he ought to dig over that amount in forty-five days, although he can dig over a single iugerum with four days' work; but he says that he allows thirteen days extra for such things as illness, bad weather, idleness, and laxness. 3 Neither of these writers has left us a very clearly expressed rule. For if <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> wished to do this, he should have stated it in such a way that we add or subtract from the number proportionately as the farm is larger or smaller. Further, he should have named the overseer and the housekeeper outside of the number of slaves; for if you cultivate less than 240 iugera of olives you cannot get along with less than one overseer, nor if you cultivate twice as large a place or more will you have to keep two or three overseers. 4 It is only the labourers and teamsters that are to be added proportionately to larger bodies of land; and even then only if the land is uniform. But if it is so varied that it cannot all be ploughed, as, for instance, if it is very broken or very steep, fewer <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> and teamsters will be needed. I pass over the fact that the 240 iugera instanced is a plot which is neither a unit nor standard (the standard unit is the century, containing 200 iugera); </p>                        </div>

As to his saying that on 100 iugera of vineyard you should have fifteen slaves; if one has a century, half vineyard and half oliveyard, it will follow that he should have two overseers and two housekeepers, which is absurd. 6 Wherefore the proper number and variety of slaves must be determined by another method, and <a href=/people/10228 target=_blank>Saserna</a> is more to be approved in this matter; he says that each iugerum is enough to furnish four days' work for one hand.

Therefore you will most accurately determine the number of slaves and other equipment which you should provide 7 if you observe three things carefully: the character of the farms in the neighbourhood and their size; the number of hands employed on each; and how many hands should be added or subtracted in order to keep your cultivation better or worse. For nature has given us two routes to agriculture, experiment and imitation. The most ancient farmers determined many of the practices by experiment, their descendants for the most part by imitation. 8 We ought to do both — imitate others and attempt by experiment to do some things in a different way, following not chance but some system: as, for instance, if we plough a second time, more or less deeply than others, to see what effect this will have. This was the method they followed in weeding a second and third time, and those who put off the grafting of figs from spring-time to summer. </p>                        </div>

Hence, if <a href=/people/10228 target=_blank>Saserna</a> is right, one yoke is needed for every 100 iugera; if <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> is right, one of every 80. My own opinion is that neither of these standards will fit every piece of land, and that each will fit some particular piece. One piece, for instance, may be easier or harder to work than another, 2 and there are places which <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> cannot break unless they are unusually powerful, and frequently they leave the plough in the field with broken beam. Wherefore on each farm, so long as we are unacquainted with it, we should follow a threefold guide: the practice of the former owner, the practice of neighbouring owners, and a degree of experimentation. 3 As to his addition of three <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>donkeys</a> to haul manure and one for the mill (for a vineyard of 100 iugera, a yoke of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, a pair of <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>donkeys</a>, and one for the mill); under this head of inarticulate equipment it is to be added that of other animals only those that are to be kept which are of service in agriculture, and the few which are usually allowed as the private property of the slaves for their more comfortable support and to make them more diligent in their work. Of such animals, not only owners who have meadows prefer to keep <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> rather than <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a> because of their manure, but also those who keep animals for other reasons than the benefit of the meadows.

You should purchase them unbroken, not less than three years old and not more than four; they should be powerful and equally matched, so that the stronger will not exhaust the weaker when they work together; they should have large horns, black for choice, a broad face, flat nose, deep chest, and heavy quarters. 2 <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>Oxen</a> that have reached maturity on level ground should not be bought for rough and mountainous country; moreover, if the opposite happens to be the case, it should be avoided. When you have bought young steers, if you will fasten forked sticks loosely around their necks and give them food, within a few days they will grow gentle and fit for breaking to the plough. This breaking should consist in letting them grow accustomed to the work gradually, in yoking the raw <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> to a broken one (for the training by imitation is easier), and in driving them first on level ground without a plough, then with a light one, and at first in sandy or rather light soil. 3 Draught <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> should be trained in a similar way, first drawing an empty cart, and if possible through a village or town. The constant noise and the variety of objects, by frequent repetition, accustom them to their work. The <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> which you have put on the right should not remain continuously on that side, because if he is changed in turn to the left, he finds rest by working on alternate sides. 4 In light soils, as in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>, the ploughing is done, not with heavy steers, but with <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> or <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>donkeys</a>; and hence they can more easily be adapted to a light plough or a mill, and to doing the ordinary hauling of the farm. For this purpose some employ <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>donkeys</a>, others <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> or mules, according to the fodder available; for a <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>donkey</a> requires less feed than a <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>, but the latter is more profitable. 5 In this matter the farmer must keep in mind the conformation of his land; in broken and heavy land stronger animals must be got, and preferably those which, while doing the same amount of work, can themselves return some profit. </p>                        </div>

The several kinds of such equipment and their number are determined by the size of the place, more being needed if the farm is extensive. 3 Accordingly, said <a href=/people/4697 target=_blank>Stolo</a>, under this head <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, fixing a definite size for his farm, writes that one who had under cultivation 240 iugera of olive land should equip it by assembling five complete sets of oil-pressing equipment; and he itemizes such equipment, as, copper kettles, pots, a pitcher with three spouts, and so forth; then implements made of wood and iron, as three large carts, six ploughs and ploughshares, four manure hampers, and so forth; then the kind and number of iron tools needed, as eight forks, as many hoes, half as many shovels, and so forth. 4 He likewise gives a second schedule for a vineyard, in which he writes that if it be one of 100 iugera it should have three complete pressing equipments, vats and covers to hold 800 cullei, twenty grape hampers, twenty grain hampers, and other like implements. Other authorities, it is true, give smaller numbers, but I imagine he fixed the number of cullei so high in order that the farmer might not be forced to sell his wine every year; for old wine brings a better price than new, and the same wine a better price at one time than at another. </p>                        </div>

Since I hold, continued <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a>, that the profit of the farm is that which arises from it as the result of planting for a useful purpose, two items are to be considered: what it is most expedient to plant and in what place. For some spots are suited to hay, some to grain, others to vines, others to olive, and so of forage crops, including clover, mixed forage, vetch, alfalfa, snail clover, and lupines. 2 It is not good practice to plant every kind of crop on rich soil, nor to plant nothing on poor soil; for it is better to plant in thinner soil those crops which do not need much nutriment, such as clover and the legumes, except the chick pea, which is also a legume, as are all those plants which are pulled from the ground and not mowed, and are called legumes from the fact that they are 'gathered' (leguntur) in this way. In rich soil it is better to plant those requiring more food, as cabbage, wheat, winter wheat, and flax. 3 Some crops are also to be planted not so much for the immediate return as with a view to the year later, as when cut down and left on the ground they enrich it. Thus, it is customary to plough under lupines as they begin to pod — and sometimes field beans before the pods have formed so far that it is profitable to harvest the beans — in place of dung, if the soil is rather thin. 4 And also in planting selection should be made of those things which are profitable for the pleasure they afford, such as those plots which are called orchards and flower gardens, and also of those which do not contribute either to the sustenance of man or to the pleasure of his senses, but are not without value to the farm.

Some places are suitable at the same time for the planting of other crops; thus in young orchards, when the seedlings have been planted and the young trees have been set in rows, during the early years before the roots have spread very far, some plant garden crops, and others plant other crops; but they do not do this after the trees have gained strength, for fear of injuring the roots. </p>                        </div>

If you plant it in rich or warm soil the yield will be worthless, the tree will exhaust itself in bearing, and a reddish scale will injure it.' 3 A hostus is what they call the yield of oil from one factus; and a factus ('making') is the amount they make up at one time.

The word seges is used of ploughed land which has been sowed, arvum of ploughed land not yet sowed, novalis of land where there has been a crop before it is renewed (novatur) by a second ploughing. 2 When they plough the first time they say they are 'breaking up,' the second time that they are 'breaking down,' because at the first ploughing large clods are usually turned up, and when the ploughing is repeated they call it 'breaking down.' When they plough the third time, after the seed has been broadcast, the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> are said to 'ridge'; that is, with mould boards attached to the ploughshare they both cover the broadcast seed in ridges, and at the same time cut ditches to let the rain-water drain off.

The space between two furrows, the raised dirt, is called porca, because that part of the field presents (porricit) the grain; so they also used to employ the word porricere when they offered the entrails to the gods. </p>                        </div>

This is called occare because they crush (occidunt) the ground. The vines should be thinned (for that is better than pruning), but by an expert, and this should be done not in the orchard but in the vineyard. 2 Thinning consists in leaving the first and second, sometimes even the third of the strongest shoots with spring from the stock and picking off the rest, lest the stock be not strong enough to furnish sap to the shoots if all are left. For that reason, in the vine-nursery when the vine first comes out, it is the practice for the whole to be cut back, so that it may come from the ground with a sturdier stock and have greater strength in sending out shoots. 3 For a slender stock, on account of weakness, is sterile and cannot put out the vine, which, when it is smaller, they call flagellum, while the larger from which the grapes spring they call palma. The first word by the change of one letter is derived from flatus, the blowing of the wind, so that they call it flagellum instead of flabellum. The second word seems at first to have been called parilema, from parere, to bear, because the shoot is sent out to bear grapes; 4 thence, by change of letters, as in many words, it got to be called palma. On the other side, it bears a tendril; this is a vine twig twisted like a curl. It is by means of these tendrils that the vine holds the support on which it creeps to grasp a place, from which grasping (capere) it is called capreolus. All fodder crops should be cut, first clover, mixed fodder, and vetch, and last hay. Ocinum is derived, as is the garden clover (ocimum), from the Greek word ὠκέως, which means 'quickly.' It is called ocinum for the further reason that it moves (citat) the bowels of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, and is fed to them on that account, as a purgative.

It is with this that <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and other animals are purged and fattened in the spring. Vetch is so called from vincire, to bind, because it also has tendrils as the vine has, with which, when it creeps up to cling to the stalk of the lupine or some other plant, it usually binds (vincit) it.

This should be broadcast on the land like seed, and not placed in piles like <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> dung. 2 My own opinion is that the best dung is from aviaries of thrushes and blackbirds, as it is not only good for the land, but is excellent food both for <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>, to fatten them. Hence those who lease aviaries with the owner's stipulation that the dung shall remain on the place pay less rent than those who have the use of it. <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> states that next to pigeon dung human excrement is the best, and in the third place <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>, <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, and <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> dung; 3 that <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> dung is least valuable, but good on grain land; for on meadows it is the most valuable of all, as is that of all draught animals which feed on barley, because it produces a quantity of grass.

For in a field it is important to note the exposure of every section, and also the season at which each plant grows best. Do we not observe that some blossom in spring, some in summer, and that the autumn growth is not the same as the winter? 2 Thus some plants are sown and grafted and harvested earlier or later than others; and while most are grafted in spring rather than in autumn, figs are grafted near the solstice, and cherries actually in mid-winter. 3 Now as seeds are, in general, of four kinds — those furnished by nature, those which are transplanted from one piece of ground to another as rooted slips, cuttings from trees planted in the ground, and grafts from tree to tree — you should observe what separate operation should be carried out at each season and in each locality. </p>                        </div>

There are invisible seed, if, as the naturalist <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a> holds, they are in the air, and if the water which flows on the land carries them, as <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> writes. The seed which can be seen should be carefully watched by the farmer; for some seed, such as that of the cypress, though capable of generating, is so small that it can hardly be seen; (for the pods which it bears, that look like little balls of bark, are not the seeds but contain them). 2 The original seeds were given by nature, while the later were discovered in the experiments of the farmer. The first are those which, without the aid of the farmer, grow without being sown; the second are those which, derived from these, do not grow without being sown. In the case of the first,88a care should be taken to see that they are not dried out from age, and that they are clean and not mixed with seed of similar appearance. The age of the seed is of such importance in the case of some plants that it alters their nature; thus from the planting of old cabbage seeds it is said that rape grows, and on the other hand that cabbage grows from old rape seed. 3 In the case of the second class of seed,88b you should be careful not to transplant them too early or too late. The proper time is that given by <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> — spring, autumn, and at the rising of the Dog Star — but the time is not the same for all localities and all species. In ground that is dry, thin, or clayey, spring is the proper season, because it is less humid; in good, rich land the autumn, because in spring it is very wet. Some authorities allow about thirty days for such planting. 4 In the third method, which consists in transferring shoots from a tree into the ground, if the shoot is buried in the earth, you must be careful, in the case of some, that the shoot be removed at the proper time — that is, before it shows any sign of budding or blossoming; and that what you transplant from the tree you tear from the stock rather than break off a limb, as the heel of a shoot is steadier, or the wider it is the more easily it puts out roots. They are thrust into the ground at once, before the sap dries out. In the case of olive cuttings, care must be taken that they be from a tender branch, sharpened evenly at both ends. Such cuttings, about a foot in length, are called by some clavolae, and by others taleae. </p>                        </div>

You cannot, for instance, graft a pear on an oak, even though you can on an apple. This is a matter of importance to many people who pay considerable attention to the soothsayers; for these have a saying that when a tree has been grafted with several varieties, the one that attracts the lightning turns into as many bolts as there are varieties, though the stroke is a single one. No matter how good the pear shoot which you graft on a wild pear, the fruit will not be as well flavoured as if you graft it on a cultivated pear. 6 It is a general rule in grafting, if the shoot and the tree are of the same species, as, for instance, if both are of the apple family, that for the effect on the fruit the grafting should be of a such a nature that the shoot is of a better type than the tree on which it is grafted. There is a second method of grafting from tree to tree which has recently been developed, under conditions where the trees stand close to each other. From the tree from which you wish to take the shoot a small branch is run to the tree on which you wish to graft and is inserted in a branch of the latter which has been cut off and split; the part which fits into the branch having first been sharpened on both sides with the knife so that one side the part which will be exposed to the weather will have bark fitted accurately to bark. Care is taken to have the tip of the grafted shoot point straight up. The next year, after it has taken firm hold, it is cut off the parent stem. </p>                        </div>

Moisture is harmful to a fresh graft, for it causes the tender shoot to decay quickly, 2 and hence it is the common view that this tree is best grafted in the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> days. In the case of plants which are not so soft, however, a vessel is fastened above the graft in such a way that water may drip slowly to keep the shoot from drying out before it unites with the tree. The bark of the shoot must be kept uninjured, and the shoot itself be sharpened in such a way as not to bare the pith. To prevent moisture or excessive heat from injuring it on the surface its be smeared with clay and tied up with bark. 3 For this reason the vine is cut off three days before grafting, so that any excessive moisture in it may run out before it is grafted; or else a cut is made in the branch on which the graft is made a little lower than the graft, so as to allow casual water to run off. On the other hand, figs, pomegranates, and plants of a drier nature are grafted at once. In other graftings, such as of figs, care must be taken that the shoot contains a bud. </p>                        </div>

As the seedling can scarcely spring from these small grains — for all things which are small and dry grow slowly, while those which are of looser texture are also of more rapid growth, as, for instance, the female grows more rapidly than the male, a rule which holds good also in plants to some extent, the fig, the pomegranate, and the vine being, on account of their feminine softness, of rapid growth, while, on the other hand, the palm, the cypress, and the olive are of slow growth; 5 for in this respect the humid [are quicker] than the dry — it is therefore better to plant in the nursery shoots from the fig tree than grains from the fruit; unless this is impracticable, as when you wish to ship seeds overseas or import them thence. In this case we pass a string through the figs when they are ripe for eating, and after they have dried they are tied in bundles and may be sent where we will; and there they are planted in a nursery and reproduce. 6 It was in this manner that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=demonym long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chian</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236PCha class=demonym long=23.6153 lat=38.4597>Chalcidian</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a>, African, and other varieties of over-sea figs were imported into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>.

It also makes a great difference whether the planting is on virgin soil or on what is called restibilis — land cultivated every year — or on vervactum, which is allowed sometimes to lie fallow between crops. 3 In Olynthia, remarked <a href=/people/2084 target=_blank>Agrius</a>, they say that the land is cropped every year, but in such a way that a richer crop is produced every other year. Land ought to be left every other year with somewhat lighter crops, rejoined <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a>; I mean by that crops which are less exhausting to the land. <br />Tell us now, said <a href=/people/2084 target=_blank>Agrius</a>, of the third step, the nurture and feeding of the plant. 4 All plants, resumed <a href=/people/4697 target=_blank>Stolo</a>, grow in the soil, and when mature conceive, and when the time of gestation is complete bear fruit or ear, or the like; and the seed returns whence it came. Thus, if you pluck the blossom or an unripe pear, or the like, no second one will grown on the same spot in the same year, as the same plant cannot have two periods of gestation.

Wild plants which have not been touched by the planter show that this is true; for roots grow before the plant which comes from them, but they go no deeper than the point to which the sun's warmth reaches.

The hard inner part is called the grain; the husk is its envelope; and the beard is the part which rises from the husk like a long, slender needle, just as if the husk and bead formed a peaked cap for the grain. 2 'Beard' and 'grain' are familiar words to most people, but 'husk' (gluma) to few; thus the only place where it occurs, to my knowledge, is in <a href=/people/337 target=_blank>Ennius</a>, in his translation of <a href=/people/2047 target=_blank>Euhemerus</a>.

The grain is so called from gerere; for the seed is planted that the ear may 'bear' (gerat) the grain, not the husk of the beard; just as the vine is planted not to bear leaves but grapes. The ear, however, which the peasants, in their old-fashioned way, call speca, seems to have got its name from spes; for it is because they hope (sperant) to have this grow that they plant. 3 An ear which has no bears is said to be 'hornless,' as the beard may be said to be the 'horns' of the ear. When these are just forming and are not yet quite visible, the green envelope under which they are hidden is called the sheath, being like the sheath in which a sword is encased. The part at the top of the full-grown ear, which is smaller than the grain, is called frit; while the part, also smaller than the grain, at the bottom of the ear where it joins the top of the stalk is called urru.100b </p>                        </div>

First the grass on the hay-meadows should be cut close with the sickle when it ceases to grow and begins to dry out with the heat, and turned with the fork while it is drying out; when it is quite dry it should be made into bundles and hauled to the barn. Then the loose hay from the meadows should be raked up and added to the hay-pile. 2 After doing this you should 'sickle' the meadows — that is, cut with the sickle what the mowers have passed over, leaving the field humped, as it were, with tufts of grass. I suppose the verb sicilire, used with meadow as object, is derived from this cutting (sectio). </p>                        </div>

There are three methods of harvesting grain: the first, employed in Umbria, in which the stalk is cut close to the ground with the hook, and each bundle, as it is cut, is laid on the ground. When a number of bundles are formed, they go over them again, and cut the ears from each close to the stalk. The ears are cast into the basket and carried to the threshing-floor, while the straw is left in the field and afterwards stacked. 2 In the second method, employed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a>, they use a curved handle of wood with a small iron saw attached to the end; when this catches a bundle of ears it cuts them off and leaves the straw standing in the field to be cut later. In the third method, employed near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and in numerous other places, seizing the top with the left hand they cut the straw in the middle; and I suggest that the word messis is derived from this middle (medium) which they cut. The part of the stalk below the hand remains attached to the ground, and is cut later; 3 while the part which is attached to the ear is carried to the threshing-floor in baskets. The name for straw, palea, may be derived from the fact that there, in an uncovered place, it is detached 'openly' (palam); some derive the other word, stramentum, from stare, as they do also the word stamen, and others from stratus, because it is 'spread' (substernitur) under <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>. The grain should be cut when it is ripe; and on easily worked land it is held that the reaping of one iugerum is approximately a day's work for one man — this should include the carrying of the reaped ears to the threshing-floor in baskets. </p>                        </div>

It should be built of solid dirt, well packed, and especially if it is of clay, so that it may not crack in the heat and allow the grain to hide, or take in water and open the door to <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mice</a> and ants. For this reason it is customary to coat it with amurca, which is poison to weeds, ants, and moles. 2 Some farmers build up the floor with stone to make it solid, or even pave it. Others, such as the Bagienni, go so far as to build a shelter over the floors, because in that country rain-storms frequently occur at threshing time.

The latter is constructed either of a board made rough with stones or iron, which separates the grain from the ear when it is dragged by a yoke of steers with the driver or a heavy weight on it; or of a toothed axle running on low wheels, called a Punic cart, the driver sitting on it and driving the steers which drag it — a contrivance in use in Hither Spain and other places. 2 Among other peoples the threshing is done by turning in <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and driving them around with goads, the grain being separated from the beards by their hoofs. After the threshing the grain should be tossed from the ground when the wind is blowing gently, with winnowing fans or forks.

So those gathered are carried to the wine-yard, thence to go into the empty jar; those selected are carried to a separate basket, to be placed thence in small pots and thrust into jars filled with wine dregs, while others are plunged into the pond in a jar sealed with pitch, and still others go up to their place in the larder. When the grapes have been trodden, the stalks and skins should be placed under the press, so that whatever must remains in them may be pressed out into the same vat. 3 When the flow ceases under the press, some people trim around the edges of the mass and press again; this second pressing is called circumsicium, and the juice is kept separate because it tastes of the knife.

Those which cannot be reached with the hand should be beaten down; but a reed should be used rather than a pole, as the heavier blow renders necessary the work of the tree-doctor. The one who is beating should not strike the olive directly; 3 for an olive struck in this way often tears away the shoot with it, and the fruit of the next year is lost. This is not the least reason for the saying that the olive fails to bear a crop every other year, or does not bear so full a crop. 4 The olive reaches the steading by the same two roads as the grape, one portion for food, and one to gush forth and anoint the body not only within but also without, thus following the master into the bath and into the gymnasium. </p>                        </div>

As most people are ignorant of the value of the latter, you may see it flowing out from the olive presses on to the fields, and not only blackening the ground but rendering it barren when there is a large quantity of it; whereas, in moderate quantities, this fluid is not only extremely valuable for many purposes, but is especially valuable in agriculture, as it is usually poured around the roots of trees, chiefly olive trees, and where noxious weeds grow in the fields. </p>                        </div>

For as in the country those who live in the villa are lazier than those who are engaged in carrying out work on the land, so they thought that those who settled in town were more indolent than those who dwelt in the country. Hence they so divided the year that they attended to their town affairs only on the ninth days, and dwelt in the country on the remaining seven. 2 So long as they kept up this practice they attained both objects — keeping their lands most productive by cultivation, and themselves enjoying better health and not requiring the citified gymnasia of the Greeks. In these days one such gymnasium is hardly enough, and they do not think they have a real villa unless it rings with many resounding Greek names, places severally called procoetion (ante-room), palaestra (exercise-room), apodyterion (dressing-room), peristylon (colonnade), ornithon (aviary), peripteros (pergola), oporotheca (fruit-room). 3 As therefore in these days practically all the heads of families have sneaked within the walls, abandoning the sickle and the plough, and would rather busy their hands in the theatre and in the circus than in the grain-fields and the vineyards, we hire a man to bring us from Africa and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a> the grain with which to fill our stomachs, and the vintage we store comes in ships from the islands of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369273PKos class=place long=27.2859 lat=36.8914>Cos</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a>. </p>                        </div>

For the shepherd is one thing and the ploughman another; and it does not follow that because <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> can graze in a field the herdsman is the same as the ploughman.

As the association between them is very close, inasmuch as it is frequently more profitable to the owner of the farm to feed the fodder on the place than to sell it, and inasmuch as manure is admirably adapted to the fruits of the earth, and <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> especially fitted to produce it, one who owns a farm ought to have a knowledge of both pursuits, agriculture and <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>-raising, and also of the husbandry of the steading.

Of the ancients the most illustrious were all shepherds, as appears in both Greek and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> literature, and in the ancient poets, who call some men 'rich in flocks,' others 'rich in <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>,' others 'rich in herds'; and they have related that on account of their costliness some <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> actually had fleeces of gold — as at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a> the one which <a href=/people/126 target=_blank>Atreus</a> complains that <a href=/people/598 target=_blank>Thyestes</a> stole from him; or as in the realm of <a href=/people/320 target=_blank>Aeetes</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=place long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchis</a>, the ram in search of whose golden fleece the <a href=/people/461 target=_blank>Argonauts</a> of royal blood are said to have fared forth; or as among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/321201UEue class=place long=20.063 lat=32.114>Hesperides</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, from which <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> brought from Africa to Greece golden mala, which is the ancient manner of naming <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> and <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>. For the Greeks called these mela from the sound of their bleating; 7 and in fact our people give them a similar name from the same bleating, but with a different consonant (for the bleating seems to give the sound be, and not me), and they call the bleating of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> baelare, and hence later, by the excision of a letter, as occurs in many words, balare. But if the flock had not been held in high honour among the ancients, the astronomers, in laying out the heavens, would not have called by their names the signs of the zodiac; they not only did not hesitate to give such names, but many of them begin their enumeration of the twelve signs with the names of the Ram and the Bull, placing them ahead of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> and <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>. For those gods follow them, but are called the Twins. 8 And they were not content to have one-sixth of the twelve signs bear the names of domestic animals, but added <a href=/people/10728 target=_blank>Capricornus</a>, so that one-fourth might have them. And besides this, they added of the domestic animals the she-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>, the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kid</a>, and the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>. Or are not tracts on land and sea also known by the names of animals? For instance, they named a sea <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381253WAeg class=place long=25.3 lat=38.1>Aegean</a> from the word for <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>, a mountain on the border of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a>, a mountain in the Sabine country, Cantherius, and two straits <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411291WBos class=place long=29.0753 lat=41.1194>Bosphorus</a> (<a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>-ford) — the Thracian and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454367WBos class=demonym long=36.66 lat=45.36>Cimmerian</a>. 9 Did they not give such names to many places on land, as, for instance, the city in Greece called 'Hippion (<a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>-rearing) <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415156UArg class=place long=15.611 lat=41.553>Argos</a>'? And, finally, is not <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> named from vituli (bullocks), as <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> states? Further, does not everyone agree that the Roman people is sprung from shepherds? Is there anyone who does not know that <a href=/people/12127 target=_blank>Faustulus</a>, the foster-father who reared <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> and <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a>, was a shepherd? Will not the fact that they chose exactly the <a href=/people/3225 target=_blank>Parilia</a> as the time to found a city demonstrate that they were themselves shepherds? Is not the same thing proved by the following facts: that up to this day a fine is assessed after the ancient fashion in <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> and <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>; that the oldest copper coins are marked with <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>; 10 that when the city was founded the position of walls and gates was marked out by a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> and a <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>; that when the Roman people is purified by the suovetaurilia, a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>, a ram, and a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> are driven around; that many of our family names are derived from both classes, the larger and the smaller, such as <a href=/people/756 target=_blank>Porcius</a>, Ovinius, Caprilius from the smaller, and Equitius, Taurius, <a href=/people/685 target=_blank>Asinius</a> from the larger; and that the so-called cognomina [surnames] prove the same thing, as, for instance, the Annii Caprae, the Statilii Tauri, the Pomponii Vituli, and many others, derived from the names of domestic animals? </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0684.phi002:2.1.11'><b>&sect; 2.1.11</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;It remains to speak of the science of animal husbandry, and our friend, <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a>, to whom this generation presents the palm in all agricultural matters, and who is therefore better fitted, will discuss it. When the eyes of all were turned on him <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a> began:— Well, there is a science of assembling and feeding <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> in such fashion as to secure the greatest returns from them; the very word for money is derived from them, for <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> are the basis of all wealth. 12 The science embraces nine divisions under three topics of three divisions each: the topic of the smaller animals, with its three divisions, <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>, <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>; the second topic, that of the larger animals, with likewise its three classes naturally separate, <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a>, <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. The third topic comprises animals which are kept not for the profit derived from them, but for the purpose of the above groups, or as a result of them, mules, <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>, and herdsmen. Each one of these divisions includes at least nine general subdivisions; and of these four are necessarily involved in assembling and an equal number in feeding; while one is common to both. There are, then, at the lowest 81 subdivisions, all of them important and not one insignificant. 13 First: in order to assemble a sound flock one must know one item — at what age it is profitable to get and keep each several kind. Thus, in the matter of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, they can be purchased at a lower price below the age of one year and beyond that of ten years, for they begin to yield a profit after the age of two or three, and do not continue to do so much beyond the age of ten years — 14 the earliest youth and extreme age of all animals being barren. The second of the first four heads is a knowledge of the proper characteristics of each species of animal, as this has a very important bearing on the profit. Thus, one buys an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> with dark rather than with white horns, a full-bodied she-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> rather than a thin one, and <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a> with long bodies provided the head is small. The third point of inquiry is as to the breed; it is for this reason that in Greece the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=person long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a> are noted, and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424129URea class=place long=12.8589 lat=42.402>Reate</a> — so much so that within my recollection an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> fetched 60,000 sesterces, and one team of four at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> sold for 400,000. 15 The fourth topic is the law of purchase — the proper legal form to be followed in the purchase of each separate species. In order that the property of another may become mine an intermediate step is necessary, and not in all purchases is an agreement or the payment of money sufficient to effect a change of ownership; and in a purchase it is sometimes to be stipulated that the animal is sound, sometimes that it is from a sound flock, while at other times neither stipulation is made. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0684.phi002:2.1.16'><b>&sect; 2.1.16</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;After the purchase has been made we come to the second group of four points which are to be observed: they are those concerned with pasturage, breeding, feeding, and health. Of pasturage, which is the first point, there are three divisions: the preferable locality for the pasturage of the several species, the time, and the manner; thus, it is better to pasture <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> on a bushy hillside than on a grassy plain, while the opposite is true of mares. Again, the same localities are not equally suited in summer and winter to the pasturing of all species. Hence, flocks of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> are driven all the way from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=place long=16.3 lat=41>Apulia</a> into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413148RSam class=place long=14.8 lat=41.3>Samnium</a> for summering, and are reported to the tax-collectors, for fear of offending against the censorial regulation forbidding the pasturing of unregistered flocks; 17 and mules are driven in summer from the level Rosea into the high mountains of Burbur. One must also consider the preferable method of pasturing each species — by which I do not mean merely that a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> or an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> is content with hay, but that barley and beans should be fed at intervals to some of them, and that lupines should be fed to <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, and alfalfa and clover to milch <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a>; and besides that for thirty days before mating more food should be given rams and <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> to increase their vigour, and food should be lessened for the females, because it is claimed that they conceive more readily when they are thin. 18 The second topic is that of breeding — by which I mean the process from conception to birth, these being the limits of pregnancy. The first point to be observed, therefore, is that of mating — the time at which opportunity for coition should be allowed each species; thus, the period from the beginning of the west wind to the vernal equinox is deemed best suited to <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>, while that from the setting of <a href=/people/632 target=_blank>Arcturus</a> to the setting of <a href=/people/2035 target=_blank>Aquila</a> is considered best for <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>. Consideration should also be given to the proper period before breeding begins, during which the males should be kept away from the females — a period which both stockmen and shepherds usually fix at two months for all animals. 19 The second division comprises the points to be watched in breeding, arising from the difference among species in the period of gestation; thus, the mare carries her young twelve months, the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a> ten, the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> five, the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> four. (Speaking of breeding, there is a story from Spain which, though incredible, is quite authentic, that on the shore of the ocean in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-83RLus class=place long=-8.3 lat=39>Lusitania</a>, in the district in which is situated the town of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387000UOli class=place long=-9.1337 lat=38.71>Olisipo</a>, certain mares on Mount Taurus, at a particular time of year, are impregnated by the wind; just as in this country frequently occurs in the case of those hens the eggs of which are called hypenemia. But the foals of these mares do not live beyond three years.) Care must be taken that the young which have gone the full time or longer have a clean, soft place to stand in, and that they be not trampled. Lambs which are born after the full period are called cordi, the name being derived from the fact that they have remained in those deep-lying folds which are called chorion. 20 There is a third item — the practice to be observed in the matter of feeding, including the number of days on which the young may have the teat, at what times, and where; and if the mother is deficient in milk, that the young be allowed to suckle the udder of another mother. Such animals are called subrumi, 'under the udder,' the udder being called rumis, as I suppose, in old <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a>. As a rule, <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> are not weaned under four months, <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kids</a> under three, and <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> under two. Those of the last named which are pure for sacrifice and may be offered up, used to be called sacres; <a href=/people/408 target=_blank>Plautus</a> uses the term in his sentence: 'What's the price of sacred <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a>?' Similarly, <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, fattened for public offerings, are called opimi, fatlings. 21 The fourth division is that of health — a complicated but extremely important matter, inasmuch as a sickly herd is a losing investment, and men frequently come to grief because it is not strong. There are two divisions of such knowledge, as there are in the treatment of human beings: in the one case the physician should be called in, while in the other even an attentive herdsman is competent to give the treatment. The topic has three heads: we must observe the cause of the several diseases, the symptoms displayed by such causes, and the proper method of treatment to be followed for each disease. 22 In general, sickness is caused by the fact that the animals are suffering from heat or from cold, or else from excessive work, or, on the other hand, from lack of exercise; or in case food or drink has been given them immediately after working, without a period of rest. The symptoms are that those which have fever from overwork keep the mouth open, pant fast with moist breath, and have hot bodies. The following is the treatment in such cases: 23 The animal is drenched with water, rubbed down with oil and warm wine, and, further, is sustained with food, and a covering is thrown over it to prevent a chill; in case of thirst tepid water is administered. If improvement is not obtained by such treatment, blood is let, usually from the head. Other diseases have other causes and other symptoms, and the man in charge of the herd should keep them all in written form. </p>                        </div>

For the man who is feeding a herd must decide on the size, determining how many herds and how large he is going to graze, so that his pasturage will not run short, and so that he will not have idle pasturage and hence lose his profit. He must also decide how many females to have in the flock for breeding, how many males, how many young of each sex, and how many culls are to be cut out. In the matter of feeding, if too many young are born you should follow the practice of some breeders, and wean some of them; the result usually being that the rest grow better. </p>                        </div>

How will you get a ninefold division in the case of mules and herdsmen, where there is neither breeding nor bearing? 26 I see how you can use it in the case of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>. I grant you also that even in the case of the humans the ninefold division can be retained, as they keep women in their huts in the winter ranches, and some have them even in the summer, thinking that this is worth while in order the more easily to keep the herdsmen with their herds; and by the natural increase they enlarge their slave gangs and make the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>-raising more profitable. The number, I remark, is not to be taken as precisely accurate, just as we do not mean to be taken exactly when we say that a thousand ships set forth against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, or speak of the centumviral court at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. So, if you wish, subtract two of the topics, coition and foaling, when you speak of mules. 27 Foaling? asked Vaccius; why, don't you know that it has several times been asserted that a mule has borne a colt at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>?36 To back up his statement, I add that both <a href=/people/343 target=_blank>Mago</a> and <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> remark that the mule and the mare bring forth in the twelfth month after conception. Hence we must not expect all lands to agree, even if it is considered a portent when a mule bears young here in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. Swallows and storks, for instance, which bear in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, do not bear in all lands. Surely you are aware that the date-palms of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> bear fruit in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a> but cannot in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. 28 <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a>, however, remarked: If you insist on having 81 sub-heads, omitting the breeding and feeding of mules, you may easily fill that double gap; two very important sources of revenue fall outside the enumeration. There is the shearing — the clipping or pulling of wool and <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> hair — and another, which is even more important, the matter of milk and cheese. The Greek authorities treat this as a separate topic, calling it tyropoiia (cheese-making), and have had a great deal to say about it. </p>                        </div>

The first consideration is that these be in good condition when purchased; with respect to age that they be neither too old nor mere <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a>, the latter being not yet, and the former no longer profitable — though the age which is followed by hope is better than the one which is followed by death. 3 As to form, <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> should be full-bodied, with abundant soft fleece, with fibres long and thick over the whole body, especially about the shoulders and neck, and should have a shaggy belly also. In fact, <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> which did not have this our ancestors called 'bald' (apicas), and would have none of them. The legs should be short; and observe that the tail should be long in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> but short in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>. The most important point to watch is to have a flock from good stock. 4 This can usually be judged by two points — the form and the progeny; by the form if the ram have a full coating of fleece on the forehead, have flat horns curving towards the muzzle, grey eyes, and ears overgrown with wool; if they are full-bodied, with wide chest, shoulders, and hind-quarters, and a wide, long tail. A black or spotted tongue is also to be avoided, for rams with such a tongue usually beget black or spotted <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a>. The stock is determined by the progeny if they beget handsome <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a>. </p>                        </div>

With this exception, the ancient formula is generally employed: when the purchaser has said, 'They are sold at such a price?' and the seller has replied, 'Yes,' and the money has passed, the purchaser, using the old formula, says: 6 'You guarantee that the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> in question are perfectly sound, up to the standard of a flock which is perfectly sound, excepting those blind of one eye, deaf, or minae (that is, with belly bare of wool),43 that they do not come from a diseased flock, and that title may legally pass — that all this may be properly done?'

It is first to be arranged that they feed properly the year round, indoors and out. The fold should be placed in a suitable situation, protected from the wind, and facing the east rather than the south. The ground on which they are to stand should be clear of undergrowth and sloping, so that it can easily be swept and kept clean; for the moisture of the ground injures not only the fleece of the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> but their hoofs as well, and causes them to become scabby. 8 When they have been standing for some days, fresh brush should be spread for them, to give them a softer bed and keep them cleaner; for this increases their appetite. Separate enclosures should also be built, so that you may take the pregnant ones away from the flock, and also those that are sick. These measures concern most the flocks which are folded at the steading. 9 On the other hand, in the case of those that feed on the ranges and are far from cover, hurdles or nets are carried with which to make enclosures in a desolate district, as well as other necessary things; for they usually graze far and wide in all sorts of places, so that frequently the winter grazing grounds are many miles away from the summer. I am well aware of that, said I,44 for I had flocks that wintered in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=place long=16.3 lat=41>Apulia</a> and summered in the mountains around <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424129URea class=place long=12.8589 lat=42.402>Reate</a>, these two widely separated ranges being connected by public <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>-trails, as a pair of buckets by their yoke. 10 Such flocks, even when they feed in the same locality, are treated differently at different seasons; thus, in summer they begin feeding at daybreak, because at that time the grass, filled with dew, is superior to the grass of midday, which is drier. At sunrise they are driven to water, to make them more eager to graze when they come back. 11 During the midday heat they are driven under shady cliffs and wide-spreading trees to cool off until the day grows cooler; and they feed again in the evening until sunset. Sheep should be headed in grazing in such a way as to have the sun behind them, as the head of the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> is its weakest part. A short time after sunset they are driven to water, and then again they graze until it becomes quite dark; for at this time the succulence comes again to the grass. This practice is usually kept up from the rising of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> until the autumnal equinox. 12 It is profitable to drive them into stubble fields for two reasons: they get their fill of the ears that have fallen, and make the crop better the next year by trampling the straw and by their dung. The feeding during the rest of the year, winter and spring, varies from this, in that when the frost has melted they are driven out to feed and range the whole day, and it is considered sufficient for them to be driven to water only once, at midday. </p>                        </div>

The rams which are to be used for breeding are to be removed from the flock two months ahead, and fed more generously. If barley is fed them on their return to the pens from the pasture, they are strengthened for the work before them. The best time for mating is from the setting of <a href=/people/632 target=_blank>Arcturus</a> to the setting of <a href=/people/2035 target=_blank>Aquila</a>; as <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> which are conceived after that time grow undersized and weak. 14 As the period of pregnancy of the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> is 150 days, the birth thus occurs at the close of autumn, when the air is fairly temperate, and the grass which is called forth by the early rains is just growing. During the whole time of breeding they should drink the same water, as a change of water causes the wool to spot and is injurious to the womb. When all the ewes have conceived, the rams should again be removed, as they are troublesome in worrying the ewes which have now become pregnant. Ewes less than two years old should not be allowed to breed, for the offspring of these is not sturdy and the ewes themselves are injured; and no others are better than the three-year-olds for breeding. They may be protected from the male by binding behind them baskets made of rushes or other material; but they are protected more easily if they feed apart. </p>                        </div>

They are kept penned for two or three days, while they are learning to recognise their dams and are getting their fill of nourishment. Then the dams go to pasture with the flock, and the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> are kept penned; when the dams are brought back to them toward evening, the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> are suckled by them and are again separated to keep them from being trampled by the dams during the night. The same thing takes place in the morning, before the dams go out to pasture, so that the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> may be filled with milk. 16 When about ten days have passed, stakes are set to which the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> are fastened at intervals by bark or other smooth ropes, so that the tender young things may not knock the skin off any of their legs while frisking about together during the whole day. If the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a> will not come to its dam's udder, it should be held close and its lips smeared with butter or hog's lard and the lips be given the savour of milk. A few days later ground vetch or tender grass is thrown out to them before they go out to pasture and when they come back; 17 and this feeding is continued until they are four months old. During this time some breeders do not milk the dams; and it is even better not to milk them at all, as they both yield more wool and bear more <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a>. When the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> are removed from the dams, care must be taken that they do not sicken from the separation; and so in feeding they must be coaxed by the daintiness of the food and guarded from being harmed by cold and heat. 18 They must be driven into the flock only after they no longer miss the dam, because they have forgotten the taste of milk. Lambs should be castrated not earlier than the fifth month, and then not until the heat or the cold has broken. Those they wish to rear for rams are chosen preferably from the young of dams which usually bear twins. The treatment is, in general, the same in the case of jacketed <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> — those which, on account of the excellence of the wool, are jacketed with skins, as is the practice at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a> and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, to prevent the fleece from being soiled, in which case it cannot be so well dyed, or washed and bleached. 19 More care is employed in the case of these than in the case of rough-fleeced <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, to keep the folds and stalls clean; and so they are covered with a stone pavement so that the urine may not stand anywhere in the stalls. To these the food which they prefer, such as fig leaves, straw, grape dregs, and bran, is fed in moderate quantities, to avoid under-feeding or over-feeding; either of which is harmful to their fattening, while alfalfa and snail-clover are both beneficial, as these fatten them very easily and produce milk. </p>                        </div>

One who decides to assemble a flock of <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> should, in choosing his animals, have regard first to age, picking those of the age which is already capable of bringing in a profit, and this age preferably the one which can bring it longer; for the young <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> is more profitable than the old. 2 As to conformation, see that they be strong and large, and have a smooth coat with thick hair, unless, to be sure, they belong to the hairless breed, for there are two breeds of <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>. They should have two teat-like growths hanging under the chin, as such <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> are more fertile; they should have rather large udders, so that they may give a greater quantity of milk and of richer quality in proportion. The buck should have hair which is rather soft and by preference white; short shoulders and neck; and a somewhat long throat. The flock is better if it is not formed of animals bought here and there, but of those which are accustomed to run together. 3 As to the breed, I make the remark which <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> made with regard to <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>; with this exception, that the race of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> is more quiet, inasmuch as they are gentler, while on the other hand that of <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> is more nimble. As to their activity, <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> says in his <a href=/people/5146 target=_blank>Origines</a>: 'On Soracte and Fiscellum there are wild <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> which make leaps of more than sixty feet from the cliffs.' For just as the domesticated <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> is sprung from the wild <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, so the domesticated <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> is sprung from the wild <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>; and the island <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430098ICap class=place long=9.8425 lat=43.0477>Caprasia</a>, off the coast of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, derives its name from these. 4 As she-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> which bear twins are of better stock, it is from these, preferably, that the males are usually chosen for service. Some owners are even careful to import she-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> from the island <a href=/people/2806 target=_blank>Melia</a>, because it is thought that the largest and finest <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kids</a> are produced there. </p>                        </div>

Such stalls, and in fact all stalls, should be floored with stone or tile, to prevent the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>-house from being wet and muddy. When they have to spend the night outdoors, their pens should face in the same direction, and they should be bedded down with twigs so that they may not be muddied. The care of this animal in the matter of feeding is about the same as that of the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, though each has certain peculiarities; 7 thus, the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> prefers wooded glades to meadows, as it eats eagerly the field bushes and crops the undergrowth on cultivated land. Indeed, their name capra is derived from carpere, to crop. It is because of this fact that in a contract for the lease of a farm the exception is usually made that the renter may not pasture the offspring of a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> on the place. For their teeth are injurious to all forms of growth; and though the astronomers have placed them in the sky, they have put them outside the circle of the twelve signs — there are two <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kids</a> and a she-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> not far from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a>. 8 As to breeding, at the close of autumn, while the herd is at pasture, the bucks are driven from it into the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>-houses, as was directed with regard to rams. The female which has conceived drops her <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kid</a> four months later, during the spring. As to rearing, when the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kids</a> reach the age of three months they are turned out and begin to form part of the flock. What can I say of the health of animals which are never healthy? I can only make one remark: that the head goatherds keep written directions as to the remedies to be used for some of their diseases and for flesh wounds which they frequently receive, as they are always fighting one another with their horns, and as they crop in thorny places. 9 One topic remains — that of number. This is smaller in the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> herd than in the flock, as <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> are wanton and scatter widely, while <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, on the contrary, huddle together and crowd into the same space. Hence in the Ager Gallicus breeders keep numerous herds rather than large ones, because in large herds an epidemic quickly spreads, and this may ruin the owner. 10 A flock of about fifty is considered quite large enough. The experience of the Roman knight, Gaberius, is thought to prove this: He had a place containing 1000 iugera near the city, and hearing from a certain goatherd who drove ten <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> to the city that they yielded him a denarius a day per head, he bought 1000 <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>, hoping that he would make 1000 denarii a day profit. In which he was sadly mistaken, for within a short time he lost the whole flock by disease. Among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399182RSal class=ethnic long=18.3 lat=39.9>Sallentini</a>, however, and around <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415138UCas class=place long=13.8222 lat=41.483>Casinum</a>, they have herds running as high as 100. As to the proportion of males to females, there is about the same difference of opinion, some (and this is my own practice) keeping one buck to every ten does; others, such as <a href=/people/1593 target=_blank>Menas</a>, one to fifteen; and still others, such as Murrius, one to twenty. </p>                        </div>

I need hardly ask, for that <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a> should be chosen to speak on that subject this surname of his indicates. You seem, said Tremelius in reply, not to know why I have the nickname <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a>. That these gentlemen, too, may learn the reason while you are being enlightened, you must know that my family does not bear a swinish surname, and that I am no descendant of <a href=/people/636 target=_blank>Eumaeus</a>. My grandfather was the first to be called <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a>. He was quaestor to the praetor <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a>, in the province of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, and was left in command of the army until the return of the praetor. The enemy, thinking that they had an opportunity to win a victory, began a vigorous assault on the camp. 2 In the course of his plea to the soldiers to seize arms and go to meet them, my grandfather said that he would scatter those people as a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> scatters her <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a>; and he was as good as his word. For he so scattered and routed the enemy in that battle that because of it the praetor <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> received the title of Imperator, and my grandfather earned the surname of <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a>. Hence neither my great-grandfather nor any of the Tremelii who preceded him was called by this surname of <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a>; and I am no less than the seventh man of praetorian rank in succession in our family. 3 Still, I will not shrink from the task of telling what I know about <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>. For I have been a close student of agriculture since my earliest days, and this matter of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a> is of equal interest to me and to you who are large <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>-owners. For who of our people cultivates a farm without keeping <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>? and who has not heard that our fathers called him lazy and extravagant who hung in his larder a flitch of bacon which he had purchased from the butcher rather than got from his own farm? <br />A man, then, who wishes to keep his herd in good condition should select, first, animals of the proper age, secondly, of good conformation (that is, with heavy members, except in the case of feet and head), of uniform colour rather than spotted. You should see that the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> have not only these same qualities, but especially that their shoulders are well developed. 4 The breed of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a> is determined by their appearance, their litter, and the locality from which they come: from their appearance if both <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> and <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> are handsome; from their litter if they produce numerous <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a>; from the locality if you get them from places where fat rather than thin <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a> are produced. </p>                        </div>

Some buyers add the stipulation that they have got through with fever and diarrhoea. <br />In the matter of feeding, ground proper for this animal is wet, as it likes not only water but even mud. It is for this reason, they say, that <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a>, when they catch <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>, always drag them to water, because their teeth cannot endure the heat of the flesh. 6 As this animal feeds chiefly on mast, and next on beans, barley, and other grains, this food produces not only fat but a pleasant flavour in the flesh. In summer they are driven to pasture early in the day, and before the heat grows intense they are driven into a shady spot, preferably where there is water; then in the afternoon, when the heat has diminished, they are again turned out to pasture. In winter they are not turned out until the frost has disappeared and the ice has melted. 7 In the matter of breeding, the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> are to be separated out two months ahead. The best time for service is from the beginning of the west wind to the spring equinox, as in this case the litter is produced in summer. For the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> is pregnant for four months and will thus bear her young when the land is rich in food. Sows should not be bred when less than a year old, and it is better to wait until they are twenty months old, so that they will be two years old when they bear. When they once begin bearing it is said that they continue to do so satisfactorily up to the seventh year. 8 At the time of breeding they are driven into muddy lanes and pools, so that they may wallow in the mud; for this is their form of refreshment, as bathing is to human beings. After all the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sows</a> have conceived, the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> are again separated. The <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> begins to cover at eight months and keeps his vigour up to three years; after which time he begins to deteriorate until he reaches the butcher, the appointed go-between of pork and the populace. </p>                        </div>

There are traces of this in these facts: that <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> are sacrificed at the initial rites of <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a>; that at the rites that initiate peace, when a treaty is made, a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> is killed; and that at the beginning of the marriage rites of ancient kings and eminent personages in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Etruria</a>, the bride and groom, in the ceremonies which united them, first sacrificed a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>. 10 The ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a>, too, as well as the Greeks living in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, seem to have had the same custom; for our women, and especially nurses, call that part which in girls is the mark of their sex porcus,b as Greek women call it choeros, meaning thereby that it is a distinctive part mature enough for marriage. There is a saying that the race of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> is expressly given by nature to set forth a banquet; and that accordingly life was given them just like salt, to preserve the flesh. The Gauls usually make the best and largest flitches of them; it is a sign of their excellence that annually Comacine and Cavarine hams and shoulders are still imported from Gaul to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. 11 With regard to the size of the Gallic flitches, <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> uses this language: 'The <a href=/people/11013 target=_blank>Insubrians</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> salt down three and four thousand flitches; in spring the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> grows so fat that she cannot stand on her own feet, and cannot take a step; and so when one is to be taken anywhere it is placed in a wagon.' <a href=/people/585 target=_blank>Atilius</a> of Spain, a thoroughly truthful man and one widely versed in a variety of subjects, used to tell the story that when a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> was killed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-83RLus class=place long=-8.3 lat=39>Lusitania</a>, a district of Farther Spain, there was sent to the senator Lucius <a href=/people/1860 target=_blank>Volumnius</a> a piece of the meat with two ribs attached which weighed •three-and-twenty pounds; and that the meat of that <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> was •one foot three fingers thick from skin to bone. 12 No less remarkable a thing was told me in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a>, I remarked; I recall that I went to look at a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> which was so fat that not only could she not rise to her feet, but actually a shrew-<a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mouse</a> had eaten a hole in her flesh, built her nest, and borne her young.

As to rearing, which is called porculatio, the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> are allowed to remain with their mothers for two months; in the second month, after they are able to feed, they are removed. Pigs born in winter are apt to grow thin on account of the cold and because the mothers drive them off on account of the scantiness of the milk, and the consequent bruising of their teats by the teeth of the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a>. Each <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> should have her separate sty in which to feed her <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a>; because she does not drive away the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> of a strange litter, and so, if they become mixed she deteriorates in breeding. 14 Her year is naturally divided into two parts, as she bears twice a year, being with young for four months and giving suck for two. The sty should be constructed •about three feet high, and a little more than that across, at such a height from the ground that if the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> when pregnant should try to jump out, she will not cast her young. The height of the pen should be such that the swineherd can easily look around it, to prevent the little <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> from being crushed by the mother, and be able to clean the bottom without trouble. The sty should have a door with the lower sill •one and a third feet high, so that the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> cannot jump over it when the mother leaves the sty. 15 Whenever the swineherd cleans the sty he should always cover the floor with sand, or throw into each sty something to soak up the moisture; and when a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> has young he should feed her more bountifully so that she may more easily supply milk. They are usually fed about two pounds of barley soaked in water; some double this amount, feeding both morning and evening, if they have no other food to give. 16 Pigs when weaned are by some people no longer called 'sucking-<a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a>,' but delici or shoats. On the tenth day after birth they are considered 'pure,' and for that reason the ancients called them sacres, because they are said to be fit for sacrifice first at that age. Hence in <a href=/people/408 target=_blank>Plautus</a>'s play, the Menaechmi, the scene of which is laid in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413194PEpi class=place long=19.4449 lat=41.3164>Epidamnus</a>, a character who, thinking that another is mad, wants him to make sacrifice and be cured, asks: 'What's the price of porci sacres in this town?' Wine dregs and grape refuse are usually fed them if the farm produces these. 17 When they have outgrown the name of sucking-<a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> they are called nefrendes, from the fact that they are not able to 'crunch' (frendere), that is crush, beans. Porcus is an old Greek word, but it is obsolete, as they now use the word choeros. At the time of bearing, care is taken to see that the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sows</a> drink twice a day for the sake of the milk. The saying is that a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> should bear as many <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> as she has teats; if she bear less she will not pay for herself, and if she bear more it is a portent. 18 It is recorded that the most ancient portent of this kind is the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417125ULav class=place long=12.4793 lat=41.6564>Lavinium</a>, which bore thirty white <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a>; and the portent was fulfilled in that thirty years later the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417125ULav class=place long=12.4793 lat=41.6564>Lavinium</a> founded the town of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=place long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alba</a>. Traces of this <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> and her <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> are to be seen even to this day; there are bronze images of them standing in public places even now, and the body of the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> is exhibited by the priests, having been kept in brine, according to their account. 19 A <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> can feed eight little <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> at first; but when they have taken on weight it is the practice of experienced breeders to remove half of them, as the mother cannot supply enough milk and the whole of the litter cannot grow fat. The mother is not driven out of the sty except for water during the first ten days after delivery; but after this time they are allowed to range for food in near-by parts of the steading, so that they may come back often and feed their <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a>. 20 When these are grown they are allowed to follow the mother to pasture; but when they come home they are separated from the mothers and fed apart, so as to grow accustomed to the lack of the mother's nourishment, a point which they reach in ten days. The swineherd should accustom them to do everything to the sound of the horn. At first they are penned in; and then, when the horn sounds, the sty is opened so that they can come out into the place where barley is spread out. This is spread in a row because in that way less is wasted than if it is heaped up, and more of them can reach it easily. The idea in having them gather at the sound of the horn is that they may not become lost when scattered in wooded country. 21 The best time for castrating the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> is when one year old, and certainly not less than six months; when this is done their name is changed, and they are called 'barrows' instead of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a>. As to the health of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>, I shall give but one illustration: if the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> cannot furnish enough milk for the sucking-<a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a>, toasted wheat should be fed (for raw wheat loosens the bowels), or barley soaked in water, until they are three months old. 22 As to numbers, ten <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> are considered enough for 100 <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sows</a>, and some breeders even lessen this number. The number in a herd varies; for myself I consider a herd of 100 a reasonable number, but some breeders have larger ones, the number sometimes going as high as 150. Some double the size of the herd, and others have even a larger herd. A rather small herd is less expensive than one too large, as the herdsman requires fewer helpers; and so the breeder determines the size of the herd by his own advantage, and not as he determines the number of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> to keep, as this latter point is derived from nature. </p>                        </div>

A sterile <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a> is called taura, and a pregnant <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a> is called horda. It is from the fact that at that time pregnant <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> are sacrificed that one of the days in the calendar is called hordicidia. 7 One who wishes to buy a herd of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> should be careful to have animals of such an age that they are sound for bearing calves rather than those which have already reached the age of barrenness. They should be well formed, that is, clean-limbed, square-built, large, with blackish horns, wide foreheads, large black eyes, hairy ears, narrow jaws, somewhat snub-nosed, not humpbacked, but with a slight depression of the spine, spreading nostrils, blackish lips, 8 thick, long neck, with dewlap hanging from it, body well ribbed, broad shoulders, sturdy rump, a long tail hanging down to the ankles, curling somewhat at the end with thick hair, with legs rather short and straight, knees prominent and a good distance apart, feet not wide and not splaying as they walk, the hoofs not widely cloven but with the two toes smooth and of equal size, the skin not hard and rough to touch. The best colour is black, next red, then dun, and then white; for those of the last mentioned colour are most delicate, and those of the first most hardy. 9 Of the other two colours the first is preferable to the second, while both are more common than the black and the white. He should furthermore see that the males be of good breed, and their conformation should be looked to, for their young reproduce the characteristics of the parents. It is also a matter of importance where they are born; thus in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> many Gallic <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> of good breed are good workers, while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=demonym long=8.3 lat=44.3>Ligurian</a> are of small account; 10 of foreign <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> are not only the best in all Greece, but are even better than the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a>. Yet some people use <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> breeds, which they claim excel in size, as offerings, and these they reserve for solemn offerings to the gods. These are doubtless to be preferred for sacrificial purposes because of the splendour of their size and colour; and this is done all the more because white <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> are not so common in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> as they are in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> on the shores of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406265WMel class=place long=26.46 lat=40.55>Black Gulf</a> where there are few of any other colour. In the purchase of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> which have been broken in, the bargain is in these terms: 'Do you guarantee that the said <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> are sound, and that I am protected from suits for damage?' 11 In buying them unbroken, the formula runs: 'Do you guarantee that the said bullocks are quite sound and of a sound herd, and that I am protected from suits for damage?' Butchers use a somewhat fuller form, following the rule of <a href=/people/1949 target=_blank>Manilius</a>, in buying for slaughter; those who buy for sacrifice do not usually demand a guarantee of soundness in the victim. <br />Large <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> are most conveniently pastured on wooded land where there is much undergrowth and foliage; and those that spend the winter along the coast are driven in summer into the leafy hills. In the matter of breeding I usually follow these principles: 12 for one month before they are mated, <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> should not have their fill of food and drink, because it is thought that when thin they are in better condition to conceive. On the other hand, I keep the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> filled with grass, straw, and hay for two months before mating; and I keep them away from the females. I keep the same number of <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> as <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> — two to every 70 brood <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> — one a yearling, the other a two-year-old. I attend to this matter following the rising of the constellation which the Greeks call Lyra, and which our people call <a href=/people/7692 target=_blank>Fides</a> — 13 it is only then that I turn the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> into the herd. The <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> shows by the way he dismounts whether a male or female has been conceived by his act: if it is a male he comes down on the right side, and if a female on the left. Why this is true, he remarked to me, you who read <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> will have to find out. Cows should not be covered which are less than two years old, so that they may be three years old when they bear; and it will be all the better if they are four years old. Most of them continue bearing up to ten years, and some of them even longer. The best time for mating is from the rising of the Dolphin up to forty days or a little more; for <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> which conceive at that time drop their calves at the most temperate season, as <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> carry their calves for ten months. 14 On this subject I have seen a remarkable statement — that if you turn in a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> immediately after he has been castrated, he can get a calf. The <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> should be pastured in grassy and watered ground, and care should be taken not to let them crowd, be struck, or run against one another. As <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>-flies have a way of tormenting them in summer and certain minute insects grow under their tails, some breeders keep them shut up in pens, to keep them from being worried. The pens should be strewn with a bedding of leaves or some such thing, so that they may rest in greater comfort. In summer they should be driven to water twice, in winter once. 15 When they come to the time of calving, fresh fodder should be kept near the stalls for them to nibble at as they go out, for they become dainty. Care should also be taken that the place into which they turned shall not be chilly, for chill and hunger make them grow thin. 16 In the matter of rearing, the following rules should be observed with this kind of animal: Sucklings must not sleep with their dams, as they will be trampled; they should be admitted to their dams in the morning and when they have come back from pasture. When the calves have made some growth, the dams should be relieved by throwing green food before the calves in the pens. These stalls (and this holds good for practically all stalls) should be paved with stones or something of the sort, so that their hoofs may not rot. After the autumnal equinox calves pasture along with their dams. 17 They should not be castrated until they are two years old, because it is hard for them to recover otherwise; while those which are castrated later become tough and worthless. Just as in the case of other herds, there should be a culling once a year, and the culls should be cut out of the herd, as they take up the room of those which can bring in a profit. If a <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a> has lost her calf she should be given some whose dams do not give enough milk. Calves six months old are fed wheat bran and barley-meal and tender grass, and care is taken that they drink morning and evening. 18 On the subject of health there are many rules; these have been copied down from <a href=/people/343 target=_blank>Mago</a>'s treatise, and I see to it that my head herdsman is reading some of them repeatedly. As to the number of <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> and <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a>, the rule is that there be, to every sixty <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a>, one yearling <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> and one two-year-old. Some breeders make the number smaller or larger; as, for instance, in <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>'s herd there are two <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> to seventy breeding <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a>. The number of animals in a herd varies with the owner, some breeders (and I am one of them) considering a hundred a reasonable number. But <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> has 120, as does Lucienus. </p>                        </div>

They should be sturdy, sound in all parts, full-bodied, of good stock, and from those districts from which the best come; this is a point considered by those breeders in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a> who, by preference, buy in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a>, and those in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> who buy in the neighborhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424129URea class=place long=12.8589 lat=42.402>Reate</a>.

There are two species of these animals: the wild <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>, called onagrus, 3 of which there are many herds, as, for instance, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375324RLyk class=place long=32.4 lat=37.5>Lycaonia</a>; and the domesticated, such as are all those in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. The wild <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> is well suited for breeding, because he is easily changed from wild to tame and never changes back from tame to wild. As the young reproduce the qualities of their parents, both sire and dam should be chosen with an eye to their worth. In the matter of transfer of title, they change owners, as do other animals, by purchase and delivery; and there is the usual guarantee of soundness and against liability for damage. 4 The best food for them is spelt and barley bran. They are bred before the solstice, so that they may drop their colts at the same season the next year; for they foal in the twelfth month after conception. Pregnant jennies are relieved of work, as work makes the womb bear a poorer offspring. The male is not kept from work, as he loses vigour from lack of labour. In the matter of foaling about the same rules are followed as in the case of mares. The young are not separated from their dams for a year after birth; but during the next year they are allowed to be with them at night, and are kept loosely tied with a leather halter or the like. In the third year they begin their training for the work for which their owners wish to keep them. </p>                        </div>

The females of these Quintus Modius Equiculus, a very gallant gentleman whose father was also a soldier, used to value as highly as the males.

It is said that there is no way of determining those which are older than this, except that when the teeth become prominent and the brows grey with hollows under them, they determine by looking at him that such a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> is sixteen years old. 4 As to conformation they should be of moderate size, neither over nor under size, and the mares should have broad quarters and bellies.

The veins should be visible over the whole body, as a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> of this kind is capable of easy treatment when it is sick. 6 The stock from which they come is of great importance, as there are a number of breeds; hence noted breeds are named from the districts from which they come, as in Greece the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=demonym long=16.3 lat=41>Apulian</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=place long=16.3 lat=41>Apulia</a>, and the Rosean from Rosea.

In the matter of breeding, the beginning of mating should be at the vernal equinox and it should continue until the solstice, so that the foal may come at a seasonable time; for it is said that they are born on the tenth day of the twelfth month after conception. Foals which are born after this time are usually defective and unprofitable. 8 When the proper season arrives, the stallion should be admitted twice daily, morning and evening, with the help of the groom — as they call the man who attends to the mating. For with his help, when the mare is tied, the coition takes place more quickly, and the stallions do not, in their eagerness, eject the seed to no purpose. The mares show when they have conceived by defending themselves. If the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> will not cover the mare, the centre of a squill is crushed in water and reduced to the consistency of honey; with this the natural parts of the mare are touched when she is in heat, and on the other hand the nostrils of the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> are touched with what comes from the natural parts of the mare. 9 (Though it is incredible, as it actually happened the following story should be recorded: when a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> could not be induced to mount his dam, the groom covered his head, led him up, and forced him to do so; but when he took the cloth from the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>'s eyes after he had come down, the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> dashed at him and killed him with his teeth.) 10 Care must be taken that the mares, after conceiving, are not worked over hard or kept in cold places, as chill is extremely injurious to those with foal. So in their stalls the ground should be kept free of dampness, the doors and windows should be kept shut, and poles should be placed in the pen to separate each mare, so that they cannot fight one another. A mare with foal should not be over-fed or under-fed. 11 Those who mate their mares every other year claim that they breed for a longer time and that the colts are better; and that those which become pregnant every year are sooner exhausted, just as are fields which are planted every year.108 <br />Within ten days after birth colts should be driven to pasture with their dams, so that the dung may not burn their tender hoofs. When the colts are five months old, on being driven back to the stable they should have spread before them barley-meal ground with bran, and whatever other product of the soil they relish. 12 When they become yearlings they should be fed with barley and bran so long as they suckle. And they should not be removed before the end of two years; and while they are still with the dam they should be handled from time to time, to prevent them from being frightened when they are separated. For the same purpose harness should be hung in the stall, so that the young <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> may become accustomed both to the sight of it and to its jingling when it moves. 13 As soon as they have become accustomed to coming up and being handled it is well to let a boy mount them two or three times, first lying flat on his stomach and then seated. This should be done when the colt is a three-year-old, for at that age it is growing most rapidly, and putting on muscle. Some breeders claim that a young <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> can be broken at eighteen months; but it is better to wait until they are three-year-olds; from which time it is customary to feed mixed forage, for this is a most necessary form of purging for <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. It should be fed for ten days, and the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> should be allowed to taste no other food. 14 From the eleventh to the fourteenth day barley should be fed, the amount being increased gradually from day to day; and the amount fed on the fourth day should be continued for the next ten days. After that time he should have gentle exercise, and be rubbed down with oil after he has sweated. If the weather is chilly, a fire should be built in the stall. </p>                        </div>

Thus the experienced soldier chooses his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> by one standard and feeds and trains them in one way, and the charioteer and circus-rider in another; and the trainer who is breaking <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> for riding under the saddle or for the carriage does not use the same system as the man who has military service in view; for as on the one hand, in the army, they want spirited <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, so on the other hand they prefer more docile ones for road service. It is for this reason that there has grown up the greatest difference in the matter of castrating <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>; for when the testicles have been removed they become more steady for the reason that they no longer have seed.

It will take only a short time to discuss them, said Murrius; for mules and hinnies are hybrids and grafts, not from roots after their own kind; for the mule is the offspring of a mare and an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>, while the hinny is the offspring of a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and a jenny; 2 each is useful work, but neither brings any return from young. When an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> colt is newly born it is placed under a mare and becomes fatter on her milk, as they claim that such nourishment is more nutritious than the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>'s milk. They are reared, in addition, on straw, hay, or barley. Special care is also taken of the foster-mother, so the mare may furnish the colt with an abundant supply of milk. A jack so reared may be used for breeding after three years, and because it is accustomed to <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> it will not refuse to mate. 3 If you use him at an early age, he himself tires sooner, and his offspring will be of poorer quality.

Great care must be taken for their supply of food; for hunger will drive them to hunt for food, if it is not provided, and take them away from the flock — 9 even if they do not, as some think, come to the point of disproving the ancient proverb, or even go so far as to enact the story of <a href=/people/583 target=_blank>Actaeon</a>, and sink their teeth in their master. 10 You should also feed them barley bread, but not without soaking it in milk; for when they have become accustomed to eating that kind of food they will not soon stray from the flock. They are not allowed to feed on the flesh of a dead <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, for fear that the taste will make them less inclined to spare the flock. They are also fed on bone soup and even broken bones as well; for these make their teeth stronger and their mouths of wider stretch, because their jaws are spread with greater force, and the savour of the marrow makes them more keen. Their habit is to eat during the day when they are out with the flocks, and at evening when these are folded. 11 The beginning of breeding is fixed at the opening of spring, for at that time they are said to be 'in heat,' that is, to show their desire for mating. Those that conceive at that time have a litter about the time of the summer solstice, for they usually carry their young for three months. During the period of gestation they should be fed barley bread rather than wheat bread, for they are better nourished on the former and yield a larger supply of milk. 12 In the matter of rearing after birth, if the litter is large you should at once pick those that you wish to keep and dispose of the others. The fewer you leave the better they will grow, because of the abundance of milk. Chaff and other like stuff is spread under them, because they are more easily reared on a soft bedding. The <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>pups</a> open their eyes within twenty days; for the first two months after birth they are not taken from the mother, but are weaned by degrees. Several of them are driven into one place and teased to make them fight, so as to make them more keen; but they are not allowed to tire themselves out, as this makes them sluggish. 13 They are also accustomed to being tied, at first with slight leashes; and if they try to gnaw these they are whipped to keep them from forming the habit of doing this. On rainy days the kennels should be bedded with leaves or fodder, and this for two purposes: to keep them from being muddied, and to keep them from getting chilled. 14 Some people castrate them, because they think that by this means they are less likely to leave the flock; others do not, because they think this makes them less keen. Some people crush filberts in water and rub the mixture over their ears and between their toes, as the flies and worms and fleas make ulcers there if you do not use this ointment. 15 To protect them from being wounded by wild beasts, collars are placed on them — the so-called melium, that is, a belt around the neck made of stout leather with nails having heads; under the nail heads there is sewed a piece of soft leather, to prevent the hard iron from injuring the neck. The reason for this is that if a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> or other beast has been wounded by these nails, this makes the other <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> also, which do not have the collar, safe. 16 The number of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> is usually determined by the size of the flock; it is thought to be about right for one <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> to follow each shepherd. But the number varies with the circumstances; thus in countries where wild beasts are plentiful there should be more, as is usually the case with those who escort the flocks to summer and winter pastures through distant woodland trails. On the other hand, for a flock feeding near the steading two <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> to the farm are sufficient. These should be a male and a female, for in this case they are more watchful, as one makes the other more keen, and if one of the two is sick that the flock may not be without a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>. </p>                        </div>

Whereupon <a href=/people/3158 target=_blank>Cossinius</a>: For herds of larger <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> older men, for the smaller even boys; but in both cases those who range the trails should be sturdier than those on the farm who go back to the steading every day. Thus on the range you may see young men, usually armed, while on the farm not only boys but even girls tend the flocks. 2 The herdsmen should be required to stay on the range the entire day and have the herds feed together; but, on the other hand, to spend the night each with his own herd. They should all be under one herd-master; he should preferably be older than the rest and more experienced, as the other herdsmen will be more disposed to take orders from one who surpasses them in both age and knowledge. 3 Still, he should not be so much older that his age will prevent him from being as able to stand hard work; for neither old men nor boys can easily endure the hardships of the trail and the steepness and roughness of the mountains — all of which must be encountered by those who follow the herd, and especially herds of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and oats, which like cliffs and woods for pasturage. The men chosen for this work should be of a sturdy sort, swift, nimble, with supple limbs; men who can not only follow the herd but can also protect it from beasts and robbers, who can lift loads to the backs of pack animals, who can dash out, and who can hurl the javelin. 4 It is not every people that is fitted for herding; thus neither a Bastulan nor a <a href=/people/12086 target=_blank>Turdulan</a> is suited, while Gauls are admirably adapted, especially for draught <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>. In the matter of purchase there are some six methods of acquiring a legitimate title: by legal inheritance; by receiving, in due form, through mancipation from one who had a legal right to transfer; by legal cession, from one who had the right to cede, and that at the proper time; by right of possession; by purchase at auction from war-booty; and lastly by official sale among other property or in confiscated property. </p>                        </div>

But in the case of those who tend the herds in mountain valleys and wooded lands, and keep off the rains not by the roof of the steading but by makeshift huts, many have thought that it was advisable to send along women to follow the herds, prepare food for the herdsmen, and make them more diligent. 7 Such women should, however, be strong and not ill-looking. In many places they are not inferior to the men at work, as may be seen here and there in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, being able either to tend the herd, or carry firewood and cook the food, or to keep things in order in their huts. 8 As to feeding their young, I merely remark that in most cases they suckle them as well as bear them. At the same time, turning to me, he said: As I have heard you say that you, when you were in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440154RLib class=place long=15.4 lat=44>Liburnia</a>, saw mothers carrying logs and children at the breast at the same time, sometimes one, sometimes two; showing that our newly-delivered women, who lie for days under their mosquito-nets, are worthless and contemptible. 9 It is quite true, I replied; and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> I have seen something even more remarkable: for it often happens there that a pregnant woman, when her time has come, steps aside a little way from her work, bears her child there, and brings it back so soon that you would say she had not borne it but found it. They have also another remarkable practice: their custom does not refuse to allow women, often as much as twenty years old (and they call them maidens, too), before marriage to mate with any man they please, to wander around by themselves, and to bear children. 10 (<a href=/people/3158 target=_blank>Cossinius</a> resumes), All directions for caring for the health of human beings and <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, and all sicknesses which can be treated without the aid of a physician, the head-herdsman should keep in writing. For one who does not know his letters is not fit for the place, because he cannot possibly keep his master's <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> accounts correctly. The number of herdsmen is determined differently, some having a smaller, some a larger number. 11 My own practice is to have a herdsman to every eighty wool-bearing <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, while <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> has one to every hundred. If flocks of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> are very large (and some people have as many as 1000) you can decrease the number of shepherds more easily than you can in smaller flocks, such as those of <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> and mine. My own flocks contain 700, and yours, I think, had 800; but still you had one tenth of them rams, as I do. Two men are needed for a herd of fifty mares, and each of these should certainly have for his use a mare which has been broken to the saddle, in those districts where it is customary for the mares to be rounded up and driven to stalls, as is frequently true in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=place long=16.3 lat=41>Apulia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=place long=16 lat=40.4>Lucania</a>. </p>                        </div>

Yes, said I, but not until you have added, as was promised, something about supplementary profit from the flock, including under it the milk and the shearing. (<a href=/people/3158 target=_blank>Cossinius</a> continues) Of all the liquids which we take for sustenance, milk is the most nourishing — first <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>'s milk, and next <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>'s milk. Mare's milk, however, has the greatest purgative effect, secondly <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>'s milk, then <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>'s milk, and lastly <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>'s milk. 2 But there are certain differences among these which arise from a difference of pasturage, a difference in the nature of the animal, and a difference in the milking. As affected by pasturage, milk is best for nourishment which comes from animals fed on barley and straw, and, in general, on solid dry food; while that from animals fed on green food is best for purging, and especially if the green food such as purges us when we eat it ourselves. As affected by the nature of the animal, milk from healthy animals and those not yet old is better than if it is the reverse. As affected by milking and birth, the best milk is that which has not been kept too long after milking and which has not been milked immediately after parturition. 3 Of the cheeses which are made from this milk, those made of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>'s milk have the most nutriment, but when eaten are discharged with most difficulty; next come those made of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>'s milk, while those made of <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>'s milk have the least nutriment and are most easily voided. There is also a difference depending on whether the cheeses are soft and fresh or dry and old, as the soft cheeses are more nutritious and less constipating, while the old, dry cheeses are just the opposite. 4 The period for making cheese extends from the rising of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> in spring until the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> in summer. In spring the milk for cheese making is drawn in the morning, while at other seasons the milking takes place toward midday; but the practice is not entirely uniform because of differences in locality and food. To two congii of milk is added a bit of rennet the size of an olive, to make it coagulate; this is better when made from a hare or a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kid</a> than when made from a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a>. Others use, instead of rennet, the milk from the stem of a fig, and vinegar; they also curdle with various other substances — a thing which, in Greek, is sometimes called ὀπός, and sometimes δάκρυον. </p>                        </div>

The proper time for shearing is the period from the spring equinox to the solstice, after the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> have begun to sweat; it is because of this sweat (sudor) that freshly shorn wool is called 'juicy' (sucida). 7 Freshly clipped <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> are rubbed down on the same day with wine and oil, to which some add a mixture of white chalk and hog lard; and if they have been accustomed to wear a jacket, the skin with which they were covered is greased on the inside with the same mixture and placed on them again. If a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> has been cut during the shearing, the wound is smeared with soft pitch. Sheep with coarse fleece are shorn about the time of the barley harvest, or at other places before the cutting of the hay. 8 Some shear their <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> twice a year, as is done in Hither Spain, shearing every six months. They undergo the double work on the supposition that more wool is secured by this method — which is the same motive that leads some to mow their meadows twice a year. The more careful farmers spread out cloths and shear the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> over them to prevent loss of the wool. 9 Calm days are chosen for this work, and on these the shearing is done from about the fourth to the ninth hour. The fleece from a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> that is clipped when the sun is rather warm is rendered softer by the sweat, as well as heavier and of better colour. When the fleece has been removed and rolled up it is called by some vellus, by others vellimnum; and it may be seen from these words that in the case of wool, plucking was discovered earlier than shearing. Some people pluck the wool even to-day; and these keep the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> without food for three days before, as the roots of the wool hold less tightly when the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> are weak. </p>                        </div>

The latter is well known and highly esteemed, being also called pecuaria, and wealthy men frequently have ranches devoted to it, which they have either leased or bought; while the other, that of the steading, as it seems insignificant, has, by some writers, been brought under the head of agriculture, though it is a matter of feeding; and the subject as a whole has not, so far as I know, been treated as a separate topic by anyone. 9 Hence, as I suggested that there are three divisions of rural economy which are instituted for gainful ends — one of agriculture, a second of animal husbandry, and a third of the husbandry of the steading — I fixed on three books, of which I have written two: the first to my wife Fundania, on agriculture, and the second to <a href=/people/5299 target=_blank>Turranius</a> <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a>, on animal husbandry. The third book, that on the husbandry of the steading, which remains, I am herewith sending to you, thinking that in view of our nearness and our affection it is to you particularly that I should dedicate it. 10 For just as you had a villa noteworthy for its frescoing, inlaid work, and handsome mosaic floors, but thought it was not fine enough until its walls were adorned also by your writings, so I, that it might be farther adorned with fruit, so far as I could make it so, am sending this to you, recalling as I do the conversations which we held on the subject of the complete villa. And in discussing that subject we shall begin as follows. </p>                        </div>

There we find <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, the augur, sitting on a bench so that he might be on hand for consultation, if need should arise.

When we came up to him, <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a> said to <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, with a smile: Will you let us come into your aviary, where you are sitting among the birds? 3 With pleasure, he replied, and especially you; I still 'bring up' those hospitable birds which you set before me a few days ago in your villa at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424129URea class=place long=12.8589 lat=42.402>Reate</a>, when I was on my way to lake <a href=/people/6044 target=_blank>Velinus</a> in the matter of the dispute between the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426126UInt class=place long=12.6433 lat=42.5604>Interamna</a> and those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424129URea class=place long=12.8589 lat=42.402>Reate</a>.

At your place everything is just the opposite.

For it has never, as that one did, seen a cured hay harvest in the loft, or a vintage in the cellar, or a grain-harvest in the bins.

For if buildings are not villas unless they contain the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> which you showed me at your place, for which you paid 40,000 sesterces, I'm afraid I shall be buying a 'Seian' house instead of a seaside villa. 8 My friend here, Lucius <a href=/people/2114 target=_blank>Merula</a>, made me eager to own this house when he told me, after spending several days with <a href=/people/2544 target=_blank>Seius</a>, that he had never been entertained in a villa which he liked more; and this in spite of the fact that he saw there no picture or statue of bronze or marble, nor, on the other hand, apparatus for pressing wine, jars for olive oil, or mills. 9 <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a> turned to <a href=/people/2114 target=_blank>Merula</a> and asked: How can that be a villa, if it has neither the furnishings of the city nor the appurtenances of the country? Why, he replied, you don't think that place of yours on the bend of the <a href=/people/6044 target=_blank>Velinus</a>, which never a painter or fresco-worker has seen, is less a villa than the one in the Rosea which is adorned with all the art of the stucco-worker, and of which you and your <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> are joint owners? 10 When <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a> had indicated by a nod that a building which was for farm use only was as much a villa as one that served both purposes, that of farm-house and city residence, and asked what inference he drew from that admission. Why, he replied, if your place in the Rosea is to be commended for its pasturage, and is rightly called a villa because <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> are fed and stabled there, for a like reason that also should have the name in which a large revenue is derived from pasturing. 11 For if you get a revenue from flocks, what does it matter whether they are flocks of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> or of birds? Why, is the revenue sweeter on your place from <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> which give birth to <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> than it is from the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> which are busy at their task in the hives of <a href=/people/2544 target=_blank>Seius</a>'s villa? And do you get more from the butcher for <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> born on your place there than <a href=/people/2544 target=_blank>Seius</a> does from the market-man for the wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> from his place? 12 Well, replied <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a>, what is there to prevent me from keeping these at my villa at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424129URea class=place long=12.8589 lat=42.402>Reate</a>? You don't think that honey is <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> if it is produced on <a href=/people/2544 target=_blank>Seius</a>'s place, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420090IKyr class=demonym long=9 lat=42>Corsican</a> if it is produced at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424129URea class=place long=12.8589 lat=42.402>Reate</a>? And that if mast which has to be bought feeds a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> on his place it makes him fat, while that which is had for nothing on my place makes him thin? Whereupon <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> remarked: <a href=/people/2114 target=_blank>Merula</a> did not say that you could not have husbandry like <a href=/people/2544 target=_blank>Seius</a>'s on your place; but I have, with my own eyes, seen that you have not. 13 For there are two kinds of pasturing: one in the fields, which includes <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>-raising, and the other around the farmstead, which includes chickens, pigeons, <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>, and the like, which usually feed in the steading; the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=person long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> <a href=/people/343 target=_blank>Mago</a>, <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, and other writers have left in their books remarks on them, but scattered and unsystematic. These <a href=/people/2544 target=_blank>Seius</a> seems to have read, and as a result he gets more revenue from such pasturing out of one villa than others receive from a whole farm. 14 You are quite right, said <a href=/people/2114 target=_blank>Merula</a>; I have seen there large flocks of geese, chickens, pigeons, cranes, and <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peafowl</a>, not to speak of numbers of dormice, fish, <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a>, and other game. His book-keeper, a freedman who waited on <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> and used to entertain me when his patron was away from home, told me that he received, because of such husbandry, more than 50,000 sesterces from the villa every year. When <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a> expressed his surprise, I remarked to him: Doubtless you know my maternal aunt's place in the Sabine country, at the twenty-fourth milestone from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the Via <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPSa class=place long=12.4985 lat=41.9107>Salaria</a>? 15 Of course, he replied; it is my custom to break the journey there at noon in summer, when I am on my way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424129URea class=place long=12.8589 lat=42.402>Reate</a> from the city, and to camp there at night in winter when I am on my way from there to town. Well, from the aviary alone which is in that villa, I happen to know that there were sold 5,000 fieldfares, for three denarii apiece, so that that department of the villa in that year brought in sixty thousand sesterces — twice as much as your farm of 200 iugera at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424129URea class=place long=12.8589 lat=42.402>Reate</a> brings in. What? Sixty? exclaimed <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a>, Sixty? Sixty? You are joking! 16 Sixty, I repeated. But to reach such a haul as that you will need a public banquet or somebody's triumph, such as that of <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> at that time, or the club dinners which are now so countless that they make the price of provisions go soaring. If you can't look for this sum in all other years, your aviary, I hope, will not go bankrupt on you; and if fashions continue as they now are, it will happen only rarely that you miss your reckoning. For how rarely is there a year in which you do not see a banquet or a triumph, or when the clubs do not feast? Why, said he, in this time of luxury it may fairly be said that there is a banquet every day within the gates of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. 17 Was it not Lucius Abuccius, who is, as you know, an unusually learned man (his writings are quite in the manner of <a href=/people/628 target=_blank>Lucilius</a>), who used to remark likewise that his estate near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=place long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alba</a> was always beaten in feeding by his steading? for his land brought in less than 10,000, and his steading more than 20,000 sesterces. He also claimed that if he had got a villa near the sea, where he wanted one, he would take in more than 100,000 from the villa. Come, did not Marcus <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, when he took over the guardianship of <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> recently, sell the fish from his ponds for 40,000 sesterces? 18 My dear <a href=/people/2114 target=_blank>Merula</a>, said <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a>, take me, I beg, as your pupil in this villa-feeding. Certainly, he replied; I will begin as soon as you promise the minerval.25 That is satisfactory to me; you may have it to-day, or I'll pay it time and again from that feeding. Humph, replied <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, the first time some geese or <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peacocks</a> out of your flock die! Well, retorted <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a>, what does it matter if you eat fowls or fish that have died, seeing that you never eat them unless they are dead? But, I pray you, said he, lead me into the way of the science of villa-husbandry, and set forth its scope and method. </p>                        </div>

There are three divisions of this science: the aviary, the hare-warren, and the fish-pond. Under the head of aviary I include enclosures for all fowls which are usually reared within the walls of the villa. 2 Under the head of hare-warrens I wish you to understand, not those which our forefathers called by that name — places where there are only hares — but all enclosures which are attached to the villa and keep animals enclosed for feeding. Similarly, by the term fish-pond I mean ponds which keep fish enclosed near the villa, either in fresh or salt water. 3 Each of these divisions may be subdivided into at least two: thus, under the first head, those which are not content with the land only, but need water also, as geese, teal, and ducks. In the same way the second head — that of game — contains its two diverse classes, one under which come the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>, the roe, and the hare, and the second, those which are also outside the villa, such as <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>, snails, and dormice. 4 There are likewise two divisions of the third class, the aquatic, inasmuch as fish are kept sometimes in fresh water, sometimes in sea-water. For the three classes formed of these six subdivisions must be secured three classes of craftsmen — fowlers, hunters, fishers — or else you must purchase from these those creatures which you are to preserve by the activity of your own servants during the period of gestation and up to the time of birth, and when they are born to rear and fatten so that they may reach the market. And there are, moreover, certain other creatures which are to be brought into the villa without the use of net by fowler or hunter or fisher, such as dormice, snails, and chickens. </p>                        </div>

Next came the animals which are kept in an enclosure near the villa for hunting, and hard by it the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>-hives; for from the first <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> took advantage of the roof of the villa under the eaves. Thirdly there began to be built fresh-water ponds, to which were carried fish which had been caught from the streams. 6 Each of these three classes has two stages: the earlier, which the frugality of the ancients observed, and the later, which modern luxury has now added. For instance, first came the ancient stage of our ancestors, in which there were simply two aviaries: the barn-yard on the ground in which the hens fed — and their returns were eggs and chickens — and the other above ground, in which were the pigeons, either in cotes or on the roof of the villa. 7 On the other hand, in these days, the aviaries have changed their name and have become ornithones; and those which the dainty palate of the owner has constructed have larger buildings for the sheltering of fieldfares and <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peafowl</a> than whole villas used to have in those days. 8 So too in the second division, the warren, your father, <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a>, never saw any better game from his hunting than a paltry hare. For in his day there was no great preserve, whereas nowadays people enclose many acres within walls, so as to keep numbers of wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> and roes. When you bought your place near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a> from Marcus <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, he added, turning to me, were there not many wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> in the 'hare-warren?' 9 In the third division, who had a fish-pond, except a fresh-water pond, or kept any fish in it except squali or mugiles? On the other hand what young fop in these days will not tell you that he would as soon have his pond full of <a href=/people/10983 target=_blank>frogs</a> as of such fish as these?

Well, there is built a large domed building, or a peristyle covered with tiles or netting, in which several thousand fieldfares and blackbirds can be enclosed; 2 though some breeders add besides other birds which, when fattened, bring a high price, such as ortolans and quails. Into this building water should be conducted through a pipe and allowed to spread preferably through narrow channels which can easily be cleaned (for if the water spreads there in pools, it more easily becomes foul and is not good for drinking), and the superfluous drip-water from these should run out through a pipe, so that the birds may not be troubled by mud. 3 It should have a low, narrow door, and preferably of the kind which they call coclia, such as usually are seen in the pit where bullfights are held. The windows should be few, and so arranged that trees and birds outside cannot be seen; for the sight of these, and the longing for them, makes the imprisoned birds grow thin. It should have only enough openings for light to enable the birds to see where to perch, and where the food and water is. It should be faced around the doors and windows with smooth plaster, so that no <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mice</a> or other vermin can enter anywhere. 4 Around the walls of this building on the inside there should be a number of poles for the birds to perch on; and, in addition, rods sloping from ground to wall, with transverse rods fastened to them in steps at moderate intervals, after the fashion of the balustrades of the theatre or the arena. At the bottom, on the ground, there should be water for them to drink, and here should be placed cakes for their food. These are usually made by kneading a mixture of figs and spelt. Twenty days before the breeder desires to remove fieldfares, he feeds them more liberally, giving larger quantities and beginning to feed them on spelt ground finer. In this building there should be recesses, equipped with several shelves, as a supplement to the perches; </p>                        </div>

When it become necessary to remove from this aviary birds which are fit for market, they should be taken out and put into a smaller aviary, called the seclusorium (coop), which is connected by a door with the larger aviary and better lighted. When he has the number which he desires to take shut up here, he kills them all. 6 The reason for doing this privately in a separate room is to prevent the others, if they should see it, from moping and dying at a time which would be inopportune for the seller. Fieldfares do not rear their young here and there as do the other migratory birds, storks in the field, swallows under the roof [and though their name (turdi) is masculine, there are in fact females too; nor is the case otherwise as regards blackbirds (merulae) — though they have a feminine name, there are also males].39 7 Again, birds being partly migratory, as swallows and cranes, and partly indigenous, as hens and doves, fieldfares belong to the former class, the migratory, and fly yearly across the sea into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> about the time of the autumnal equinox, and back again whence they came about the spring equinox, as do turtle-doves and quail at another season in vast numbers.

Then, turning to me, he said: Do you now describe that other kind of aviary which I am told you built for your amusement near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415138UCas class=place long=13.8222 lat=41.483>Casinum</a>, in the construction of which you are reputed to have far surpassed not only the archetype left by its inventor, our friend Marcus <a href=/people/3410 target=_blank>Laenius</a> <a href=/people/911 target=_blank>Strabo</a>, our host at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, who was the first to keep birds penned up in a recess in his peristyle, feeding them through a net covering, but also <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>' huge buildings on his place at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>. 9 I replied: I own, near the town of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415138UCas class=place long=13.8222 lat=41.483>Casinum</a>, a stream which runs through my villa, clear and deep, with a stone facing, 57 feet wide, and requiring bridges for passage from one side of the villa to the other; it is 950 feet in a straight line from the island in the lowest part of the stream, where another stream runs into it, to the upper part of the stream, where the <a href=/people/2058 target=_blank>Museum</a> is situated. 10 Along the banks of this stream there runs an uncovered walk 10 feet broad; off this walk and facing the open country is the place in which the aviary stands, shut in on two sides, right and left, by high walls. Between these lies the site of the aviary, shaped in the form of a writing-tablet with a top-piece, the quadrangular part being 48 feet in width and 72 feet in length, while at the rounded top-piece it is 27 feet. 11 Facing this, as it were a space marked off on the lower margin of the tablet, is an uncovered walk with a plumula extending from the aviary, in the middle of which are cages; and here is the entrance to the courtyard. At the entrance, on the right side and the left, are colonnades, arranged with stone columns in the outside rows and, instead of columns in the middle, with dwarf trees; while from the top of the wall to the archway the colonnade is covered with a net of hemp, which also continues from the archway to the base. These colonnades are filled with all manner of birds, to which food is supplied through the netting, while water flows to them in a tiny rivulet. 12 Along the inner side of the base of the columns, on the right side and on the left, and extending from the middle to the upper end of the open quadrangle, are two oblong fish-basins, not very wide, facing the colonnades. Between these basins is merely a path giving access to the tholos, which is a round domed building outside the quadrangle, faced with columns, such as is seen in the hall of <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>, if you put columns instead of walls. Outside these columns is a wood planted by hand with large trees, so that the light enters only at the lower part, and the whole is enclosed with high walls. 13 Between the outer columns of the rotunda, which are of stone, and the equal number of slender inner columns, which are of fir, is a space five feet wide. Between the exterior columns, instead of a wall there is a netting of gut, so that there is a view into the wood and the objects in it, while not a bird can get out into it. In the spaces between the interior columns the aviary is enclosed with a net instead of a wall. Between these and the exterior columns there is built up step by step a sort of little bird-theatre, with brackets fastened at frequent intervals to all the columns as bird-seats. 14 Within the nettings are all manner of birds, chiefly songsters, such as nightingales and blackbirds, to which water is supplied by means of a small trench, while food is passed to them under the netting. Below the base of the columns is stone-work rising a foot and nine inches above the platform; the platform itself rises about two feet above a pond, and is about five feet wide, so that the guests can walk in among the benches and the small columns. At the foot of the platform inside, is the pond, with a border a foot wide, and a little island in the middle. Along the platform also docks have been hollowed out as shelters for ducks. 15 On the island is a small column, and on the inside of it is a post, which holds up, instead of a table, a wheel with spokes, in such fashion that on the outer rim, where the felloe usually stands, there is a curved board with raised edges like a tambourine, two and a half feet in width and a palm in height. This is revolved by a single manservant in such a way that everything to drink and eat is placed on it at once and moved around to all the guests. 16 From the side of the platform, on which there are usually coverlets, the ducks come out into the pond and swim about; from this pond a stream runs into the two fish-basins which I have described, and the minnows dart back and forth, while it is so arranged that cold and warm water flows for each guest from the wooden wheel and the table which, as I have said is at the ends of the spokes, by the turning of cocks. 17 Inside, under the dome of the rotunda, the morning-star by day and the evening-star at night circle around near the lower part of the hemisphere, and move in such a manner as to show what the hour is. In the middle of the same hemisphere, running around the axis, is a compass of the eight winds, as in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BHor class=place long=23.727 lat=37.97416>horologium</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, which was built by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408223UKyr class=person long=22.301 lat=40.8312>Cyrrestrian</a>; and there a pointer, projecting from the axis, runs about the compass in such a way that it touches the wind which is blowing, so that you can tell on the inside which it is. </p>                        </div>

There should be somewhat fewer males than females if you have an eye to the financial returns; but the opposite if you look at the pleasure, for the male is handsomer. 2 They should be pastured in flocks in the fields. Across the water they are said to be reared in the islands — on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>, in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269SHer class=place long=26.8857 lat=37.6718>grove</a> of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>, and likewise in Marcus <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>'s island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426100IPla class=place long=10.0975 lat=42.5869>Planasia</a>. For the forming of a flock they are to be secured when they are young and of good appearance; for nature has awarded the palm of beauty to this fowl over all winged things. The hens are not suited for breeding under two years, and are no longer suited when they get rather old. 3 They eat any kind of grain placed before them, and especially barley; so <a href=/people/2544 target=_blank>Seius</a> issues a modius of barley a month per head, with the exception that he feeds more freely during the breeding season, before they begin to tread. He requires of his breeder three chicks for each hen, and these, when they are grown, he sells for fifty denarii each, so that no other fowl brings in so high a revenue. 4 He buys eggs, too, and places them under hens, and the chicks which are hatched from these he places in that domed building in which he keeps his <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peafowl</a>. This building should be made of a size proportioned to the number of <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peafowl</a>, and should have separate sleeping quarters, coated with smooth plaster, so that no <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> or animal can get in; </p>                        </div>

These birds require that both places be clean; and so their keeper should go around with a shovel and pick up the droppings and keep them, as they are useful for fertilizer and as litter for chicks. 6 It is said that Quintus <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> was the first to serve these fowl; it was on the occasion of his inauguration as aedile, and the innovation was praised at that time rather by the luxurious than by those who were strict and virtuous. As his example was quickly followed by many, the price has risen to such a point that the eggs sell for five denarii each, the birds themselves sell readily for 50 each, and a flock of 100 easily brings 40,000 sesterces — in fact, Abuccius used to say that if one required three chicks to every hen, the total might amount to 60,000. </p>                        </div>

But pigeons fly into the villa, and <a href=/people/2114 target=_blank>Merula</a>, pointing to them, remarks to <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a>: If you had ever built a dove-cote you might think these were your doves, wild though they are. For in a dove-cote there are usually two species of these: one the wild, or as some call them, the rock-pigeon, which lives in turrets and gable-ends (columina) of the farmhouse — whence the name columbae — and these, because of their natural shyness, hunt for the highest peak of the roof; hence the wild pigeons chiefly hunt for the turrets, flying into them, from the fields and back again, as the fancy takes them. 2 The other species of pigeon is gentler, and being content with the food from the house usually feeds around the doorstep. This species is generally white, while the other, the wild, has no white, but is variously coloured. From these two stocks is bred for profit a third hybrid species; these are put in a place called by some peristeron and by others peristerotrophion, and often a single one of these will contain as many as 5,000. 3 The peristeron is built in the form of a large building, with a vaulted roof; it has one narrow door and windows of the Punic style, or wider ones with double lattice-work, so that the whole interior is light, but so that no <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> or other noxious creature can get in. The whole of the walls and chambers in the interior is covered with the smoothest possible plaster made of marble dust, and the exterior is also plastered around the windows, so that no <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mouse</a> or lizard can crawl into the pigeon nest; for nothing is more timid than a pigeon. 4 Round nests are constructed for each pair, side by side in a row, and as many rows as possible are run from the floor up to the vaulted roof. Each nest should be so constructed as to have an opening large enough to allow only entrance and exit, and on the interior should be three palms in all directions. Under each row there should be fixed a board two palms wide, to serve as an entrance and walk-way. </p>                        </div>

So the pigeon-keeper should sweep them out frequently every month; for the droppings which make the place filthy are so well suited for fertilizing that several writers have stated that it is the best kind. He should see to it that any pigeon which has been hurt be treated, and that any dead one be removed, and should remove the squabs which are fit for market. 6 He should also have a place shut off by a net from the rest, to which the brooding birds may be transferred, and from which the mother-birds may be able to fly away from the pigeon-house. This they do for two reasons: first, if they lose their appetite or grow sickly from confinement, as they are refreshed by the open air when they fly over the fields, or secondly for a decoy; for they will themselves return in any case, because of the young they have, unless they are killed by a <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a> or cut off by a hawk. 7 These birds the pigeon-keepers make a practice of killing by planting two limed twigs in the ground, leaning toward each other, after placing between them, with its legs tied, some animal which hawks are in the habit of chasing; and they are caught in this way, when they have smeared themselves with the lime. You may see that doves do return to a place, from the fact that many people let them loose from their bosoms in the theatre and they return to their homes; and if they did not come back they would not be turned loose. 8 Food is furnished them in troughs running around the walls, which are filled from the outside through pipes. Their favourite foods are millet, wheat, barley, peas, kidney-beans, and vetch. Those who have wild pigeons in turrets and in the tops of their villas should imitate these methods so far as they can. Those which are placed in the pigeon-house should be of a proper age, neither squabs nor old birds; and there should be an equal number of cocks and hens. 9 Nothing is more prolific than the pigeon; thus, within a period of forty days it conceives, lays, hatches, and brings off its young. And they continue this, too, through practically the entire year, leaving an interval only between the winter solstice and the vernal equinox. Two chicks are born each time, and as soon as they have grown and have their strength they breed along with their mothers. Those who practise the fattening of squabs to increase their selling price, shut them up as soon as they are covered with down; then they stuff them with white bread which has been chewed, twice a day in winter and three times in summer — morning, noon, and evening; in winter they omit the noon feeding. 10 When they begin to have feathers they are left in the nest, with their legs broken, and are left to their mothers so that they can eat the food more freely; for they feed themselves and their young on it all day long. Birds which are reared in this way fatten more quickly than others, and their parents become white. At <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, if the birds are handsome, of good colour, sound, and of good breed, single pairs sell usually for 200 sesterces; but unusually fine ones sometimes for 1,000 sesterces. When a trader wanted recently to buy such birds at this price from Lucius <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a>, a Roman knight, he said he would not sell for less than 400 denarii. 11 <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a> remarked: If I could buy a ready-made pigeon-house, as I bought an earthenware dove-cote when I wanted one in my town house, I should already have gone to buy it and have sent it to the farm-house. Just as if, replied Pica, there weren't many of them in the city, also. Or doesn't it seem to you that people who have dove-cotes on their roof-tiles possess pigeon-houses, inasmuch as some of them have equipment worth more than 100,000 sesterces? I suggest that you buy the complete outfit from one of these, and before you build in the country learn here in the city to put in your purse every day the big profit of a penny or two.

The bottom row should be not less than three feet from the ground, between the other rows there should be a space of nine inches, with a half-foot interval between the top and the cupola; and the row should be as wide as the bracket can stand out from the wall, as they feed on the brackets day and night. 3 As to food, dry wheat is given them, about a half-modius for 120 turtle-doves, and their quarters are swept out every day so that they may not suffer harm from the dung — and this is also kept for fertilizing the ground.

Well, under the term poultry are included three kinds of fowl: the barn-yard, the wild, and the African. 2 Barn-yard fowls are the species which are kept continuously in farmsteads. One who wants to set up a poultry-farm of these — that is, wants to gain a large profit by the exercise of knowledge and care, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=ethnic long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delians</a> generally have done — should observe especially the following five points: purchase, including the breed and number to secure; breeding, including the manner of mating and laying; eggs, including the manner of sitting and hatching; chicks, including the manner of rearing and the birds by which they are reared; and to these is added, as an appendix, the fifth topic — the method of fattening. 3 Of the three species, the proper name for the female of the barn-yard fowl is hen, for the male is cock, while that of the half-males, which have been castrated, is capon. Cocks are castrated, to make them capons, by burning with a red-hot iron at the lowest part of the leg until it bursts; and the sore which results is smeared with potter's clay. 4 One who intends to have a complete poultry-farm should, of course, procure all three species, but chiefly the barn-yard fowls. In buying these he should choose hens which are prolific, usually of a reddish plumage, with black wing feathers, toes of uneven length, large heads, upright crest, full-bodied, as these are better fitted for laying. </p>                        </div>

If you wish to raise 200 you should assign them an enclosed place, and on it construct two large connecting hen-houses, facing eastward, each about ten feet in length, one-half smaller in width, and a little less in height. In each of these there should be a window three feet wide and one foot higher; these should be made of withes so spaced as to allow plenty of light to enter, and yet to keep from passing through them any of the things which usually injure fowls. 7 Between the two houses there should be a door through which their keeper, the gallinarius, can enter. In the houses should be run a number of perches sufficient to hold all the hens. Facing the several perches separate nests should be built for them in the wall. In front of it, as I said, should be an enclosed yard, in which they may run during the daytime and dust themselves. In addition there should be a large room for the caretaker to live in, so built that the surrounding walls may be entirely filled with hens' nests, either built in the wall or firmly attached; for movement is harmful to a sitting hen. 8 In their nests at laying-time chaff should be spread under them; and when they have laid their eggs, the bedding should be removed and other fresh bedding spread, as in old bedding lice and other vermin generally breed, and these keep the hen from resting quietly, the result being that the eggs either develop unevenly or become stale. If you wish the hen to cover the eggs, it is claimed that a sitting should number not more than 25, even if the hen has been so prolific as to lay more, 9 and that the laying is best from the vernal to the autumnal equinox. So eggs which are laid before or after that period, and even the first laid within the period, should not be set; and the eggs which you set should be put under old hens (and such hens should not have sharp beaks or claws) rather than under pullets, as the latter ought to be busy at laying rather than at sitting. They are best fitted for laying when one or two years old. 10 If you are putting <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peafowl</a> eggs under a hen, you should put the hen's eggs under her only at the beginning of the tenth day of sitting, so that she will hatch them together; for chicks require twice ten days, and <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peafowl</a> chicks thrice nine. The hens should be shut up so that they may sit day and night, except at the times morning and evening, when food and drink are being given them. 11 The caretaker should go around at intervals of several days and turn the eggs so that they will warm evenly. It is said that you can tell whether eggs are full and fertile or not if you drop them into water, as the empty egg floats, while the full one sinks. Those who shake an egg to find this out make a mistake, as they break up the vital veins in them. The same authorities state that when you hold it up to the light, the one that the light shines through is infertile. 12 Those who wish to keep eggs a considerable time rub them down thoroughly with fine salt or brine for three or four hours, and when this is washed off pack them in bran or chaff. In setting eggs, care is taken that the number be uneven. The caretaker can find out four days after the sitting begins whether the incubating eggs contain the embryo of a chick. If he holds one against a light and observes it to be uniformly clear, the belief is that it should be thrown out and another substituted. 13 The chicks, when hatched, should be taken from the several nests and placed under a hen which has few chicks; and if a few eggs are left they should be taken away from this hen and put under others which have not yet hatched and those which have fewer than 30 chicks; for the batch must not exceed this number. During the first fifteen days there should be fed to the chicks in the morning, on a bed of dust, so that the hard earth may not injure their beaks, a mixture of barley-meal and cress-seed which has been worked up some time before with water, so that when it is eaten it may not swell up in their crops; and they must be kept away from water. 14 When they begin to grow feathers from the rump, the lice must be picked from their heads and necks often, for they frequently waste away because of these. Around their houses stag horns should be burned, to keep <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> from coming in; for the smell of these animals is usually fatal to them. They should be driven out into the sunshine and on to the dung-hill so they can flutter about, as in that way they grow healthier — 15 not only the chicks but the whole poultry yard, both in summer and whenever the air is mild and it is sunny, with a net spread above them to keep them from flying outside the enclosure, and to keep hawks and the like from flying into it from outside; avoiding heat and cold, each of which is harmful to them. As soon as they have their wing-feathers they should be trained to follow one or two hens, so that the others may be free for laying rather than busied with the rearing of young. 16 They should begin to sit after the new moon, for the sittings which begin before that time usually do not turn out well. They are hatched in about twenty days. As really too much has been said about these barnyard fowls, I shall make up for it by brevity in speaking of the rest. <br />Wild hens are found rarely in town and are hardly seen in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, except the tamed ones in cages. In appearance they not like these barn-yard fowls of ours, but rather like the African fowl. 17 Birds whose appearance and shape show that they are of unmixed breed are usually displayed in public ceremonies, along with parrots, white blackbirds, and other unusual things of that sort. Usually they do not produce eggs and chicks in farmsteads, but in the forests. It is from these fowls that the island Gallinaria, in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscan</a> Sea off the coast of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> opposite the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=demonym long=8.3 lat=44.3>Ligurian</a> mountains, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/43876UAlb class=place long=7.6252 lat=43.7892>Intimilium</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440082UAlI class=place long=8.211 lat=44.0437>Album Ingaunum</a>, is said to have got its name; others hold that they are the descendants of those barnyard fowls which were carried there by sailors and became wild. 18 The African hens are large, speckled, with rounded back, and the Greeks call them 'meleagrides.'73 These are the latest fowls to come from the kitchen to the dining-room because of the pampered tastes of people. 19 On account of their scarcity they fetch a high price. Of the three species, it is chiefly the barnyard fowls which are fattened. These are shut into a warm, narrow, darkened place, because movement on their part and light free them from the slavery of fat. For this purpose the largest hens are chosen, but not necessarily those which are mistakenly called Melic; for the ancients said Melic for Medic, just as they said Thelis for <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a>. Those were called so originally which, because of their size, were imported from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a>, and the descendants of these; but later on all large hens got the name on account of their likeness. 20 On these hens the feathers are pulled from wings and tail, and they are fattened on pellets of barley-meal, sometimes mixed with darnel flour, or with flax seed soaked in fresh water. They are fed twice a day, and are watched to see, from certain symptoms, that the last food taken has been digested before more is given. When they have eaten, and their heads have been cleaned to prevent their having lice, they are again shut up. This is continued as long as twenty-five days, and at this time they finally become fat. 21 Some breeders fatten them also on wheat bread softened in water mixed with a sound, fragrant wine, which results in making them fat and tender within twenty days. If, in the course of the fattening, they lose their appetites from too much food, the amount fed should be lessened, diminishing in the last ten days in the same proportion as it increased in the first ten, so that the twentieth day will be equal to the first. The same method is followed in fattening wood-pigeons and making them plump. </p>                        </div>

For there is another species, mottled, which is called 'wild,' and these do not like to flock with the others, and are not tamed so easily. 3 The most suitable time for mating, in the case of geese, is after the winter solstice, for laying and sitting from the first of February or March up to the summer solstice. As they usually mate in the water, they are driven into a stream or a pond. Individuals do not lay more than three times in a year, and when they do, square coops should be built for each, about two and a half feet on each side, and these should be carpeted with straw. Their eggs should be distinguished by some mark, as they do not hatch the eggs of another. Usually nine eggs or eleven form a sitting; if fewer are set, five, if more, fifteen. In cold weather they sit thirty days, in warmer weather twenty-five. 4 When they hatch they are allowed to stay with the mother for the first five days; then they are driven out daily, when the weather is good, into meadows, and also into ponds or swamps. Coops are made for them above ground or under it, and not more than twenty goslings are placed in each; and care is taken that these quarters do not have moisture in the ground, and that they do have a soft cushion of straw or some other material, and that weasels cannot get in, or any other harmful beasts. </p>                        </div>

The leaves of this are plucked and fed to them, for if they are driven into the place where it is growing they either ruin it by their trampling or die from over-eating; for they are naturally ravenous. For this reason you must restrain them, for, as often happens in their feeding because of their greed, if they catch hold of a root which they want to pull out of the ground, they break their necks; for the neck is exceedingly weak, just as the head is soft. If there is none of this herb, they should be fed on barley or other grain. When the season for mixed forage comes, this should be fed as I said in regard to seris. 6 While the geese are sitting they should be fed on barley soaked in water. The goslings are fed first on barley-meal or barley for two days, and for the next three on green cress cut fine, soaked in water and turned into a vessel. But after they are shut into the coops or the underground nests, twenty to the nest, as I have said, they are fed on ground barley or mixed forage or tender grass cut fine. 7 For fattening, goslings are chosen which are about one and one-half months old; these are enclosed in the fattening pen, and there they are fed on a food consisting of barley-meal and flour dampened with water, being surfeited three times a day. After eating, they are allowed the opportunity of drinking as much as they want. When they are treated in this way they become fat in about two months.

It is reported that Quintus <a href=/people/152 target=_blank>Fulvius</a> <a href=/people/9701 target=_blank>Lippinus</a> has a preserve in the vicinity of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/423118UTar class=place long=11.8016 lat=42.2588>Tarquinii</a> of forty iugera, in which are enclosed, not only the animals I have named, but also wild <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>; and an even larger one near <a href=/people/8337 target=_blank>Statonia</a>, and some in other places; 2 while in Transalpine Gaul, Titus <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> has a hunting preserve so large that he keeps a tract of about four square miles enclosed. In addition to this, in the same enclosure are usually kept places for snails and <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>-hives, and also casks in which dormice are kept confined. But the care, increase, and feeding of all these, except the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>, is evident. 3 For everybody knows that walled enclosures in warrens ought to be covered with plaster and ought to be high — in the one case to make it impossible for a weasel or a badger or other animal to enter, and in the other to keep a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> from leaping over; and they should have coverts in which the hares may hide in the day-time under the brush and grass, and trees with spreading branches to hinder the swooping of an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>. 4 Who also does not know that if he points in a few hares, male and female, in a short time the place will be filled? Such is the fecundity of this animal. For place only four in a warren and it is usually filled in a short time; for often, while they have a young litter they are found to have others in the womb. And so <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> writes of them that one who wishes to know how old they are should examine the natural openings, for undoubtedly one has more than another. </p>                        </div>

There are, then, some three species of these: one, this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> species of ours, with short fore-legs and long hind legs, the upper part of the body dark, belly white, and ears long. This hare is said to conceive even while it is pregnant. In Transalpine Gaul and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> they grow very large; in Spain and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> they are medium-sized. 6 Belonging to the second species is the hare which is born in Gaul near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a>, which usually differs in the fact that it is entirely white; these are not often brought to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. To the third species belongs the one which is native to Spain — like our hare in some respects, but with short legs — which is called cony. Lucius <a href=/people/499 target=_blank>Aelius</a> thought that the hare received its name lepus because of its swiftness, being levipes, nimble-foot. My own opinion is that it comes from an old Greek word, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390271RAio class=ethnic long=27.1 lat=39>Aeolians</a> called it λέπορις. The conies are so named from the fact that they have a way of making in the fields tunnels (cuniculos) in which to hide. 7 You should have all these three species in your warren if you can. You surely have two species anyway, I suppose, as you were in Spain for so many years that I imagine the conies followed you all the way from there. </p>                        </div>

For on the place that our friend <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> here bought from Marcus <a href=/people/5212 target=_blank>Pupius</a> <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>, you saw wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> and roes gather for food at the blowing of a horn at a regular time, when mast was thrown from a platform above to the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a>, and vetch or the like to the roes. 2 Why, said he, I saw it carried out more in the Thracian fashion at Quintus <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>'s place near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417123ULau class=place long=12.3467 lat=41.711>Laurentum</a> when I was there. For there was a forest which covered, he said, more than fifty iugera; it was enclosed with a wall and he called it, not a warren, but a game-preserve. In it was a high spot where was spread the table at which we were dining, to which he bade <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a> be called. 3 When he appeared with his robe and harp, and was bidden to sing, he blew a horn; whereupon there poured around us such a crowd of stags, <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a>, and other animals that it seemed to me to be no less attractive a sight than when the hunts of the aediles take place in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCiM class=place long=12.4871 lat=41.8852>Circus Maximus</a> without the African beasts. </p>                        </div>

So far as game is concerned, the second act has been completed briefly; and I do not ask for the rest of it — snails and dormice — as that cannot be a matter of great effort. The thing is not so simple as you think, my dear <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a>, replied <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>. You must take a place fitted for snails, in the open, and enclose it entirely with water; for if you do not, when you put them to breed it will not be their young which you have to search for, but the old snails. 2 They have to be shut in, I repeat, with water, so that you need not get a runaway-catcher. The best place is one which the sun does not parch, and where the dew falls. If there is no such natural place — and there usually is not in sunny ground — and you have no place where you can build one in the shade, as at the foot of a cliff or a mountain with a pool or stream at the bottom, you should make an artificially dewy one. This can be done if you will run a pipe and attach to it small teats to squirt out the water in such a way that it will strike a stone and be scattered widely in a mist. 3 They need little food, and require no one to feed them; they get their food, not only in the open while crawling around, but even discover any upright walls, if the stream does not prevent. In fact, even at the dealer's they keep alive for a long time by chewing the cud, a few laurel leaves being thrown them for the purpose, sprinkled with a little bran. Hence the cook usually doesn't know whether they are alive or dead when he is cooking them. 4 There are several varieties of snails, such as the small whites, which come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424129URea class=place long=12.8589 lat=42.402>Reate</a>, the large-sized, which are brought from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, and the medium-sized, which come from Africa. Not that they do not vary in these regions in distribution and size; thus, very large ones do come from Africa — the so-called solitannae — so large that 80 quadrantes can be put into their shells; and so in other countries the same species are relatively larger or smaller. </p>                        </div>

They are fattened in jars, which many people keep even inside the villa. The potters make these jars in a very different form from other jars, as they run channels along the sides and make a hollow for holding the food.

Does not the chamber in the comb have six angles, the same number as the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a> has feet? The geometricians prove that this hexagon inscribed in a circular figure encloses the greatest amount of space.b They forage abroad, and within the hive they produce a substance which, because it is the sweetest of all, is acceptable to gods and men alike; for the comb comes to the altar and the honey is served at the beginning of the feast and for the second table. 6 Their commonwealth is like the states of men, for here are king, government, and fellowship. They seek only the pure; and hence no <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a> alights on a place which is befouled or one which has an evil odour, or even one which smells of sweet perfume. So one who approaches them smelling of perfume they sting, and do not, as flies do, lick him; and one never sees <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>, as he does flies, on flesh or blood or fat — so truly do they alight only on objects which have a sweet savour. 7 The <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a> is not in the least harmful, as it injures no man's work by pulling it apart; yet it is not so cowardly as not to fight anyone who attempts to break up its own work; but still it is well aware of its own weakness.

They are themselves not idle, and detest the lazy; and so they attack and drive out from them the drones, as these give no help and eat the honey, and even a few <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> chase larger numbers of drones in spite of their cries. On the outside of the entrance to the hive they seal up the apertures through which the air comes between the combs with a substance which the Greeks call erithace. They all live as if in an army, sleeping and working regularly in turn, and send out as it were colonies, and their leaders give certain orders with the voice, as it were in imitation of the trumpet, as happens when they have signals of peace and war with one another.

They were well-off, because, though their father had left only a small villa and a bit of land certainly not larger than one iugerum, they had built an apiary entirely around the villa, and kept a garden; and all the rest of the land had been planted in thyme, snail-clover, and balm — a plant which some call honey-leaf, others <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>-leaf, and some call <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>-herb. 11 These men never received less than 10,000 sesterces from their honey, on a conservative estimate, as they said they preferred to wait until they could bring in the buyer at the time they wanted rather than to rush into market at an unfavourable time. Tell me, then, said he, where I ought to build an apiary and of what sort, so as to get a large profit. 12 The following, said <a href=/people/2114 target=_blank>Merula</a>, is the proper method for building apiaries, which are variously called melitrophia and mellaria: first, they should be situated preferably near the villa, but where echoes do not resound (for this sound is thought to be a signal for flight in their case); where the air is temperate, not too hot in summer, and not without sun in winter; that it preferably face the winter sunrise, and have near by a place which has a good supply of food and clear water. 13 If there is no natural food, the owner should <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> crops which are most attractive to <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>. Such crops are: the rose, wild thyme, balm, poppy, bean, lentil, pea, clover, rush, alfalfa, and especially snail-clover, which is extremely wholesome for them when they are ailing. It begins flowering at the vernal equinox and continues until the second equinox. 14 But while this is most beneficial to the health of <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>, thyme is best suited to honey-making; and the reason that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> honey bears off the palm is that good thyme is common there. For this reason some bruise thyme in a mortar and soak it in lukewarm water, and with this sprinkle all the plots planted for the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>. 15 So far as the situation is concerned, one should preferably be chosen close to the villa — and some people place the apiary actually in the portico of the villa, so that it may be better protected. Some build round hives of withes for the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> to stay in, others of wood and bark, others of a hollow tree, others build of earthenware, and still others fashion them of fennel stalks, building them square, about three feet long and one foot deep, but making them narrower when there are not enough <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> to fill them, so that they will not lose heart in a large empty space. All such hives are called alvi, 'bellies,' because of the nourishment (alimonium), honey, which they contain; and it seems that the reason they are made with a very narrow middle is that they may imitate the shape of the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>. 16 Those that are made of withes are smeared, inside and out, with <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>-dung, so that the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> may not be driven off by any roughness; and these hives are so placed on brackets attached to the walls that they will not be shaken nor touch one another when they are arranged in a row. In this method, a second and a third row are placed below it at an interval, and it is said that it is better to reduce the number than to add a fourth. At the middle of the hive small openings are made on the right and left, by which the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> may enter; 17 and on the back, covers are placed through which the keepers can remove the comb. The best hives are those made of bark, and the worst those made of earthenware, because the latter are most severely affected by cold in winter and by heat in summer. During the spring and summer the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>-keeper should examine them about thrice a month, smoking them lightly, and clear the hive of filth and sweep out vermin. 18 He should further see to it that several chiefs do not arise, for they become nuisances because of their dissensions. Some authorities state also that, as there are three kinds of leaders among <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> — the black, the red, and the striped — or as <a href=/people/733 target=_blank>Menecrates</a> states, two — the black and the striped — the latter is so much better that it is good practice for the keeper, when both occur in the same hive, to kill the black; for when he is with the other king he is mutinous and ruins the hive, because he either drives him out or is driven out and takes the swarm with him. 19 Of ordinary <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>, the best is the small round striped one. The one called by some the thief, and by others the drone, is black, with a broad belly. The <a href=/people/10963 target=_blank>wasp</a>, though it has the appearance of a <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>, is not a partner in its work, and frequently injures it by its sting, and so the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> keep it away. Bees differ from one another in being wild or tame; by wild, I mean those which feed in wooded places, and by tame those which feed in cultivated ground. The former are smaller in size, and hairy, but are better workers. <br />In purchasing, the buyer should see whether they are well or sick. 20 The signs of health are their being thick in the swarm, sleek, and building uniformly smooth comb. When they are not so well, the signs are that they are hairy and shaggy, as if dusted over — unless it is the working season which is pressing them; for at this time, because of the work, they get tough and thin. 21 If they are to be transferred to another place, it should be done carefully, and the proper time should be observed for doing it, and a suitable place be provided to which to move them. As to the time, it should be in spring rather than in winter, as in winter it is difficult for them to form the habit of staying where they have been moved, and so they generally fly away. If you move them from a good situation to one where there is no suitable pasturage, they become runaways. And even if you move them from one hive into another at the same place, the operation should not be carried out carelessly, 22 but the hive into which the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> are going should be smeared with balm, which has a strong attraction for them, and combs full of honey should be placed inside not far from the entrance, for fear that, when they notice either a lack of food. . . .112 He says that when <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> are sickly, because of their feeding in the early spring on the blossoms of the almond and the cornel, it is diarrhoea that affects them, and they are cured by drinking urine. 23 Propolis is the name given to a substance with which they build a protectum ('gable') over the entrance opening in front of the hive, especially in summer. This substance is used, and under the same name, by physicians in making poultices,c and for this reason it brings even a higher price than honey on the Via Sacra. Erithace is the name given a substance with which they fasten together the ends of the comb (it is a different substance than either honey or propolis) and it is in it that the force of the attraction lies. So they smear with this substance, mixed with balm, the bough or other object on which they want the swarm to settle. 24 The comb is the structure which they fashion in a series of cells of wax, each separate cell having six sides, the same number as that of the feet given to each <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a> by nature. It is said that they do not gather wholly from the same sources the materials which they bring in for making the four substances, propolis, erithace, comb, and honey. Sometimes what they gather is of one kind, since from the pomegranate and the asparagus they gather only food, from the olive tree wax, from the fig honey, but of a poor quality. 25 Sometimes a double service is rendered, as both wax and food from the bean, the balm, the gourd, and the cabbage; and similarly a double service of food and honey from the apple and wild pear, and still another double service in combination, since they get wax and honey from the poppy. A threefold service, too, is rendered, as food, honey, and wax from the almond and the charlock. From other blossoms they gather in such a way that they take some materials for just one of the substances, other materials for more than one; 26 they also follow another principle of selection in their gathering (or rather the principle follows the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>); as in the case of honey, they make watery honey from one flower, for instance the sisera, thick honey from another, for instance from rosemary; and so from still another they make an insipid honey, as from the fig, good honey from snail-clover, and the best honey from thyme. </p>                        </div>

In this matter great care should be taken to keep the water pure, as this is an extremely important point in making good honey. 28 As it is not every kind of weather that allows them to go far afield for feeding, food should be provided for them, so that they will not have to live on the honey alone at such times, or leave the hives when it is exhausted. So about ten pounds of ripe figs are boiled in six congii of water, and after they are boiled they are rolled into lumps and placed near the hives. Other apiarists have water sweetened with honey placed near the hives in vessels, and drop clean pieces of wool into it through which they can suck, for the double purpose of keeping them from surfeiting themselves with the drink and from falling into the water. A vessel is placed near each hive and is kept filled. Others pound raisins and figs together, soak them in boiled wine, and put pellets made of this mixture in a place where they can come out to feed even in winter. </p>                        </div>

Those which have gone out first fly around in sight, looking back for the others, which have not yet gathered, to swarm. When the keeper observes that they have acted so, he frightens them by throwing dust on them and by beating brass around them; 31 and the place to which he wishes to carry them, and which is not far away, is smeared with <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>-bread and balm and other things by which they are attracted.

The signal for removing the comb is given by the following occurrences . . . if the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> make a humming noise inside, if they flutter when going in and out, and if, when you remove the covers of the hives, the openings of the combs are seen to be covered with a membrane, the combs being filled with honey. 33 Some authorities hold that in taking off honey nine-tenths should be removed and one-tenth left; for if you take all, the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> will quit the hive. Others leave more than the amount stated. Just as in tilling, those who let the ground lie fallow reap more grain from interrupted harvests, so in the matter of hives if you do not take off honey every year, or not the same amount, you will by this method have <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> which are busier and more profitable. 34 It is thought that the first season for removing the comb is at the time of the rising of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a>, the second at the end of summer, before <a href=/people/632 target=_blank>Arcturus</a> is wholly above the horizon, and the third after the setting of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a>. But in this case, if the hive is well filled no more than one-third of the honey should be removed, the remainder being left for the wintering; but if the hive is not well filled no honey should be taken out. When the amount removed is large, it should not all be taken at one time or openly, for fear the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> may lose heart. If some of the comb removed contains no honey or honey that is dirty, it should be cut off with a knife. 35 Care should be taken that the weaker <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> be not imposed upon by the stronger, for in this case their output is lessened; and so the weaker are separated and placed under another king. Those which often fight one another should be sprinkled with honey-water. When this is done they not only stop fighting, but swarm over one another, licking the water; and even more so if they are sprinkled with mead, in which case the odour causes them to attach themselves more greedily, and they drink until they are stupefied. </p>                        </div>

If at any time they are knocked down by a sudden rain while harvesting, or overtaken by a sudden chill before they have foreseen that this would happen (though it is rarely that they are caught napping), and if, struck by the heavy rain-drops, they lie prostrate as if dead, they should be collected into a vessel and placed under cover in a warm spot; the next day, when the weather is at its best, they should be dusted with ashes made of fig wood, and heated a little more than warm. Then they should be shaken together gently in the vessel, without being touched with the hand, and placed in the sun. 38 Bees which have be warmed in this way recover and revive, just as happens when flies which have been killed by water are treated in the same way.d This should be carried out near the hives, so that those which have been revived may return each to his own work and home. </p>                        </div>

But while he was building near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PBai class=place long=14.0699 lat=40.8178>Baiae</a> he became so enthusiastic that he allowed the architect to spend money as if it were his own, provided he would run a tunnel from his ponds into the sea and throw up a mole, so that the tide might run into the pond and back to the sea twice a day from the beginning of the moon until the next new moon, and cool off the ponds. <br />10 So far we. Then a noise on the right, and our candidate, as aedile-elect, came into the villa wearing the broad stripe. We approach and congratulate him and escort him to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitolium</a>. Thence, he to his home, we to ours, my dear <a href=/people/10088 target=_blank>Pinnius</a>, after having had the conversation on the husbandry of the villa, the substance of which I have given you. </p>                        </div>
