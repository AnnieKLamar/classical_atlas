For such men, consorting with glory, which we may call an image of virtue, produce nothing that is genuine and of true lineage, but much that is bastard and monstrous, being swept now along one course and now along another in their attempts to satisfy desire and passion. The herdsmen of <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> say, in speaking of their flock: — Of these, indeed, though masters, we are yet the slaves, And to them we must listen even though they're dumb. </p>                        </div>
