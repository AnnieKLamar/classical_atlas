The foundations of the song have been laid with the gods, and with this man's god-given excellence. [10] The summit of perfect glory is found in good fortune. The <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> loves to remember great contests. <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>Sow</a> some splendor on the island, which <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the lord of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a> gave to <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Persephone</a>; he nodded assent with his flowing hair, that as the best land on the fruitful earth [15] he would make <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> fertile and prosperous in her cities blossoming with wealth.

I have embarked on the occasion for many themes, without flinging a false word. I have arrived singing of fine deeds at the courtyard gates of a man who loves guests, where a beautifully arranged meal has been prepared for me, and the halls are often familiar with strangers from other lands. It is his lot to have noble friends to bring against his slanderers, like water against smoke. </p>                        </div>

It is right for a man to follow straight paths, and strive according to his nature. For strength manifests itself in action, and intelligence in counsels, for those who have the inborn skill of foreseeing the future. Son of <a href=/people/4546 target=_blank>Hagesidamus</a>, your way of life [30] grants you the enjoyment of many things. I take no pleasure in keeping great wealth hidden away in my hall, but in using what I have to be successful and to win a good name by helping my friends. For the hopes of men who toil much come to all alike. But as for me, I cling to the theme of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> gladly, rousing an ancient story from among the great heights of his excellence, [35] how, when the son of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> suddenly came out of his mother's womb into the brilliant light, escaping her birth-pangs, with his twin brother, he did not escape the notice of gold-throned <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> when he was placed in his saffron swaddling-clothes. But the queen of the gods, stung in her heart, immediately sent <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a>. The doors opened, and they crept into the spacious inner-chamber, eager to coil their swift jaws around the babies. But <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> lifted his head straight up, and had his first experience of battle, seizing [45] the two necks of the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a> in his two irresistible hands. When they were strangled, time squeezed the breath of life out of their unspeakable limbs.

For each man alike is oppressed by his own trouble, but the heart recovers quickly from someone else's grief. [55] He stood, possessed by overwhelming astonishment and delight. For he saw the supernatural courage and power of his son; the immortals had turned the story of the messengers to falsehood for him. And he called his neighbor, the outstanding prophet of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the highest, the truthful seer <a href=/people/468 target=_blank>Teiresias</a>. And the prophet told him and all the men what fortunes the boy would encounter: how many he would slay on land, and how many lawless monsters at sea. And he told of a certain one, [65] most hateful, who walked with crooked insolence towards men, whom the boy would send to his doom.

And there is also the satiety of men, which is grievous to encounter. But nevertheless, awaken the well-strung lyre, and take thought of wrestling; the contest for the bronze shield calls the people to the sacrifice of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> in honor of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> and to the trial of contests. There the son of Ulias, <a href=/people/6984 target=_blank>Theaeus</a>, was victorious twice, and gained forgetfulness of toils that were bravely borne. </p>                        </div>
