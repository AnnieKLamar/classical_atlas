For who at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> lacks – O if I <br />Could say it! – and I might, gazing at our grey heads, <br />And this sad life of ours, and whatever we play with <br />Now we’ve left off marbles, and smack of gravity. <br />Then, then – forgive me (I’d rather not, but how can I <br />Help it?) I’ve an impudent streak – I’d have to hoot! <br />We scribble something grand, behind closed doors, <br />One in verse, another in prose that only a generous <br />Lungful of air can exhale; it being what, combed <br />Neatly, in a white toga, wearing your birthday ring <br />Of sardonyx, you’ll read to the audience from your <br />Tall seat, while you gargle with water to rinse your <br />Fickle throat, your expressive eyes moved to tears. <br />Then you’ll watch as grown men tremble, their sober <br />Manner and tranquil voices gone, as your poetry stirs <br />Their loins, your rhythmic verse works away inside. <br />So, old man, you compose tit-bits, for others’ ears <br />To make even your decrepit skin and bones cry ‘Stop!’? <br />– Why study, if this ferment, this wild fig that has taken <br />Root within, can’t burst forth in passionate eruption? <br />– Behold, pallid decrepitude! What a way to behave! <br />Is knowledge nothing unless others know you know? <br />– But it’s lovely to be pointed out, to hear: ‘It’s him!’ <br />Is it nothing to be a text for hundreds of curly-headed lads? <br />– Look, the sated scions of <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, are no sooner asking, <br />Over the wine, what sacred poetry has to say, when he rises, <br />A hyacinth coloured cloak round his shoulders, to stammer <br />Some rancid nonsense through his nose, squeezing out <br />Songs about <a href=/people/2479 target=_blank>Phyllis</a>, <a href=/people/939 target=_blank>Hypsipyle</a>, some bardic tear-jerker, <br />Stumbling over the words on his oh-so-delicate palate. <br />The great approve: are the poet’s ashes happier now? </p>                        </div>

Not because I’m made of iron, <br />But because I refuse to consider your ‘bravo’ and ‘lovely’ <br />As the be-all and end-all of endorsement. Examine that <br />Cry of ‘lovely’ thoroughly: and what does it not embrace? <br />Isn’t the <a href=/people/12111 target=_blank>Iliad</a> there, that Iliad by <a href=/people/2292 target=_blank>Attius</a>, who gets drunk <br />On hellebore? And all those little elegies dictated by our <br />Dyspeptic lords? In short whatever’s scribbled on couches <br />Of citron-wood? You know how to serve up warm tripe, <br />Make a shivering client the gift of a second-hand cloak, <br />Then say ‘ I love the truth, tell me the truth about myself.’ <br />How can I? Do you want me to say you’re talking rubbish, <br />Baldy, you with your fat belly sticking out a foot and half? <br />O, bi-faced <a href=/people/983 target=_blank>Janus</a>, never suffering gestures behind your back; <br />Pecking storks; nor waggling hands imitating <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>donkey</a>’s ears; <br />Nor a hanging tongue like some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=person long=16.3 lat=41>Apulian</a> <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> dying of thirst! <br />But you, of patrician blood, you who must do without eyes <br />In the back of your head, come see the grimaces behind you. <br />– What’s the popular view? <br />– What indeed, but that poetry at last moves in a measured way, <br />So that the links flow smoothly through critical fingers. Bravo, <br />To the poet, who knows how to lay out a line with one eye shut, <br />As if he were stretching a plumb-line! Whether he aims to talk <br />Of morality, luxury or the banquets of kings, the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> grants <br />Him ample matter. Behold, we’re teaching people now to pen <br />Heroic sentiments who used to dabble in Greek foolishness, <br />Not artful enough to paint a grove, to praise rich countryside, <br />Its hearths, baskets, <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a>, and its burning hay at the Palilia, <br />The land of <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a>, and of <a href=/people/5559 target=_blank>Cincinnatus</a>, polishing his plough <br />In the furrow, his flustered wife dressing him as a dictator <br />In front of the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, the lictor bearing the ploughshare home! <br />Nowadays one will linger over Dionysian <a href=/people/1390 target=_blank>Accius</a>’ dry tome, <br />Others do likewise over <a href=/people/1225 target=_blank>Pacuvius</a>, and his warty <a href=/people/792 target=_blank>Antiope</a>, <br />‘Her melancholy heart besieged by troubles.’ When you see <br />Bleary-eyed fathers pouring this sort of education into <br />Their sons, need you question where the stew of language <br />On their tongues derives from, or that disgraceful rubbish <br />Your young knights on the benches exult in? Aren't you <br />Ashamed you’re unable even to defend some white-haired <br />Old client on a charge, without needing to hear that tepid <br />‘Nicely done’? They tell <a href=/people/12083 target=_blank>Pedius</a>: ‘You’re a thief!’ What <br />Does <a href=/people/12083 target=_blank>Pedius</a> reply? He frames the charge smoothly as an <br />Antithesis, and is praised for expressing it all so skilfully: <br />‘How lovely, that is!’ Lovely, that? Isn’t it mere flattery, <br />Roman? Should I be stirred, and toss a penny to every <br />Shipwrecked sailor who sings a song? Isn’t that how you <br />Sing, with a picture of you in a crushed boat, by your side? <br />Whoever wants to move me with his lament will show <br />Genuine tears, not some tale he’s drummed up overnight. <br />– Yet elegance and harmony has been added to raw measure. <br />Here’s how ‘<a about=https://topostext.org/place/355241LBer class=person long=24.094 lat=35.466>Berecynthian</a> <a href=/people/1108 target=_blank>Attis</a>’ learned to do line-endings, </p>                        </div>

Encouraged by the Camenae, the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, I <br />Offer you my heart for inspection, <a href=/people/1444 target=_blank>Cornutus</a>, my dear friend, <br />I delight in showing you just how much of my spirit is yours. <br />Strike it, you have the knowledge to discern what rings true <br />On the tongue, and what is painted plaster. Here’s where I’d <br />Ask for those hundred throats to convey in a pure voice, how <br />Deeply I’ve fixed you in the windings of my breast, and have <br />My words reveal all that lies hidden, unutterable, within me. <br />When as a timid youth I first shed that protective purple toga, <br />And my amulet hung there as an offering to the girdled <a href=/people/12089 target=_blank>Lares</a>, <br />When dressed newly in white, with pleasant companions, I <br />Dared cast my eyes over the whole <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125USub class=place long=12.4906 lat=41.8952>Subura</a> with impunity, <br />At the age when the road’s unclear, and in our ignorance of life, <br />Confusion clouds the anxious mind at the branching crossroads, <br />I placed myself in your hands. You gathered my tender years <br />To your <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socratic</a> breast, <a href=/people/1444 target=_blank>Cornutus</a>. Then, without my knowing, <br />Your skilful rule was applied, straightening my twisted path; <br />My mind assailed by reason and labouring to yield to it, thus <br />Acquired all its features, under the pressure of your thumb. <br />Indeed I recall spending long days with you, enjoying the first <br />Evening hours dining with you. We planned our work as one <br />Rested together, eased our seriousness at your modest table. <br />Don’t doubt, for an instant, that our lives, guided by a fixed <br />Bond, by a single star, move in harmony one with the other. </p>                        </div>
