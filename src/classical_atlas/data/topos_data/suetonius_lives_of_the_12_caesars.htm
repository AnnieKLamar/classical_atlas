In the next consulate, having previously been nominated priest of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, he broke his engagement with Cossutia, a lady of only equestrian rank, but very wealthy, who had been betrothed to him before he assumed the gown of manhood, and married <a href=/people/858 target=_blank>Cornelia</a>, daughter of that <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a> who was four times consul, by whom he afterwards had a daughter <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a>; and the dictator <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> could by no means force him to put away his wife. Therefore besides being punished by the loss of his priesthood, his wife's dowry, and his family inheritances, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was held to be one of the opposite party. He was accordingly forced to go into hiding, and though suffering from a severe attack of quartan ague, to change from one covert to another almost every night, and save himself from <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>'s detectives by bribes. But at last, through the good offices of the <a href=/people/12228 target=_blank>Vestal virgins</a> and of his near kinsmen, <a href=/people/1888 target=_blank>Mamercus</a> <a href=/people/116 target=_blank>Aemilius</a> and <a href=/people/11042 target=_blank>Aurelius</a> <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a>, he obtained forgiveness. Everyone knows that when <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> had long held out against the most devoted and eminent men of his party who interceded for <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and they obstinately persisted, he at last gave way and cried, either by divine inspiration or a shrewd forecast: Have your way and take him; only bear in mind that the man you are so eager to save will one day deal the death blow to the cause of the aristocracy, which you have joined with me in upholding; for in this <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> there is more than one <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>. </p>                        </div>

While crossing to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>, after the winter season had already begun, he was taken by <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> near the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373273IPha class=place long=27.086 lat=37.29>Pharmacussa</a> and remained in their custody for nearly forty days in a state of intense vexation, attended only by a single physician and two body-servants; for he had sent off his travelling companions and the rest of his attendants at the outset, to raise money for his ransom. Once he was set on shore on payment of fifty talents, he did not delay then and there to launch a fleet and pursue the departing <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>, and the moment they were in his power to inflict on them the punishment which he had often threatened when joking with them. He then proceeded to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>, but as <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> was devastating the neighboring regions, he crossed over into Asia, to avoid the appearance of inaction when the allies of the Roman people were in danger.

So <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was chosen consul with <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a>. With the same motives the optimates took care that provinces of the smallest importance should be assigned to the newly elected consuls; that is, mere woods and pastures. Thereupon <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, especially incensed by this slight, by every possible attention courted the goodwill of Gnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, who was at odds with the senate because of its tardiness in ratifying his acts after his victory over king <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> . He also patched up a peace between <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> and Marcus <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>, who had been enemies since their consulship, which had been one of constant wrangling. Then he so made a compact with both of them, that no step should be taken in public affairs which did not suit any one of the three. </p>                        </div>

He also revived a by-gone custom, that during the months when he did not have the fasces an orderly should walk before him, while the lictors followed him. He brought forward an agrarian law too, and when his colleague announced adverse omens, he resorted to arms and drove him from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a>; and when next day <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> made complaint in the senate and no one could be found who ventured to make a motion, or even to express an opinion about so high-handed a proceeding (although decrees had often been passed touching less serious breaches of the peace), <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s conduct drove him to such a pitch of desperation, that from that time until the end of his term he did not leave his house, but merely issued proclamations announcing adverse omens. <br />From that time on <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> managed all the affairs of state alone and after his own pleasure; so that sundry witty fellows, pretending by way of jest to sign and seal testamentary documents, wrote Done in the consulship of <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, instead of '<a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, writing down the same man twice, by name and by surname.

When the publicans asked for relief, he freed them from a third part of their obligation, and openly warned them in contracting for taxes in the future not to bid too recklessly. He freely granted everything else that anyone took it into his head to ask, either without opposition or by intimidating anyone who tried to object. Marcus <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, who tried to delay proceedings, was dragged from the House by a lictor at <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s command and taken off to prison. When Lucius <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> was somewhat too outspoken in his opposition, he filled him with such fear of malicious prosecution that <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> actually fell on his knees before him. Because <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, while pleading in court, deplored the state of the times, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> transferred the orator's enemy Publius <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> that very same day from the patricians to the plebeians, a thing for which <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> had for a long time been vainly striving; and that too at the ninth hour.

But seeing that everything was being pushed most persistently, and that even the consuls elect were among the opposition, he sent a written appeal to the senate, not to take from him the privilege which the people had granted, or else to compel the others in command of armies to resign also; feeling sure, it was thought, that he could more readily muster his veterans as soon as he wished, than <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> his newly levied troops. He further proposed a compromise to his opponents, that after giving up eight legions and Gallia <a href=/people/10426 target=_blank>Transalpina</a>, he be allowed to keep two legions and Gallia <a href=/people/9142 target=_blank>Cisalpina</a>, or at least one legion and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, until he was elected consul. </p>                        </div>

Now this was his excuse for the civil war, but it is believed that he had other motives. Gnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> used to declare that since <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s own means were not sufficient to complete the works which he had planned, nor to do all that he had led the people to expect on his return, he desired a state of general unrest and turmoil. Others say that he dreaded the necessity of rendering an account for what he had done in his first consulship contrary to the auspices and the laws, and regardless of vetoes; for Marcus <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> often declared, and took oath too, that he would impeach <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> the moment he had disbanded his army. It was openly said too that if he was out of office on his return, he would be obliged, like <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>, to make his defence in a court hedged about by armed men. The latter opinion is the more credible one in view of the assertion of <a href=/people/11078 target=_blank>Asinius Pollio</a>, that when <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> at the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393224UPha class=place long=22.3869 lat=39.2883>Pharsalus</a> saw his enemies slain or in flight, he said, word for word: They would have it so. Even I, Gaius <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, after so many great deeds, should have been found guilty, if I had not turned to my army for help. Some think that habit had given him a love of power, and that weighing the strength of his adversaries against his own, he grasped the opportunity of usurping the despotism which had been his heart's desire from early youth. <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> too was seemingly of this opinion, when he wrote in the third book of his De <a href=/people/6717 target=_blank>Officiis</a> that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> ever had upon his lips these lines of <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, of which <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> himself adds a version: <br />'If wrong may e'er be right, for a throne's sake <br />Were wrong most right: — -be God in all else feared.' </p>                        </div>

He shared the elections with the people on this basis: that except in the case of the consulship, half of the magistrates should be appointed by the people's choice, while the rest should be those whom he had personally nominated.

He is said to have delivered himself in a high-pitched voice with impassioned action and gestures, which were not without grace. He left several speeches, including some which are attributed to him on insufficient evidence. <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> had good reason to think that the speech Pro Quintus <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> was rather taken down by shorthand writers who could not keep pace with his delivery, than published by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself; for in some copies I find that even the title is not Pro <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, but, Quam scripsit Metello although the discourse purports to be from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s lips, defending <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> and himself against the charges of their common detractors. <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> also questions the authenticity of the address Apud milites quoque in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390000RIbe class=place long=-4 lat=39>Hispania</a>, although there are two sections of it, one purporting to have been spoken at the first battle, the other at the second when <a href=/people/11078 target=_blank>Asinius Pollio</a> writes that because of the sudden onslaught of the enemy, he actually did not have time to make an harangue. </p>                        </div>

With regard to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s memoirs <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, also in the <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> speaks in the following terms: He wrote memoirs which deserve the highest praise; they are naked in their simplicity, straightforward yet graceful, stripped of all rhetorical adornment, as of a garment; but while his purpose was to supply material to others, on which those who wished to write history might draw, he haply gratified silly folk, who will try to use the curling-irons on his narrative, but he has kept men of any sense from touching the subject. Of these same memoirs <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> uses this emphatic language: They are so highly rated in the judgment of all men, that he seems to have deprived writers of an opportunity, rather than given them one; yet our admiration for this feat is greater than that of others; for they know how well and faultlessly he wrote, while we know besides how easily and rapidly he finished his task. <a href=/people/11078 target=_blank>Asinius Pollio</a> thinks that they were put together somewhat carelessly and without strict regard for truth; since in many cases <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was too ready to believe the accounts which others gave of their actions, and gave a perverted account of his own, either designedly or perhaps from forgetfulness; and he thinks that he intended to rewrite and revise them. He left besides a work in two volumes De Analogia, the same number of Anti-Catones, in addition to a poem, entitled Iter. He wrote the first of these works while crossing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> and returning to his army from Gallia <a href=/people/6364 target=_blank>Citerior</a>, where he heard lawsuits; the second about the time of the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374000UMun class=place long=-5.196 lat=37.376>Munda</a>, and the third in the course of a twenty-four days' journey from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390000RIbe class=place long=-4 lat=39>Hispania</a> Ulterior. Some letters of his to the senate are also preserved, and he seems to have been the first to reduce such documents to pages and the form of a note-book, whereas previously consuls and generals sent their reports written right across the sheet. There are also letters of his to <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, as well as to his intimates on private affairs, and in the latter, if he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet, that not a word could be made out. If anyone wishes to decipher these, and get at their meaning, he must substitute the fourth letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and so with the others. We also have mention of certain writings of his boyhood and early youth, such as the Laudes <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372000IHer class=place long=-6.9452 lat=37.1892>Herculis</a>, a tragedy <a href=/people/173 target=_blank>Oedipus</a>, and a Dicta Collectanea; but <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> forbade the publication of all these minor works in a very brief and frank letter sent to <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> Macer, whom he had selected to set his libraries in order. </p>                        </div>

Throughout the long struggle not one deserted and many of them, on being taken prisoner, refused to accept their lives, when offered them on the condition of consenting to serve against <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>.

Indeed one cohort of the sixth legion, when set to defend a redoubt, kept four legions of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> at bay for several hours, though almost all were wounded by the enemy's showers of arrows, of which a hundred and thirty thousand were picked up within the ramparts.

For not only did he accept excessive honors, such as an uninterrupted consulship, the dictatorship for life, and the censorship of public morals, as well as the forename Imperator, the surname of Pater <a href=/people/10010 target=_blank>Patriae</a>, a statue among those of the kings, and a raised couch in the orchestra; but he also allowed honors to be bestowed on him which were too great for mortal man: a golden throne in the Senate and on the judgment seat; a chariot and litter in the procession at the circus; temples, altars, and statues beside those of the gods; a special priest, an additional college of the <a href=/people/12178 target=_blank>Luperci</a>, and the calling of one of the months by his name. In fact, there were no honors which he did not receive or confer at pleasure. He held his third and fourth consulships in name only, content with the power of the dictatorship conferred on him at the same time as the consulships. Moreover, in both years he substituted two consuls for himself for the last three months, in the meantime holding no elections except for tribunes and plebeian aediles, and appointing praefects instead of the praetors, to manage the affairs of the city during his absence. When one of the consuls suddenly died the day before the Kalends of January, he gave the vacant office for a few hours to a man who asked for it. With the same disregard of law and precedent he named magistrates for several years to come, bestowed the emblems of consular rank on ten ex-praetors, and admitted to the Senate men who had been given citizenship, and in some cases half-civilized Gauls. He assigned the charge of the mint and of the public revenues to his own slaves, and gave the oversight and command of the three legions which he had left at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> to a favorite of his called Rufo, son of one of his freedmen. </p>                        </div>

Therefore the plots which had previously been formed separately, often by groups of two or three, were united in a general conspiracy, since even the populace no longer were pleased with present conditions, but both secretly and openly rebelled at his tyranny and cried out for defenders of their liberty. On the admission of foreigners to the Senate, a placard was posted: God bless the Republic! let no one consent to point out the Senate to a newly made senator. The following verses too were sung everwhere: — - <br />'<a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> led the Gauls in triumph, led them to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate house</a>; <br />Then the Gauls put off their breeches, and put on the latus clavus. <br />When Quintus <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, whom he had appointed consul in his place for three months, was entering the theater, and his lictor called attention to his arrival in the usual manner, a general shout was raised: He's no consul! At the first election after the deposing of <a href=/people/4460 target=_blank>Caesetius</a> and <a href=/people/3883 target=_blank>Marullus</a>, the tribunes, several votes were found for their appointment as consuls.

A few months before, when the settlers assigned to the colony at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> by the <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a> Law were demolishing some tombs of great antiquity, to build country houses, and plied their work with the greater vigor because as they rummaged about they found a quantity of vases of ancient workmanship, there was discovered in a tomb, which was said to be that of <a href=/people/1378 target=_blank>Capys</a>, the founder of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>, a bronze tablet, inscribed with Greek words and characters to this purport: Whenever the bones of <a href=/people/1378 target=_blank>Capys</a> shall be moved, it will come to pass that a son of Ilium shall be slain at the hands of his kindred, and presently avenged at heavy cost to Italia. And let no one think this tale a myth or a lie, for it is vouched for by <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>, an intimate friend of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. Shortly before his death, as he was told, the herds of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> which he had dedicated to the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442124WRub class=place long=12.43012 lat=44.16308>Rubicon</a> when he crossed it, and had let loose without a keeper, stubbornly refused to graze and wept copiously. Again, when he was offering sacrifice, the soothsayer <a href=/people/2789 target=_blank>Spurinna</a> warned him to beware of danger, which would come not later than the Ides of March; and on the day before the Ides of that month a little bird called the king-bird flew into the Curia of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> with a sprig of laurel, pursued by others of various kinds from the grove hard by, which tore it to pieces in the hall. In fact the very night before his murder he dreamt now that he was flying above the clouds, and now that he was clasping the hand of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>; and his wife <a href=/people/2393 target=_blank>Calpurnia</a> thought that the pediment of their house fell, and that her husband was stabbed in her arms; and on a sudden the door of the room flew open of its own accord. Both for these reasons and because of poor health he hesitated for a long time whether to stay at home and put off what he had planned to do in the senate; but at last, urged by <a href=/people/11075 target=_blank>Decimus Brutus</a> not to disappoint the full meeting which had for some time been waiting for him, he went forth almost at the end of the fifth hour; and when a note revealing the plot was handed him by someone on the way, he put it with others which he held in his left hand, intending to read them presently. Then, after several victims had been slain, and he could not get favorable omens, he entered the Senate in defiance of portents, laughing at <a href=/people/2789 target=_blank>Spurinna</a> and calling him a false prophet, because the Ides of March were come without bringing him harm; though <a href=/people/2789 target=_blank>Spurinna</a> replied that they had of a truth come, but they had not gone. </p>                        </div>

When he saw that he was beset on every side by drawn daggers, he muffled his head in his robe, and at the same time drew down its lap to his feet with his left hand, in order to fall more decently, with the lower part of his body also covered.

When his uncle presently went to Spain to engage the sons of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, although <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> had hardly yet recovered his strength after a severe illness, he followed over roads beset by the enemy with only a very few companions, and that too after suffering shipwreck, and thereby greatly endeared himself to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, who soon formed a high opinion of his character over and above the energy with which he had made the journey. When <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, after recovering the Spanish provinces, planned an expedition against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=ethnic long=25 lat=44.5>Dacians</a> and then against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, who had been sent on in advance to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407195PApo class=place long=19.4727 lat=40.7215>Apollonia</a>, devoted his leisure to study. As soon as he learned that his uncle had been slain and that he was his heir, he was in doubt for some time whether to appeal to the nearest legions, but gave up the idea as hasty and premature. He did, however, return to the city and enter upon his inheritance, in spite of the doubts of his mother and the strong opposition of his stepfather, the ex-consul <a href=/people/10971 target=_blank>Marcius</a> <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a>. Then he levied armies and henceforth ruled the State, at first with Marcus <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> and Marcus <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>, then with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> alone for nearly twelve years, and finally by himself for forty-four. </p>                        </div>

Furthermore, since those who had been appointed to celebrate <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s victory by games did not dare to do so, he gave them himself. To be able to carry out his other plans with more authority, he announced his candidature for the position of one of the tribunes of the people, who happened to die; though he was a patrician, and not yet a senator. But when his designs were opposed by Marcus <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, who was then consul, and on whose help he had especially counted, and <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> would not allow him even common and ordinary justice without the promise of a heavy bribe, he went over to the aristocrats, who he knew detested <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, especially because he was besieging <a href=/people/11075 target=_blank>Decimus Brutus</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/446109UMut class=place long=10.925 lat=44.6472>Mutina</a>, and trying to drive him by force of arms from the province given him by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and ratified by the Senate. Accordingly, at the advice of certain men, he hired assassins to kill <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, and when the plot was discovered, fearing retaliation he mustered veterans, by the use of all the money he could command, both for his own protection and that of the State. Put in command of the army which he had raised, with the rank of propraetor, and bidden to join with <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> and <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a>, who had become consuls, in lending aid to <a href=/people/11075 target=_blank>Decimus Brutus</a>, he finished the war which had been entrusted to him within three months in two battles. In the former of these, so <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> writes, he took to flight and was not seen again until the next day, when he returned without his cloak and his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>; but in that which followed all agree that he played the part not only of a leader, but of a soldier as well, and that, in the thick of the fight, when the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>-bearer of his legion was sorely wounded, he shouldered the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> and carried it for some time. </p>                        </div>

In both places a part of his galleys were sunk, while the rigging of the ship in which he was sailing was carried away and its rudder broken. He delayed at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> only twenty-seven days — just long enough to satisfy all the demands of the soldiers — and then went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> by a roundabout way through Asia and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, laid siege to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, where <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> had taken refuge with <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, and soon took the city. Although <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> tried to make terms at the eleventh hour, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> forced him to commit suicide, and viewed his corpse. He greatly desired to save <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> alive for his triumph, and even had <a href=/people/6861 target=_blank>Psylli</a> brought to her, to suck the poison from her wound, since it was thought that she died from the bite of an <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>asp</a>. He allowed them both the honour of burial, and in the same tomb, giving orders that the mausoleum which they had begun should be finished. The young <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, the elder of <a href=/people/821 target=_blank>Fulvia</a>'s two sons, he dragged from the image of the Deified <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Julius</a>, to which he had fled after many vain entreaties, and slew him. <a href=/people/3355 target=_blank>Caesarion</a>, too, whom <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> fathered on <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, he overtook in his flight, brought back, and put to death. But he spared the rest of the offspring of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> and <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, and afterwards maintained and reared them according to their several positions, as carefully as if they were his own kin. </p>                        </div>

He dismissed the entire tenth legion in disgrace, because they were insubordinate, and others, too, that demanded their discharge in an insolent fashion, he disbanded without the rewards which would have been due for faithful service. If any cohorts gave way in battle, he decimated them, and fed the rest on barley.

Except as a fire-brigade at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and when there was fear of riots in times of scarcity, he employed freedmen as soldiers only twice: once as a guard for the colonies in the vicinity of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, and again to defend the bank of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>; even these he levied, when they were slaves, from men and women of means and at once gave them freedom; and he kept them under their original standard, not mingling them with the soldiers of free birth or arming them in the same fashion. As military prizes he was somewhat more ready to give trappings or collars, valuable for their gold and silver, than crowns for scaling ramparts or walls, which conferred high honour; the latter he gave as sparingly as possible and without favouritism, often even to the common soldiers.

Those who had celebrated triumphs were the only ones whom he thought ineligible for prizes, even though they had been the companions of his campaigns and shared in his victories, on the ground that they themselves had the privilege of bestowing such honours wherever they wished. He thought nothing less becoming in a well-trained leader than haste and rashness, and, accordingly, favourite sayings of his were: More haste, less speed; Better a safe commander than a bold; and That is done quickly enough which is done well enough. He used to say that a war or a battle should not be begun under any circumstances, unless the hope of gain was clearly greater than the fear of loss; for he likened such as grasped at slight gains with no slight risk to those who fished with a golden hook, the loss of which, if it were carried off, could not be made good by any catch. </p>                        </div>

He usurped the consulship in the twentieth year of his age, leading his legions against the city as if it were that of an enemy, and sending messengers to demand the office for him in the name of his army; and when the Senate hesitated, his centurion, <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a>, leader of the deputation, throwing back his cloak and showing the hilt of his sword, did not hesitate to say in the House, This will make him consul, if you do not. He held his second consulship nine years later; the rest up to the eleventh were in successive years, then after declining a number of terms that were offered him, he asked of his own accord for a twelfth after a long interval, no less than seventeen years, wishing to hold the highest magistracy at the time when he introduced each of his sons Gaius and Lucius to public life upon their coming of age. The five consulships from the sixth to the tenth he held for the full year, the rest for nine, six, four, or three months, except the second, which lasted only a few hours; for after sitting for a short time on the curule chair in front of the temple of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=person long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitolinus</a> in the early morning, he resigned the honour on the Kalends of January and appointed another in his place.

For while they could oftentimes be moved by personal influence and entreaties, he alone was most insistent that no one should be spared, even adding to the list his guardian Gaius <a href=/people/8441 target=_blank>Toranius</a>, who had also been the colleague of his father <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a> in the aedileship. <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> <a href=/people/758 target=_blank>Saturninus</a> adds that after the proscription was over Marcus <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> addressed the Senate in justification of the past and held out hope of leniency thereafter, since enough punishment had been inflicted; but that <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> on the contrary declared that he had consented to end the proscription only on condition that he was allowed a free hand for the future. However, to show his regret for this inflexibility, he later honoured Titus <a href=/people/6048 target=_blank>Vinius</a> <a href=/people/184 target=_blank>Philopoemen</a> with equestrian rank, because it was said that he had hidden his patron, who was on the list. While he was triumvir, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> incurred general detestation by many of his acts. For example, when he was addressing the soldiers and a throng of civilians had been admitted to the assembly, noticing that Pinalius, a Roman knight, was taking notes, he ordered that he be stabbed on the spot, thinking him an eavesdropper and a spy. Because Tedius <a href=/people/2826 target=_blank>Afer</a>, consul elect, railed at some act of his in spiteful terms, he uttered such terrible threats that <a href=/people/2826 target=_blank>Afer</a> committed suicide. Again, when Quintus <a href=/people/3393 target=_blank>Gallius</a>, a praetor, held some folded tablets under his robe as he was paying his respects, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, suspecting that he had a sword concealed there, did not dare to make a search on the spot for fear it should turn out to be something else; but a little later he had <a href=/people/3393 target=_blank>Gallius</a> hustled from the tribunal by some centurions and soldiers, tortured him as if he were a slave, and though he made no confession, ordered his execution, first tearing out the man's eyes with his own hand. He himself writes, however, that <a href=/people/3393 target=_blank>Gallius</a> made a treacherous attack on him after asking for an audience, and was haled to prison; and that after he was dismissed under sentence of banishment, he either lost his life by shipwreck or was waylaid by brigands. He received the tribunician power for life, and once or twice chose a colleague in the office for periods of five years each. He was also given the supervision of morals and of the laws for all time, and by the virtue of this position, although without the title of censor, he nevertheless took the census thrice, the first and last time with a colleague, the second time alone. </p>                        </div>

Reflecting, however, that as he himself would not be free from danger if he should retire, so too it would be hazardous to trust the State to the control of more than one, he continued to keep it in his hands; and it is not easy to say whether his intentions or their results were the better. His good intentions he not only expressed from time to time, but put them on record as well in an edict in the following words: May it be my privilege to establish the State in a firm and secure position, and reap from that act the fruit that I desire; but only if I may be called the author of the best possible government, and bear with me the hope when I die that the foundations which I have laid for the State will remain unshaken. And he realized his hope by making every effort to prevent any dissatisfaction with the new regime. Since the city was not adorned as the dignity of the empire demanded, and was exposed to flood and fire, he so beautified it that he could justly boast that he had found it built of brick and left it in marble. He made it safe too for the future, so far as human foresight could provide for this. </p>                        </div>

His reason for building the forum was the increase in the number of the people and of cases at law, which seemed to call for a third forum, since two were no longer adequate. Therefore it was opened to the public with some haste, before the temple of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> was finished, and it was provided that the public prosecutions be held there apart from the rest, as well as the selection of jurors by lot. He had made a vow to build the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SMUl class=place long=12.4869 lat=41.8942>temple</a> of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> in the war of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410243PPhi class=place long=24.285 lat=41.012>Philippi</a>, which he undertook to avenge his father; accordingly he decreed that in it the Senate should consider wars and claims for triumphs, from it those who were on their way to the provinces with military commands should be escorted, and to it victors on their return should bear the tokens of their triumphs. He reared the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SApP class=place long=12.4855 lat=41.8891>temple</a> of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> in that part of his house on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LPal class=place long=12.4884 lat=41.8896>Palatine</a> for which the soothsayers declared that the god had shown his desire by striking it with lightning. He joined to it colonnades with Latin and Greek libraries, and when he was getting to be an old man he often held meetings of the Senate there as well, and revised the lists of jurors. He dedicated the shrine to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> the Thunderer because of a narrow escape; for on his <a href=/people/12072 target=_blank>Cantabrian</a> expedition during a march by night, a flash of lightning grazed his litter and struck the slave dead who was carrying a torch before him. He constructed some works too in the name of others, his grandsons and nephew to wit, his wife and his sister, such as the colonnade and basilica of Gaius and Lucius, also the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BPOc class=place long=12.4785 lat=41.8924>colonnades</a> of <a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a> and <a href=/people/722 target=_blank>Octavia</a>. More than that, he often urged other prominent men to adorn the city with new monuments or to restore and embellish old ones, each according to his means.

He increased the number and importance of the priests, and also their allowances and privileges, in particular those of the <a href=/people/12228 target=_blank>Vestal virgins</a>. Moreover, when there was occasion to choose another vestal in place of one who had died, and many used all their influence to avoid submitting their daughters to the hazard of the lot, he solemnly swore that if anyone of his grand-daughters were of eligible age, he would have proposed her name. He also revived some of the ancient rites which had gradually fallen into disuse, such as the augury of <a href=/people/2936 target=_blank>Safety</a>, the office of <a href=/people/2224 target=_blank>Flamen Dialis</a>, the ceremonies of the <a href=/people/12178 target=_blank>Lupercalia</a>, the Secular Games, and the festival of the <a href=/people/4494 target=_blank>Compitalia</a>.

He provided that the <a href=/people/12089 target=_blank>Lares</a> of the Crossroads should be crowned twice a year, with spring and summer flowers. Next to the immortal Gods he honoured the memory of the leaders who had raised the estate of the Roman people from obscurity to greatness. Accordingly he restored the works of such men with their original inscriptions, and in the two colonnades of his forum dedicated statues of all of them in triumphal garb, declaring besides in a proclamation: I have contrived this to lead the citizens to require me, while I live, and the rulers of later times as well, to attain the standard set by those worthies of old. He also moved the statue of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> from the hall in which Gaius <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had been slain and placed it on a marble arch opposite the grand door of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>' theater. </p>                        </div>

Therefore to put a stop to brigandage, he stationed guards of soldiers wherever it seemed advisable, inspected the workhouses, and disbanded all guilds, except such as were of long standing and formed for legitimate purposes. He burned the records of old debts to the treasury, which were by far the most frequent source of blackmail. He made over to their holders places in the city to which the claim of the state was uncertain. He struck off the lists the names of those who had long been under accusation, from whose humiliation nothing was to be gained except the gratification of their enemies, with the stipulation that if anyone was minded to renew the charge, he should be liable to the same penalty. To prevent any action for damages or on a disputed claim from falling through or being put off, he added to the term of the courts thirty more days, which had before been taken up with honorary games. To the three divisions of jurors he added a fourth of a lower estate, to be called ducenarii, and to sit on cases involving trifling amounts. He enrolled as jurors men of thirty years or more, that is five years younger than usual.

Again, in a case touching a forged will, in which all the signers were liable to punishment by the Cornelian Law, he distributed to the jury not merely the two tablets for condemnation or acquittal, but a third as well, for the pardon of those who were shown to have been induced to sign by misrepresentation or misunderstanding.

On the latter occasion it is thought that he wore a coat of mail under his tunic as he presided, and a sword by his side, while ten of the most robust of his friends among the Senators stood by his chair. <a href=/people/4943 target=_blank>Cremutius</a> <a href=/people/6382 target=_blank>Cordus</a> writes that even then the Senators were not allowed to approach except one by one, and after the folds of their robes had been carefully searched. Some he shamed into resigning, but he allowed even these to retain their distinctive dress, as well as the privilege of viewing the games from the orchestra and taking part in the public banquets of the order. Furthermore, that those who were chosen and approved might perform their duties more conscientiously, and also with less inconvenience, he provided that before taking his seat each member should offer incense and wine at the altar of the god in whose temple the meeting was held; that regular meetings of the Senate should be held not oftener than twice a month, on the Kalends and the Ides; and that in the months of September and October only those should be obliged to attend who were drawn by lot, to a number sufficient for the passing of decrees. He also adopted the plan of privy councils chosen by lot for terms of six months, with which to discuss in advance matters which were to come before the entire body. On questions of special importance he called upon the Senators to give their opinions, not according to the order established by precedent, but just as he fancied, to induce each man to keep his mind on the alert, as if he were to initiate action rather than give assent to others. </p>                        </div>

He reviewed the companies of knights at frequent intervals, reviving the custom of the procession after long disuse. But he would not allow an accuser to force anyone to dismount as he rode by, as was often done in the past; and he permitted those who were conspicuous because of old age or any bodily infirmity to send on their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> in the review, and come on foot to answer to their names whenever they were summoned.

Moreover, since many knights whose property was diminished during the civil wars did not venture to view the games from the fourteen rows through fear of the penalty of the law regarding theatres, he declared that none were liable to its provisions, if they themselves or their parents had ever possessed a knight's estate. He revised the lists of the people district by district, and to prevent the commons from being called away from their occupations too often because of the distributions of grain, he determined to give out tickets for four months' supply three times a year; but at their urgent request he allowed a return to the old custom of receiving a share every month. He also revived the old time election privileges, trying to put a stop to bribery by numerous penalties, and distributing to his fellow members of the Fabian and Scaptian tribes a thousand sesterces a man from his own purse on the day of the elections, to keep them from looking for anything from any of the candidates. Considering it also of great importance to keep the people pure and unsullied by any taint of foreign or servile blood, he was most chary of conferring Roman citizenship and set a limit to manumission. When <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> requested citizenship for a Grecian dependent of his, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> wrote in reply that he would not grant it unless the man appeared in person and convinced him that he had reasonable grounds for the request; and when <a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a> asked it for a Gaul from a tributary province, he refused, offering instead freedom from tribute, and declaring that he would more willingly suffer a loss to his privy purse than the prostitution of the honour of Roman citizenship. Not content with making it difficult for slaves to acquire freedom, and still more so for them to attain full rights, by making careful provision as to the number, condition, and status of those who were manumitted, he added the proviso that no one who had ever been put in irons or tortured should acquire citizenship by any grade of freedom. <br />He desired also to revive the ancient fashion of dress, and once when he saw in an assembly a throng of men in dark cloaks, he cried out indignantly, Behold them Romans, lords of the world, the nation clad in the toga,, and he directed the aediles never again to allow anyone to appear in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a> or its neighbourhood except in the toga and without a cloak. </p>                        </div>

He increased the property qualification for Senators, requiring one million two hundred thousand sesterces, instead of eight hundred thousand, and making up the amount for those who did not possess it. He often gave largess to the people, but usually of different sums: now four hundred, now three hundred, now two hundred and fifty sesterces a man; and he did not even exclude young boys, though it had been usually for them to receive a share only after the age of eleven.

Again, when the people demanded largess which he had in fact promised, he replied: I am a man of my word; but when they called for one which had not been promised, he rebuked them in a proclamation for their shameless impudence, and declared that he would not give it, even though he was intending to do so. With equal dignity and firmness, when he had announced a distribution of money and found that many had been manumitted and added to the list of citizens, he declared that those to whom no promise had been made should receive nothing, and gave the rest less than he had promised, to make the appointed sum suffice. Once indeed in a time of great scarcity when it was difficult to find a remedy, he expelled from the city the slaves that were for sale, as well as the schools of gladiators, all foreigners with the exception of physicians and teachers, and a part of the household slaves; and when grain at last became more plentiful, he writes: I was strongly inclined to do away forever with distributions of grain, because through dependence on them agriculture was neglected; but I did not carry out my purpose, feeling sure that they would one day be renewed through desire for popular favor.

He gave them sometimes in all the wards and on many stages with actors in all languages, and combats of gladiators not only in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a> or the amphitheatre, but in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCiM class=place long=12.4871 lat=41.8852>Circus</a> and in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BSJu class=place long=12.4773 lat=41.8984>Saepta</a>; sometimes, however, he gave nothing except a fight with wild beasts. He gave athletic contests too in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCMa class=place long=12.481 lat=41.905>Campus Martius</a>, erecting wooden seats; also a seafight, constructing an artificial lake near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, where the grove of the Caesars now stands.

In the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCiM class=place long=12.4871 lat=41.8852>Circus</a> he exhibited charioteers, rumlers, and slayers of wild animals, who were sometimes young men of the highest rank. Besides he gave frequent performances of the game of Troya by older and younger boys, thinking it a time-honoured and worthy custom for the flower of the nobility to become known in this way. When <a href=/people/2174 target=_blank>Nonius</a> <a href=/people/2998 target=_blank>Asprenas</a> was lamed by a fall while taking part in this game, he presented him with a golden necklace and allowed him and his descendants to bear the surname <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>.

He sometimes employed even Roman knights in scenic and gladiatorial performances, but only before it was forbidden by decree of the Senate. After that he exhibited no one of respectable parentage, with the exception of a young man named <a href=/people/1750 target=_blank>Lycius</a>, whom he showed merely as a curiosity; for he was less than two feet tall, weighed but seventeen pounds, yet had a stentorian voice. He did however on the day of one of the shows make a display of the first <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> hostages that had ever been sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, by leading them through the middle of the arena and placing them in the second row above his own seat. Furthermore, if anything rare and worth seeing was ever brought to the city, it was his habit to make a special exhibit of it in any convenient place on days when no shows were appointed. For example a rhinoceros in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BSJu class=place long=12.4773 lat=41.8984>Saepta</a>, a tiger on the stage and a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> of fifty cubits in front of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCmt class=place long=12.4849 lat=41.8926>Comitium</a>.

He was sometimes absent for several hours, and now and then for whole days, making his excuses and appointing presiding officers to take his place. But whenever he was present, he gave his entire attention to the performance, either to avoid the censure to which he realized that his father <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had been generally exposed, because he spent his time in reading or answering letters and petitions; or from his interest and pleasure in the spectacle, which he never denied but often frankly confessed. Because of this he used to offer special prizes and numerous valuable gifts from his own purse at games given by others, and he appeared at no contest in the Grecian fashion without making a present to each of the participants according to his deserts. He was especially given to watching boxers, particularly those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> birth, not merely such as were recognized and classed as professionals, whom he was wont to match even with Greeks, but the common untrained townspeople that fought rough and tumble and without skill in the narrow streets.

To enable what was going on in each of the provinces to be reported and known more speedily and promptly, he at first stationed young men at short intervals along the military roads, and afterwards post-chaises.

He bore the death of his kin with far more resignation than their misconduct. For he was not greatly broken by the fate of Gaius and Lucius, but he informed the Senate of his daughter's fall through a letter read in his absence by a quaestor, and for very shame would meet no one for a long time, and even thought of putting her to death. At all events, when one of her confidantes, a freedwoman called <a href=/people/1280 target=_blank>Phoebe</a>, hanged herself at about that same time, he said: I would rather have been <a href=/people/1280 target=_blank>Phoebe</a>'s father. After <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a> was banished, he denied her the use of wine and every form of luxury, and would not allow any man, bond or free, to come near her without his permission, and then not without being informed of his stature, complexion, and even of any marks or scars upon his body. It was not until five years later that he moved her from the island to the mainland and treated her with somewhat less rigour. But he could not by any means be prevailed on to recall her altogether, and when the Roman people several times interceded for her and urgently pressed their suit, he in open assembly called upon the gods to curse them with like daughters and like wives. He would not allow the child born to his granddaughter <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a> after her sentence to be recognized or reared. As <a href=/people/7188 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> grew no more manageable, but on the contrary became madder from day to day, he transferred him to an island and set a guard of soldiers over him besides. He also provided by a decree of the Senate that he should be confined there for all time, and at every mention of him and of the <a href=/people/3193 target=_blank>Julias</a> he would sigh deeply and even cry out: Would that I ne'er had wedded and would I had died without offspring ; and he never alluded to them except as his three boils and his three ulcers. </p>                        </div>

The former he handed over to the Senate that it might condemn him to death, because he was plotting revolution; the latter he forbade his house and the privilege of residence in the imperial provinces because of his ungrateful and envious spirit. But when <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a> too was forced to undergo death through the declarations of his accusers and the decrees of the Senate, though commending their loyalty and their indignation on his account, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> yet shed tears and bewailed his lot, because he alone could not set what limits he chose to his anger with his friends. All the rest continued to enjoy power and wealth to the end of their lives, each holding a leading place in his own class, although sometimes differences arose. Not to mention the others, he occasionally found <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> lacking in patience and <a href=/people/1293 target=_blank>Maecenas</a> in the gift of silence; for the former because of a slight suspicion of coolness and of a preference shewn for <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>, threw up everything and went off to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391265PMyt class=place long=26.5621 lat=39.1114>Mytilene</a>, while the latter betrayed to his wife <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> the secret of the discovery of the conspiracy of <a href=/people/12001 target=_blank>Murena</a>. In return he demanded of his friends affection on their part, both in life and after death. For though he was in no sense a legacy-hunter, and in fact could never bring himself to accept anything from the will of a stranger, yet he was highly sensitive in weighing the death-bed utterances of his friends, concealing neither his chagrin if he was left a niggardly bequest or one unaccompanied with compliments, nor his satisfaction, if he was praised in terms of gratitude and affection. Whenever legacies or shares in inheritances were left him by men of any station who had offspring, he either turned them over to the children at once, or if the latter were in their minority, paid the money back with interest on the day when they assumed the gown of manhood or married. </p>                        </div>

At this the guests appeared in the guise of gods and goddesses, while he himself was made up to represent <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, as was charged not merely in letters of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, who spitefully gives the names of all the guests, but also in these anonymous lines, which everyone knows: As soon as that table of rascals had secured a choragus, and Mallia saw six gods and six goddesses, while <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a> impiously plays the false role of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> and feasts amid novel debaucheries of the gods; then all the deities turned their faces from the earth and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> himself fled from his golden throne. The scandal of this banquet was the greater because of dearth and famine in the land at the time, and on the following day there was an outcry that the gods had eaten all the grain and that <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was in truth <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, but <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> the Tormentor, a surname under which the god was worshipped in one part of the city. He was criticized too as over fond of costly furniture and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a> bronzes and as given to gaming. Indeed, as early as the time of the proscriptions there was written on his statue — — In silver once my father dealt, now in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=ethnic long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthians</a> I, since it was believed that he caused some men to be entered in the list of the proscribed because of their <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a> vases. Later, during the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> war, this epigram was current: After he has twice been beaten at sea and lost his ships, he plays at dice all the time, in the hope of winning one victory. </p>                        </div>

He could not dispose of the charge of lustfulness and they say that even in his later years he was fond of deflowering maidens, who were brought together for him from all quarters, even by his own wife. He did not in the least shrink from a reputation for gaming, and played frankly and openly for recreation, even when he was well on in years, not only in the month of December, but on other holidays as well, and on working days too. There is no question about this, for in a letter in his own handwriting he says: I dined, dear <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, with the same company; we had besides as guests <a href=/people/4740 target=_blank>Vinicius</a> and the elder <a href=/people/1117 target=_blank>Silius</a>. We gambled like old men during the meal both yesterday and today; for when the dice were thrown, whoever turned up the '<a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>' or the six, put a denarius in the pool for each one of the dice, and the whole was taken by anyone who threw the '<a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>' . Again in another letter: We spent the Quinquatria very merrily, my dear <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, for we played all day long and kept the gaming-board warm. Your brother made a great outcry about his luck, but after all did not come out far behind in the long run; for after losing heavily, he unexpectedly and little by little got back a good deal. For my part, I lost twenty thousand sesterces, but because I was extravagantly generous in my play, as usual. If I had demanded of everyone the stakes which I let go, or had kept all that I gave away, I should have won fully fifty thousand. But I like that better, for my generosity will exalt me to immortal glory. To his daughter he writes: I send you two hundred and fifty denarii, the sum which I gave each of my guests, in case they wished to play at dice or at odd and even during the dinner. </p>                        </div>

He lived at first near the Forum <a href=/people/2016 target=_blank>Romanum</a>, above the Stairs of the Ringmakers, in a house which had belonged to the orator <a href=/people/1937 target=_blank>Calvus</a>; afterwards, on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LPal class=place long=12.4884 lat=41.8896>Palatine</a>, but in the no less modest dwelling of <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>, which was remarkable neither for size nor elegance, having but short colonnades with columns of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=demonym long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alban</a> stone, and rooms without any marble decorations or handsome pavements. For more than forty years too he used the same bedroom in winter and summer; although he found the city unfavourable to his health in the winter, yet continued to winter there. If ever he planned to do anything in private or without interruption, he had a retired place at the top of the house, which he called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracusa</a> and technyphion . In this he used to take refuge, or else in the villa of one of his freedmen in the suburbs; but whenever he was not well, he slept at <a href=/people/1293 target=_blank>Maecenas</a>' house. For retirement he went most frequently to places by the sea and the islands of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>, or to the towns near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, such as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127ULan class=place long=12.6989 lat=41.6777>Lanuvium</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418129UPra class=place long=12.8924 lat=41.8399>Praeneste</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a>, where he very often held court in the colonnades of the Temple of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>. He disliked large and sumptuous country palaces, actually razing to the ground one which his granddaughter <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a> built on a lavish scale. His own villas, which were modest enough, he decorated not so much with handsome statues and pictures as with terraces, groves, and objects noteworthy for their antiquity and rarity; for example, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406143ICap class=place long=14.2623 lat=40.5579>Capreae</a> the monstrous bones of huge sea monsters and wild beasts, called the bones of the giants, and the weapons of the heroes. </p>                        </div>

He would sometimes come to table late on these occasions and leave early, allowing his guests to begin to dine before he took his place and keep their places after he went out. He served a dinner of three courses or of six when he was most lavish, without needless extravagance but with the greatest goodfellowship.

He used also at a dinner party to put up for auction lottery-tickets for articles of most unequal value, and paintings of which only the back was shown, thus by the caprice of fortune disappointing or filling to the full the expectations of the purchasers, requiring however that all the guests should take part in the bidding and share the loss or gain. </p>                        </div>

Yet in spite of all he made good his weakness by great care, especially by moderation in bathing; for as a rule he was anointed or took a sweat by a fire, after which he was doused with water either lukewarm or tepid from long exposure to the sun. When however he had to use hot salt water and sulphur baths for rheumatism, he contented himself with sitting on a wooden bath-seat, which he called by the Spanish name dureta, and plunging his hands and feet in the water one after the other. </p>                        </div>

With this end in view, to avoid confusing and checking his reader or hearer at any point, he did not hesitate to use prepositions with names of cities, nor to repeat conjunctions several times, the omission of which causes some obscurity, though it adds grace. He looked on innovators and archaizers with equal contempt, as faulty in opposite directions, and he sometimes had a fling at them, in particular his friend <a href=/people/1293 target=_blank>Maecenas</a>, whose unguent-dripping curls, as he calls them, he loses no opportunity of belabouring and pokes fun at them by parody.

He continually used baceolus (dolt) for stultus (fool), for pullus (dark) pulleiaceus (darkish), and for cerritus (mad) vacerrosus (blockhead); also vapide se habere (feel flat) for male se habere (feel badly), and betizaree (be like a beet) for languere (be weak), for which the vulgar term is lachanizare. Besides he used simus for sumus and domos in the genitive singular instead of domuos. The last two forms he wrote invariably, for fear they should be thought errors rather than a habit. I have also observed this special peculiarity in his manner of writing: he does not divide words or carry superfluous letters from the end of one line to the beginning of the next, but writes them just below the rest of the word and draws a loop around them. </p>                        </div>

Still he was far from being ignorant of Greek poetry, even taking great pleasure in the Old Comedy and frequently staging it at his public entertainments. In reading the writers of both tongues there was nothing for which he looked so carefully as precepts and examples instructive to the public or to individuals; these he would often copy word for word, and send to the members of his household, or to his generals and provincial governors, whenever any of them required admonition. He even read entire volumes to the Senate and called the attention of the people to them by proclamations; for example, the speeches of Quintus <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> On Increasing the Family, and of <a href=/people/1250 target=_blank>Rutilius</a> On the Height of Buildings; to convince them that he was not the first to give attention to such matters, but that they had aroused the interest even of their forefathers. He gave every encouragement to the men of talent of his own age, listening with courtesy and patience to their readings, not only of poetry and history, but of speeches and dialogues as well.

When <a href=/people/4444 target=_blank>Atia</a> had come in the middle of the night to the solemn service of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, she had her litter set down in the temple and fell asleep, while the rest of the matrons also slept. On a sudden a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> glided up to her and shortly went away. When she awoke, she purified herself, as if after the embraces of her husband, and at once there appeared on her body a mark in colours like a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>, and she could never get rid of it; so that presently she ceased ever to go to the public baths. In the tenth month after that <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> was born and was therefore regarded as the son of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>. <a href=/people/4444 target=_blank>Atia</a> too, before she gave him birth, dreamed that her vitals were borne up to the stars and spread over the whole extent of land and sea, while <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a> dreamed that the sun rose from <a href=/people/4444 target=_blank>Atia</a>'s womb. </p>                        </div>

When <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a> next day met <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, whom he had never seen before, he looked at him in great surprise and said that he was very like the boy of whom he had dreamed. Some give a different account of <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>' first dream: when a large group of well-born children asked <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> for a guardian, he pointed out one of their number, to whom they were to refer all their wishes, and then, after lightly touching the boy's mouth with his fingers, laid them on his own lips. As Marcus <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> was attending Gaius <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, he happened to tell his friends a dream of the night before — that a boy of noble countenance was let down from heaven on a golden chain and, standing at the door of the temple, was given a whip by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>. Just then suddenly catching sight of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, who was still unknown to the greater number of those present and had been brought to the ceremony by his uncle <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, he declared that he was the very one whose form had appeared to him in his dream. When <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> was assuming the gown of manhood, his senatorial tunic was ripped apart on both sides and fell at his feet, which some interpreted as a sure sign that the order of which the tunic was the badge would one day be brought to his feet. As the Deified <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Julius</a> was cutting down a wood at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374000UMun class=place long=-5.196 lat=37.376>Munda</a> and preparing a place for his camp, coming across a palm tree, he caused it to be spared as an omen of victory. From this a shoot at once sprang forth and in a few days grew so great that it not only equalled the parent tree, but even overshadowed it; moreover many doves built their nests there, although that kind of bird especially avoids hard and rough foliage. Indeed, it was that omen in particular, they say, that led <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> to wish that none other than his sister's grandson should be his successor. </p>                        </div>

More than that, for the several remaining days of his stay, among little presents of various kinds, he distributed togas and cloaks as well, stipulating that the Romans should use the Greek dress and language and the Greeks the Roman.

He also gave these youths a banquet at which he himself was present, and not only allowed, but even required perfect freedom in jesting and in scrambling for tickets for fruit, dainties and all kinds of things, which he threw to them. In short, there was no form of gaiety in which he did not indulge. He called the neighbouring part of the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406143ICap class=place long=14.2623 lat=40.5579>Capreae</a> Apragopolis from the laziness of some of his company who sojourned there.

Noticing from his dining-room that the tomb of this <a href=/people/5766 target=_blank>Masgaba</a>, who had died the year before, was visited by a large crowd with many torches, he uttered aloud this verse, composed offhand: I see the founder's tomb alight with fire; <br />and turning to <a href=/people/506 target=_blank>Thrasyllus</a>, one of the suite of <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> who was reclining opposite him and knew nothing about the matter, he asked of what poet he thought it was the work.

One man proposed that the name of the month of August be transferred to September, because <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> was born in the latter, but died in the former; another, that all the period from the day of his birth until his demise be called the <a href=/people/3350 target=_blank>Augustan</a> Age, and so entered in the Calendar.

There was even an ex-praetor who took oath that he had seen the form of the Emperor, after he had been reduced to ashes, on its way to heaven.

From there it moved to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> shortly after the founding of the city with a large band of dependents, through the influence of Titus <a href=/people/1911 target=_blank>Tatius</a>, who shared the kingly power with <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> (or, according to the generally accepted view, of Atta <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, the head of the family) about six years after the expulsion of the kings.

While the members of the family were known by various forenames and surnames, they discarded the forename Lucius by common consent after two of the family who bore it had been found guilty, the one of highway robbery, and the other of murder. To their surnames, on the other hand, they added that of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, which in the <a href=/people/11083 target=_blank>Sabine</a> tongue means strong and valiant. </p>                        </div>

On the other hand, <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> Regillianus, decemvir for codifying the laws, through his lawless attempt to enslave a freeborn maid, to gratify his passion for her, was the cause of the second secession of the plebeians from the patricians. <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> Russus, having set up his statue at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415130UFAp class=place long=12.9937 lat=41.468>Forum Appi</a> with a crown upon its head, tried to take possession of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> through his dependents. <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> <a href=/people/11027 target=_blank>Pulcher</a> began a sea-fight off <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, though the sacred chickens would not eat when he took the auspices, throwing them into the sea in defiance of the omen, and saying that they might drink, since they would not eat. He was defeated, and on being bidden by the Senate to appoint a dictator, he appointed his messenger Glycias, as if again making a jest of his country's peril. The women also have records equally diverse, since both the famous Claudias belonged to that family: the one who drew the ship with the sacred properties of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397268LIda class=person long=26.8423 lat=39.6922>Idaean</a> <a href=/people/2057 target=_blank>Magna Mater</a> from the shoal in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> on which it was stranded, after first publicly praying that it might yield to her efforts only if her chastity were beyond question; and the one who was tried by the people for treason, an unprecedented thing in the case of a woman, because when her carriage made but slow progress through the throng, she openly gave vent to the wish that her brother <a href=/people/11027 target=_blank>Pulcher</a> might come to life and lose another fleet, to make less of a crowd in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. It is notorious besides that all the <a href=/people/4932 target=_blank>Claudii</a> were aristocrats and staunch upholders of the prestige and influence of the patricians, with the sole exception of Publius <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>, who for the sake of driving <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> from the city had himself adopted by a plebeian and one too who was younger than himself. Their attitude towards the commons was so headstrong and stubborn that not even when on trial for his life before the people did any one of them deign to put on mourning or beg for mercy; and some of them during bickerings and disputes struck the tribunes of the commons. Even a <a href=/people/12228 target=_blank>Vestal virgin</a> mounted her brother's chariot with him, when he was celebrating a triumph without the sanction of the people, and attended him all the way to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, in order to make it an act of sacrilege for any one of the tribunes to forbid him or interpose his veto. </p>                        </div>

Some think that, since the children of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> were now of age, he voluntarily gave up the position and the virtual assumption of the second rank which he had long held, thus following the example of Marcus <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, who withdrew to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391265PMyt class=place long=26.5621 lat=39.1114>Mytilene</a> when <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> began his public career, so that he might not seem either to oppose or belittle him by his presence.

Being at last allowed to depart, he left his wife and son in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and went down to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Ostia</a> in haste, without saying a single word to any of those who saw him off, and kissing only a very few when he left. </p>                        </div>

But since gossip was rife that he was lingering on the chance of realizing his highest hopes, although the wind was all but dead ahead, he sailed directly to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>, for he had been attracted by the charm and healthfulness of that island ever since the time when he put in there on his return from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a>. Content there with a modest house and a villa in the suburbs not much more spacious, he adopted a most unassuming manner of life, at times walking in the gymnasium without a lictor or a messenger, and: exchanging courtesies with the good people of Greece with almost the air of an equal. It chanced one morning in arranging his program for the day, that he had announced his wish to visit whatever sick folk there were in the city. This was misunderstood by his attendants, and orders were given that all the sick should be taken to a public colonnade and arranged according to the nature of their complaints. Whereupon <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, shocked at this unexpected sight, and in doubt for some time what to do, at last went about to each one, apologizing for what had happened even to the humblest and most obscure of them. Only one single instance was noticed of a visible exercise of the rights of the tribunicial authority. He was a constant attendant at the schools and lecture-rooms of the professors of philosophy, and once when a hot dispute had arisen among rival sophists, a fellow had the audacity to ply him with abuse when he took part and appeared to favour one side. Thereupon he gradually backed away to his house, and then suddenly coming out with his lictors and attendants, and bidding his crier to summon the foul-mouthed fellow before his tribunal, he had him taken off to prison. Shortly after this he learned that his wife <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a> had been banished because of her immorality and adulteries, and that a bill of divorce had been sent her in his name by authority of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>; but welcome as this news was, he yet considered it his duty to make every possible effort in numerous letters to reconcile the father to his daughter; and regardless of her deserts, to allow her to keep any gifts which he had himself made her at any time. Moreover, when the term of his tribunician power was at an end, at last admitting that the sole object of his retirement had been to avoid the suspicion of rivalry with Gaius and Lucius, he asked that inasmuch as he was free from care in that regard, since they were now grown up and had an undisputed claim on the succession, he be allowed to visit his relatives, whom he sorely missed. But his request was denied and he was besides admonished to give up all thought of his kindred, whom he had so eagerly abandoned. </p>                        </div>

Then in very truth he lived not only in private, but even in danger and fear, secluded in his country away from the sea, and shunning the attentions of those that sailed that way; these, however, were constantly thrust on him, since no general or magistrate who was on his way to any province failed to put in at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>.

He also incurred the suspicion of having through some centurions of his appointment, who were returning to camp after a furlough, sent messages to several persons which were of an ambiguous character and apparently designed to incite them to revolution. On being informed by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> of this suspicion, he unceasingly demanded the appointment of someone, of any rank whatsoever, to keep watch over his actions and words. </p>                        </div>

When later, on his way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, he visited the oracle of <a href=/people/894 target=_blank>Geryon</a> near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454119UPat class=place long=11.8766 lat=45.4096>Patavium</a>, and drew a lot which advised him to seek an answer to his inquiries by throwing golden dice into the fount of <a href=/people/7267 target=_blank>Aponus</a>, it came to pass that the dice which he threw showed the highest possible number; and those dice may be seen today under the water. A few days before his recall an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>, a bird never before seen in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>, perched upon the roof of his house; and the day before he was notified that he might return, his tunic seemed to blaze as he was changing his clothes. It was just at this time that he was convinced of the powers of the astrologer <a href=/people/506 target=_blank>Thrasyllus</a>, whom he had attached to his household as a learned man; for as soon as he caught sight of the ship, <a href=/people/506 target=_blank>Thrasyllus</a> declared that it brought good news — this too at the very moment when <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> had made up his mind to push the man off into the sea as they were strolling together, believing him a false prophet and too hastily made the confidant of his secrets, because things were turning out adversely and contrary to his predictions. </p>                        </div>

For a slave of <a href=/people/7188 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, <a href=/people/2509 target=_blank>Clemens</a> by name had collected a band of no mean size to avenge his master; Lucius <a href=/people/1792 target=_blank>Scribonius</a> <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a>, one of the nobles was secretly plotting a revolution; and a mutiny of the soldiers broke out in two places, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> and <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germania</a>. Both armies demanded numelous special privileges-above all, that they should receive the same pay as the praetorians. The army in <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germania</a> was, besides, reluctant to accept an emperor who was not its own choice, and with the greatest urgency besought <a href=/people/380 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>, their commander at the time, to assume the purple, in spite of his positive refusal. Fear of this possibility in particular led <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> to ask the Senate for any part in the administration that it might please them to assign him, saying that no one man could bear the whole burden without a colleague, or even several colleagues. He also feigned ill-health, to induce <a href=/people/380 target=_blank>Germanicus</a> to wait with more patience for a speedy succession, or at least for a share in the sovereignty. The mutinies were put down, and he also got <a href=/people/2509 target=_blank>Clemens</a> into his power, outwitting him by stratagem. Not until his second year did he finally arraign <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a> in the Senate, fearing to take any severe measures before his power was secure, and satisfied in the meantime merely to be on his guard. Thus, when <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a> was offering sacrifice with him among the pontiffs, he had a leaden knife substituted for the usual one, and when he asked for a private interview, <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> would not grant it except with his son <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> present, and as long as the conference lasted he held fast to <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a>'s right arm, under pretence of leaning on it as they walked together. </p>                        </div>

He forbade the voting of temples, flamens, and priests in his honour, and even the setting up of statues and busts without his permission; and this he gave only with the understanding that they were not to be placed among the likenesses of the gods, but among the adornments of the temples. He would not allow an oath to be taken ratifying his acts nor the name <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> to be given to the month of September, or that of <a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a> to October. He also declined the forename Imperator, the surname of Father of his Country, and the placing of the civic crown at his door; and he did not even use the title of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> in any letters except those to kings and potentates, although it was his by inheritance. He held but three consulships after becoming emperor — one for a few days, and a third, during his absence from the city, until the Ides of May. </p>                        </div>

In fact, if anyone in conversation or in a set speech spoke of him in too flattering terms, he did not hesitate to interrupt him, to take him to task, and to correct his language on the spot. Being once called Dominus he warned the speaker not to address him again in an insulting fashion.

He was greatly offended too by a decree of the Senate, providing that son of <a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a>, as well as son of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> should be written in his honorary inscriptions. For this reason he would not suffer her to be named Parent of her Country, nor to receive any conspicuous public honour. More than that, he often warned her not to meddle with affairs of importance and unbecoming a woman, especially after he learned that at a fire near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SVes class=place long=12.48621 lat=41.89171>temple</a> of <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a> she had been present in person, and urged the people and soldiers to greater efforts, as had been her way while her husband was alive. </p>                        </div>

Then <a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a>, in a rage, drew from a secret place and read some old letters written to her by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> with regard to the austerity and stubbornness of <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>' disposition.

Of those who were cited to plead their causes some opened their veins at home, feeling sure of being condemned and wishing to avoid annoyance and humiliation, while others drank poison in full view of the Senate; yet the wounds of the former were bandaged and they were hurried half-dead, but still quivering, to the prison. Every one of those who were executed was thrown out upon the Stairs of Mourning and dragged to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> with hooks, as many as twenty being so treated in a single day, including women and children. Since ancient usage made it impious to strangle maidens, young girls were first violated by the executioner and then strangled. Those who wished to die were forced to live; for he thought death so light a punishment that when he heard that one of the accused, <a href=/people/9082 target=_blank>Carnulus</a> by name, had anticipated his execution, he cried: <a href=/people/9082 target=_blank>Carnulus</a> has given me the slip; and when he was inspecting the prisons and a man begged for a speedy death, he replied: I have not yet become your friend. An ex-consul has recorded in his Annals that once at a large dinner-party, at which the writer himself was present, <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> was suddenly asked in a loud voice by one of the dwarfs that stood beside the table among the jesters why <a href=/people/5154 target=_blank>Paconius</a>, who was charged with treason, remained so long alive; that the emperor at the time chided him for his saucy tongue, but a few days later wrote to the Senate to decide as soon as possible about the execution of <a href=/people/5154 target=_blank>Paconius</a>. </p>                        </div>

Among various forms of torture he had devised this one: he would trick men into loading themselves with copious draughts of wine, and then on a sudden tying up their private parts, would torment them at the same time by the torture of the cords and of the stoppage of their water. And had not death prevented him, and <a href=/people/506 target=_blank>Thrasyllus</a>, purposely it is said, induced him to put off some things through hope of a longer life, it is believed that still more would have perished, and that he would not even have spared the rest of his grandsons; for he had his suspicions of Gaius and detested <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> as the fruit of adultery.

First of all, to remove him from his person under colour of showing him honour, he chose him as his colleague in a fifth consulship, which, with this very end in view, he assumed after a long interval while absent from the city. Then beguiling him with hope of marriage into the imperial family and of the tribunicial power, he accused him when he least expected it in a shameful and pitiable speech, begging the senators among other things to send one of the consuls to bring him, a lonely old man, into their presence under military protection.

Some say that a pillow was thrown upon his face, when he came to and asked for a ring which had been taken from him during a fainting fit. <a href=/people/12005 target=_blank>Seneca</a> writes that conscious of his approaching end, he took off the ring, as if to give it to someone, but held fast to it for a time; then he put it back on his finger, and clenching his left hand, lay for a long time motionless; suddenly he called for his attendants, and on receiving no response, got up; but his strength failed him and he fell dead near the couch. </p>                        </div>

Moreover, the inscription on the altar adds no strength to <a href=/people/10945 target=_blank>Pliny</a>'s view, for <a href=/people/720 target=_blank>Agrippina</a> twice gave birth to daughters in that region, and any childbirth, regardless of sex, is called puerperium, since the men of old called girls puerae, just as they called boys puelli.

I send with him besides one of my slaves who is a physician, and I have written <a href=/people/380 target=_blank>Germanicus</a> to keep him if he wishes. Farewell, my own <a href=/people/720 target=_blank>Agrippina</a>, and take care to come in good health to your <a href=/people/380 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>. I think it is clear enough that Gaius could not have been born in a place to which he was first taken from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> when he was nearly two years old. This letter also weakens our confidence in the verses, the more so because they are anonymous. We must then accept the only remaining testimony, that of the public record, particularly since Gaius loved <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415126UAnt class=place long=12.6286 lat=41.4552>Antium</a> as if it were his native soil, always preferring it to all other places of retreat, and even thinking, it is said, of transferring thither the seat and abode of the empire through weariness of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. </p>                        </div>

To have a better chance of realizing this, after losing <a href=/people/4574 target=_blank>Junia</a> in childbirth, he seduced Ennia Naevia, wife of Macro, who at that time commanded the praetorian guard, even promising to marry her if he became emperor, and guaranteeing this promise by an oath and a written contract.

After he had assumed various surnames (for he was called <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a>, Castrorum Filius, Pater Exercituum and Optimus Maximus <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a> ), chancing to overhear some kings, who had come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to pay their respects to him, disputing at dinner about the nobility of their descent, he cried: Let there be one Lord, one King. And he came near assuming a crown at once and changing the semblance of a principate into the form of a monarchy. But on being reminded that he had risen above the elevation both of princes and kings, he began from that time on to lay claim to divine majesty; for after giving orders that such statues of the gods as were especially famous for their sanctity or their artistic merit, including that of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=person long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>, should be brought from Greece, in order to remove their heads and put his own in their place, he built out a part of the Palace as far as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a>, and making the temple of <a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a> and <a href=/people/327 target=_blank>Pollux</a> its vestibule, he often took his place between the divine brethren, and exhibited himself there to be worshipped by those who presented themselves; and some hailed him as <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> <a href=/people/3412 target=_blank>Latiaris</a>. He also set up a special temple to his own godhead, with priests and with victims of the choicest kind. In this temple was a life-sized statue of the emperor in gold, which was dressed each day in clothing such as he wore himself. The richest citizens used all their influence to secure the priesthoods of his cult and bid high for the honor. The victims were flamingoes, <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peacocks</a>, black grouse, guinea-hens, and pheasants, offered day by day each after its own kind. At night he used constantly to invite the full and radiant moon to his embraces and his bed, while in the daytime he would talk confidentially with <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=person long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitolinus</a>, now whispering and then in turn putting his ear to the mouth of the god, now in louder and even angry language; for he was heard to make the threat: Lift me up, or I'll lift you. But finally won by entreaties, as he reported, and even invited to live with the god, he built a bridge over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SDAT class=place long=12.4842 lat=41.8914>temple</a> of the Deified <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, and thus joined his Palace to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>.

His charge against the latter was that <a href=/people/816 target=_blank>Silanus</a> had not followed him when he put to sea in stormy weather, but had remained behind in the hope of taking possession of the city in case he should be lost in the storm; against <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, that his breath smelled of an antidote, which he had taken to guard against being poisoned at his hand. Now as a matter of fact, <a href=/people/816 target=_blank>Silanus</a> was subject to sea-sickness and wished to avoid the discomforts of the voyage, while <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> had taken medicine for a chronic cough, which was growing worse.

At the plays in the theater, sowing discord between the people and the equites, he scattered the gift tickets ahead of time, to induce the rabble to take the seats reserved for the equestrian order. At a gladiatorial show he would sometimes draw back the awnings when the sun was hottest and give orders that no one be allowed to leave; then removing the usual equipment, he would match worthless and decrepit gladiators against mangy wild beasts, and have sham fights between householders who were of good repute, but conspicuous for some bodily infirmity. Sometimes too he would shut up the granaries and condemn the people to hunger. </p>                        </div>

When <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> to feed the wild beasts which he had provided for a gladiatorial show were rather costly, he selected criminals to be devoured, and reviewing the line of prisoners without examining the charges, but merely taking his place in the middle of a colonnade, he bade them be led away from baldhead to baldhead. A man who had made a vow to fight in the arena if the emperor recovered, he compelled to keep his word, watched him as he fought sword in hand, and would not let him go until he was victorious, and then only after many entreaties. Another who had offered his life for the same reason, but delayed to kill himself, he turned over to his slaves, with orders to drive him through the streets decked with sacred boughs and fillets, calling for the fulfilment of his vow, and finally hurl him from the embankment. Many men of honorable rank were first disfigured with the marks of branding-irons and then condemned to the mines, to work at building roads, or to be thrown to the wild beasts; or else he shut them up in cages on all fours, like animals, or had them sawn asunder. Not all these punishments were for serious offences, but merely for criticizing one of his shows, or for never having sworn by his Genius. He forced parents to attend the executions of their sons, sending a litter for one man who pleaded ill health, and inviting another to dinner immediately after witnessing the death, and trying to rouse him to gaiety and jesting by a great show of affability. He had the manager of his gladiatorial shows and beast-baitings beaten with chains in his presence for several successive days, and would not kill him until he was disgusted at the stench of his putrefied brain. He burned a writer of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410143UAte class=demonym long=14.2538 lat=40.9658>Atellan</a> farces alive in the middle of the arena of the amphitheatre, because of a humorous line of double meaning.

When he had roused such fear in this way that he came to be named openly as heir by strangers among their intimates and by parents among their children, he accused them of making game of him by continuing to live after such a declaration, and to many of them he sent poisoned dainties. He used further to conduct the trial of such cases in person, naming in advance the sum which he proposed to raise at each sitting, and not rising until it was made up. Impatient of the slightest delay, he once condemned in a single sentence more than forty who were accused on different counts, boasting to <a href=/people/4461 target=_blank>Caesonia</a>, when she woke after a nap, of the great amount of business he had done while she was taking her afternoon sleep. Appointing an auction, he put up and sold what was left from all the shows, personally soliciting bids and running them up so high, that some who were forced to buy articles at an enormous price and were thus stripped of their possessions, opened their veins. A well-known incident is that of <a href=/people/5445 target=_blank>Aponius</a> <a href=/people/758 target=_blank>Saturninus</a>; he fell asleep on one of the benches, and as the auctioneer was warned by Gaius not to overlook the praetorian gentleman who kept nodding to him, the bidding was not stopped until thirteen gladiators were knocked down to the unconscious sleeper at nine million sesterces. </p>                        </div>

Full of threats as he was also against the barbarians, when he was riding in a chariot through a narrow defile on the far side of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>, and someone said that there would be no slight panic if the enemy should appear anywhere, he immediately mounted a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and hastily returned to the bridges. Finding them crowded with camp servants and baggage, in his impatience of any delay he was passed along from hand to hand over the men's heads. Soon after, hearing of an uprising in <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germania</a>, he made preparations to flee from the city and equipped fleets for the purpose, finding comfort only in the thought that the provinces across the sea would at any rate be left him, in case the enemy should be victorious and take possession of the summits of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a>, as the <a href=/people/946 target=_blank>Cimbri</a>, or even of the city, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/482033UAge class=ethnic long=3.284 lat=48.198>Senones</a> had once done. And it was this, I think, that later inspired his assassins with the idea of pretending to the riotous soldiers that he had laid hands on himself in terror at the report of a defeat. </p>                        </div>

From this point there are two versions of the story: some say that as he was talking with the boys, <a href=/people/5549 target=_blank>Chaerea</a> came up behind, and gave him a deep cut in the neck, having first cried, Take that, and that then the tribune <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a>, who was the other conspirator and faced Gaius, stabbed him in the breast.

As he lay upon the ground and with writhing limbs called out that he still lived, the others dispatched him with thirty wounds; for the general signal was Strike again. Some even thrust their swords through his privates.

Certain it is that this verse at once became current: In three months time come children to the great. This <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>, while holding the offices of quaestor and praetor, was in charge of the war in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469105RRae class=place long=10.47 lat=46.85>Rhaetia</a> and later of that in <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germania</a>. He was the first of Roman generals to sail the northern Ocean, and beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> with prodigious labor he constructed the huge canals which to this very day are called by his name. Even after he had defeated the enemy in many battles and driven them far into the wilds of the interior, he did not cease his pursuit until the apparition of a barbarian woman of greater than human size, speaking in the Latin tongue, forbade him to push his victory further. For these exploits he received the honor of an ovation with the triumphal regalia; and immediately after his praetorship he became consul and resumed his campaign, but died in his summer camp, which for that reason was given the name of Accursed. The body was carried by the leading men of the free towns and colonies to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, where it was met and received by the decuries of scribes, and buried in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCMa class=place long=12.481 lat=41.905>Campus Martius</a>. But the army reared a monument in his honor, about which the soldiers should make a ceremonial run each year thereafter on a stated day, which the cities of Gaul were to observe with prayers and sacrifices. The Senate, in addition to many other honors, voted him a marble arch adorned with trophies on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPAp class=place long=12.5016 lat=41.8734>Appian Way</a>, and the surname <a href=/people/380 target=_blank>Germanicus</a> for himself and his descendants. It is the general belief that he was as eager for glory as he was democratic by nature; for in addition to victories over the enemy he greatly desired to win the spolia opima, often pursuing the leaders of the Germans all over the field at great personal risk; and he made no secret of his intention of restoring the old-time form of government, whenever he should have the power. It is because of this, I think, that some have made bold to write that he was an object of suspicion to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>; that the emperor recalled him from his province, and when he did not obey at once, took him off by poison. This I have mentioned, rather not to pass it by, than that I think it true or even probable; for as a matter of fact <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> loved him so dearly while he lived that he always named him joint-heir along with his sons, as he once declared in the senate; and when he was dead, he eulogized him warmly before the people, praying the gods to make his Caesars like <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>, and to grant him, when his time came, as glorious a death as they had given that hero. And not content with carving a laudatory inscription on his tomb in verses of his own composition, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> also wrote a memoir of his life in prose. <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> had several children by the younger <a href=/people/1215 target=_blank>Antonia</a>, but was survived by only three, <a href=/people/380 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>, Livina, and <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>. </p>                        </div>

Later, on the adoption of his elder brother into the <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a> family, he took the surname Germanicus. He lost his father when he was still an infant, and throughout almost the whole course of his childhood and youth he suffered so severely from various obstinate disorders that the vigor of both his mind and his body was dulled, and even when he reached the proper age he was not thought capable of any public or private business. For a long time, even after he reached the age of independence, he was in a state of pupillage and under a guardian, of whom he himself makes complaint in a book of his, saying that he was a barbarian and a former chief of muleteers, put in charge of him for the express purpose of punishing him with all possible severity for any cause whatever. It was also because of his weak health that contrary to all precedent he wore a cloak when he presided at the gladiatorial games which he and his brother gave in honor of their father; and on the day when he assumed the gown of manhood he was taken in a litter to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> about midnight without the usual escort. </p>                        </div>

Now we are both agreed that we must decide once for all what plan we are to adopt in his case. For if he be sound and so to say complete, what reason have we for doubting that he ought to be advanced through the same grades and steps through which his brother has been advanced? But if we realize that he is wanting and defective in soundness of body and mind, we must not furnish the means of ridiculing both him and us to a public which is wont to scoff at and deride such things. Surely we shall always be in a stew, if we deliberate about each separate occasion and do not make up our minds in advance whether we think he can hold public offices or not. However, as to the matters about which you ask my present advice, I do not object to his having charge of the banquet of the priests at the games of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, if he will allow himself to be advised by his kinsman the son of <a href=/people/1251 target=_blank>Silvanus</a>, so as not to do anything to make himself conspicuous or ridiculous. That he should view the games in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCiM class=place long=12.4871 lat=41.8852>Circus</a> from the Imperial box does not meet with my approval; for he will be conspicuous if exposed to full view in the front of the auditorium. I am opposed to his going to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127LAlb class=place long=12.709 lat=41.7514>Alban Mount</a> or being in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the days of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> festival; for why should he not be made prefect of the city, if he is able to attend his brother to the Mount? You have my views, my dear <a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a>, to wit that I desire that something be decided once for all about the whole matter, to save us from constantly wavering between hope and fear. Moreover, you may, if you wish, give this part of my letter to our kinswoman <a href=/people/1215 target=_blank>Antonia</a> also to read. Again in another letter: I certainly shall invite the young <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> to dinner every day during your absence, to keep him from dining alone with his friends <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a> and <a href=/people/692 target=_blank>Athenodorus</a>. I do wish that he would choose more carefully and in a less scatter-brained fashion someone to imitate in his movements, bearing, and gait. The poor fellow is unlucky; for in important matters, where his mind does not wander, the nobility of his character is apparent enough. Also in a third letter: Confound me, dear <a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a>, if I am not surprised that your grandson <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> could please me with his declaiming. How in the world anyone who is so unclear in his conversation can speak with clearness and propriety when he declaims, is more than I can see. There is no doubt at all what <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> later decided, and that he left him invested with no office other than the augural priesthood, not even naming him as one of his heirs, save in the third degree and to a sixth part of his estate, among those who were all but strangers; while the legacy that he left him was not more than eight hundred thousand sesterces. </p>                        </div>

He recalled no one from exile except with the approval of the Senate. He obtained from the members as a favor the privilege of bringing into the House with him the prefect of the praetorian guard and the tribunes of the soldiers, and the ratification of the judicial acts of his agents in the provinces. He asked the consuls for permission to hold fairs on his private estates. He often appeared as one of the advisers at cases tried before the magistrates; and when they gave games, he also arose with the rest of the audience and showed his respect by acclamations and applause. When the tribunes of the Plebeians appeared before him as he sat upon the tribunal, he apologized to them because for lack of room he could not hear them unless they stood up.

He administered justice most conscientiously both as consul and when out of office, even on his own anniversaries and those of his family, and sometimes even on festivals of ancient date and days of ill-omen. He did not always follow the letter of the laws, but modified their severity or lenity in many cases according to his own notions of equity and justice; for he allowed a new trial to those who had lost their cases before private judges by demanding more than the law prescribed, while, overstepping the lawful penalty, he condemned to the wild beasts those who were convicted of especially heinous crimes. </p>                        </div>

In revising the lists of the divisions of jurors he disqualified a man who had presented himself without mentioning that he was immune because of the number of his children on the ground that he had a passion for jury duty. Another, who was challenged by his opponents about a suit of his own, said that it did not come before <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s tribunal, but the ordinary courts; whereupon <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> compelled him at once to bring the case before him, saying that the man would show in a case affecting his own interests how just a juror he would be in the affairs of others. When a woman refused to recognize her son, and the evidence on both sides was conflicting, he forced her to admit the truth by ordering her to marry the young man. Whenever one party to a suit was absent, he was prone to decide in favor of the one who was present without considering whether his opponent had failed to appear through his own fault or from a necessary cause. On a man's being convicted of forgery, some one cried out that his hands ought to be cut off; whereupon <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> insisted that an executioner be summoned at once with knife and block. In a case involving citizenship a fruitless dispute arose among the advocates as to whether the defendant ought to make his appearance in the toga or in a Hellenic mantle, and the emperor, with the idea of showing absolute impartiality, made him change his garb several times, according as he was accused or defended. In one case he is credited with having rendered the following decision, which he had actually written out beforehand: I decide in favor of those who have told the truth. By such acts as these he so discredited himself that he was held in general and open contempt. One man in making excuses for a witness that the emperor had summoned from one of the provinces, said that he could not appear, but for a long time would give no reason; at last, after a long series of questions, he said: He's dead; I think the excuse is a lawful one. Another in thanking the emperor for allowing him to defend his client added After all, it is usual. I myself used to hear older men say that the pleaders took such advantage of his good-nature, that they would not only call him back when he had left the tribunal, but would catch hold of the fringe of his robe, and sometimes of his foot, and thus detain him. To prevent any surprise at this, I may add that a common Hellenic attorney let slip this remark in a hot debate: You are both an old man and a fool. All the world knows that a Roman eques who was tried for improper conduct towards women, but on a false charge trumped up by unscrupulous enemies, seeing common strumpets called as witnesses against him and their testimony admitted, hurled the stylus and tablets which he held in his hand into the emperor's face with such force as to badly cut his cheek, at the same time loudly reviling his cruelty and stupidity. </p>                        </div>

In his review of the equites he let off a young man of evil character, whose father said that he was perfectly satisfied with him, without any public censure saying He has a censor of his own. Another who was notorious for corruption and adultery he merely admonished to be more restrained in his indulgence, or at any rate more circumspect, adding, For why should I know what mistress you keep? When he had removed the mark of censure affixed to one man's name, yielding to the entreaties of the latter's friends, he said: But let the erasure be seen. He not only struck from the list of jurors a man of high birth, a leading citizen of the province of Hellas, because he did not know Latin, but even deprived him of the rights of citizenship; and he would not allow anyone to render an account of his life save in his own words, as well as he could, without the help of an advocate. And he degraded many, some contrary to their expectation and on the novel charge that they had left Italia without consulting him and obtaining leave of absence; one man merely because he had been companion to a king in his province, citing the case of <a href=/people/4675 target=_blank>Rabirius</a> <a href=/people/2121 target=_blank>Postumus</a>, who in bygone days had been tried for treason because he had followed <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, to recover a loan. When he attempted to degrade still more, he found them in most cases blameless; for owing to the great carelessness of his agents, but to his own greater shame, those whom he accused of celibacy, childlessness, or lack of means proved that they were married, or fathers, or well-to-do. In fact, one man, who was charged with having stabbed himself, stripped off his clothing and showed a body without a scar. Other noteworthy acts of his censorship were the following: he had a silver chariot of costly workmanship, which was offered for sale in the <a href=/people/5971 target=_blank>Sigillaria</a>, bought and cut to pieces in his presence; in one single day he made twenty proclamations, including these two: As the yield of the vineyards is bountiful, the wine jars should be well-pitched; and Nothing is so effective a cure for snake-bite as the juice of the yew tree. </p>                        </div>

Now there was no form of entertainment at which he was more familiar and free, even thrusting out his left hand as the Plebeians did, and counting aloud on his fingers the gold pieces which were paid to the victors; and ever and anon he would address the audience, and invite and urge them to merriment, calling them masters from time to time, and interspersing feeble and far-fetched jokes. For example, when they called for Palumbus he promised that they should have him, if he could be caught. The following, however, was both exceedingly timely and salutary; when he had granted the wooden sword to an essedarius, for whose discharge four sons begged, and the act was received with loud and general applause, he at once circulated a note, pointing out to the people how greatly they ought to desire children, since they saw that they brought favor and protection even to a gladiator. He gave representations in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCMa class=place long=12.481 lat=41.905>Campus Martius</a> of the storming and sacking of a town in the manner of real warfare, as well as of the surrender of the kings of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=ethnic long=-1.5 lat=53>Britons</a>, and presided clad in a general's cloak. Even when he was on the point of letting out the water from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420135WFuc class=place long=13.547 lat=41.995>Lake Fucinus</a> he gave a sham sea-fight first. But when the combatants cried out: Hail, emperor, those who are about to die salute you, he replied, Or not, and after that all of them refused to fight, maintaining that they had been pardoned. Upon this he hesitated for some time about destroying them all with fire and sword, but at last leaping from his throne and running along the edge of the lake with his ridiculous tottering gait he induced them to fight, partly by threats and partly by promises. At this performance a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> and a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=demonym long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodian</a> fleet engaged, each numbering twelve triremes, and the signal was sounded on a horn by a silver <a href=/people/664 target=_blank>Triton</a>, which was raised from the middle of the lake by a mechanical device. </p>                        </div>

Not to go into details about less important matters (such as revoking his grants, rescinding his decisions, substituting false letters patent, or even openly changing those which he had issued), he put to death his father-in-law <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> <a href=/people/816 target=_blank>Silanus</a> and the two <a href=/people/3193 target=_blank>Julias</a>, daughters of <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> and <a href=/people/380 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>, on an unsupported charge and giving them no opportunity for defense; also Gnaeus <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, the husband of his elder daughter, and Lucius <a href=/people/816 target=_blank>Silanus</a>, who was betrothed to his younger one.

He inflicted the death penalty on thirty-five senators and more than three hundred Roman equites with such easy indifference, that when a centurion, in reporting the death of an ex-consul, said that his order had been carried out, he replied that he had given no order; but he nevertheless approved the act, since his freedmen declared that the soldiers had done their duty in hastening to avenge their emperor without instructions. But it is beyond all belief, that at the marriage which <a href=/people/2634 target=_blank>Messalina</a> had contracted with her paramour <a href=/people/1117 target=_blank>Silius</a> he signed the contract for the dowry with his own hand, being induced to do so on the ground that the marriage was a feigned one, designed to avert and turn upon another a danger which was inferred from certain portents to threaten the emperor himself. </p>                        </div>

When a pair of gladiators had fallen by mutually inflicted wounds, he at once had some little knives made from both their swords for his use. He took such pleasure in the combats with wild beasts and of those that fought at noonday that he would go down to the arena at daybreak and after dismissing the people for luncheon at midday, he would keep his seat and in addition to the appointed combatants, he would for trivial and hasty reasons match others, even of the carpenters, the assistants, and men of that class, if any automatic device, or pageant, or anything else of the kind, had not worked well.

For he used to lie upon his back and hold a leaden plate on his chest, purge himself by the syringe and by vomiting, and deny himself fruits and all foods injurious to the voice. Finally encouraged by his progress, although his voice was weak and husky, he began to long to appear on the stage, and every now and then in the presence of his intimate friends he would quote a Greek proverb meaning Hidden music counts for nothing. And he made his debut at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>, where he did not cease singing until he had finished the number which he had begun, even though the theatre was shaken by a sudden earthquake shock, In the same city he sang frequently and for several days.

On learning that everything had gone wrong and that she had escaped by swimming, driven to desperation he secretly had a dagger thrown down beside her freedman Lucius Agermus, when he joyfully brought word that she was safe and sound, and then ordered that the freedman be seized and bound, on the charge of being hired to kill the emperor; that his mother be put to death, and the pretence made that she had escaped the consequences of her detected guilt by suicide. 4 Trustworthy authorities add still more gruesome details: that he hurried off to view the corpse, handled her limbs, criticising some and commending others, and that becoming thirsty meanwhile, he took a drink. Yet he could not either then or ever afterwards endure the stings of conscience, though soldiers, senate and people tried to hearten him with their congratulations; for he often owned that he was hounded by his mother's ghost and by the whips and blazing torches of the <a href=/people/1744 target=_blank>Furies</a>.

Then, as his cloak had been torn by the thorns, he pulled out the twigs which had pierced it, and crawling on all fours through a narrow passage that had been dug, he entered the villa and lay down in the first room he came to, on a couch with a common mattress, over which an old cloak had been thrown. Though suffering from hunger and renewed thirst, he refused some coarse bread which was offered him, but drank a little lukewarm water. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.phi001:Gal.3'><b>&sect; Gal.3</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a long story to give in detail his illustrious ancestors and the honorary inscriptions of the entire race, but I shall give a brief account of his immediate family. It is uncertain who was the first of the <a href=/people/8349 target=_blank>Sulpicii</a> to bear the surname <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>, why he assumed it, and whence it was derived. Some think that it was because after having for a long time unsuccessfully besieged a town in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390000RIbe class=place long=-4 lat=39>Hispania</a>, he at last set fire to it by torches smeared with galbanum; others because during a long illness he made constant use of galbeum, that is to say of remedies wrapped in wool, still others, because he was a very fat man, such as the Gauls term galba, or because he was, on the contrary, as slender as the insects called galbae, which breed in oak trees. The family acquired distinction from <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>, who became consul and was decidedly the most eloquent speaker of his time. This man, they say, was the cause of the war with <a href=/people/1797 target=_blank>Viriathus</a>, because while governing <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390000RIbe class=place long=-4 lat=39>Hispania</a> as propraetor, he treacherously massacred thirty thousand of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-83RLus class=ethnic long=-8.3 lat=39>Lusitanians</a>. His grandson had been one of <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s lieutenants in Gallia, but angered because his commander caused his defeat for the consulship, he joined the conspiracy with <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, and was consequently condemned to death by the Pedian law. From him were descended the grandfather and the father of the emperor <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>. The former, who was more eminent for his learning than for his rank — for he did not advance beyond the grade of praetor — published a voluminous and painstaking history. The father attained the consulship, and although he was short of stature and even hunchbacked, besides being only an indifferent speaker, was an industrious pleader at the bar. He married Mummia Achaica, the granddaughter of <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a> and great-granddaughter of Lucius <a href=/people/782 target=_blank>Mummius</a> who destroyed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>; and later <a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a> Ocellina, a very rich and beautiful woman, who, however, is thought to have sought marriage with him because of his high rank, and the more eagerly when, in response to her frequent advances, he took off his robe in private and showed her his deformity, so as not to seem to deceive her by concealing it. By Achaica he had two sons, Gaius and <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>. Gaius, who was the elder, left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> after squandering the greater part of his estate, and committed suicide because <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> would not allow him to take part in the allotment of the provinces in his year. </p>                        </div>

Adopted by his stepmother <a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a>, he took her name and the surname <a href=/people/4629 target=_blank>Ocella</a>, and also changed his forename; for he used Lucius, instead of <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>, from that time until he became emperor. It is well known that when he was still a boy and called to pay his respects to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> with others of his age, the emperor pinched his cheek and said in Greek: You too, child, will have a nibble at this power of mine. <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> too, when he heard that <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a> was destined to be emperor, but in his old age, said: Well, let him live then, since that does not concern me. Again, when <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>'s grandfather was busy with a sacrifice for a stroke of lightning, and an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> snatched the intestines from his hand and carried them to an oak full of acorns, the prediction was made that the highest dignity would come to the family, but late; whereupon he said with a laugh: Very likely, when a mule has a foal . Afterwards when <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a> was beginning his revolt, nothing gave him so much encouragement as the foaling of a mule, and while the rest were horrified and looked on it as an unfavorable omen, he alone regarded it as most propitious, remembering the sacrifice and his grandfather's saying. When he assumed the gown of manhood, he dreamt that <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> said that she was tired of standing before his door, and that unless she were quickly admitted she would fall a prey to the first comer. When he awoke, opening the door of the hall, he found close by the threshold a bronze statue of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> more than a cubit high. This he carried in his arms to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>, where he usually spent the summer, and consecrated it in a room of his house; and from that time on he honored it with monthly sacrifices and a yearly vigil. Even before he reached middle life, he persisted in keeping up an old and forgotten custom of his country, which survived only in his own household, of having his freedmen and slaves appear before him twice a day in a body, greeting him in the morning and bidding him farewell at evening, one by one. </p>                        </div>

He governed Africa for two years with the rank of proconsul, being specially chosen to restore order in the province, which was disturbed both by internal strife and by a revolt of the barbarians. And he was successful, owing to his insistence on strict discipline and his observance of justice even in trifling matters. When provisions were very scarce during a foray and a soldier was accused of having sold for a hundred denarii a modius of wheat which was left from his rations, <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a> gave orders that when the man began to lack food, he should receive aid from no one; and he starved to death. On another occasion when he was holding court and the question of the ownership of a beast of burden was laid before him, as the evidence on both sides was slight and the witnesses unreliable, so that it was difficult to get at the truth, he ruled that the beast should be led with its head muffled up to the pool where it was usually watered, that it should then be unmuffled, and should belong to the man to whom it returned of its own accord after drinking. </p>                        </div>

But he gradually changed to sloth and inaction, not to give <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> any cause for jealousy, and as he used to say himself, because no one could be forced to render an account for doing nothing. As he was holding the assizes at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376-09PCar class=place long=-0.9738 lat=37.6013>Nova Carthago</a>, he learned of the rebellion of the Gallic provinces through an urgent appeal for help from the governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450010RAqu class=place long=1 lat=45>Aquitania</a>; then came letters from <a href=/people/1489 target=_blank>Vindex</a>, calling upon him to make himself the liberator and leader of mankind.

Then proclaiming a holiday, he enrolled from the people of the province into legions and auxiliaries in addition to his former force of one legion, two divisions of cavalry, and three cohorts. But from the oldest and most experienced of the nobles he chose a kind of Senate, to whom he might refer matters of special importance whenever it was necessary. He also chose young men of the ordo equester, who were to have the title of volunteers and keep guard before his bed chamber in place of the regular soldiers, without losing their right to wear the gold ring. He also sent proclamations broadcast throughout the province, urging all men individually and collectively to join the revolution and aid the common cause in every possible way. At about this same time, during the fortification of a town which he had chosen as the seat of war, a ring of ancient workmanship was found, containing a precious stone engraved with a <a href=/people/335 target=_blank>Victory</a> and a trophy.

He also disbanded a cohort of Germans, whom the previous Caesars had made their body-guard and had found absolutely faithful in many emergencies, and sent them back to their native country without any rewards, alleging that they were more favorably inclined towards Gnaeus <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>, near whose gardens they had their camp. The following tales too were told in mockery of him, whether truly or falsely: that when an unusually elegant dinner was set before him, he groaned aloud; that when his duly appointed steward presented his expense account, he handed him a dish of beans in return for his industry and carefulness; and that when the flute player <a href=/people/3357 target=_blank>Canus</a> greatly pleased him, he presented him with five denarii, which he took from his own purse with his own hand. </p>                        </div>

To these brigands, each with his different vice, he so entrusted and handed himself over as their tool, that his conduct was far from consistent; for now he was more exacting and niggardly and now more extravagant and reckless than became a princeps chosen by the people and of his time of life. He condemned to death divers distinguished men of both orders on trivial suspicions without a trial. He rarely granted Roman citizenship, and the privileges of threefold paternity to hardly one or two, and even to those only for a fixed and limited time. When the jurors petitioned that a sixth division be added to their number, he not only refused, but even deprived them of the privilege granted by <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, of not being summoned for court duty in winter and at the beginning of the year. </p>                        </div>

Again, as he entered the city, and later the palaces, he was met by a shock of an earthquake and a sound like the lowing of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>kine</a>.

He did, however, put on a linen cuirass, though he openly declared that it would afford little protection against so many swords. But he was lured out by false reports, circulated by the conspirators to induce him to appear in public; for when a few rashly assured him that the trouble was over, that the rebels had been overthrown, and that the rest were coming in a body to offer their congratulations, ready to submit to all his orders, he went out to meet them with so much confidence, that when one of the soldiers boasted that he had slain <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a>, he asked him, On whose authority? and then he went on as far as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a>.

It was very surprising that none of those present tried to lend aid to their emperor, and that all who were sent for treated the summons with contempt except a company of German troops. These, because of his recent kindness in showing them great indulgence when they were weakened by illness, flew to his help, but through their unfamiliarity with the city took a roundabout way and arrived too late.

His father Lucius <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a> was of a distinguished family on his mother's side, with many powerful connections, and was so beloved by <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> and so like him in appearance, that he was believed by many to be the emperor's son. In the regular offices at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, the proconsulate of Africa, and several special military commands, he conducted himself with extreme severity. In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> he even had the courage to punish some soldiers with death, because in the rebellion of <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a>, repenting of their defection, they had killed their officers on the ground that they were the ringleaders in the revolt against <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>; and they were executed in his presence before his headquarters, although he knew that they had been promoted to higher positions by <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> because of that very act. By this deed, while he increased his reputation, he lost favor at court; but he speedily regained it by detecting the treachery of a Roman eques, whose slaves betrayed their master's design of killing the emperor. For in consequence of this, the Senate conferred a very unusual honor on him by setting up his statue in the Palace; and <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> also enrolled him among the patricians, and after praising him in the highest terms, added these words: a man of greater loyalty than I can even pray for in my own children. By Albia <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a>, a woman of an illustrious line, he had two sons, Lucius <a href=/people/6028 target=_blank>Titianus</a>, and a younger called Marcus, who had the same surname as himself; also a daughter, whom he betrothed to <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>, son of <a href=/people/380 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>, almost before she was of marriageable age. </p>                        </div>

After his father's death he pretended love for an influential freedwoman of the court, although she was an old woman and almost decrepit, that he might more effectually win her favor. Having through her wormed his way into <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>'s good <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a>, he easily held the first place among the emperor's friends because of the similarity of their characters; but according to some, also through immoral relations.

Then hurriedly entering a closed litter, such as women use, he hurried to the camp, but got out when the bearers' strength flagged, and started to run. His shoe came untied and he stopped, whereupon without delay he was at once taken up on the shoulders of his companions and hailed as emperor.

When he at last woke up at about daylight, he stabbed himself with a single stroke under the left breast; and now concealing the wound, and now showing it to those who rushed in at his first groan, he breathed his last and was hastily buried (for such were his orders) in the thirty-eighth year of his age and on the ninety-fifth day of his reign. </p>                        </div>

He is said to have been of moderate height, splay-footed and bandy-legged, but almost feminine in his care of his person. He had the hair of his body plucked out, and because of the thinness of his locks wore a wig so carefully fashioned and fitted to his head, that no one suspected it. Moreover, they say that he used to shave every day and smear his face with moist bread, beginning the practice with the appearance of the first down, so as never to have a beard; also that he used to celebrate the rites of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> publicly in the linen garment prescribed by the cult. I am inclined to think that it was because of these habits that a death so little in harmony with his life excited the greater marvel. Many of the soldiers who were present kissed his hands and feet as he lay dead, weeping bitterly and calling him the bravest of men and an incomparable emperor, and then at once slew themselves beside his bier. Many of those who were absent too, on receiving the news, attacked and killed one another from sheer grief. In short, the greater part of those who had hated him most bitterly while he lived lauded him to the skies when he was dead; and it was even commonly declared that he had put an end to <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>, not so much for the sake of ruling as of restoring the republic and liberty. <br />END </p>                        </div>

We have a book of Quintus Elogius addressed to Quintus <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>, quaestor of the Deified <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, in which it is written that the <a href=/people/8491 target=_blank>Vitellii</a> were sprung from <a href=/people/800 target=_blank>Faunus</a>, king of the Aborigines, and Vitellia, who was worshipped as a goddess in many places; and that they ruled in all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=place long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latium</a>.

Quintus lost his rank at the time when it was resolved, at the suggestion of <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, to depose and get rid of undesirable Senators. Publius, a member of <a href=/people/380 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>' staff, arraigned Gnaeus <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, the enemy and murderer of his commander, and secured his condemnation. Arrested among the accomplices of <a href=/people/5249 target=_blank>Seianus</a>, after holding the praetorship, and handed over to his own brother to be kept in confinement, he opened his veins with a penknife, but allowed himself to be bandaged and restored, not so much from unwillingness to die, as because of the entreaties of his friends; and he met a natural death while still in confinement.

He was an honest and active man, but of very ill repute because of his passion for a freedwoman, which went so far that he used her spittle mixed with honey to rub on his throat and jaws as a medicine, not secretly nor seldom, but openly and every day. He had also a wonderful gift for flattery and was the first to begin to worship Gaius <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a> as a god; for on his return from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> he did not presume to approach the emperor except with veiled beads, turning himself about and then prostrating himself. To neglect no means of gaining the favor of <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, who was a slave to his wives and freedmen, he begged of <a href=/people/2634 target=_blank>Messalina</a>, as the highest possible favor, that she would allow him to take off her shoes; and when he had taken off her right slippers he constantly carried it about between his toga and his tunic, and sometimes kissed it. <a href=/people/10943 target=_blank>Narcissus</a> also and <a href=/people/10899 target=_blank>Pallas</a> he honored by cherishing their images among his household gods.

For when he had begun his march, he rode through the middle of the cities like a triumphing general, and on the rivers he sailed in most exquisite craft wreathed with various kinds of garlands, amid lavish entertainments with no discipline among his household or the soldiers, making a jest of the pillage and wantonness of all his followers. For not content with the banquets which were furnished them everywhere at public expense, they set free whatever slaves they pleased, promptly paying those who remonstrated with blows and stripes, often with wounds, and sometimes with death. When he came to the plains where the battle was fought and some shuddered with horror at the moldering corpses, he had the audacity to encourage them by the abominable saying, that the odor of a dead enemy was sweet and that of a fellow-citizen sweeter still. But nevertheless, the better to bear the awful stench, he openly drained a great draught of unmixed wine and distributed some among the troops. With equal bad taste and arrogance, gazing upon the stone inscribed to the memory of <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a>, he declared that he deserved such a mausoleum, and sent the dagger with which his rival had killed himself to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/509070UCol class=place long=6.9582 lat=50.9413>Colonia Agrippinensis</a>, to be dedicated to <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>.

Moreover, he had himself invited to each of these meals by different men on the same day, and the materials for any one of them never cost less than four hundred thousand sesterces.

This he did in various treacherous ways, even giving poison to one of them with his own hand in a glass of cold water, for which the man had called when ill of a fever.

A Roman eques also, who cried as he was being taken off to execution, You are my heir, he compelled to show his will; and reading that one of the man's freedmen was put down as joint-heir with himself, he ordered the death both of the eques and the freedman. He even killed some of the common people, merely because they had openly spoken ill of the Blue factions, thinking that they had ventured to do this from contempt of himself and the anticipation of a change of rulers. But he was especially hostile to writers of lampoons and to astrologers, and whenever any one of them was accused he put him to death without trial, particularly incensed because after a proclamation of his in which he ordered the astrologers to leave the city and Italia before the Kalends of October, a placard was at once posted, reading: By proclamation of the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a>, God bless the State!

He was brought up under the care of his paternal grandmother <a href=/people/5273 target=_blank>Tertulla</a> on her estates at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424113UCos class=place long=11.2877 lat=42.4126>Cosa</a>. Therefore, even after he became emperor, he used constantly to visit the home of his infancy, where the manor house was kept in its original condition, since he did not wish to miss anything which he was wont to see there; and he was so devoted to his grandmother's memory, that on religious and festival days he always drank from a little silver cup that had belonged to her. After assuming the garb of manhood, he for a long time made no attempt to win the broad stripe of senator, though his brother had gained it, and only his mother could finally induce him to sue for it. She at length drove him to it, but rather by sarcasm than by entreaties or parental authority, since she constantly taunted him with being his brother's footman. He served in Thrakia as tribune of the soldiers; as quaestor was assigned by lot to the province of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Kyrene</a>; became a candidate for the aedileship and then for the praetorship, attaining the former only after one defeat and then barely landing in the sixth place, but the latter on his first canvass and among the foremost. In his praetorship, to lose no opportunity of winning the favor of Gaius, who was at odds with the Senate, he asked for special games because of the emperor's victory in <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germania</a> and recommended, as an additional punishment of the conspirators that they be cast out unburied. He also thanked the emperor before that illustrious body because he had deigned to honor him with an invitation to dinner. </p>                        </div>

For this he received the triumphal regalia, and shortly after two priesthoods, besides the consulship, which he held for the last two months of the year. The rest of the time up to his proconsulate he spent in rest and retirement, through fear of <a href=/people/720 target=_blank>Agrippina</a>, who still had a strong influence over her son and hated any friend of <a href=/people/10943 target=_blank>Narcissus</a>, even after the latter's death. The chance of the lot then gave him Africa, which he governed with great justice and high honor, save that in a riot at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358106UHad class=place long=10.6387 lat=35.8258>Hadrumetum</a> he was pelted with turnips. Certain it is that he came back none the richer, for his credit was so nearly gone that he mortgaged all his estates to his brother, and had to resort to trading in mules to keep up his position; whence he was commonly known as the Muleteer. He is also said to have been found guilty of squeezing two hundred thousand sesterces out of a young man for whom he obtained the broad stripe against his father's wish, and to have been severely rebuked in consequence. On the tour through Graecia, among the companions of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, he bitterly offended the emperor by either going out often while <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> was singing, or falling asleep, if he remained. Being in consequence banished not only from intimacy with the emperor but even from his public receptions, he withdrew to a little out-of-the-way town, until a province and an army were offered him while he was in hiding and in fear of his life. There had spread over all the Orient an old and established belief, that it was fated at that time for men coming from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judaea</a> to rule the world. This prediction, referring to the emperor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, as afterwards appeared from the event, the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judaea</a> took to themselves; accordingly they revolted and after killing their governor, they routed the consular ruler of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> as well, when he came to the rescue, and took one of his <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a>. Since to put down this rebellion required a considerable army with a leader of no little enterprise, yet one to whom so great power could be entrusted without risk, <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> was chosen for the task, both as a man of tried energy and as one in no wise to be feared because of the obscurity of his family and name. Therefore there were added to the forces in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judaea</a> two legions with eight divisions of cavalry and ten cohorts. He took his elder son as one of his lieutenants and as soon as he reached his province he attracted the attention of the neighboring provinces also; for he at once reformed the discipline of the army and fought one or two battles with such daring, that in the storming of a fortress he was wounded in the knee with a stone and received several arrows in his shield. </p>                        </div>

On the suburban estate of the Flavii an old oak tree, which was sacred to <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, on each of the three occasions when Vespasia was delivered, suddenly put forth a branch from its trunk, obvious indications of the destiny of each child. The first was slender and quickly withered, and so too the girl that was born died within the year; the second was very strong and long and portended great success, but the third was the image of a tree. Therefore, their father <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a>, so they say, being further encouraged by an inspection of victims, announced to his mother that a grandson had been born to her who would be a <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. But she only laughed, marveling that her son should already be in his dotage, while she was still of strong mind. Later, when <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> was aedile, <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Gaius Caesar</a>, incensed at his neglect of his duty of cleaning the streets, ordered that he be covered with mud, which the soldiers accordingly heaped into the bosom of his fringed toga; this some interpreted as an omen that one day in some civil commotion his country, trampled under foot and forsaken, would come under his protection and as it were into his embrace. Once when he was taking breakfast, a stray <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> brought in a human hand from the cross-roads and dropped it under the table. Again, when he was dining, an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> that was ploughing shook off its yoke, burst into the dining-room, and after scattering the servants, fell at the very feet of <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> as he reclined at table, and bowed its neck as if suddenly tired out. A cypress tree, also, on his grandfather's farm was torn up by the roots, without the agency of any violent storm, and thrown down, and on the following day rose again greener and stronger than before. He dreamed in Greece that the beginning of good fortune for himself and his family would come as soon as <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> had a tooth extracted; and on the next day it came to pass that a physician walked into the hall, and showed him a tooth which he had just then taken out. When he consulted the oracle of the god of Carmel in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judaea</a>, the lots were highly encouraging, promising that whatever he planned or wished, however great it might be, would come to pass; and one of his highborn prisoners, <a href=/people/1222 target=_blank>Josephus</a> by name, as he was being put in chains, declared most confidently that he would soon be released by the same man, who would then, however, be emperor. Omens were also reported from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>: <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> in his latter days was admonished in a dream to take the sacred chariot of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> Optimus Maximus from its shrine to the house of <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> and from there to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCiM class=place long=12.4871 lat=41.8852>Circus</a>. Not long after this, too, when <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a> was on his way to the elections which gave him his second consulship, a statue of the Deified <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Julius</a> of its own accord turned towards the East; and on the field of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/451104UBed class=place long=10.4424 lat=45.1295>Betriacum</a>, before the battle began, two <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> fought in the sight of all, and when one was vanquished a third came from the direction of the rising sun and drove off the victor. </p>                        </div>

Two thousand soldiers of the three legions that made up the army in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440205RMys class=place long=20.5 lat=44>Moesia</a> had been sent to help <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a>.

There, taking advantage of the lawless state of the times, they indulged in every kind of pillage; then, fearing that if they went back, they would have to give an account and suffer punishment, they took it into their heads to select and appoint an emperor, saying that they were just as good as the Army of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390000RIbe class=place long=-4 lat=39>Hispania</a> which had appointed <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>, or the Praetorian Guard which had elected <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a>, or the Army of <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germania</a> which had chosen <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>. Accordingly, the names of all the consular governors who were serving anywhere were taken up, and since objection was made to the rest for one reason or another, while some members of the third legion, which had been transferred from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440205RMys class=place long=20.5 lat=44>Moesia</a> just before the death of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, highly commended <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, they unanimously agreed on him and forthwith inscribed his name on all their banners. At the time, however, the movement was checked and the soldiers recalled to their allegiance for a season. But when their action became known, <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius Alexander</a>, prefect of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, was the first to compel his legions to take the oath for <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> on the Kalends of July, the day which was afterwards celebrated as that of his accession; then the army in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judaea</a> swore allegiance to him personally on the fifth day before the Ides of July. The enterprise was greatly forwarded by the circulation of a copy of a letter of the late emperor <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a> to <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, whether genuine or forged, urging him with the utmost earnestness to vengeance, and expressing the hope that he would come to the aid of his country; further, by a rumor which spread abroad that <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> had planned, after his victory, to change the winter quarters of the legions and to transfer those in <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germania</a> to the Orient, to a safer and milder service; and finally, among the governors of provinces, by the support of <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> <a href=/people/1246 target=_blank>Mucianus</a>, and among the kings, by that of <a href=/people/2358 target=_blank>Vologaesus</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a>.

There he dismissed all his attendants and entered the Temple of <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Serapis</a> alone, to consult the auspices as to the duration of his power. And when after many propitiary offerings to the god he at length turned about, it seemed to him that his freedman <a href=/people/5500 target=_blank>Basilides</a> offered him sacred boughs, garlands and loaves, as is the custom there; and yet he knew well that no one had let him in, and that for some time he had been hardly able to walk by reason of rheumatism, and was besides far away.

A man of the people who was blind, and another who was lame, came to him together as he sat on the tribunal, begging for the help for their disorders which <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Serapis</a> had promised in a dream; for the god declared that <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> would restore the eyes, if he would spit upon them, and give strength to the leg, if he would deign to touch it with his heel. Though he had hardly any faith that this could possibly succeed, and therefore shrank even from making the attempt, he was at last prevailed upon by his friends and tried both things in public before a large crowd; and with success. At this same time, by the direction of certain soothsayers, some vases of antique workmanship were dug up in a consecrated spot at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375224PTeg class=place long=22.429 lat=37.464>Tegea</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a> and on them was an image very like <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>. </p>                        </div>

The soldiery, some emboldened by their victory, and some resenting their humiliating defeat, had abandoned themselves to every form of licence and recklessness; the provinces, too, and the free cities, as well as some of the kingdoms, were in a state of internal dissension. Therefore, he discharged many of the soldiers of <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> and punished many; but so far from showing any special indulgence to those who had shared in his victory, he was even tardy in paying them their lawful rewards. To let slip no opportunity of improving military discipline, when a young man reeking with perfumes came to thank him for a commission which had been given him, <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> drew back his head in disgust, adding the stern reprimand: I would rather you had smelt of garlic; and he revoked the appointment.

Yet many of his remarks are still remembered which are full of fine wit, and among them the following. When an ex-consul called Mestrius <a href=/people/1425 target=_blank>Florus</a> called his attention to the fact that the proper pronunciation was plaustra rather than plostra, he greeted him next day as Flaurus. When he was importuned by a woman, who said that she was dying with love for him, he took her to his bed and gave her four hundred thousand sesterces for her favors.

But he particularly resorted to witticisms about his unseemly means of gain, seeking to diminish their odium by some jocose saying and to turn them into a jest. Having put off one of his favorite attendants, who asked for a stewardship for a pretended brother, he summoned the candidate himself, and after compelling him to pay him as much money as he had agreed to give his advocate, appointed him to the position without delay. On his attendant's taking up the matter again, he said: Find yourself another brother; the man that you thought was yours is mine. On a journey, suspecting that his muleteer had got down to shoe the mules merely to make delay and give time for a man with a lawsuit to approach the emperor, he asked how much he was paid for shoeing the mules and insisted on a share of the money. When Titus found fault with him for contriving a tax upon public toilets, he held a piece of money from the first payment to his son's nose, asking whether its odor was offensive to him. When Titus said No, he replied, Yet it comes from urine. On the report of a deputation that a colossal statue of great cost had been voted him at public expense, he demanded to have it set up at once, and holding out his open hand, said that the base was ready.

He was suspected of greed as well; for it was well known that in cases which came before his father he put a price on his influence and accepted bribes. In short, people not only thought, but openly declared, that he would be a second <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>. But this reputation turned out to his advantage and gave place to the highest praise, when no fault was discovered in him, but on the contrary the highest virtues.

Moreover, in the case of other requests made of him, it was his fixed rule not to let anyone go away without hope. Even when his household officials warned him that he was promising more than he could perform, he said that it was not right for anyone to go away sorrowful from an interview with his emperor. On another occasion, remembering at dinner that he had done nothing for anybody all that day, he gave utterance to that memorable and praiseworthy remark: Friends, I have lost a day. The whole body of the people in particular he treated with such indulgence on all occasions, that once, at a gladiatorial show, he declared that he would give it, not after his own inclinations, but ;hose of the spectators; and what is more, he kept his word. For he refused nothing which anyone asked, and even urged them to ask for what they wished. Furthermore, he openly displayed his partiality for Thracian gladiators and bantered the people about it by words and gestures, always, however, preserving his dignity, as well as observing justice. Not to omit any act of condescension, he sometimes bathed in the baths which he had built, in company with the common people.

In these many great calamities he showed not merely the concern of an emperor, but even a father's surpassing love, now offering consolation in edicts, and now lending aid so far as his means allowed. He chose commissioners by lot from among the ex-consuls for the relief of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>; and the property of those who lost their lives by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408144LVes class=place long=14.425 lat=40.8216>Vesuvius</a> and had no heirs left alive he applied to the rebuilding of the buried cities. During the fire in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> he made no remark except I am ruined, and he set aside all the ornaments of his villas for the public buildings and temples, and put several men of the equestrian order in charge of the work, that everything might be done with the greater dispatch. For curing the plague and diminishing the force of the epidemic there was no aid, human or divine, which he did not employ, searching for every kind of sacrifice, and all kinds of medicines. Among the evils of the times were the informers and their instigators, who had enjoyed a long standing licence. After these had been soundly beaten in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a> with scourges and cudgels, and finally led in procession across the arena of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BAmF class=place long=12.4926 lat=41.8901>amphitheatre</a>, he had some of them put up and sold, and others deported to the wildest of the islands. To further discourage for all time any who might think of venturing on similar practices, among other precautions he made it unlawful for anyone to be tried under several laws for the same offence, or for any inquiry to be made as to the legal status of any deceased person after a stated number of years. </p>                        </div>

When two men of patrician family were found guilty of aspiring to the throne, he satisfied himself with warning them to abandon their attempt, saying that imperial power was the gift of fate, and promising that if there was anything else they desired, he himself would bestow it. Then he sent his couriers with all speed to the mother of one of them, for she was some distance off, to relieve her anxiety by reporting that her son was safe; and he not only invited the men themselves to dinner among his friends, but on the following day at a gladiatorial show he purposely placed them near him, and when the swords of the contestants were offered him, handed them over for their inspection. It is even said that inquiring into the horoscope of each of them, he declared that danger threatened them both, but at some future time and from another, as turned out to be the case. Although his brother never ceased plotting against him, but almost openly stirred up the armies to revolt and meditated flight to them, he had not the heart to put him to death or banish him from the court, or even to hold him in less honor than before. On the contrary, as he had done from the very first day of his rule, he continued to declare that he was his partner and successor, and sometimes he privately begged him with tears and prayers to be willing at least to return his affection. </p>                        </div>

He is said to have passed the period of his boyhood and his early youth in great poverty and infamy. For he did not possess a single piece of plate and it is a well known fact that <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> <a href=/people/701 target=_blank>Pollio</a>, a man of praetorian rank, against whom <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>'s poem entitled The One-eyed Man is directed, preserved a letter in <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>'s handwriting and sometimes exhibited it, in which the future emperor promised him an assignation; and there have not been wanting those who declared that <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> was also debauched by <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a>, who succeeded him. In the war with <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> he took refuge in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> with his paternal uncle <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a> and a part of the forces under him. When the enemy forced an entrance and the temple was fired, he hid during the night with the guardian of the shrine, and in the morning, disguised in the garb of a follower of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> and mingling with the priests of that fickle superstition, he went across the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> with a single companion to the mother of one of his school-fellows. There he was so effectually concealed, that though he was closely followed, he could not be found, in spite of a thorough search. It was only after the victory that he ventured forth and after being hailed as <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, he assumed the office of city praetor with consular powers, but only in name, turning over all the judicial business to his next colleague. But he exercised all the tyranny of his high position so lawlessly, that it was even then apparent what sort of a man he was going to be. Not to mention all details, after making free with the wives of many men, he went so far as to marry <a href=/people/3584 target=_blank>Domitia</a> Longina, who was the wife of <a href=/people/499 target=_blank>Aelius</a> <a href=/people/694 target=_blank>Lamia</a>, and in a single day he assigned more than twenty positions in the city and abroad, which led <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> to say more than once that he was surprised that he did not appoint the emperor's successor with the rest. </p>                        </div>

For this he was reprimanded, and to give him a better realization of his youth and position, he had to live with his father, and when they appeared in public he followed the emperor's chair and that of his brother in a litter, while he also attended their triumph over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judaea</a> riding on a white <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> . Moreover, of his six consulships, only one was a regular one, and he obtained that only because his brother gave place to him and recommended his appointment. He himself, too, made a remarkable pretense of modesty and especially of an interest in poetry, an art which had previously been as unfamiliar to him as it was later despised and rejected, and he even gave readings in public. Yet in spite of all this, when <a href=/people/2358 target=_blank>Vologaesus</a>, King of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, had asked for auxiliaries against the <a href=/people/2232 target=_blank>Alani</a> and for one of <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>'s sons as their leader, <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> used every effort to have himself sent rather than <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a>; and because the affair came to nothing, he tried by gifts and promises to induce other eastern kings to make the same request. On the death of his father he hesitated for some time whether to offer a double largess to the soldiers, and he never had any compunction about saying that he had been left a partner in the imperial power, but that the will had been tampered with. And from that time on he never ceased to plot against his brother secretly and openly, until <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a> was seized with a dangerous illness, when <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> ordered that he be left for dead, before he had actually drawn his last breath.

During the whole of every gladiatorial show there always stood at his feet a small boy clad in scarlet, with an abnormally small head, with whom he used to talk a great deal, and sometimes seriously.

For there were competitions in prose declamations both in Greek and in Latin; and in addition to those of the lyre-players, between choruses of such players and in the lyre alone, without singing; while in the stadium there were races even between maidens. He presided at the competitions in half-boots clad in a purple toga in the Greek fashion, and wearing upon his head a golden crown with figures of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>, and <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>, while by his side sat the priest of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> and the college of the Flaviales, similarly dressed, except that their crowns bore his image as well.

He prohibited the castration of males, and kept down the price of the eunuchs that remained in the hands of the slave dealers. Once upon the occasion of a plentiful wine crop, attended with a scarcity of grain, thinking that the fields were neglected through too much attention to the vineyards, he made an edict forbidding anyone to plant more vines in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and ordering that the vineyards in the provinces be cut down, or but half of them at most be left standing; but he did not persist in carrying out the measure.

To abuse men's patience the more insolently, he never pronounced an unusually dreadful sentence without a preliminary declaration of clemency, so that there came to be no more certain indication of a cruel death than the leniency of his preamble. He had brought some men charged with treason into the Senate, and when he had introduced the matter by saying that he would find out that day how dear he was to the members, he had no difficulty in causing them to be condemned to suffer the ancient method of punishments. Then, appalled at the cruelty of the penalty, he interposed a veto, to lessen the odium, in these words (for it will be of interest to know his exact language): Allow me, Fathers of the Senate, to prevail on you by your love for me to grant a favor which I know I shall obtain with difficulty, namely that you grant the condemned free choice of the manner of their death; for thus you will spare your own eyes and all men will know that I was present at the meeting of the Senate. </p>                        </div>

The property of the living and the dead was seized everywhere on any charge brought by any accuser. It was enough to allege any action or word derogatory to the majesty of the princeps. Estates of those in no way connected with him were confiscated, if but one man came forward to declare that he had heard from the deceased during his lifetime that <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was his heir.

I recall being present in my youth when the person of a man ninety years old was examined before the procurator and a very crowded court, to see whether he was circumcised.

With no less arrogance he began as follows in dictating a circular letter in the name of his procurators, Our Master and our God bids that this be done. And so the custom arose of henceforth addressing him in no other way, even in writing or in conversation. He suffered no statues to be set up in his honor in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, except of gold and silver and of a fixed weight.

He held the consulship seventeen times, more often than any of his predecessors.

In his youth astrologers had predicted all this to him, and his father once even openly ridiculed him at dinner for refusing mushrooms, saying that he showed himself unaware of his destiny in not rather fearing the sword. Therefore he was at all times timorous and worried, and was disquieted beyond measure by even the slightest suspicions. It is thought that nothing had more effect in inducing him to ignore his proclamation about cutting down the vineyards than the circulation of notes containing the following lines: Gnaw at my root, an you will; even then shall I have juice in plenty To pour upon thee, O <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>, when at the altar you stand . It was because of this same timorousness that although he was most eager for all such honors, he refused a new one which the Senate had devised and offered to him, a decree, namely, that whenever he held the consulship, Roman equites selected by lot should precede him among his lictors and attendants, clad in the trabea and bearing lances. As the time when he anticipated danger drew near, becoming still more anxious every day, he lined the walls of the colonnades in which he used to walk with phengite stone, to be able to see in its brilliant surface the reflection of all that went on behind his back. And he did not give a hearing to any prisoners except in private and alone, even holding their chains in his hands. Further, to convince his household that one must not venture to kill a patron even on good grounds, he condemned <a href=/people/2406 target=_blank>Epaphroditus</a>, his confidential secretary, to death, because it was believed that after <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> was abandoned the freedman's hand had aided him in taking his life. </p>                        </div>

And it was by this deed in particular that he hastened his own destruction. For eight successive months so many strokes of lightning occurred and were reported, that at last he cried: Well, let him now strike whom he will. The Temple of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=person long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitolinus</a> was struck and that of the Flavian family, as well as the Palace and the emperor's own bedroom. The inscription, too, on the base of a triumphal statue of his was torn off in a violent tempest and fell upon a neighboring tomb. The tree which had been overthrown when <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> was still a private citizen but had sprung up anew, then on a sudden fell down again. <a href=/people/1560 target=_blank>Fortuna</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418129UPra class=person long=12.8924 lat=41.8399>Praeneste</a> had throughout his whole reign, when he commended the new year to her protection, given him a favorable omen and always in the same words. Now at last she returned a most direful one, not without the mention of bloodshed. He dreamed that <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>, whom he worshipped with superstitious veneration, came forth from her shrine and declared that she could no longer protect him, since she had been disarmed by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>. Yet there was nothing by which he was so much disturbed as a prediction of the astrologer Ascletarion and what befell him. When this man was accused before the emperor and did not deny that he had spoken of certain things which he had foreseen through his art, he was asked what his own end could be. When he replied that he would shortly be rent by <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>, <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> ordered him killed at once; but to prove the fallibility of his art, he ordered besides that his funeral be attended to with the greatest care. While this was being done, it chanced that the pyre was overset by a sudden storm and that the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> mangled the corpse, which was only partly consumed; and that an actor of farces called <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a>, who happened to pass by and see the incident, told it to <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> at the dinner table, with the rest of the day's gossip. </p>                        </div>

At about midnight he was so terrified that he leaped from his bed. The next morning he conducted the trial of a soothsayer sent from <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germania</a>, who when consulted about the lightning strokes had foretold a change of rulers, and condemned him to death. While he was vigorously scratching a festered wart on his forehead, and had drawn blood, he said: May this be all. Then he asked the time, and by pre-arrangement the sixth hour was announced to him, instead of the fifth, which he feared. Filled with joy at this, and believing all danger now past, he was hastening to the bath, when his chamberlain <a href=/people/3441 target=_blank>Parthenius</a> changed his purpose by announcing that someone had called about a matter of great moment and would not be put off. Then he dismissed all his attendants and went to his bedroom, where he was slain. </p>                        </div>

As the conspirators were deliberating when and how to attack him, whether at the bath or at dinner, <a href=/people/309 target=_blank>Stephanus</a>, Domitilla's a steward, at the time under accusation for embezzlement, offered his aid and counsel. To avoid suspicion, he wrapped up his left arm in woollen bandages for some days, pretending that he had injured it, and concealed in them a dagger. Then pretending to betray a conspiracy and for that reason being given an audience, he stabbed the emperor in the groin as he was reading a paper which the assassin handed him, and stood in a state of amazement. As the wounded princeps attempted to resist, he was slain with seven wounds by <a href=/people/4124 target=_blank>Clodianus</a>, a servant, <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, a freedman of <a href=/people/3441 target=_blank>Parthenius</a>, Satur, decurion of the chamberlains, and a gladiator from the imperial school. A boy who was engaged in his usual duty of attending to the <a href=/people/12089 target=_blank>Lares</a> in the bedroom, and so was a witness of the murder, gave this additional information. He was bidden by <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>, immediately after he was dealt the first blow, to hand him the dagger hidden under his pillow and to call the servants; but he found nothing at the head of the bed save the hilt, and besides all the doors were closed. Meanwhile the emperor grappled with <a href=/people/309 target=_blank>Stephanus</a> and bore him to the ground, where they struggled for a long time, <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> trying now to wrest the dagger from his assailant's hands and now to gouge out his eyes with his lacerated fingers. He was slain on the fourteenth day before the Kalends of October in the forty-fifth year of his age and the fifteenth of his reign. His corpse was carried out on a common bier by those who bury the poor, and his nurse <a href=/people/2479 target=_blank>Phyllis</a> cremated it at her suburban estate on the Via Patina; but his ashes she secretly carried to the temple of the Flavian family and mingled them with those of <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/3477 target=_blank>Titus</a>, whom she had also reared. </p>                        </div>

His eyes were large, but his sight was somewhat dim. He was handsome and graceful too, especially when a young man, and indeed in his whole body with the exception of his feet, the toes of which were somewhat cramped. In later life he had the further disfigurement of baldness, a protruding belly, and spindling legs, though the latter had become thin from a long illness. He was so conscious that the modesty of his expression was in his favor, that he once made this boast in the Senate: So far, at any rate, you have approved my heart and my countenance. He was so sensitive about his baldness, that he regarded it as a personal insult if anyone else was twitted with that defect in jest or in earnest; though in a book On the Care of the Hair, which he published and dedicated to a friend, he wrote the following by way of consolation to the man and himself: Do you not see that I too am tall and comely to look on? And yet the same fate awaits my hair, and I bear with resignation the ageing of my locks in youth. Be assured that nothing is more pleasing than beauty, but nothing shorter-lived. </p>                        </div>

The senators, on the contrary, were so overjoyed that they raced to fill the Curia, where they did not refrain from assailing the dead emperor with the most insulting and stinging kind of outcries. They even had ladders brought and his shields and images torn down before their eyes and dashed upon the ground; finally they passed a decree that his inscriptions should everywhere be erased, and all record of him obliterated.
