Dialogue: <br />ZEUS: A curse on all those philosophers who will have it that none but the Gods are happy! If they could but know what we have to put up with on men's account, they would not envy us our nectar and our ambrosia. They take <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s word for it all, — the word of a blind quack; 'tis he who pronounces us blessed, and expatiates on heavenly glories, he who could not see in front of his own nose. Look at the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, now. He yokes that chariot, and is riding through the heavens from morn till night, clothed in his garment of fire, and dispensing his rays abroad; not so much breathing-space as goes to the scratching of an ear; once let his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> catch him napping, and they have the bit between their teeth and are off 'cross country, with the result that the <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> is scorched to a cinder. The Moon is no better off: she is kept up into the small hours to light the reveller and the diner-out upon their homeward path. And then <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, — he has his work cut out for him: with such a press of oracular business, it is much if he has any ears left to hear with: he is wanted at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>; the next minute, he must be off to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=place long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophon</a>; then away to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364293PXan class=place long=29.3182 lat=36.3565>Xanthus</a>; then back at a trot to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380272SKla class=place long=27.193 lat=38.0047>Clarus</a>; then it is <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a>, then <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374273SDid class=place long=27.2561 lat=37.3848>Branchidae</a>; — in short, he is at the beck of every priestess who has taken her draught of holy water, munched her laurel-leaf, and made the tripod rock; it is now or never; if he is not there that minute to reel off the required oracle, his credit is gone. The traps they set for him too! He must have a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>'s nose for <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a> and tortoise in the pot, or his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> customer departs, laughing him to scorn. As for <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>, he has no peace for his patients: his eyes are acquainted with horror, and his hands with loathsomeness; another's sickness is his pain. To say nothing of the work that the Winds have to get through, what with sowing and winnowing and getting the ships along; or of <a href=/people/422 target=_blank>Sleep</a>, always on the wing, with <a href=/people/2643 target=_blank>Dream</a> at his side all night giving a helping hand.

And the others have an easy time of it, compared to me, to me the King and Father of all. The annoyances I have to put up with! the worry of thinking of all these things at once! I must keep an eye on all the rest, to begin with, or they would be making some silly mistake; and as for the work I have to do with my own hands, there is no end to it; such complications! it is all I can do to get through with it. It is not as if I had only the main issues to attend to, the rain and hail and wind and lightning, and as soon as I had arranged them could sit down, feeling that my own particular work was over: no, besides all that, I must be looking every way at once, <a href=/people/493 target=_blank>Argus</a>-eyed for theft and perjury, as for sacrifice; the moment a libation has been poured, it is for me to locate the savoury smoke that rises; for me it is to hear the cry of the sick man and of the sailor; at one and the same moment, a hecatomb demands my presence at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>, a battle in the plain of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>; hail is due in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, dinner in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>; 'tis too much!

If I nod for a moment, behold, <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> is justified, and our indifference to the affairs of <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> made manifest; and if once men lend an ear to that doctrine, the consequences will be serious: our temples will go ungarlanded; the streets will be redolent no longer of roast meat, the bowl no longer yield us libation; our altars will be cold, sacrifice and oblation will be at an end, and utter starvation must ensue. Hence like a pilot I stand up at the helm all alone, tiller in hand, while every soul on board is asleep, and probably drunk; no rest, no food for me, while I ponder in my mind and breast on the common safety; and my reward? to be called the Lord of all!

Some have absorbed the full quantity of dye; these are perfect specimens of her art, and show no admixture of other colours; with them you will find a ready reception. But others, owing to their original impurities, are not yet completely saturated; they are better than the generality of mankind, but they are not all they should be; they are piebald or spotted or dappled. Others again there are who have contented themselves with merely rubbing a fingertip in the soot on the outside of the cauldron, and smearing themselves with that; after which they consider the dyeing process complete. </p>                        </div>

In support of my statements, I appeal to every man in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> to say whether he had ever seen <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> sober. But in an evil hour for him, his revels, which had brought him to so many other doors, brought him at length to my own. I laid hands on him, tore him away by brute force from the plaintiff, and made him my own; giving him water to drink, teaching him sobriety, and stripping him of his garlands. He, who should have been sitting over his wine, now became acquainted with the perverse, the harassing, the pernicious quibbles of philosophy. Alas! the ruddy glow has departed from his cheek; he is pale and wasted; his songs are all forgotten; there are times when he will sit far on into the night, tasting neither meat nor drink, while he reels out the meaningless platitudes with which I have so abundantly supplied him. I have even incited him to attack the character of my client, and to utter a thousand base insinuations against her good fame. The case of Drink is now complete. I proceed to state my own. Let my time be taken. <br />JUST: What will the defendant have to say to that, I wonder? Give her the same time allowance. </p>                        </div>

And yet, if you will give me your favourable attention, I shall convince you that the plaintiff has suffered no wrong at my hands. This <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a>, whom plaintiff claims as her servant, so far from having any natural connexion with her, is one whose excellent parts entitle him to claim kinship and affinity with myself. He was still a boy, his powers were yet unformed, when plaintiff, aided and abetted by <a href=/people/626 target=_blank>Pleasure</a> — ever her partner in crime — seized upon him, and delivered him over into the clutches of debauchery and dissipation, under whose corrupt influence the unfortunate young man utterly lost all sense of shame. Those very facts that plaintiff supposed to be so many arguments in her favour will be found, on the contrary, to make for my own case. From early morning (as my learned friend has just observed) did the misguided <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a>, with aching head and garlanded, stagger through the open market to the noise of flutes, never sober, brawling with all he met; a reproach to his ancestors and his city, a laughing-stock to foreigners. One day he reached my door. He found it open: I was discoursing to a company of my disciples, as is my wont, upon virtue and temperance. He stood there, with the flute-girl at his side and the garlands on his head, and sought at first to drown our conversation with his noisy outcry. But we paid no heed to him, and little by little our words produced a sobering effect, for Drink had not entire possession of him: he bade the flute-girl cease, tore off his garlands, and looked with shame at his luxurious dress. Like one waking from deep sleep, he saw himself as he was, and repented of his past life; the flush of drunkenness faded and vanished from his cheek, and was succeeded by a blush of shame; at last, not (as plaintiff would have you believe) in response to any invitation of mine, nor under any compulsion, but of his own free will, and in the conviction of my superiority, he renounced his former mistress there and then, and entered my service. Bring him into court. You shall see for yourselves, gentlemen, what he has become under my treatment. Behold that <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> whom I found drunk, unable to speak or stand upright, an object of ridicule: I turned him from his evil ways; I taught him sobriety; and I present him to you, no longer a slave, but a decent and orderly citizen, a credit to his nation. In conclusion let me say that the change I have wrought in him has won me the gratitude not only of <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> himself but of all his friends. Which of us has been the more profitable companion for him, it is now for the jury to decide. <br />HERM: Come, gentlemen, get up and give your votes.

I see how your eyes turn in her direction; she has your smiles, I your contempt, because my hair is close-cropped, and my expression stern and masculine. Yet if you will give me a fair hearing, I fear her not; for justice is on my side. Nay, it is with these same meretricious attractions of hers that my accusation is concerned: it was by her specious appearance that she beguiled the virtuous <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, my lover, and drew him to herself. The present case is in fact closely allied with that of Drink and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAca class=place long=23.707 lat=37.992>Academy</a>, with which your colleagues have just dealt. The question now before you is this: are men to live the lives of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>, wallowing in voluptuousness, with never a high or noble thought: or are they to set virtue above enjoyment, and follow the dictates of freedom and philosophy, fearing not to grapple with pain, nor seeking the degrading service of pleasure, as though happiness were to be found in a pot of honey or a cake of figs? These are the baits my adversary throws out for fools, and toil the bugbear with which she frightens them: her artifices seldom fail; and among her victims is this unfortunate whom she has constrained to rebel against my authority. She had to wait till she found him on a sick-bed; never while he was himself would he have listened to her proposals. Yet what right have I to complain? She spares not even the Gods; she impugns the wisdom of Providence; she is guilty of blasphemy; you have a double penalty to impose, if you would be wise. I hear that she has not even been at the pains of preparing a defence: <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> is to speak for her! She does not stand upon ceremony with you, gentlemen. — Ask her what <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> would have been, what your own <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a> would have been, if they had listened to the voice of pleasure, and shrunk back from toil: their toils were the only check upon wickedness, which else must have overrun the whole <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>. And now I have done; I am no lover of long speeches. Yet if my adversary would consent to answer a few questions, her worthlessness would soon appear. Let me remind you, gentlemen, of your oath: give your votes in accordance with that oath, and believe not <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, when he tells you that the Gods take no thought for the things of <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>. <br />HERM: Stand down, madam. <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> will now speak on behalf of pleasure. <br />EPI: I shall not detain you long, gentlemen of the jury; there </p>                        </div>

On the other hand, if a free citizen of a free state, deciding for himself in a matter where the law is silent, takes a violent aversion to this lady's person, concludes that the blessedness with which she promises to crown his labours is neither more nor less than moonshine, and accordingly makes the best of his way out of her labyrinthine maze of argument into the attractive arms of <a href=/people/626 target=_blank>Pleasure</a>, bursts the bonds of verbal subtlety, exchanges credulity for common sense, and pronounces, with great justice, that toil is toilsome, and that pleasure is pleasant, — I ask, is this shipwrecked mariner to be excluded from the calm haven of his desire, and hurled back headlong into a sea of toil? is this poor suppliant at the altar of <a href=/people/2103 target=_blank>Mercy</a> — in other words of <a href=/people/626 target=_blank>Pleasure</a> — is he to be delivered over into the power of perplexity, — and all on the chance that his hot climb up the steep hill of <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a> may be rewarded with a glimpse of that celebrated lady on the top, and his life of toil followed by a hereafter of happiness? We could scarcely ask for a better judge of the matter than <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> himself. He was as familiar with the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a> doctrines as any man, and held at one time that virtue was the only Good: but he presently discovered that toil was an evil: he then chose what seemed to him the better course. He would no doubt observe that those philosophers who had so much to say on the subject of patience and endurance under toil were secretly the servants of <a href=/people/626 target=_blank>Pleasure</a>, carefully abiding by her laws in their own homes, though they made so free with her name in their discourses. They cannot bear to be detected in any relaxation, or any departure from their principles: but, poor men, they lead a <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a> life of it in consequence, and when they do get a chance of sinning without being found out, they drink down pleasure by the bucketful. Depend on it, if some one would make them a present of <a href=/people/870 target=_blank>Gyges</a>'s ring of invisibility, or <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>'s cap, they would cut the acquaintance of toil without further ceremony, and elbow their way into the presence of <a href=/people/626 target=_blank>Pleasure</a>; they would all be <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysiuses</a> then. As long as <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> was well, he thought that there was some good in all this talk about endurance; but when he fell ill, and found out what pain really was, he perceived that his body was of another school than the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BSPo class=place long=23.72265 lat=37.97635>Stoa</a>, and held quite other tenets: he was converted, realized that he was flesh and blood, and from that day ceased to behave as if he were made of marble; he knew now that the man who talks nonsense about the iniquity of pleasure But toys with words: his thoughts are bent elsewhither.

With this Dialogue, in spite of the disparity of age, he is now living; and is not ashamed to clip the wings of free, high-soaring eloquence, and submit himself to the comedian's fetters of bald question and answer. He, whose thoughts should have found utterance in thundering oratory, is content to weave a puny network of conversation. Such things may draw a smile from his audience, a nod, an unimpassioned wave of the hand, a murmur of approbation: they can never hope to evoke the deafening uproar of universal applause.

My suspicions were aroused, and I began to watch the direction of her eyes. To make a long story short, our street was nightly infested with the serenades of her tipsy gallants, some of whom, not content with knocking at our doors, threw aside all restraint, and forced their way into the house. These attentions amused and delighted my wife: she was commonly to be seen leaning over the parapet and listening to the loose ditties that were bawled up from below; and when she thought she was unobserved, she would even open the door, and admit the gallant to her shameless embraces.

Gentlemen, you will remain and hear this second case, and will receive a double fee. Dialogue: If I had had my choice, gentlemen, I should have addressed you in the conversational style to which I am accustomed, instead of delivering a long harangue. However, I must conform to the custom of the law-courts, though I have neither skill nor experience in such matters. So much by way of exordium: and now for the outrage committed on me by the defendant. In former days, gentlemen, I was a person of exalted character: my speculations turned upon the Gods, and Nature, and the Annus <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a>; I trod those aerial plains wherein <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> on winged car is borne along through the heights. My flight had actually brought me to the heavenly vault; I was just setting foot upon the upper surface of that dome, when this Syrian took it upon himself to drag me down, break my wings, and reduce me to the common level of humanity. Whisking off the seemly tragic mask I then wore, he clapped on in its place a comic one that was little short of ludicrous: his next step was to huddle me into a corner with Jest, Lampoon, Cynicism, and the comedians <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a> and <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>, persons with a horrible knack of making light of sacred things, and girding at all that is as it should be. But the climax was reached when he unearthed a barking, snarling old <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynic</a>, <a href=/people/621 target=_blank>Menippus</a> by name, and thrust his company upon me; a grim bulldog, if ever there was one; a treacherous brute that will snap at you while his tail is yet wagging. Could any man be more abominably misused? Stripped of my proper attire, I am made to play the buffoon, and to give expression to every whimsical absurdity that his caprice dictates. And, as if that were not preposterous enough, he has forbidden me either to walk on my feet or to rise on the wings of poesy: I am a ridiculous cross between prose and verse; a monster of incongruity; a literary <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaur</a>. <br />HERM: Now, Syrian: what do you say to that? </p>                        </div>

Nothing could be more unexpected than the charge Dialogue has brought against me. When I first took him in hand, he was regarded by the world at large as one whose interminable discussions had soured his temper and exhausted his vitality. His labours entitled him to respect, but he had none of the attractive qualities that could secure him popularity. My first step was to accustom him to walk upon the common ground like the rest of mankind; my next, to make him presentable, by giving him a good bath and teaching him to smile. Finally, I assigned him Comedy as his yokefellow, thus gaining him the confidence of his hearers, who until then would as soon have thought of picking up a hedgehog as of venturing into the thorny presence of Dialogue. But I know what the grievance is: he wants me to sit and discourse subtle nothings with him about the immortality of the soul, and the exact number of pints of pure homogeneous essence that went to the making of the universe, and the claims of rhetoric to be called a shadow of a fraction of statecraft, or a fourth part of flattery. He takes a curious pleasure in refinements of this kind; it tickles his vanity most deliciously to be told that not every man can see so far into the ideal as he. Evidently he expects me to conform to his taste in this respect; he is still hankering after those lost wings; his eyes are turned upwards; he cannot see the things that lie before his feet. I think there is nothing else he can complain of. He cannot say that I, who pass for a barbarian, have torn off his Greek dress, and replaced it with one like my own: that would have been another matter; to deprive him of his native garb were indeed a crime. Gentlemen, I have made my defence, as far as in me lies: I trust that your present verdict will confirm the former one. <br />HERM: Well I never! All ten are for you again. Only one dissentient, and he the same one as before. True to his envious principles, he must ever give his vote against his betters. The jurors may now leave the court. The remaining cases will come on tomorrow. </p>                        </div>
