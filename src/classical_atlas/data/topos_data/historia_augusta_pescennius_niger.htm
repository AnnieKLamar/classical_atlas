His father was <a href=/people/1125 target=_blank>Annius</a> <a href=/people/3602 target=_blank>Fuscus</a>, his mother Lampridia. His grandfather was the supervisor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415137UAqu class=place long=13.6916 lat=41.4983>Aquinum</a>, the town to which the family sought to trace its origin, though the fact is even now considered doubtful. 4 As for <a href=/people/11051 target=_blank>Pescennius</a> himself, he was passably well versed in literature, thrifty in his habits, and unbridled in indulgence in every manner of passion. 5 For a long time he commanded in the ranks, and finally, after holding many generalships, he reached the point where <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> named him to command the armies in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, chiefly on the recommendation of the athlete who afterward strangled <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>; for so, at that time, were all appointments made. </p>                        </div>

And this proved to be the case. <br />3 Now <a href=/people/11051 target=_blank>Pescennius</a> was on very friendly terms with <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> at the time that the latter was governor of the province of <a href=/people/7889 target=_blank>Lugdunensis</a>. 4 For he was sent to apprehend a body of deserters who were then ravaging Gaul in great numbers, 5 and because he conducted himself in this task with credit, he gained the esteem of <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, so much so, in fact, that the latter wrote to <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> about him, and averred that he was a man indispensable to the state. 6 And he was, indeed, a strict man in all things military. No soldier under his command ever forced a provincial to give him fuel, oil, or service. 7 He himself never accepted any presents from a soldier, and when he served as tribune he would not allow any to be accepted. 8 Even as emperor, when two tribunes were proved to have made deductions from the soldiers' rations, he ordered the auxiliaries to stone them. <br />9 There is extant a letter written by <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> to Ragonius <a href=/people/3007 target=_blank>Celsus</a>, who was then governor of Gaul: It is a pity that we cannot imitate the military discipline of this man whom we have overcome in war. 10 For your soldiers go straggling on all sides; the tribunes bathe in the middle of the day; they have cook-shops for mess-halls and, instead of barracks, brothels; they dance, they drink, they sing, and they regard as the proper limit to a banquet unlimited drinking. 11 How, pray, if any traces of our ancestral discipline still remained, could these things be? So, then, first reform the tribunes, and then the rank and file. For as long as these fear you, so long will you hold them in check. 12 But learn from <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> this also, that the soldiers cannot be made to fear you unless the tribunes and generals are irreproachable. </p>                        </div>

Presently, when advancing years shall make <a href=/people/499 target=_blank>Aelius</a> Corduenus retire from public life, I will make him a general. 5 Such were the opinions that all men had of him. And in truth <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> himself frequently declared that he would have pardoned him had he not persisted. <br />6 Finally, <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> appointed him consul, and advanced him thereby over <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, greatly indeed to the latter's wrath, since he thought that <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> had gained the consulship on the recommendation of the senior centurions. 7 Yet in his autobiography <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> says that on one occasion, when he had fallen sick and his sons had not yet reached an age when they could rule, he intended, if anything by any chance should happen to him, to appoint <a href=/people/11051 target=_blank>Pescennius</a> <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> and <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> as his heirs to the throne, even these two men who in time became his bitterest enemies. 8 From this it is evident what <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> thought of <a href=/people/11051 target=_blank>Pescennius</a>. </p>                        </div>

For though he understated the number of his years, after ruling eighteen years he died at the age of eighty-nine. <br />2 Now <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> dispatched <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heraclitus</a> to secure <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a> and <a href=/people/152 target=_blank>Fulvius</a> to seize <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a>'s adult children. 3 Nevertheless, although he had already heard that <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> had seized the empire, and although he himself was on the point of setting out to remedy the situation in the East, he made no mention of <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> in the senate. 4 In fact, on setting out, he did only this — namely, send troops to Africa, fearing that <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> would seize it and thereby distress the Roman people with a famine. 5 For such a plan was possible of accomplishment, it seemed, by way of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, the provinces adjacent to Africa, for all that it was no easy journey either by land or sea. 6 As for <a href=/people/11051 target=_blank>Pescennius</a>, he slew a multitude of distinguished men and got control of Greece, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, while <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> was still on his way to the East.

Soon after, <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> gave battle under the leadership of <a href=/people/1261 target=_blank>Aemilianus</a> and suffered defeat from <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>' generals. 8 Even then, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> promised him safety in exile if he would lay down his arms. <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a>, however, persisted and gave battle a second time, but was defeated; and in his flight while near the lake at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404279UCyz class=place long=27.8878 lat=40.3895>Cyzicus</a> he was wounded and was thus brought before <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, and presently he was dead. </p>                        </div>

His voice was so penetrating that when he spoke in the open he could be heard a thousand paces away, if the wind were not against him. His countenance was dignified and always somewhat ruddy; 6 his neck was so black that many men say that he was called <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> on this account. The rest of his body, however, was very white and he was inclined to be fat. He was fond of wine, sparing in his use of food, and as for intercourse with women, he abstained from it wholly save for the purpose of begetting children. 7 Indeed, certain religious rites in Gaul, which they always by common consent vote to the most chaste to celebrate, <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> himself performed. 8 On the rounded colonnade in the garden of Commodusa he is to be seen pictured in the mosaic among <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>' most intimate friends and performing the rites of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>. 9 To these rites <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> was so devoted as even to shave his head, carry the image of <a href=/people/1656 target=_blank>Anubis</a>, and make every one of the ritualistic pauses in the procession. <br />10 As a soldier, then, he was excellent; as a tribune, without peer; as a general, eminent; as a governor, stern; as a consul, distinguished; as a man, one to be noted both at home and abroad; but as an emperor, unlucky. Under <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, who was a forbidding sort of man, he might have been of use to the state had he been willing to cast in his lot with him. </p>                        </div>

For when a man consigns to books the lives of men who were not rulers in the state, or of those, again, who were not declared emperors by the senate, or, lastly, of those who were so quickly killed that they could not attain to fame, his task is difficult, as we said at the beginning of this work. 2 It is for this reason that <a href=/people/1489 target=_blank>Vindex</a> is obscure and <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> unknown, as well as all those others also who were merely adopted, or were hailed as emperors by the soldiers (as was <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> in <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>'s time), or were speedily slain and gave up their lives and their attempt at empire together. 3 It now remains for me to speak of <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>, who is considered this man's ally, in a way, since they rebelled against <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> similarly, and were similarly overcome by him and put to death.

At this same time he ordered that no one during the period of the campaign should build a hearth in his company-quarters, and that they should never eat freshly-cooked food, but should live on bread and cold water. And he set spies to see that this was done. 7 He gave orders, likewise, that the soldiers should not carry gold or silver coin in their money-belts when about to go into action, but should deposit them with a designated official. After the battle, he assured them, they would get back what they had deposited, or the official who had received it would pay it to their heirs — that is, their wives and children — without fail. Thus, he reasoned, no plunder would pass to the enemy, should fortune bring some disaster. 8 All these stern measures, however, worked to his disadvantage in times so slack as those of <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>. 9 For even if there was no one who seemed to his own times a sterner general, those measures availed to damage him rather during his life than after his death, when both envy and malice were laid by. </p>                        </div>
