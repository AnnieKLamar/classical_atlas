Or isn't it still early? <br />CRITO: Yes, very early. <br />SOCRATES: About what time? <br />CRITO: Just before dawn. <br />SOCRATES: I am surprised that the watchman of the prison was willing to let you in. <br />CRITO: He is used to me by this time, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, because I come here so often, and besides I have done something for him. <br />SOCRATES: Have you just come, or some time ago? <br />CRITO: Some little time ago. <br />SOCRATES: Then why did you not wake me at once, instead of sitting by me in silence? <br />CRITO: No, no, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, I only wish I myself were not so sleepless and sorrowful. But I have been wondering at you for some time, seeing how sweetly you sleep; and I purposely refrained from waking you, that you might pass the time as pleasantly as possible. I have often thought throughout your life hitherto that you were of a happy disposition, and I think so more than ever in this resent misfortune, since you bear it so easily and calmly. <br />SOCRATES: Well, <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a>, it would be absurd if at my age I were disturbed because I must die now. <br />CRITO: Other men as old, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, become involved in similar misfortunes, but their age does not in the least prevent them from being disturbed by their fate. <br />SOCRATES: That is true. But why have you come so early? <br />CRITO: To bring news, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, sad news, though apparently not sad to you, but sad and grievous me and all your friends, and to few of them, I think, so grievous as to me. <br />SOCRATES: What is this news? Has the ship come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a>, at the arrival of which I am to die? <br />CRITO: It has not exactly come, but I think it will come today from the reports of some men who have come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376240LSou class=place long=24.0247 lat=37.6498>Sounion</a> and left it there. Now it is clear from what they say that it will come today, and so tomorrow, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, your life must end. <br />SOCRATES: Well, <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a>, good luck be with us!

I must die on the day after the ship comes in, must I not? <br />CRITO: So those say who have charge of these matters. <br />SOCRATES: Well, I think it will not come in today, but tomorrow. And my reason for this is a dream which I had a little while ago in the course of this night. And perhaps you let me sleep just at the right time. <br />CRITO: What was the dream? <br />SOCRATES: I dreamed that a beautiful, fair woman, clothed in white raiment, came to me and called me and said, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, on the third day thou wouldst come to fertile <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393223RPht class=place long=22.5 lat=39.2>Phthia</a>. <br />CRITO: A strange dream, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>. <br />SOCRATES: No, a clear one, at any rate, I think, <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a>. <br />CRITO: Too clear, apparently. But, my dear <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, even now listen to me and save yourself. Since, if you die, it will be no mere single misfortune to me, but I shall lose a friend such as I can never find again, and besides, many persons who do not know you and me well will think I could have saved you if I had been willing to spend money, but that I would not take the trouble. And yet what reputation could be more disgraceful than that of considering one's money of more importance than one's friends? For most people will not believe that we were eager to help you to go away from here, but you refused. <br />SOCRATES: But, my dear <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a>, why do we care so much for what most people think? For the most reasonable men, whose opinion is more worth considering, will think that things were done as they really will be done. <br />CRITO: But you see it is necessary, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, to care for the opinion of the public, for this very trouble we are in now shows that the public is able to accomplish not by any means the least, but almost the greatest of evils, if one has a bad reputation with it. <br />SOCRATES: I only wish, <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a>, the people could accomplish the greatest evils, that they might be able to accomplish also the greatest good things. Then all would be well. But now they can do neither of the two; for they are not able to make a man wise or foolish, but they do whatever occurs to them. <br />CRITO: That may well be. But, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, tell me this: you are not considering me and your other friends, are you, fearing that, if you escape, the informers will make trouble for us by saying that we stole you away, and we shall be forced to lose either all our property or a good deal of money, or be punished in some other way besides? </p>                        </div>

Now please do as I ask. <br />SOCRATES: I am considering this, <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a>, and many other things. <br />CRITO: Well, do not fear this! for it is not even a large sum of money which we should pay to some men who are willing to save you and get you away from here. Besides, don't you see how cheap these informers are, and that not much money would be needed to silence them? And you have my money at your command, which is enough, I fancy; and moreover, if because you care for me you think you ought not to spend my money, there are foreigners here willing to spend theirs; and one of them, <a href=/people/386 target=_blank>Simmias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=person long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>, has brought for this especial purpose sufficient funds; and <a href=/people/521 target=_blank>Cebes</a> also and very many others are ready. So, as I say, do not give up saving yourself through fear of this. And do not be troubled by what you said in the court, that if you went away you would not know what to do with yourself. For in many other places, wherever you go, they will welcome you; and if you wish to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, I have friends there who will make much of you and will protect you, so that no one in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a> shall annoy you. And besides, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, it seems to me the thing you are undertaking to do is not even right — betraying yourself when you might save yourself. And you are eager to bring upon yourself just what your enemies would wish and just what those were eager for who wished to destroy you. And moreover, I think you are abandoning your children, too, for when you might bring them up and educate them, you are going to desert them and go away, and, so far as you are concerned, their fortunes in life will be whatever they happen to meet with, and they will probably meet with such treatment as generally comes to orphans in their destitution. No. Either one ought not to beget children, or one ought to stay by them and bring them up and educate them. But you seem to me to be choosing the laziest way; and you ought to choose as a good and brave man would choose, you who have been saying all your life that you cared for virtue. So I am shamed both for you and for us, your friends, and I am afraid people will think that this whole affair of yours has been conducted with a sort of cowardice on our part — both the fact that the case came before the court, when it might have been avoided, and the way in which the trial itself was carried on, and finally they will think, as the crowning absurdity of the whole affair, that this opportunity has escaped us through some base cowardice on our part, </p>                        </div>

Take care, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, that these things be not disgraceful, as well as evil, both to you and to us. Just consider, or rather it is time not to consider any longer, but to have finished considering. And there is just one possible plan; for all this must be done in the coming night. And if we delay it can no longer be done. But I beg you, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, do as I say and don't refuse. <br />SOCRATES: My dear <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a>, your eagerness is worth a great deal, if it should prove to be rightly directed; but otherwise, the greater it is, the more hard to bear. So we must examine the question whether we ought to do this or not; for I am not only now but always a man who follows nothing but the reasoning which on consideration seems to me best. And I cannot, now that this has happened to us, discard the arguments I used to advance, but they seem to me much the same as ever, and I revere and honor the same ones as before. And unless we can bring forward better ones in our present situation, be assured that I shall not give way to you, not even if the power of the multitude frighten us with even more terrors than at present, as children are frightened with goblins, threatening us with imprisonments and deaths and confiscations of property. Now how could we examine the matter most reasonably? By taking up first what you say about opinions and asking whether we were right when we always used to say that we ought to pay attention to some opinions and not to others? Or were we right before I was condemned to death, whereas it has how been made clear that we were talking merely for the sake of argument and it was really mere play and nonsense? And I wish to investigate, <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a>, in common with you, and see whether our former argument seems different to me under our present conditions, or the same, and whether we shall give it up or be guided by it. But it used to be said, I think, by those who thought they were speaking sensibly, just as I was saying now, that of the opinions held by men some ought to be highly esteemed and others not. In God's name, <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a>, do you not think this is correct? For you, humanly speaking, </p>                        </div>

If a man is an athlete and makes that his business, does he pay attention to every man's praise and blame and opinion or to those of one man only who is a physician or a trainer? <br />CRITO: To those of one man only. <br />SOCRATES: Then he ought to fear the blame and welcome the praise of that one man and not of the multitude. <br />CRITO: Obviously. <br />SOCRATES: And he must act and exercise and eat and drink as the one man who is his director and who knows the business thinks best rather than as all the others think. <br />CRITO: That is true. <br />SOCRATES: Well then; if he disobeys the one man and disregards his opinion and his praise, but regards words of the many who have no special knowledge, will he not come to harm? <br />CRITO: Of course he will. <br />SOCRATES: And what is this harm? In what direction and upon what part of the one who disobeys does it act? <br />CRITO: Evidently upon his body; for that is what it ruins. <br />SOCRATES: Right. Then in other matters, not to enumerate them all, in questions of right and wrong and disgraceful and noble and good and bad, which we are now considering, ought we to follow and fear the opinion of the many or that of the one, if there is anyone who knows about them, whom we ought to revere and fear more than all the others? And if we do not follow him, we shall injure and cripple that which we used to say is benefited by the right and is ruined by the wrong. Or is there nothing in this? <br />CRITO: I think it is true, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>. <br />SOCRATES: Well then, if through yielding to the opinion of the ignorant we ruin that which is benefited by health and injured by disease, is life worth living for us when that is ruined? And that is the body, is it not? <br />CRITO: Yes. <br />SOCRATES: Then is life worth living when the body is worthless and ruined? <br />CRITO: Certainly not. <br />SOCRATES: But is it worth living when that is ruined which is injured by the wrong and improved by the right?

And so you introduced the discussion wrongly in the first place, when you began by saying we ought to consider the opinion of the multitude about the right and the noble and the good and their opposites. But it might, of course, be said that the multitude can put us to death. <br />CRITO: That is clear, too. It would be said, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>. <br />SOCRATES: That is true. But, my friend, the argument we have just finished seems to me still much the same as before; and now see whether we still hold to this, or not, that it is not living, but living well which we ought to consider most important. <br />CRITO: We do hold to it. <br />SOCRATES: And that living well and living rightly are the same thing, do we hold to that, or not? <br />CRITO: We do. <br />SOCRATES: Then we agree that the question is whether it is right for me to try to escape from here without the permission of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, or not right. And if it appears to be right, let us try it, and if not, let us give it up. But the considerations you suggest, about spending money, and reputation, and bringing up my children, these are really, <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a>, the reflections of those who lightly put men to death, and would bring them to life again, if they could, without any sense, I mean the multitude. But we, since our argument so constrains us, must consider only the question we just broached, whether we shall be doing right in giving money and thanks to these men who will help me to escape, and in escaping or aiding the escape ourselves, or shall in truth be doing wrong, if we do all these things. And if it appears that it is wrong for us to do them, it may be that we ought not to consider either whether we must die if we stay here and keep quiet or whether we must endure any thing else whatsoever, but only the question of doing wrong. <br />CRITO: I think what you say is right, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>; but think what we should do. <br />SOCRATES: Let us, my good friend, investigate in common, and if you can contradict anything I say, do so, and I will yield to your arguments; but if you cannot, my dear friend, stop at once saying the same thing to me over and over, that I ought to go away from here without the consent of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>; for I am anxious to act in this matter with your approval, and not contrary to your wishes.

Or, as we often agreed in former times, is it never right or honorable to do wrong? Or have all those former conclusions of ours been overturned in these few days, and have we old men, seriously conversing with each other, failed all along to see that we were no better than children? Or is not what we used to say most certainly true, whether the world agree or not? And whether we must endure still more grievous sufferings than these, or lighter ones, is not wrongdoing inevitably an evil and a disgrace to the wrongdoer? Do we believe this or not? <br />CRITO: We do. <br />SOCRATES: Then we ought not to do wrong at all. <br />CRITO: Why, no. <br />SOCRATES: And we ought not even to requite wrong with wrong, as the world thinks, since we must not do wrong at all. <br />CRITO: Apparently not. <br />SOCRATES: Well, <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a>, ought one to do evil or not? <br />CRITO: Certainly not, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>. <br />SOCRATES: Well, then, is it right to requite evil with evil, as the world says it is, or not right? <br />CRITO: Not right, certainly. <br />SOCRATES: For doing evil to people is the same thing as wronging them. <br />CRITO: That is true. <br />SOCRATES: Then we ought neither to requite wrong with wrong nor to do evil to anyone, no matter what he may have done to us. And be careful, <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a>, that you do not, in agreeing to this, agree to something you do not believe; for I know that there are few who believe or ever will believe this. Now those who believe this, and those who do not, have no common ground of discussion, but they must necessarily, in view of their opinions, despise one another. Do you therefore consider very carefully whether you agree and share in this opinion, and let us take as the the starting point of our discussion the assumption that it is never right to do wrong or to requite wrong with wrong, or when we suffer evil to defend ourselves by doing evil in return. Or do you disagree and refuse your assent to this starting point? For I have long held this belief and I hold it yet, but if you have reached any other conclusion, speak and explain it to me. If you still hold to our former opinion, hear the next point. <br />CRITO: I do hold to it and I agree with you; so go on. <br />SOCRATES: Now the next thing I say, or rather ask, is this: ought a man to do what he has agreed to do, provided it is right, or may he violate his agreements? <br />CRITO: He ought to do it. <br />SOCRATES: Then consider whether, if we go away </p>                        </div>

If, as I was on the point of running away (or whatever it should be called), the laws and the commonwealth should come to me and ask, Tell me, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, what have you in mind to do? Are you not intending by this thing you are trying to do, to destroy us, the laws, and the entire state, so far as in you lies?

What shall we say, <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a>, in reply to this question and others of the same kind? For one might say many things, especially if one were an orator, about the destruction of that law which provides that the decisions reached by the courts shall be valid. Or shall we say to them, The state wronged me and did not judge the case rightly? Shall we say that, or what? <br />CRITO: That is what we shall say, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>. <br />SOCRATES: What then if the laws should say, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, is this the agreement you made with us, or did you agree to abide by the verdicts pronounced by the state? Now if I were surprised by what they said, perhaps they would continue, Don't be surprised at what we say, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, but answer, since you are in the habit of employing the method of question and answer. Come, what fault do you find with us and the state, that you are trying to destroy us? In the first place, did we not bring you forth? Is it not through us that your father married your mother and begat you? Now tell us, have you any fault to find with those of us who are the laws of marriage? I find no fault, I should say. Or with those that have to do with the nurture of the child after he is born and with his education which you, like others, received? Did those of us who are assigned to these matters not give good directions when we told your father to educate you in music and gymnastics? You did, I should say. Well then, when you were born and nurtured and educated, could you say to begin with that you were not our offspring and our slave, you yourself and your ancestors? And if this is so, do you think right as between you and us rests on a basis of equality, so that whatever we undertake to do to you it is right for you to retaliate? There was no such equality of right between you and your father or your master, if you had one, so that whatever treatment you received you might return it, answering them if you were reviled, </p>                        </div>

So strongly did you prefer us and agree to live in accordance with us; and besides, you begat children in the city, showing that it pleased you.

Now, however, you will go away wronged, if you do go away, not by us, the laws, but by men; but if you escape after so disgracefully requiting wrong with wrong and evil with evil, breaking your compacts and agreements with us, and injuring those whom you least ought to injure — yourself, your friends, your country and us — we shall be angry with you while you live, and there our brothers, the laws in <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>' realm, will not receive you graciously; for they will know that you tried, so far as in you lay, to destroy us. Do not let <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a> persuade you to do what he says, but take our advice. Be well assured, my dear friend, <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a>, that this is what I seem to hear, as the frenzied dervishes of <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a> seem to hear the flutes, and this sound of these words re-echoes within me and prevents my hearing any other words. And be assured that, so far as I now believe, if you argue against these words you will speak in vain. Nevertheless, if you think you can accomplish anything, speak. <br />CRITO: No, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, I have nothing to say. <br />SOCRATES: Then, <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a>, let it be; and let us act in this way, since it is in this way that God leads us. </p>                        </div>
