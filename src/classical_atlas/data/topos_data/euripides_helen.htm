To a hollow vale on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397268LIda class=place long=26.8423 lat=39.6922>Ida</a> came three goddesses to <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a>, for beauty's prize contending, <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> and <a href=/people/168 target=_blank>Cypris</a>, and the virgin child of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, eager to secure his verdict on their loveliness. Now <a href=/people/168 target=_blank>Cypris</a> held out my beauty,-if aught so wretched deserves that name,-as a bride before the eyes of <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a>, saying he should marry me; and so she won the day; wherefore the shepherd of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397268LIda class=place long=26.8423 lat=39.6922>Ida</a> left his steading, and came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>, thinking to win me for his bride. But <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>, indignant at not defeating the goddesses, brought to naught my marriage with <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a>, and gave to <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>'s princely son not <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>, but a phantom endowed with life, that she made in my image out of the breath of heaven; and <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a> thought that I was his, although I never was,-an idle fancy! Moreover, the counsels of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> added further troubles unto these; for upon the land of Hellas and the hapless <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a> he brought a war, that he might lighten mother-earth of her myriad hosts of men, and to the bravest of the sons of Hellas bring renown. </p>                        </div>

Here then I abide, while my hapless lord has gathered an army, and is setting out for the towers of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a> to track and recover me.

Why, then, do I prolong my life? Because I heard <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> declare, that I should yet again make my home on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>'s glorious soil, with my lord,-for <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> knew I never went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a>,-that so I might never submit to any other's wooing. Now as long as <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a> gazed upon yon glorious sun, I was safe from marriage; but when o'er him the dark grave closed, the dead man's son was eager for my hand. But I, from regard to my former husband, am throwing myself down in suppliant wise before this tomb of <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a>, praying him to guard my husband's honour, that, though through Hellas I bear a name dishonoured, at least my body here may not incur disgrace.

For no woman, <a href=/people/1290 target=_blank>Hellene</a> or barbarian, gives birth to babes in eggs inclosed, as they say <a href=/people/596 target=_blank>Leda</a> bare me to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>.

Would God I could rub my beauty out like a picture, and assume hereafter in its stead a form less comely, and oh! that Hellas had forgotten the evil fate that now I bear, and were now remembering my career of honour as surely as they do my deeds of shame. Now, if a man doth turn his eyes to a single phase of fortune, and meets ill-usage at heaven's hands, 'tis hard no doubt; but still it can be borne; but I in countless troubles am involved. First, although I never sinned, my good name is gone. And this is a grief beyond the reality, if a man incurs blame for sins that are not his. Next, have the gods removed me from my native land, to dwell with men of barbarous ways, and reft of every friend, I arn become a slave though free by birth; for amongst barbarians all are slaves but one. And the last anchor that held my fortunes, the hope that my husband would return one day, and rid me of my woes, is now no more, lost since the day he died. My mother too is dead, and I am called her murderess, unjustly it is true, but still that injustice is mine to bear; and she that was the glory of my house, my darling child, is growing old and grey, unwedded still; </p>                        </div>

No! when a husband she loathes is mated with a woman, even life is loathly to her. Best for her to die; but how shall I die a noble death?

Decide in such a way as to please one and all. <br />THEONOE: My nature and my inclination lean towards piety; myself, too, I respect, and I will never sully my father's fair name, or gratify my brother at the cost of bringing myself into open dishonour. For justice hath her temple firmly founded in my nature, and since I have this heritage from <a href=/people/428 target=_blank>Nereus</a> I will strive to save <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>; wherefore, seeing it is <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>'s will to stand thy friend, I will give my vote with her. May <a href=/people/168 target=_blank>Cypris</a> be favourable to me! though in me she hath no part, and I will try to remain a maid alway. As for thy reproaches against my father at this tomb; lo! I have the same words to utter; I should be wronging thee, did I not restore thy wife; for my sire, were he living, would have given her back into thy keeping, and thee to her. Yea, for there is recompense for these things as well amongst the dead as amongst all those who breathe the breath of life. The soul indeed of the dead lives no more, yet hath it a consciousness that lasts for ever, eternal as the ether into which it takes the final plunge. Briefly then to end the matter, I will observe strict silence on all that ye prayed I should, and never with my counsel will I aid my brother's wanton will. For I am doing him good service, though he little thinks it, if turn him from his godless life to holiness. Wherefore devise yourselves some way of escape; my lips are scaled; I will not cross your path. First with the goddesses begin, and of the one,-and that one <a href=/people/168 target=_blank>Cypris</a>,-Crave permission to return unto thy country; and of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>, that her goodwill may abide in the same quarter, even her scheme to save thee and thy husband. And thou, my own dead sire, shalt never, in so far as rests with me, lose thy holy name to rank with evil-doers. (THEONOE and her attendants enter the palace.) </p>                        </div>

Withhold then thy malignant blade from thy sister, and believe that she herein is acting with discretion. Long, long ago had we our sister saved, seeing that <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> has made us gods, but we were too weak for destiny as well as the deities, who willed these things to be. This is my bidding to thee; while to my sister I say, Sail on with thy husband; and ye shall have a prosperous breeze; for we, thy brethren twain, will course along the deep and bring you safely to your fatherland. And when at last thy goal is reached and thy life ended, thou shalt be famous as a goddess, and with thy twin brethren share the drink-offering, and like us receive gifts from men, for such is the will of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. </p>                        </div>
