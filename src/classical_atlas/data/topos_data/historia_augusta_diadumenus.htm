                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi2331.phi016:1'><b>&sect; 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Life of <a href=/people/11050 target=_blank>Diadumenianus</a><br />The life of the boy <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> <a href=/people/11050 target=_blank>Diadumenianus</a> who, together with his father, Opellius <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>, was proclaimed emperor by the army when <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> had been slain through the treachery of <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>, contains nothing memorable, save that he received the name of <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> and that there befell him astonishing omens signifying that his reign would be but a short one — and so it really came to pass. 2 Now as soon as it became known among the legions that <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> was slain, great sorrow beset the hearts of all, for they thought, because they had not an <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> at the head of the state, that with <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> the Roman Empire would come to an end. 3 When word of this was brought to <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>, who by this time was emperor, he became afraid that the army would turn to some one of the Antonines, many of whom, being of the kin of <a href=/people/12361 target=_blank>Antoninus Pius</a>, were among the leaders. He therefore gave orders at once to compose an harangue, and then bestowed upon his son, this lad, the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. 4 His harangue: You behold me, Comrades, now advanced in years, and <a href=/people/11050 target=_blank>Diadumenianus</a> still a lad, whom, if the gods are gracious, you will have for many years as your prince. 5 Furthermore I perceive that there still remains among you a great yearning for the name of the Antonines. And so, since the nature of human weakness seems to leave me but a short space of life, with your sanction I bestow upon this lad the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, and he for long years to come shall be in your eyes an <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> indeed. 6 Outcries of the soldiers: <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>, our Emperor, may the gods keep you! <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> <a href=/people/11050 target=_blank>Diadumenianus</a>, may the gods keep you! 7 An <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> have we all for a long time desired. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, Greatest and Best, grant long life to <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> and to <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. Thou knowest, O <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, that no man can conquer <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>. Thou knowest, O <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, that no man can conquer <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. 8 An <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> we have, and in him we have all things; an <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, indeed, have the gods granted to us. Worthy of his sire is <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, aye worthy of the Empire too. </p>                        </div>

The gods will grant that such gifts shall be often bestowed upon you, but we shall give you every five years what we have deemed right to give today. 2 Thereupon the child himself, <a href=/people/11050 target=_blank>Diadumenianus</a> <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, the Emperor, spoke: I bring you thanks, Comrades, because you have bestowed upon me both imperial office and name; and inasmuch as you have deemed us worthy, both my father and myself, to acclaim us Emperors of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and to commit the state to our keeping, 3 my father, for his part, will take good care not to fail the Empire, and I, moreover, will strive earnestly, not to fail the name of the Antonines. For I know that it is the name of <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a> and of Marcus and of <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> that I have taken, and to live according to the standard of these is difficult indeed. 4 Meanwhile, however, in return for the imperial office and in return for my name, I promise you all that my father has promised and as much as he has promised, doubling all advancements, even as my revered father <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> has promised here in your presence. 5 <a href=/people/3610 target=_blank>Herodian</a>, the Greek writer, omits these details and records only that <a href=/people/11050 target=_blank>Diadumenianus</a> as a child received from the soldiers the title of Caesar and that he was slain along with his father. <br />6 Immediately after this harangue a coin was struck at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> bearing the name of <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> <a href=/people/11050 target=_blank>Diadumenianus</a>, but coinage with the name of <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> was postponed until the senate should give command. 7 Moreover, despatches announcing the bestowal of the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> were sent to the senate. In return, it is said, the senate readily acknowledged his rule — although some think they did so only out of hatred for <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a>. 8 Now <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>, as emperor, purposed in honour of his son <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> to present to the populace mantles of a reddish hue, to be called 'Antoninian' as <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a>' Gallic mantles had been. For it was more fitting, he said, that his son should be called Paenuleus or Paenularius, than that <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> should have been called <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a>. 9 He also issued an edict, promising a largess in the name of <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, as the edict itself will prove. The text of the edict: I would, Fellow-citizens, that we were now present in person; for then your <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> himself would give you a largess in his own name. He would, furthermore, enroll boys as Antoniniani and girls as Antoninianae, that they might extend the glory of so dear a name; and so forth throughout. </p>                        </div>

Wherefore the astrologers said that he would be both the son of an emperor and an emperor himself, but not for long. 5 On the day of his birth, which was also the birthday of <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, a certain woman, who lived near by, cried out, it is said, Let him be called <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>, however, was afraid and refused the imperial name, both because none of his kin was called by this name and at the same time because rumours concerning the significance of his horoscope had already spread abroad. 6 These omens and others, too, occurred, or so numerous writers have related, but the following one is especially worthy of note. As <a href=/people/11050 target=_blank>Diadumenianus</a> was lying in his cradle, some say, a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> broke its chains and dashed about savagely, but when it came to the cradle of the child it only licked him and left him unharmed; but when the nurse — the only person who chanced to be present in the open place in which the child was lying — threw herself at the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>, it seized her in its teeth and she perished. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi2331.phi016:6'><b>&sect; 6</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the details concerning <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> <a href=/people/11050 target=_blank>Diadumenianus</a> which seem to be worthy of mention. His life, indeed, I should have combined with the achievements of his father, had not the name of the Antonines constrained me to publish a special discussion of the life of this boy. 2 And in fact the name of the Antonines was at that time so greatly beloved, that he who had not the prestige of this name did not seem to merit the imperial power. 3 Wherefore some also think that <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> and <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> and <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> should be honoured with the praenomen <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, and that later on the two Gordiani, father and son, had <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> as a surname. 4 However, it is one thing to assume this as praenomen and another to take it as an actual name. 5 In the case of <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a>, for instance, <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> was his actual name and <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a> only a surname. Moreover, the true name of Marcus was <a href=/people/10479 target=_blank>Verissimus</a>, but when this was set aside and annulled, <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> was conferred on him not as a praenomen but as his name. 6 So the original name of <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> was <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>, but when this was annulled, he too was called <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> not as a praenomen but as a name. 7 <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>, however, was given the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> by Marcus, and on the day of his birth he was so enrolled in the public records. 8 As for <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a>, it is well known that he was called <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> on account of a dream beheld by <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, which revealed that an <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> was fore-ordained to be his successor, and that he was given the name in his thirteenth year, when, it is said, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> conferred on him also the imperial power. 9 <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>, moreover, who, many aver, was not called <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> at all, was given the name, it is generally said, with the same intention as <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> — namely that he might succeed his father <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>; but this never came to pass. 10 After him, the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> was given to this very <a href=/people/11050 target=_blank>Diadumenianus</a>, in order, it is generally said, that he might thereby find favour with the army, the senate, and the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, since there was a great yearning for <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a>. </p>                        </div>

I will now return to the letter written by Opellius <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>: <br />Opellius <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> to his wife Nonia <a about=https://topostext.org/place/414000UCel class=place long=-0.434 lat=41.3725>Celsa</a>. The good fortune to which we have attained, my dear wife, is incalculable. Perhaps you may think I allude to the imperial power, but this is nothing great and <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> has bestowed it on even the undeserving. 6 No! I have become the father of an <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>; you have become the mother of an <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. Blessed indeed are we, fortunate is our house, and noble the meed of praise now at length attained by this happy empire! 7 May the gods grant, and kindly <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a> too, whom you revere, both that he may achieve the deserts of an <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, and that I, who am now the father of an <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, may be deemed worthy in the sight of all. </p>                        </div>

A copy of this letter I think, for the sake of history, should be inserted: <br />5 Augustus the son to Augustus the father. You do not seem, my dear father, to have kept close enough to your usual ways or to your affection for me; for you have spared the lives of men engaged in a plot to seize the imperial power, either in the hope that if you spare them now they will prove more kindly disposed to you in the future, or else believing that because of an ancient friendship they ought to be sent away unharmed. This should not have been done, nor will it prove of any avail. 6 For, in the first place, they cannot love you now, rendered sore, as they are, by suspicion; in the second, those who have forgotten their ancient friendship and have joined your bitterest enemies will prove to be all the more cruel foes. Consider also the fact that they still have armies. <br />7 'Even should you yourself regard not the fame of such actions, <br />Think of the youthful <a href=/people/387 target=_blank>Ascanius</a>, the hopes of <a href=/people/1160 target=_blank>Iulus</a> your scion; <br />Fated for him is <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>'s realm and the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>.' <br />8 These men must be executed, if you wish to live in safety, for, thanks to the evil ways of mankind, there will be no lack of other foes, if the lives of these be spared. 9 This letter, attributed by some to <a href=/people/11050 target=_blank>Diadumenianus</a> himself, by others to his teacher Caelianus, formerly a rhetorician in Africa, shows how cruel the young man would have been, had he lived. </p>                        </div>
