I don't like it; for you know how it is to lack such a lover even for a short while. But I couldn't talk him out of it since he's not in the habit of often going abroad. I don't know how to entrust him to you when he intends to come for a visit, nor how not to when he himself hopes to be courted by you, and I reckon this will give me honour as well. For I'm aware of the companionship that exists between us; I don't fear you, my dearest, as much as I fear him, for you have a more honest character than lifestyle. But he's divinely passionate, and not even the gloomiest philosopher could keep his hands off <a href=/people/1394 target=_blank>Bacchis</a>. The rumour that he has made the trip no less in order to meet you than for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230SIst class=demonym long=22.9932 lat=37.9159>Isthmian</a> games, I don't find very credible. Perhaps you'll accuse me of being suspicious; please forgive the jealousy of a courtesan, my dearest. But I would not think it a small matter to be deprived of <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> as my lover. Especially if there is a quarrel between us or a disagreement arises, I will have to endure being bitterly ridiculed on the stage by some <a href=/people/3008 target=_blank>Chremes</a> or Pheidylus. But if he comes back to me the same as he went away, I'll be very grateful to you. Farewell. </p>                        </div>

Because the trial, which that thoroughly depraved <a href=/people/3390 target=_blank>Euthias</a> brought forward, concerned only <a href=/people/987 target=_blank>Phryne</a>, but the danger concerned us all; for if we don't get any money from our lovers when we ask for it, or if we who get money are going to be condemned for impiety by the ones who give it, then we might as well put an end to this lifestyle and no longer have trouble or cause trouble for our companions. Now, however, we shall no longer blame ourselves for being courtesans because <a href=/people/3390 target=_blank>Euthias</a> has been found to be a bad lover, but we shall strive for it because <a href=/people/731 target=_blank>Hyperides</a> has been found to be fair. May many good things come to you for your kindness! For you have both saved an honest courtesan for yourself and put us in a mood to thank you on her behalf. If only you would write down the speech you held in <a href=/people/987 target=_blank>Phryne</a>'s defence, then indeed we courtesans would set up a golden statue anywhere you want in Greece. </p>                        </div>

I think that the trial also brought you good luck, for this trial has made you famous not only in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, but all over Greece. <a href=/people/3390 target=_blank>Euthias</a> is going to pay a sufficient penalty by being deprived of your company; it seems to me that he overstepped the bounds of erotic jealousy because he was stirred by anger due to his innate stupidity. And you can be sure that he now desires you more than <a href=/people/731 target=_blank>Hyperides</a>. For the latter obviously wishes to be courted in return for his advocacy of you and is playing the part of the favoured lover, while the former is enraged by his failure in the trial. So expect once again entreaties, appeals and a lot of gold through him. Don't condemn us courtesans, my dearest, and don't, by accepting the pleas of <a href=/people/3390 target=_blank>Euthias</a>, make <a href=/people/731 target=_blank>Hyperides</a> seem like he'd made a bad judgement, and don't believe those who say that the rhetor would not have accomplished anything if you had not torn open your chiton and exhibited your breasts to the judges. For it was his defence that made it possible for this very thing to happen at the right moment. </p>                        </div>

But it seems you want to annoy <a href=/people/731 target=_blank>Hyperides</a> for paying less attention to you now. However, he has a mistress worthy of himself and you have a lover who suits you.

I don't reproach her with the other matters in which I was of service to her at the time of her voyage from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>. But when <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a> was offering me all that money — and you know this too — I didn't admit the lad because he was thought to occasionally be meeting with her! She repaid me nicely for this, wishing to please that goddamned <a href=/people/1382 target=_blank>Megara</a>. I did have a long-standing suspicion of her on account of <a href=/people/1718 target=_blank>Straton</a>, but I didn't think she would do anything out of the ordinary slandering me. It was the <a href=/people/5026 target=_blank>Haloa</a>, and we were all present at the night-festival as was to be expected. I was amazed at <a href=/people/5660 target=_blank>Euxippe</a>'s arrogance. First she was showing her hostility by giggling and making jokes with <a href=/people/1382 target=_blank>Megara</a>, then she openly sang some verses with the subject of the lover who was no longer paying attention to me. I didn't mind that so much. But then she put away all shame and made fun of me for my rouge and make-up! She seemed to be so badly off that she didn't even own a mirror. For if she had seen that she herself had a red complexion, she wouldn't have slandered me for being ugly. However, I don't care one bit about that, for it is my lovers I want to please, not <a href=/people/1382 target=_blank>Megara</a> and <a href=/people/5660 target=_blank>Euxippe</a> — those apes! I've told you this so that you won't blame me for anything. For I will avenge myself on them, not with jokes and mockeries, but with the things that will hurt them the most.

You have lost your mind, <a href=/people/329 target=_blank>Euthydemus</a>! Don't you know what sort of person this sophist is who takes on a severe look as he delivers these wonderful discourses to you? How long do you think he has been pestering me for a rendezvous while he's corrupting himself with <a href=/people/3611 target=_blank>Herpyllis</a>, the maid of <a href=/people/1382 target=_blank>Megara</a>? Then I didn't accept him, for I wanted to sleep embracing you rather than the gold from all sophists together. But since he seems to be turning you away from our intercourse, I'll welcome him and show you, if you like, that this misogynist teacher isn't satisfied with the normal nightly pleasures. This is just nonsense and humbug and profit-making off boys, you fool! Do you think a sophist is any different from a courtesan? Maybe in so far as they don't persuade by the same means, but they certainly both have one and the same goal: gain. How much better and pious we are, though! We don't say there are no gods, but we do believe our lovers when they swear they love us. Nor do we think that it's right for men to have sex with their sisters and mothers, or even with other men's wives. But perhaps we seem inferior to the sophists because we don't know where the clouds come from or what the atoms are like. I, too, have spent some time with these sophists and discussed with many of them. </p>                        </div>

But it turned out the opposite. For it rekindled my yearning so that my weeping and wailing aroused pity in the decent but laughter in the rest. I have a small consolation and comfort that is already withering, that which you ripped from your very curls and threw at me during the quarrel which distressed the guests, as if you were annoyed with everything I have sent you. If this really brings you joy, then enjoy my distress, and if it should please you, then do tell those who at the moment are happier than me but who will shortly experience pain, that is to say if they are like me.

I'm sorely troubled having been sleeping with you for a year now, and my head is filthy not having even seen an unguent within that time, and wearing the old and ragged shawl I feel shame before my friends; may I therefore have some luck! By what should I then make a living, if I'm idly sitting by your side? You are crying, but you will soon stop. I, however, if I don't have a generous lover I will surely starve. I'm also surprised how unconvincing your tears are. O Lady <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>! You say that you're in love, my good man, and wish that your mistress would sleep with you because you can't live without her. So what! Are there no wine-cups in your house?

Up to the time of the <a href=/people/430 target=_blank>Adonis</a> festival he would sometimes come to fool around and get laid, although he was already then indifferent and playing the favoured lover, and most often, whenever he was drunk, he was accompanied by Helix; desiring <a href=/people/3611 target=_blank>Herpyllis</a>, the latter loved spending time at our house. Now, however, it's clear that he won't have anything to do with me at all, since for four days in a row he's been revelling in the garden of <a href=/people/1074 target=_blank>Lysis</a> with <a href=/people/4320 target=_blank>Thettale</a> and that goddamned <a href=/people/6954 target=_blank>Strongylion</a>, who procured this mistress for him because he for some reason was angry with me. Letters and servants running back and forth and all such things have accomplished nothing, and no help has come of them. They seem to have made him even more crazy and arrogant towards me. The only thing that remains is to lock him out and to reject him if he at some point, in case he should wish to annoy the other one, should come to me to get laid; for arrogance is usually broken down by being slighted. But if I should accomplish nothing even in this way, then I'll need a more efficient drug, like the ones used on the seriously ill. For not only is it bad to be deprived of my fees, but also to be a laughingstock for <a href=/people/4320 target=_blank>Thettale</a>. There is a love potion, you say, often tried by you in your youth. That's the sort of remedy I need, which would sweep away not only his delusion, but also his drunken behaviour. I will send him a message and weep convincingly, and say that he should watch out for <a href=/people/623 target=_blank>Nemesis</a> if he neglects me, who desires him, in this way, and I will make up other such things to tell him. Then he'll surely come to take pity on me for burning with desire for him; for he will say that it's good to remember the past and our relationship, puffing himself up, that creep. And Helix too will assist me, since <a href=/people/3611 target=_blank>Herpyllis</a> will strip for him. However, love potions tend to be uncertain and will suddenly result in death.

For the common talk, that they are mean, disloyal, only interested in profit, always belonging to whoever is paying, and the cause of every bad thing that happens to their lovers, this she, by her own case, has shown to be an unjust accusation; in this way she opposed the common slander with her own character.

It's located twenty stades from the town. It's actually a meadow or garden; but close to the farm there is a plot of tillage, the rest consists of cypresses and myrtle. It's really a property for a lover, my dear, not a farmer. Right away our departure offered some amusement; for one moment we were making fun of each other or our lovers, and the next we were being teased by the people we met. The lecher <a href=/people/115 target=_blank>Nicias</a>, returning from I don't know where, said to us, 'Where are you going all together? Whose field are you going off to drain? Happy is the estate where you're going! How many figs it will have!' <a href=/people/3930 target=_blank>Petale</a> shooed him away and made fun of him in a shameless manner.

We didn't even realise, because of the amusement, that our journey had come to an end quicker than we had expected. At once we busied ourselves with the sacrifice. A short distance from the farm there was a rock, its top shaded by laurels and plane trees. On either side of it were bushes of myrtle, and ivy ran around it somehow from the top, clinging closely to the stone; from it clear water dripped. Under the projecting edges of the rock some statues of <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> were set up and a <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a> peeped out as though he was spying on the <a href=/people/952 target=_blank>Naiads</a>. Across from it we piled up an improvised altar; then after we had placed splinters and cakes on it, we began by sacrificing a white hen; and after we had poured a libation of mead and milk over the altar and offered frankincense over the little flame and offered many prayers to the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a>, and at least as many to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, we begged that they give us a quarry of lovers.

So some of us immediately broke off branches of yew, others branches of myrtle, and we spread our cloaks and threw them together in an improvised manner. The ground was soft from clover and trefoil. In the middle circle some hyacinths and a variety of flowers made the sight beautiful.

Then there were a variety of milk-cakes, some honey-cakes, others from the frying pan (I think they call them junkets and twists). Then there were sweetmeats as much as the country lavished upon us from its spring fruits. Thereafter the cups went around continuously; there was a limit to drink three friendship toasts, but no limit on how often. In a way drinking parties with no restraints tend to get more because of the continuity; we sipped the wine from small cups, but one after the other. Croumation, <a href=/people/1382 target=_blank>Megara</a>'s maid, was there and she played the flute, and Simmiche sang to the melody and the music. </p>                        </div>

The music immediately excited us women deep down and being somewhat drunk we were in the mood for some...you know what I'm talking about. We caressed our lovers' hands and gently untied their flexed fingers, and fooled around in the presence of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>. Someone lay on her back and kissed her lover and let him feel her breasts, and as if simply turning away she actually pressed her lower abdomen against his groin. The passion was already rising for us women, and that other thing was rising for the men. So we women slipped away and found a shady thicket not far away, a bridal chamber sufficient for our present drunkenness. There we took a rest from the drinking and without enthusiasm jumped into our chitons. And then one girl tied together twigs of myrtle as if twining a garland for herself and said, 'Look, my love, if this suits me'; another girl returning with buds of violet said, 'What a lovely fragrance'; another taking some unripe apples from her fold, showed them and said, 'Look at these!' Another was humming, and yet another was picking leaves from a twig and gnawing them as if playing hard to get. And what was most ridiculous — although we had all got up for the same reason, we didn't wish to be seen by each other. The men came around on the other side behind the thicket. After this little love commerce, we were thirsty again. The <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> didn't seem to look at us like before, whereas <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a> and <a href=/people/806 target=_blank>Priapus</a> seemed to look at us with greater pleasure. Again we had those small birds, caught with nets, and partridges, and very sweet grapes conserved in must, and chines of hare. Furthermore there were mussels and periwinkles that were brought in from town, and native snails, and mushrooms from the strawberry trees, and roots of parsnip, good for the stomach, steeped in vinegar and honey. Moreover there was lettuce and celery that we ate with greatest delight; and how big do you think the lettuce was? The garden was near by; we each said to our maids, 'Pull this one!' 'No, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, this one!' 'No, not that one, this one!' Some were leafy and long, others twisted like curly hair, others yet were short and their leaves had a yellowish tinge. They say <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> loves them. So after we had enjoyed the spring and stimulated our appetites afresh, we engaged in a very youthful revelry to the point that neither did we care that we were seen by each other, nor did we bother to make love in secret; the wine filled us with such a bacchic frenzy. I hate the neighbour's cock! His crowing put an end to our revelry. You should at least have the pleasure of hearing about our drinking party — for it was sumptuous and suitable for erotic friendship — even if you couldn't partake in our revelry. So I wanted to write you a detailed written account of everything, and I was urged to do so. If you really were feeling unwell, try and find a way to get better; but if you're staying at home because you're expecting your lover to come, then you're staying at home not without reason. Farewell. </p>                        </div>

By Lady <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, that's disgusting! Even though you were invited by <a href=/people/1312 target=_blank>Glycera</a> to her sacrificial feast such a long time ago (for she sent us the invitations at the time of the <a href=/people/651 target=_blank>Dionysia</a>) you didn't come — perhaps because of her you can't stand even to see your girlfriends. You've become virtuous and are in love with your lover, congratulations on that reputation! We, on the other hand, are shameless whores. <a href=/people/486 target=_blank>Philo</a> too had a fig-wood staff; so I'm really angry, by the great goddess! We were all present: <a href=/people/4320 target=_blank>Thettale</a>, Moscharium, <a href=/people/2353 target=_blank>Thais</a>, Anthracium, <a href=/people/3930 target=_blank>Petale</a>, <a href=/people/6017 target=_blank>Thryallis</a>, <a href=/people/5812 target=_blank>Myrrhine</a>, Chrysium and <a href=/people/5660 target=_blank>Euxippe</a>. Why even <a href=/people/8159 target=_blank>Philoumene</a>, despite recently married and jealously watched, was present, having put her lovely husband to sleep, although she arrived late. Only you stayed to fondle your <a href=/people/430 target=_blank>Adonis</a>, afraid perhaps that if he was left alone by you, his <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Persephone</a> would snatch him away. What a drinking party we had — why shouldn't I make you regretful? — full of great delights! Songs, jokes, drinking till cockcrow, perfumes, garlands and sweetmeats. Our place of reclining was shaded by some laurels. Only one thing was missing: you, but nothing else. We have often caroused but rarely with this much pleasure. But what gave us the most delight was that a fierce quarrel arose between <a href=/people/6017 target=_blank>Thryallis</a> and <a href=/people/5812 target=_blank>Myrrhine</a> concerning which of them had the most beautiful and smooth buttocks. And <a href=/people/5812 target=_blank>Myrrhine</a>, having first loosened her girdle — her dress was made of silk — swayed her hips which quivered like junkets through the dress, while she was looking back at the movements of her buttocks. Then she sighed gently like she was making love so that, by <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, I was astounded. <a href=/people/6017 target=_blank>Thryallis</a>, however, didn't give up, but outdid <a href=/people/5812 target=_blank>Myrrhine</a> in shamelessness. 'I shall not compete behind curtains', she said, 'nor play coy, but as in a gymnastic contest; for a contest doesn't like excuses.' She took off her dress, tightened her buttocks and said, 'there, look carefully at the skin, <a href=/people/5812 target=_blank>Myrrhine</a>, how pure, how spotless; look here at the purple lining of the hips, the slope towards the thighs, which are neither too fat nor too lean, and the dimples at the sides; but, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, they don't quiver' — and at the same time she smiled — 'like <a href=/people/5812 target=_blank>Myrrhine</a>'s'. </p>                        </div>

There were also comparisons of hips and breast competitions. However, nobody dared to compare her belly with <a href=/people/8159 target=_blank>Philoumene</a>'s, since she had not born any children and was plump. So having spent the entire night there speaking ill of our lovers and praying for new ones (for fresh love making is always sweeter) we departed drunk, and carousing a lot on the way we stopped for a revelry at Deximachus's house at the Golden Alley, where you go down to the chaste-tree, near <a href=/people/9787 target=_blank>Menephron</a>'s house. <a href=/people/2353 target=_blank>Thais</a> is madly in love with him and, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, with reason; for the lad has recently inherited his rich father.

I, however, lord <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, when I see you and hear you in public with your bodyguard and your soldiers and your ambassadors and your diadems, then, by <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, I tremble and I fear and I'm troubled, and I turn away as from the sun, so that I won't burn my eyes; and then you really seem to be the besieger, by <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>. How you look then, so fierce and warlike! I distrust myself and say, '<a href=/people/694 target=_blank>Lamia</a>, are you sleeping with this man? Are you charming him with your flute all night long? Has this man sent you a message now? Does he compare <a href=/people/1349 target=_blank>Gnathaena</a> the courtesan with you?' In confusion I keep silent and pray to see you at my place, and when you come I greet you. But when you embrace me and kiss me intensely, then again I say to myself just the opposite: 'Is this the besieger? Is this the military commander? Is this the fear of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, of Greece, of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>? By <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, today I will force him to surrender with my flute and I will see how he's going to treat me, or rather the day after tomorrow.' For you will dine with me (I hope) during <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>'s feast. I do this every year and I hold a contest to see if I can beat my earlier celebrations. I shall welcome you in a manner befitting <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> and as seductively as possible, if you give me the necessary means; after all, I've done nothing unworthy of your favour ever since that sacred night, even though you let me use my body as I see fit. On the contrary, I've used it honourably and have not had intercourse with other men. I will not behave like a courtesan, nor will I lie, my lord, like others do. In fact, ever since that time, by <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, many no longer send me messages or make an attempt on me, because they fear that you will lay them under siege. <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> is swift, my king, swift to come and swift to fly away. When he's hopeful he has wings but when he despairs and has lost all hope he usually sheds his wings right away. That's why courtesans have a great trick; by constantly postponing the moment of pleasure they have control over their lovers by giving them hope. But with you it's not possible to postpone, so I fear you will get bored. As a result it is necessary that we, by interrupting intimacies that would otherwise quickly wither, sometimes be busy, at other times be unwell, sing, play the flute, dance, make dinners, decorate the house, so that their souls will get more inflammable from the interruptions and kindle more easily, out of fear that there will be yet another obstacle to their present good fortune. I might have been able to take these precautions and play these tricks on others, my king; but, by the friendly <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, I couldn't bear using these fabrications on you who are so fond of me that you show me openly and boast to the other courtesans that I surpass them all; I'm not that stony-hearted. So even if I gave up everything, even my life, to please you, I'd count the cost as low. For I know very well that the preparation will be talked about not only in the house of <a href=/people/1681 target=_blank>Therippides</a>, where I'm going to prepare for you the banquet of the Aphrodisia festival, but also in the whole city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, by <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, and in all of Greece.

By <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, even if he had been an <a href=/people/430 target=_blank>Adonis</a>, though nearly eighty years old, I wouldn't put up with him, this lice-ridden and sickly man who is all wrapped up in fleece instead of felt. How long must one endure this philosopher? Let him have his Principal Doctrines on Nature and his distorted Canons, and permit me to live according to nature, my own mistress, without anger and violence. I really have such a besieger, not at all like you, <a href=/people/694 target=_blank>Lamia</a>, have in <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>. It's not possible to lead a virtuous life on account of this man.

I don't deny that I'm quite familiar with the young man (I have for a long time been truthful to you, <a href=/people/694 target=_blank>Lamia</a>) and I almost got my first lesson in love from him; he took my virginity when I was living next door. Since that time he has never ceased sending me all sorts of nice things like clothes, gold, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> maids and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> servants. I won't mention the rest. But he anticipates the seasons in the smallest delicacies, so that nobody may taste them before I do. So that's the kind of lover about whom <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> says, 'Shut him out and don't let him come near you.' What kind of names do you think he's calling him? Not as an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> or a philosopher *** or of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a> coming to Greece for the first time. </p>                        </div>

By Calligenea, in whose hands I now am, I rejoiced, <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>, and was beside myself with pleasure and it did not go unnoticed by those present. My mother was there and one of my two sisters, Euphronium, and one of my girlfriends whom you know; she often dined at your house and you praised her local <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> wit, but as if fearing to praise her — the time when I smiled at you and gave you a hotter kiss than usual — don't you remember, <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>? When they saw the unusual happiness in my face and my eyes they asked me, 'Dear <a href=/people/1312 target=_blank>Glycera</a>, what great good fortune has come to you, charming and desirable, that you now seem like a different person in soul, body and every aspect and your body is radiant and shining?' '<a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, the King of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>', I replied, 'has invited my <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>, promising, in a way, half his kingdom', raising my voice and speaking with more emphasis so that all present would hear. And as I said this I was shaking and brandishing in my hands the letter with the royal seal. 'You rejoice in being deserted?' they asked. But this wasn't the case, <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>. I would in no way whatsoever, by the gods, be convinced of this, not even if the proverbial <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> would speak to me, that <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> would ever want to or be able to leave his <a href=/people/1312 target=_blank>Glycera</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> and alone rule in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> in the midst of all its wealth. However, judging from the letter I read, the King obviously had heard about this, my relationship with you, it seems, and he wanted to tease you slightly by insinuation with his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> wit. I'm delighted about this, that our love has sailed over to him in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>; and by what he has heard he's certainly convinced that he's striving for the impossible when he wants <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> to come over to him.

As a matter of fact, so she says, the woman has to perform a purifying ceremony first and prepare some animals to be sacrificed and some strong frankincense and a long stalk of styrax and moon-shaped wheat cakes and leaves from a wild chaste-tree. I think even you will arrive from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Piraeus</a> first; or else tell me just for how long you can't see <a href=/people/1312 target=_blank>Glycera</a>, so that I may run down to meet you and have this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> woman ready at once. †And what you are trying by yourself, to accustom me so that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Piraeus</a>, your small estate and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379237HMou class=place long=23.658 lat=37.938>Munychia</a> will gradually fall out of my mind, I can't do,† by the gods! Neither can you who are already completely interwoven with me! Even if all the kings would send you letters I'm still more regal to you than all of them and in you I have found a dutiful lover who's also mindful of sacred oaths. </p>                        </div>

What now? Am I a bold and daring woman to judge <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>'s plays when I'm only an amateur? But I have a love for you that is wise and makes me capable of understanding these matters. For you taught me, an attractive woman, to learn quickly from lovers; but lovers dispense it in haste; we feel ashamed, by <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, to be unworthy of you not having been quicker to learn. I just beg you, <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>, to produce that play too in which you have cast me, so that even if I should not go with you, I may sail to <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> in another form, and the King may be more aware of how much influence he has over you that you bring your written loves having left your true ones in town. But you're not going to leave them behind, be sure of that. Until you come here to me from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Piraeus</a>, I will be learning how to be a helmsman or captain, so that I may steer you with my own hands untouched by the waves as I'm sailing, if this should appear to be the better choice. May that happen, all you gods, which will profit us both, and may the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> woman make a more appropriate prophesy than your Woman Possessed by a God.

That's reasonable. For with her clothes on she's the fairest of face, and with her clothes off her body seems as fair as her face, neither too wrinkled nor too fleshy but the kind we call thin and juicy. Her hair is naturally curly, blond but not coloured and falls softly over her shoulders.
