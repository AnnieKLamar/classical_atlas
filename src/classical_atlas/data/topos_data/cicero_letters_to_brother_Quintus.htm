I, 1) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN ASIA) ROME (DECEMBER) Though I have no doubt that many messengers, and even common rumour, with its usual speed, will anticipate this letter, and that you will already have heard from others that a third year has been added to my loss and your labour, yet I thought you ought to receive from me also the news of this tiresome circumstance. For not in one, but in several of my previous letters, in spite of others having given up the idea in despair, I gave you hope of being able at an early date to quit your province, not only that I might as long as possible cheer you with a pleasurable belief, but also because I and the praetors took such pains in the matter, that I felt no misgiving as to the possibility of its being arranged. As it is, since matters have so turned out that neither the praetors by the weight of their influence, nor I by my earnest efforts, have been able to prevail, it is certainly difficult not to be annoyed, yet our minds, practised as they are in conducting and supporting business of the utmost gravity, ought not to be crushed or weakened by vexation. And since men ought to feel most vexed at what has been brought upon them by their own fault, it is I who ought in this matter to be more vexed than you. For it is the result of a fault on my part, against which you had protested both in conversation at the moment of your departure, and in letters since, that your successor was not named last year. In this, while consulting for the interests of our allies, and resisting the shameless conduct of some merchants, and while seeking the increase of our reputation by your virtues, I acted unwisely, especially as I made it possible for that second year to entail a third. And as I confess the mistake to have been mine, it lies with your wisdom and kindness to remedy it, and to see that my imprudence is turned to advantage by your careful performance of your duties. And truly, if you exert yourself in every direction to earn men's good word, not with a view to rival others, but henceforth to surpass yourself, if you rouse your whole mind and your every thought and care to the ambition of gaining a superior reputation in all respects, believe me, one year added to your labour will bring us, nay, our posterity also, a joy of many years' duration. Wherefore I begin by entreating you not to let your soul shrink and be cast down, nor to allow yourself to be overpowered by the magnitude of the business as though by a wave; but, on the contrary, to stand upright and keep your footing, or even advance to meet the flood of affairs. For you are not administering a department of the state, in which fortune reigns supreme, but one in which a well-considered policy and an attention to business are the most important things. But if I had seen you receiving the prolongation of a command in a great and dangerous war, I should have trembled in spirit, because I should have known that the dominion of fortune over us had been at the same time prolonged. As it is, however, a department of the state has been entrusted to you in which fortune occupies no part, or, at any rate, an insignificant one, and which appears to me to depend entirely on your virtue and self-control. We have no reason to fear, as far as I know, any designs of our enemies, any actual fighting in the field, any revolts of allies, any default in the tribute or in the supply of corn, any mutiny in the army: things which have very often befallen the wisest of men in such a way, that they have been no more able to get the better of the assault of been granted profound peace, a dead calm: yet if the pilot fortune, than the best of pilots a violent tempest. You have falls asleep, it may even so overwhelm him, though if he keeps awake it may give him positive pleasure. For your province consists, in the first place, of allies of a race which; of all the world, is the most civilized; and, in the second place, of Citizens, who, either as being publicani are very closely connected with me, or, as being traders who have made money, think that they owe the security of their property to my consulship. [2] But it may be said that among even such men as these there occur serious disputes, many wrongful acts are committed, and hotly contested litigation is the result. As though I ever thought that you had no trouble to contend with! I know that the trouble is exceedingly great, and such as demands the very greatest prudence; but remember that it is prudence much more than fortune on which, in my opinion, the result of your trouble depends. For what trouble is it to govern those over whom you are set, if you do but govern yourself? That may be a great and difficult task to others, and indeed it is most difficult: to you it has always been the easiest thing in the world, and indeed ought to be so, for your natural disposition is such that, even without discipline, it appears capable of self-control; whereas a discipline has, in fact, been applied that might educate the most faulty of characters. But while you resist, as you do, money, pleasure, and every kind of desire yourself, there will, I am to be told, be a risk of your not being able to suppress some fraudulent banker or some rather over-extortionate tax-collector! For as to the Greeks, they will think, as they behold the innocence of your life, that one of the heroes of their history, or a demigod from heaven, has come down into the province. And this I say, not to induce you to act thus, but to make you glad that you are acting or have acted so. It is a splendid thing to have been three years in supreme power in Asia without allowing statue, picture, plate, napery, slave, anyone's good looks, or any offer of money — all of which are plentiful in your province — to cause you to swerve from the most absolute honesty and purity of life. What can be imagined so striking or so desirable as that a virtue, a command over the passions, a self-control such as yours, are not remaining in darkness and obscurity, but have been set in the broad daylight of Asia, before the eyes of a famous province, and in the hearing of all nations and peoples? That the inhabitants are not being ruined by your progresses, drained by your charges, agitated by your approach? That there is the liveliest joy, public and private, wheresoever you come, the city regarding you as a protector and not a tyrant, the private house as a guest and not a plunderer? [3] But in these matters I am sure that mere experience has by this time taught you that it is by no means sufficient to have these virtues yourself, but that you must keep your eyes open and vigilant, in order that in the guardianship of your province you may be considered to vouch to the allies, the citizens, and the state, not for yourself alone, but for all the subordinates of your government. However, you have in the persons of your legati men likely to have a regard for their own reputation. Of these in rank, position, and age <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a> is first; who, I think, particularly as he is a writer of history, could select from his own Annals many whom he would like and would be able to imitate. <a href=/people/4402 target=_blank>Allienus</a>, again, is ours, as well in heart and affection, as in his conformity to our principles. I need not speak of Gratidius: I am sure that, while taking pains to preserve his own reputation, his fraternal affection for us makes him take pains for ours also. Your quaestor is not of your own selection, but the one assigned you by lot. He is bound both to act with propriety of his own accord, and to conform to the policy and principles which you lay down. But should any one of these adopt a lower standard of conduct, you should tolerate such behaviour, if it goes no farther than a breach, in his private capacity, of the rules by which he was bound, but not if it goes to the extent of employing for gain the authority which you granted him as a promotion. For I am far from thinking, especially since the moral sentiments of the day are so much inclined to excessive laxity and self-seeking, that you should investigate every case of petty misconduct, and thoroughly examine every one of these persons; but that you should regulate your confidence by the trustworthiness of its recipient. And among such persons you will have to vouch for those whom the Republic has itself given you as companions and assistants in public affairs, at least within the limits which I have before laid down. [4] In the case, however, of those of your personal staff or official attendants whom you have yourself selected to be about you — who are usually spoken of as a kind of praetor's cohort — we must vouch, not only for their acts, but even for their words. But those you have with you are the sort of men of whom you may easily be fond when they are acting rightly, and whom you may very easily check when they show insufficient regard for your reputation. By these, when you were raw to the work, your frank disposition might possibly have been deceived — for the better a man is the less easily does he suspect others of being bad — now, however, let this third year witness an integrity as perfect as the two former, but still more wary and vigilant. Listen to that only which you are supposed to listen to; don't let your ears be open to whispered falsehoods and interested suggestions. Don't let your signet ring be a mere implement, but, as it were, your second self: not the minister of another's will, but a witness of your own. Let your marshal hold the rank which our ancestors wished him to hold, who, looking upon this place as not one of profit, but of labour and duty, scarcely ever conferred it upon any but their freedmen, whom they indeed controlled almost as absolutely as their slaves. Let the lictor be the dispenser of your clemency, not his own; and let the fasces and axes which they carry before you constitute ensigns rather of rank than of power. Let it, in fact, be known to the whole province that the life, children, fame, and fortunes of all over whom you preside are exceedingly dear to you. Finally, let it be believed that you will, if you detect it, be hostile not only to those who have accepted a bribe, but to those also who have given it. And, indeed, no one will give anything, if it is made quite clear that nothing is usually obtained from you through those who pretend to be very influential with you. Not, however, that the object of this discourse is to make you over-harsh or suspicious towards your staff. For if any of them in the course of the last two years has never fallen under suspicion of rapacity, as I am told about <a href=/people/3151 target=_blank>Caesius</a> and <a href=/people/4479 target=_blank>Chaerippus</a> and <a href=/people/822 target=_blank>Labeo</a> — and think it true, because I know them — there is no authority, I think, which may not be entrusted to them, and no confidence which may not be placed in them with the utmost propriety, and in anyone else like them. But if there is anyone of whom you have already had reason to doubt, or concerning whom you have made some discovery, in such a man place no confidence, intrust him with no particle of your reputation. V. If, however, you have found in the province itself anyone, hitherto unknown to us, who has made his way into intimacy with you, take care how much confidence you repose in him; not that there may not be many good provincials, but, though we may hope so, it is risky to be positive. For everyone's real character is covered by many wrappings of pretence and is concealed by a kind of veil: face, eyes, expression very often lie, speech most often of all. Wherefore, how can you expect to find in that class any who, while foregoing for the sake of money all from which we can scarcely tear ourselves away, will yet love you sincerely and not merely pretend to do so from interested motives? </p>                        </div>

I, 2) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN ASIA) ROME, 26 OCTOBER: <a href=/people/594 target=_blank>Statius</a> arrived at my house on the 25th October. His arrival gave me uneasiness, because you said in your letter that you would be plundered by your household in his absence. However, I thought it a very happy circumstance that he anticipated the expectation of his arrival, and the company that would have assembled to meet him, if he had left the province with you, and had not appeared before. For people have exhausted their remarks, and many observations have been made and done with of the Nay, but I looked for a mighty man kind, which I am glad to have all over before you come. But as for the motive for your sending him — that he might clear himself with me — that was not at all necessary. For, to begin with, I had never suspected him, nor in what I wrote to you about him was I expressing my own judgment; but since the interest and safety of all of us who take part in public business depends, not on truth alone, but on report also, I wrote you word of what people were saying, not what I thought myself. How prevalent and how formidable that talk was <a href=/people/594 target=_blank>Statius</a> ascertained himself on his arrival. For he was present when certain persons at my house gave vent to some complaints on that very subject, and had the opportunity of perceiving that the observations of the malevolent were being directed at himself especially. But it used to annoy me most when I was told that he had greater influence with you, than your sober time of life and the wisdom of a governor required. How many people, do you suppose, have solicited me to give them a letter of introduction to <a href=/people/594 target=_blank>Statius</a>? How often, do you suppose, has he himself, while talking without reserve to me, made such observations as, I never approved of that, I told him so, I tried to persuade him, I warned him not to? And even if these things show the highest fidelity, as I believe they do, since that is your judgment, yet the mere appearance of a freedman or slave enjoying such influence cannot but lower your dignity: and the long and short of it is — for I am in duty bound not to say anything without good grounds, nor to keep back anything from motives of policy — that <a href=/people/594 target=_blank>Statius</a> has supplied all the material for the gossip of those who wished to decry you; that formerly all that could be made out was that certain persons were. angry at your strictness; but that after his manumission the angry had something to talk about. Now I will answer the letters delivered to me by L. <a href=/people/3151 target=_blank>Caesius</a>, whom, as I see you wish it, I will serve in every way I can. One of them is about <a href=/people/938 target=_blank>Zeuxis</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384292UBla class=person long=29.209 lat=38.3574>Blaundus</a>, whom you say was warmly recommended to you by me though a most notorious matricide. In this matter, and on this subject generally, please listen to a short statement, lest you should by chance be surprised at my having become so conciliatory towards Greeks. Seeing, as I did, that the complaints of Greeks, because they have a genius for deceit, were allowed an excessive weight, whenever I was told of any of them making complaint of you, I appeased them by every means in my power. First, I pacified the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382294UDio class=ethnic long=29.4295 lat=38.2148>Dionysopolitans</a>, who were very bitter: whose chief man, <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a>, I secured not only by my conversation, but by treating him as a friend. I did the same to <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381302PApa class=person long=30.174 lat=38.073>Apameia</a>; the same to that most untrustworthy fellow, Megaristus of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396268UAnt class=person long=26.7862 lat=39.5716>Antandrus</a>; the same to <a href=/people/12472 target=_blank>Nicias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=person long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a>; I also embraced with all the courtesy I possessed the most trumpery of men, even <a href=/people/8038 target=_blank>Nymphon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=person long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophon</a>. And all this I did from no liking for these particular people, or the nation as a whole: I was heartily sick of their fickleness and obsequiousness, of feelings that are not affected by our kindness, but by our position. But to return to <a href=/people/938 target=_blank>Zeuxis</a>. When he was telling me the same story as you mention in your letter about what M. <a href=/people/7442 target=_blank>Cascellius</a> had said to him in conversation, I stopped him from farther talk, and admitted him to my society. I cannot, however, understand your virulence when you say that, having sewn up in the parricide's-sack two <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=ethnic long=28 lat=40>Mysians</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a>, you desired to display a similar example of your severity in the upper part of your province, and that, therefore, you had wished to inveigle <a href=/people/938 target=_blank>Zeuxis</a> into your hands by every possible means. For if he had been brought into court, he ought perhaps not to have been allowed to escape: but there was no necessity for his being hunted out and inveigled by soft words to stand a trial, as you say in your letter — especially as he is one whom I learn daily, both from his fellow citizens and from many others, to be a man of higher character than you would expect from such an obscure town as his. But, you will say, it is only Greeks to whom I am indulgent. What! did not I do everything to appease L. <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>? What a man! how irritable! how violent! In fact, who is there except <a href=/people/10450 target=_blank>Tuscenius</a>, whose case admitted of no cure, have I not softened? See again, I have now on my hands a shifty, mean fellow, though of equestrian rank, called <a href=/people/7449 target=_blank>Catienus</a>: even he is going to be smoothed down. I don't blame you for having been somewhat harsh to his father, for I am quite sure you have acted with good reason: but what need was there of a letter of the sort which you sent to the man himself? That the man was rearing the cross for himself from which you had already pulled him off once; that you would take care to have him smoked to death, and would be applauded by the whole province for it. Again, to a man named C. <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> — for that letter also T. <a href=/people/7449 target=_blank>Catienus</a> is handing round — that you were told that the kidnapper <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a>, with his young kite of a son, was collecting taxes. And then you go on to ask <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> to burn both father and son alive if he can; if not, to send them to you, that they may be burnt to death by legal sentence. That letter sent by you in jest to C. <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a>, if it really is from you, exhibits to ordinary readers a violence of language very injurious to you. Now, if you will refer to the exhortations in all my letters, you will perceive that I have never found fault with you for anything except harshness and sharpness of temper, and occasionally, though rarely, for want of caution in the letters you write. In which particulars, indeed, if my influence had had greater weight with you than a somewhat excessive quickness of disposition, or a certain enjoyment in indulging temper, or a faculty for epigram and a sense of humour, we should certainly have had no cause for dissatisfaction. And don't you suppose that I feel no common vexation when I am told how <a href=/people/4739 target=_blank>Vergilius</a> is esteemed, and your neighbour C. <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>? I For if you only excel your neighbours farther up country, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, that is a pretty thing to boast of! And that is just the sting of the matter, that though the men I have named are not more blameless than yourself, they yet outdo you in the art of winning favour, though they know nothing of <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>'s <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> or <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a>; from which kings, in the exercise of their great office, no one ever heard an irritable word. But in giving you this advice, as I have from the first, I am well aware how much good I have done. Now, however, as you are about to quit your province, pray do leave behind you — as I think you are now doing — as pleasant a memory as possible. You have a successor of very mild manners; in other respects, on his arrival, you will be much missed. In sending letters of requisition, as I have often told you, you have allowed yourself to be too easily persuaded. Destroy, if you can, all such as are inequitable, or contrary to usage, or contradictory to others. <a href=/people/594 target=_blank>Statius</a> told me that they were usually put before you ready written, read by himself, and that, if they were inequitable, he informed you of the fact: but that before he entered your service there had been no sifting of letters; that the result was that there were volumes containing a selection of letters, which were usually adversely criticised. On this subject I am not going to give you any advice at this time of day, for it is too late; and you cannot but be aware that I have often warned you in various ways and with precision. But I have, on a hint from <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>, entrusted him with this message to you: do see by means of persons attached to you, which you will find no difficulty in doing, that the following classes of letters are destroyed — first, those that are inequitable; next, those that are contradictory; then those expressed in an eccentric or unusual manner; and lastly, those that contain reflections on anyone. I don't believe all I hear about these matters, and if, in the multiplicity of your engagements, you have let certain things escape you, now is the time to look into them and weed them out. I have read a letter said to have been written by your nomenclator <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> himself, which I cannot approve: I have read some written in an angry spirit. But the subject of letters comes in pat: for while this sheet of paper was actually in my hands, L. <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a>, praetor-designate and a very intimate friend, came to see me. He told me that you had sent a letter to his agents, which seemed to me most inequitable, prohibiting them from taking anything from the estate of the late L. <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a> <a href=/people/3213 target=_blank>Naso</a>, whose heir L. <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a> is, until they had paid a sum of money to C. <a href=/people/3843 target=_blank>Fundanius</a>; and that you had sent a similar letter to the <a href=/people/999 target=_blank>Apollonidenses</a>, not to allow any payment on account of the estate of the late <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a> till the debt to <a href=/people/3843 target=_blank>Fundanius</a> had been discharged. It seems to me hardly likely that you have done this; for it is quite unlike your usual good sense. The heir not to take anything? What if he disowns the debt? What if he doesn't owe it at all? Moreover, is the praetor wont to decide whether a debt is due? Don't I, again, wish well to <a href=/people/3843 target=_blank>Fundanius</a>? Am I not his friend? Am I not touched with compassion? No one more so: but in certain matters the course of law is so clear as to leave no place for personal feeling. And <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a> told me that expressions were used in the letter, which he said was yours, to the effect that you would either thank them as friends, or make yourself disagreeable to them as enemies. In short, he was much annoyed, complained of it to me in strong terms, and begged me to write to you as seriously as I could. This I am doing, and I do strongly urge you again and again to withdraw your injunction to <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a>'s agents about taking money from the estate, and not to lay any farther injunction on the <a href=/people/999 target=_blank>Apollonidenses</a> contrary to the rights of <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a>. Pray do everything you can for the sake of <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a> and, indeed, of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> also. I would not, upon my honour, have you think me liberal to him at the expense of any inequitable decision on your part: but I do entreat you to leave behind you some authority, and some memorandum of a decree or of a letter under your hand, so framed as to support the interests and cause of <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a>. For the man, who is at once very attentive to me, and tenacious of his own rights and dignity, is feeling extremely hurt that he has not prevailed with you either on the grounds of personal friendship or of legal right; and, to the best of my belief, both <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> have, at one time or another, commended the interests of <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a> to you, and <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a> has written to you personally, and certainly I have. Wherefore, if there is anything which you think you ought to do at my request, let it be this. If you love me, take every care, take every trouble, and insure <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a>'s cordial thanks both to yourself and myself. I cannot use greater earnestness in making any request than I use in this. As to what you say about <a href=/people/580 target=_blank>Hermias</a>, it has been in truth a cause of much vexation to me. I wrote you a letter in a rather unbrotherly spirit, which I dashed off in a fit of anger and now wish to recall, having been irritated by what <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>'s freedman told me, immediately after hearing of the bargain. For this letter, which was not expressed in a brotherly way, you ought to have brotherly feeling enough to make allowance. As to <a href=/people/2605 target=_blank>Censorinus</a>, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, the <a href=/people/7445 target=_blank>Cassii</a>, <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a> — I am delighted to hear from you that you possess their friendship. The other contents of that same letter of yours were expressed more strongly than I could have wished, such as your with my ship at least well trimmed and your die once for all. You will find those expressions to be unnecessarily strong. My scoldings have always been very full of affection. They mention certain things for complaint, but these are not important, or rather, are quite insignificant. For my part, I should never have thought you deserving of the least blame in any respect, considering the extreme purity of your conduct, had it not been that our enemies are numerous. Whatever I have written to you in a tone of remonstrance or reproach I have written from a vigilant caution, which I maintain, and shall maintain; and I shall not cease imploring you to do the same. <a href=/people/90 target=_blank>Attalus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382280UHyp class=person long=27.955 lat=38.275>Hypaepa</a> has begged me to intercede with you that you should not prevent his getting the money paid which has been decreed for a statue of Q. <a href=/people/3950 target=_blank>Publicius</a>. In which matter I both ask as a favour and urge as a duty, that you should not consent to allow the honour of a man of his character, and so close a friend of mine, to be lowered or hindered by your means. Furthermore, <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a>, who is known to you, a slave of my friend <a href=/people/4819 target=_blank>Aesopus</a>, has run away. He has been at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, living in the house of Patron the <a href=/people/10981 target=_blank>Epicurean</a> as a free man. Thence he has made his way to Asia. Afterwards a certain <a href=/people/12503 target=_blank>Plato</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=person long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardis</a>, who is often at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, and happened to be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> at the time that <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> arrived there, having subsequently learnt by a letter from <a href=/people/4819 target=_blank>Aesopus</a> that he was an escaped slave, arrested the fellow, and put him into confinement at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>; but whether into the public prison, or into a slave mill, we could not clearly make out from his letter. But since he is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, I should be obliged if you would trace him in any manner open to you, and with all care either [send him] or bring him home with you. Don't take into consideration the fellow's value: such a good-for-nothing is worth very little; but <a href=/people/4819 target=_blank>Aesopus</a> is so much vexed at his slave's bad conduct and audacity, that you can do him no greater favour than by being the means of his recovering him. Now for the news that you chiefly desire. We have so completely lost the constitution that <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, a young man of no sense, but yet a Roman citizen and a <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, scarcely got off with his life because, having determined to prosecute <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> for bribery, when the praetors could not be approached for several days, and refused to admit anyone to their presence, he mounted the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BRoA class=place long=12.48458 lat=41.89258>Rostra</a> in public meeting and called <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> an unofficial dictator. No one ever had a narrower escape of being killed. From this you may see the state of the whole Republic. People, however, show no inclination to desert my cause. They make wonderful professions, offers of service, and promises: and, indeed, I have the highest hopes and even greater spirit — so that I hope to get the better in the struggle, and feel confident in my mind that, in the present state of the Republic, I need not fear even an accident. However, the matter stands thus: if <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> gives notice of an action against me, the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> will rush to my support, so that I shall come off with many times greater glory than before; but if he attempts the use of violence, I hope, by the zeal not only of friends but also of opponents, to be able to meet force with force. All promise me the aid of themselves, their friends, clients, freedmen, slaves, and, finally, of their money. Our old regiment of loyalists is warm in its zeal and attachment to me. If there were any who had formerly been comparatively hostile or lukewarm, they are now uniting themselves with the loyalists from hatred to these despots. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> makes every sort of promise, and so does <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>: but my confidence in them is not enough to induce me to drop any of my preparations. The tribunes-designate are friendly to us. The consuls-designate make excellent professions. Some of the new praetors are very friendly and very brave citizens-<a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, <a href=/people/734 target=_blank>Nigidius</a>, <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> — the others are loyalists also, but these are eminently so. Wherefore keep a good heart and high hopes. However, I will keep you constantly informed on particular events as they occur from day today. </p>                        </div>

I, 3) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (ON HIS WAY TO ROME) THESSALONICA, 15 JUNE: BROTHER! Brother! Brother! did you really fear that I had been induced by some angry feeling to send slaves to you without a letter? Or even that I did not wish to see you? I to be angry with you! Is it possible for me to be angry with you? Why, one would think that it was you that brought me low! Your enemies, your unpopularity, that miserably ruined me, and not I that unhappily ruined you! The fact is, the much-praised consulate of mine has deprived me of you, of children, country, fortune; from you I should hope it will have taken nothing but myself. Certainly on your side I have experienced nothing but what was honourable and gratifying: on mine you have grief for my fall and fear for your own, regret, mourning, desertion. Not wish to see you? The truth is rather that I was unwilling to be seen by you. For you would not have seen your brother-not the brother you had left, not the brother you knew, not him to whom you had with mutual tears bidden farewell as he followed you on your departure for your province: not a trace even or faint image of him, but rather what I may call the likeness of a living corpse. And oh that you had sooner seen me or heard of me as a corpse! Oh that I could have left you to survive, not my life merely, but my undiminished rank! But I call all the gods to witness that the one argument which recalled me from death was, that all declared that to some extent your life depended upon mine. In which matter I made an error and acted Culpably. For if I had died, that death itself would have given clear evidence of my fidelity and love to you. As it is, I have allowed you to be deprived of my aid, though I am alive, and with me still living to need the help of others; and my voice, of all others, to fail when dangers threatened my family, which had so often been successfully used in the defence of the merest strangers. For as to the slaves coming to you without a letter, the real reason (for you see that it was not anger) was a deadness of my faculties, and a seemingly endless deluge of tears and sorrows. How many tears do you suppose these very words have Cost me? As many as I know they will cost you to read them! Can I ever refrain from thinking of you or ever think of you without tears? For when I miss you, is it only a brother that I miss? Rather it is a brother of almost my own age in the charm of his companionship, a son in his consideration for my wishes, a father in the wisdom of his advice! What pleasure did I ever have without you, or you without me? And what must my case be when at the same time I miss a daughter: How affectionate! how modest! how clever! The express image of my face, of my speech, of my very soul! Or again a son, the prettiest boy, the very joy of my heart? Cruel inhuman monster that I am, I dismissed him from my arms better schooled in the world than I could have wished: for the poor child began to understand what was going on. So, too, your own son, your own image, whom my little <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> loved as a brother, and was now beginning to respect as an elder brother! Need I mention also how I refused to allow my unhappy wife — the truest of helpmates — to accompany me, that there might be some one to protect the wrecks of the calamity which had fallen on us both, and guard our common children? Nevertheless, to the best of my ability, I did write a letter to you, and gave it to your freedman Philogonus, which, I believe, was delivered to you later on; and in this I repeated the advice and entreaty, which had been already transmitted to you as a message from me by my slaves, that you should go on with your journey and hasten to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. For, in the first place, I desired your protection, in case there were any of my enemies whose cruelty was not yet satisfied by my fall. In the next place, I dreaded the renewed lamentation which our meeting would cause: while I could not have borne your departure, and was afraid of the very thing you mention in your letter — that you would be unable to tear yourself away. For these reasons the supreme pain of not seeing you — and nothing more painful or more wretched could, I think, have happened to the most affectionate and united of brothers-was a less misery than would have been such a meeting followed by such a parting. Now, if you can, though I, whom you always regarded as a brave man, cannot do so, rouse yourself and collect your energies in view of any contest you may have to confront. I hope, if my hope has anything to go upon, that your own spotless character and the love of your fellow citizens, and even remorse for my treatment, may prove a certain protection to you. But if it turns out that you are free from personal danger, you will doubtless do whatever you think can be done for me. In that matter, indeed, many write to me at great length and declare that they have hopes; but I personally cannot see what hope there is, since my enemies have the greatest influence, while my friends have in some cases deserted, in others even betrayed me, fearing perhaps in my restoration a censure on their own treacherous conduct. But how matters stand with you I would have you ascertain and report to me. In any case I shall continue to live as long as you shall need me, in view of any danger you may have to undergo: longer than that I cannot go on in this kind of life. For there is neither wisdom nor philosophy with sufficient strength to sustain such a weight of grief. I know that there has been a time for dying, more honourable and more advantageous; and this is not the only one of my many omissions, which, if I should choose to bewail, I should merely be increasing your sorrow and emphasizing my own stupidity. But one thing I am not bound to do, and it is in fact impossible-remain in a life so wretched and so dishonoured any longer than your necessities, or some well-grounded hope, shall demand. For I, who was lately supremely blessed in brother, children, wife, wealth, and in the very nature of that wealth, while in position, influence, reputation, and popularity, I was inferior to none, however distinguished — I cannot, I repeat, go on longer lamenting over myself and those dear to me in a life of such humiliation as this, and in a state of such utter ruin. Wherefore, what do you mean by writing to me about negotiating a bill of exchange? As though I were not now wholly dependent on your means! And that is just the very thing in which I see and feel, to my misery, of what a culpable act I have been guilty in squandering to no purpose the money which I received from the treasury in your name, while you have to satisfy your creditors out of the very vitals of yourself and your son. However, the sum mentioned in your letter has been paid to M. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, and the same amount to <a href=/people/1001 target=_blank>Caepio</a>. For me the sum at present in my hands is sufficient for what I contemplate doing. For in either case — whether I am restored or given up in despair — I shall not want any more money. For yourself, if you are molested, I think you should apply to <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> and <a href=/people/2392 target=_blank>Calidius</a>. I don't know how far <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> is to be trusted. Myself, with the most elaborate pretence of affection and the closest daily intimacy, he treated with the most utter want of principle and the most consummate treachery, and Q. <a href=/people/3343 target=_blank>Arrius</a> helped him in it: acting under whose advice, promises, and injunctions, I was left helpless to fall into this disaster. But this you will keep dark for fear they might injure you. Take care also — and it is on this account that I think you should Cultivate <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> himself by means of <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a> — that the epigram on the lex Aurelia attributed to you when Candidate for the aedileship is not proved by false testimony to be yours. For there is nothing that I am so afraid of as that, when people understand how much pity for me your prayers and your acquittal will rouse, they may attack you with all the greater violence. <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> I reckon as really attached to you: <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> I regard as still pretending only. But may you never have to put these things to the test! And that prayer I would have offered to the gods had they not ceased to listen to prayers of mine. However, I do pray that they may be content with these endless miseries of ours; among which, after all, there is no discredit for any wrong thing done-sorrow is the beginning and end, sorrow that punishment is most severe when our conduct has been most unexceptionable. As to my daughter and yours and my young <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, why should I recommend them to you, my dear brother? Rather I grieve that their orphan state will cause you no less sorrow than it does me. Yet as long as you are uncondemned they will not be fatherless. The rest, by my hopes of restoration and the privilege of dying in my fatherland, my tears will not allow me to write! <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> also I would ask you to protect, and to write me word on every subject. Be as brave as the nature of the case admits. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=place long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonica</a>, 13 June. </p>                        </div>

I, 4) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (AT ROME) THESSALONICA, AUGUST: I beg you, my dear brother, if you and all my family have been ruined by my single misfortune, not to attribute it to dishonesty and bad conduct on my part, rather than to shortsightedness and the wretched state I was in. I have committed no fault except in trusting those whom I believed to be bound by the most sacred obligation not to deceive me, or whom I thought to be even interested in not doing so. All my most intimate, nearest and dearest friends were either alarmed for themselves or jealous of me: the result was that all I lacked was good faith on the part of my friends and caution on my own. But if your own blameless character and the compassion of the world prove sufficient to preserve you at this juncture from molestation, you can, of course, observe whether any hope of restoration is left for me. For <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a>, <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>, and my son-in-law <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> have caused me as yet to stay at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=place long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonica</a>, forbidding me, on account of certain impending movements, to increase my distance. But in truth I am awaiting the result more on account of their letters than from any firm hope of my own. For what can I hope with an enemy possessed of the most formidable power, with my detractors masters of the state, with friends unfaithful, with numbers of people jealous? However, of the new tribunes there is one, it is true, most warmly attached to me — <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> — and I hope <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a>, <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>, <a href=/people/1943 target=_blank>Fadius</a>, <a href=/people/820 target=_blank>Fabricius</a>; but still there is <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> in violent opposition, who even when out of office will be able to stir up the passions of the mob by the help of that same gang, and then there will be found some one also to veto the bill. Such a state of things was not put before me when I was leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, but I often used to be told that I was certain to return in three days with the greatest eclat. What made you go, then? you will say. What, indeed! Many circumstances concurred to throw me off my balance — the defection of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, the hostility of the consuls, and of the praetors also, the timidity of the publicani, the armed bands. The tears of my friends prevented me seeking refuge in death, which would certainly have been the best thing for my honour, the best escape from unbearable sorrows. But I have written to you on this subject in the letter I gave to <a href=/people/8136 target=_blank>Phaetho</a>. Now that you have been plunged into griefs and troubles, such as no one ever was before, if the compassion of the world can lighten our common misfortune, you will, it seems, score a success beyond belief! But if we are both utterly ruined — ah me-I shall have been the absolute destruction of my whole family, to whom I used to be at least no discredit! But pray, as I said in a previous letter to you, look into the business, test it thoroughly, and write to me with the candour which our situation demands, and not as your affection for me would dictate. I shall retain my life as long as I shall think that it is in your interest for me to do so, or that it ought to be preserved with a view to future hope. You will find <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> most friendly to us, and I believe that <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, the coming consul, will also be so for your sake. However, deeds are not so easy as words. You will see what is wanted and what the truth is. On the whole, supposing that no one takes advantage of your unprotected position and our common calamity, it is by your means, or not at all, that something may be effected. But even if your enemies have begun to annoy you, don't flinch: for you will be attacked by legal process, not by swords. However, I hope that this may not occur. I beg you to write me back word on all subjects, and to believe that though I have less spirit and resource than in old times, I have quite as much affection and loyalty. </p>                        </div>

II, 1) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN SARDINIA) ROME (10 DECEMBER) The letter which you have already read I had sent off in the morning. But <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> was polite enough to call on me in the evening after the senate had risen, that, in case of any business having been done there, I might, if I thought good, write an account of it to you. The senate was fuller than I had thought possible in the month of December just before the holidays. Of us consulars there were P. <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a>, M. <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>, <a href=/people/1683 target=_blank>Volcatius</a>, <a href=/people/1243 target=_blank>Glabrio</a>: the two consuls-designate; the praetors. We were a really full house: two hundred in all. Lupus had excited some interest. He raised the question of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=demonym long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campanian</a> land in considerable detail. He was listened to in profound silence. You are not unaware what material that subject affords. He omitted none of the points which I had made in this business. There were some sharp thrusts at <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, some denunciations of <a href=/people/1509 target=_blank>Gellius</a>, some appeals to the absent <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. After concluding his speech at a late hour, he said that he would not ask for our votes lest he might burden us with a personal controversy; he quite understood the sentiments of the senate from the denunciations of past times and the silence on the present occasion. <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> spoke. Lupus begins the formula of dismissal, when <a href=/people/1706 target=_blank>Marcellinus</a> says: Don't infer from our silence, Lupus, what we approve or disapprove of at this particular time. As far as I am concerned, and I think it is the same with the rest, I am only silent because I do not think it suitable that the case of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=demonym long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campanian</a> land should be debated in <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s absence. Then Lupus said that he would not detain the senate. <a href=/people/5220 target=_blank>Racilius</a> rose and began bringing before the house the case of the pro-posed prosecutions. He calls upon <a href=/people/1706 target=_blank>Marcellinus</a>, of course, first; who, after complaining in serious tones of the <a href=/people/4124 target=_blank>Clodian</a> incendiaries, massacres, and stonings, proposed a resolution that <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> himself should, under the superintendence of the praetor urbanus, have his jury allotted to him; that the elections should be held only when the allotment of jurors had been Completed; that whoever stopped the trials would be acting against the interests of the state. The proposal having been received with warm approval, Gaius <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> — as did also <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> — spoke against it, with very emphatic murmurs of disapprobation on the part of the senate, when he proposed to hold the elections before the trials. <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a> supported <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>. After that <a href=/people/5220 target=_blank>Racilius</a> called on me first of the unofficial senators for my opinion. I made a long speech upon the whole story of P. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>'s mad proceedings and murderous violence: I impeached him at considerable length, and, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> with no little as though he were on his trial, amidst frequent murmurs of approbation from the whole senate. My speech was praised oratorical skill by <a href=/people/1531 target=_blank>Antistius</a> <a href=/people/3484 target=_blank>Vetus</a>, who also supported the priority of the legal proceedings, and declared that he should consider it of the first importance. The senators were crossing the floor in support of this view, when <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>, being called on, began trying to talk out the sitting. He spoke in furious terms of having been attacked by <a href=/people/5220 target=_blank>Racilius</a> in an unreasonable and discourteous manner. Then his roughs on the <a href=/people/9453 target=_blank>Graecostasis</a> and the steps of the house suddenly raised a pretty loud shout, in wrath, I suppose, against Q. <a href=/people/2785 target=_blank>Sextilius</a> and the other friends of <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>. At this sudden alarm we broke up with loud expressions of indignation on all sides. Here are the transactions of one day for you: the rest, I think, will be put off to January. Of all the tribunes I think <a href=/people/5220 target=_blank>Racilius</a> is by far the best: <a href=/people/1531 target=_blank>Antistius</a> also seems likely to be friendly to me: <a href=/people/3070 target=_blank>Plancius</a>, of course, is wholly ours. Pray, if you love me, be careful and cautious about sailing in December. </p>                        </div>

II, 2) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN SARDINIA) ROME, 18 JANUARY: It was not from the multiplicity of business, though I am very much engaged, but from a slight inflammation of the eyes that I was induced to dictate this letter, and not, as is my usual habit, write it with my own hand. And, to begin with, I wish to excuse myself to you on the very point on which I accuse you. For no one up to now has asked me whether I have any commands for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>  — I think you often have people who say, Have you any commands for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>? As to what you have said in your letters to me about the debt of <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> and <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>, I have spoken with <a href=/people/1775 target=_blank>Cincius</a>. However the matter stands, it is not the easiest in the world. But surely <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a> must have some special property for recalling one's memory of the past. For just as the famous <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a> — as augur — after arriving in that province remembered something that had happened to him, when holding the elections in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCMa class=place long=12.481 lat=41.905>Campus Martius</a>, in violation of the auspices, so you appear to me to have recalled at your ease in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a> the design of <a href=/people/5835 target=_blank>Numisius</a> and the debts due to <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a>. As yet I have made no purchase. <a href=/people/2860 target=_blank>Culleo</a>'s auction has taken place: there was no purchaser for his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> property. If very favourable terms were to be offered, I should perhaps not let it slip About your building I do not fail to press <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>. I hope he will do his duty But everything goes on somewhat slowly owing to the prospect of that madman's aedileship. For it seems that the legislative assembly will take place without delay it has been fixed for the 20th of January. However I would not have you uneasy. Every precaution shall be taken by me In regard to the Alexandrine king, a decree of the senate was passed declaring it dangerous to the Republic that he should be restored with a host. The point remaining to be decided in the senate being whether <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> or <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> should restore him, <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> seemed on the point of carrying the day. In that matter Ididjustice to my obligations to <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> marvellously well, while at the same time splendidly gratifying <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s wishes: but the detractors of <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> Contrived to talk the matter out by obstructive speeches. Then followed the comitial days, on which a meeting of the senate was impossible. What the villainy of the tribunes is going to accomplish I cannot guess; I suspect, however, that <a href=/people/1657 target=_blank>Caninius</a> will carry his bill by violence. In this business I cannot make Out what <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> really wishes. What his entourage desire everybody sees. Those who are financing the king are openly advancing sums of money against <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>. There seems no doubt that the commission has been taken out of <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>'s hands, to my very great regret, although he has done many things for which I might, if it were not for superior considerations, be justly angry with him. I hope, if it is consistent with your interests, that you will embark as soon as possible, when the weather is fair and settled, and come to me. For there are countless things, in regard to which I miss you daily in every possible way. Your family and my own are well. 18 January. </p>                        </div>

II, 3) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN SARDINIA) ROME, 12 FEBRUARY: I have already told you the earlier proceedings; now let me describe what was done afterwards. The legations were post-poned from the 1st of February to the 13th. On the former day our business was not brought to a settlement. On the 2nd of February <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> appeared for trial. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> came to support him. <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> spoke on being called upon by me. We came off with flying colours. The case was adjourned to the 7th. Meanwhile (in the senate), the legations having been postponed to the 13th, the business of allotting the quaestors and furnishing the outfit of the praetors was brought before the house. But nothing was done, because many speeches were interposed denouncing the state of the Republic. Gaius <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> published his bill for the recall of <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, whose son thereupon put on mourning. On the 7th <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> appeared. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> spoke, or rather wished to speak. For as soon as he got up <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>'s ruffians raised a shout, and throughout his whole speech he was interrupted, not only by hostile cries, but by personal abuse and insulting remarks. However, when he had finished his speech — for he showed great courage in these circumstances, he was not cowed, he said all he had to say, and at times had by his Commanding presence even secured silence for his words — well, when he had finished, up got <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>. Our party received him with such a shout — for they had determined to pay him out — that he lost all presence of mind, power of speech, or control over his countenance. This went on up to two o'clock — Pompey having finished his speech at noon — and every kind of abuse, and finally epigrams of the most outspoken indecency were uttered against <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> and <a href=/people/2099 target=_blank>Clodia</a>. Mad and livid with rage <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>, in the very midst of the shouting, kept putting questions to his claque: Who was it who was starving the commons to death? His ruffians answered, Pompey. Who wanted to be sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>? They answered, Pompey. Who did they wish to go? They answered, <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>. The latter was present at the time with no friendly feelings to <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>. About three o'clock, as though at a given signal, the Clodians began spitting at our men. There was an outburst of rage. They began a movement for forcing us from our ground. Our men charged: his ruffians turned tail. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> was pushed off the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BRoA class=place long=12.48458 lat=41.89258>Rostra</a>: and then we too made our escape for fear of mischief in the riot. The senate was summoned into the Curia: <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> went home. However, I did not myself enter the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate-house</a>, lest I should be obliged either to refrain from speaking on matters of such gravity, or in defending <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> (for he was being attacked by <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a>, <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>, <a href=/people/1184 target=_blank>Favonius</a>, and <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a> the younger) should give offence to the loyalists. The business was adjourned to the next day. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> fixed the <a href=/people/3241 target=_blank>Quirinalia</a> (17th of February) for his prosecution. On the 8th the senate met in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SApo class=place long=12.4797 lat=41.8925>temple</a> of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> might attend. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> made an impressive speech. That day nothing was concluded. On the 9th in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SApo class=place long=12.4797 lat=41.8925>temple</a> of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> a decree passed the senate that what had taken place on the 7th of February was treasonable. On this day <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> warmly inveighed against <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, and throughout his speech arraigned him as though he were at the bar. He said a great deal about me, to my disgust, though it was in very laudatory terms. When he attacked <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s perfidy to me, he was listened to in profound silence on the part of my enemies. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> answered him boldly with a palpable allusion to <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>, and said outright that he would take better precautions to protect his life than Mricanus had done, whom C. <a href=/people/669 target=_blank>Carbo</a> had assassinated. Accordingly, important events appear to me to be in the wind. For <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> understands what is going on, and imparts to me that plots are being formed against his life, that Gaius <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> is being supported by <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>, that money is being supplied to <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>, that both are backed by <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> and <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>, as well as by <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> and his other detractors: that he must take extraordinary precautions to prevent being overpowered by that demagogue-with a people all but wholly alienated, a nobility hostile, a senate ill-affected, and the younger men corrupt. So he is making his preparations and summoning men from the country. On his part, <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> is rallying his gangs: a body of men is being got together for the <a href=/people/3241 target=_blank>Quirinalia</a>. For that occasion we are considerably in a majority, owing to the forces brought up by <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> himself: and a large contingent is expected from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a> and Gallia, to enable us to throw out <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>'s bills also about '<a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> and <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>. On the 10th of February an indictment was lodged against <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> for bribery by the informer Cn. Nerius, of the Pupinian tribe, and on the same day by a certain M. <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> for riot. He was ill. I went at once, as I was bound to do, to his house, and put myself wholly at his service: and that was more than people expected, who thought that I had good cause for being angry with him. The result is that my extreme kindness and grateful disposition are made manifest both to <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> himself and to all the world, and I shall be as good as my word. But this same informer Nerius also named Cn. <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> Vatia and C. <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> to the commissioners. On the same day a decree passed the senate that political clubs and associations should be broken up, and that a law in regard to them should be brought in, enacting that those who did not break off from them should be liable to the same penalty as those convicted of riot. On the 11th of February I spoke in defence of <a href=/people/3782 target=_blank>Bestia</a> on a charge of bribery before the praetor Cn. <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, in the middle of the forum and in a very crowded court; and in the course of my speech I came to the incident of <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>, after receiving many wounds in the temple of <a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a>, having been preserved by the aid of <a href=/people/3782 target=_blank>Bestia</a>. Here I took occasion to pave the way beforehand for a refutation of the charges which are being got up against <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>, and I passed a well-deserved encomium upon him with the cordial approval of everybody. He was himself very much delighted with it. I tell you this because you have often advised me in your letters to retain the friendship of <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>. I am writing this on the 12th of February before daybreak the day on which I am to dine with <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a> on the occasion of his wedding. Our position in other respects is such as you used to cheer my despondency by telling me it would be-one of great dignity and popularity: this is a return to old times for you and me effected, my brother, by your patience, high character, loyalty, and, I may also add, your conciliatory manners. The house of <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a>, near the grove of <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, has been taken for you. But, as I hope, in a few months' time, after the 1st of July, you will move into your own. Some excellent tenants, the Lamini, have taken your house in Carinae. I have received no letter from you since the one dated <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409095UOlb class=place long=9.5078 lat=40.9236>Olbia</a>. I am anxious to hear how you are and what you find to amuse you, but above all to see you yourself as soon as possible. Take care of your health, my dear brother, and though it is winter time, yet reflect that after all it is <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a> that you are in. 15 February. </p>                        </div>

As to what I had often gathered from your letters, that you were anxious about — that I should not leave any loophole for abuse to an unfriendly critic on the score of my being ungrateful, if I did not treat with the utmost indulgence his occasional wrong-headedness — let me tell you that in this trial I established my character for being the most grateful of men. For in conducting the defence I satisfied in the fullest manner possible a man of difficult temper, and, what he above all things desired, I cut up <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a> (by whom he was being openly attacked) just as I pleased, with the applause of gods and men. And, farther, when our friend <a href=/people/1299 target=_blank>Paullus</a> was brought forward as a witness against <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>, he affirmed that he would lay an information against <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a> if <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> Macer hesitated to do so, and Macer, rising from <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>'s benches, declared that he would not fail. Need I say more? That impudent swaggering fellow <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a> was overwhelmed with confusion and thoroughly discredited. That most excellent boy, your son Quintus, is getting on splendidly with his education. I notice this the more because <a href=/people/2357 target=_blank>Tyrannio</a> gives his lessons in my house. The building of both your house and mine is being pushed on energetically. I have caused half the money to be paid to your contractor. I hope before winter we may be under the same roof. As to our <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a>, who, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, is very warmly attached to you, I hope I have settled her engagement with <a href=/people/2511 target=_blank>Crassipes</a>. There are two days after the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> festival which are barred by religion. Otherwise the festival of luppiter <a href=/people/3412 target=_blank>Latiaris</a> has come to an end. The affluence which you often mention I feel the want of to a certain extent; but while I welcome it if it comes to me, I am not exactly beating the covert for it. I am building in three places, and am patching up my other houses. I live somewhat more lavishly than I used to do. I am obliged to do so. If I had you with me I should give the builders full swing for a while. But this too (as I hope) we shall shortly talk over together. The state of affairs at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> is this: <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> <a href=/people/1706 target=_blank>Marcellinus</a> is splendid as consul, and his colleague does not put any difficulty in his way: he is so good, I repeat, that I have never seen a better. He deprived them of all the comitial days for even the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> festival is being repeated, nor were thanks-giving days wanting. In this way the passing of most mischievous laws is prevented, especially that of <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, on whom, however, our friend <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> played a very pretty trick. For that defender of the employment of gladiators and beast-fighters had bought some beast-fighters from <a href=/people/3566 target=_blank>Cosconius</a> and <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a>, and had never appeared in public without them in their full armour. He could not afford to maintain them, and accordingly had great difficulty in keeping them together. <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> found this out. He commissioned an individual, with whom he was not intimate, to buy this troop from <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> without exciting his suspicion. As soon as it had been removed, <a href=/people/5220 target=_blank>Racilius</a> — at this time quite the only real tribune-revealed the truth, acknowledged that the men had been purchased for himself — for this is what they had agreed — and put up a notice that he intended to sell <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>'s troop. This notice caused much laughter. Accordingly, <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> has prevented <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> from going on with his laws, and also those who published bills of a monstrous description about <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, with no tribune to veto them. <a href=/people/1657 target=_blank>Caninius</a>'s proposal, indeed, about <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> has died a natural death. For it is not approved of in itself, and our friend <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> is also spoken of with great severity for the breach of his friendship with Publius <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>. He is not the man he was. The fact is that to the lowest dregs of the populace his support of <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> gives some offence, while the aristocrats are dissatisfied with much that he omits to do, and find fault with much that he does. This is the only point, however, in which I am not pleased with <a href=/people/1706 target=_blank>Marcellinus</a> — that he handles him too roughly. Yet in this he is not going counter to the wishes of the senate: consequently I am the more glad to withdraw from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate-house</a> and from politics altogether. In the courts I have the same position as I ever had: never was my house more crowded. One untoward circumstance has occurred owing to <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>'s rashness — the acquittal of Sext. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> — whose prosecution at this particular time, and by a weak set of accusers, was against my advice. In a most Corrupt panel his conviction failed by only three votes. Consequently the people clamour for a fresh trial, and he must surely be brought back into court. For people will not put up with it, and seeing that, though pleading before a panel of his own kidney, he was all but condemned, they look upon him as practically condemned. Even in this matter the unpopularity of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> was an obstacle in our path. For the votes of the senators were largely in his favour, those of the knights were equally divided, while the tribuni aerarii voted for his condemnation. But for this contretemps I am consoled by the daily condemnations of my enemies, among whom, to my great delight, <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> got upon the rocks: the rest are utterly done for. Gaius <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> declared in public meeting that he would not allow the elections to be held, if he were deprived of the days for doing business with the people. <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> has not yet returned from his visit to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. I am looking forward with extraordinary eagerness to a letter from you. Although I know the sea is still closed, yet they tell me that certain persons have, nevertheless, arrived from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409095UOlb class=place long=9.5078 lat=40.9236>Olbia</a> full of your praises, and declaring you to be very highly thought of in the province. They said also that these persons reported that you intended to cross as soon as navigation became possible. That is what I desire: but although it is yourself, of course, that I most look forward to, yet meanwhile I long for a letter. Farewell, my dear brother. </p>                        </div>

II, 5) (AND PARTS OF 6 AND 7) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN SARDINIA) ROME, 8 APRIL: I have already sent you a letter containing the information of my daughter <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a> having been betrothed to <a href=/people/2511 target=_blank>Crassipes</a> on the 4th of April, and other intelligence public and private. The following are the events since then. On the 5th of April, by a decree of the senate, a sum of money amounting to 40,000 sestertia was voted to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> for the business of the corn-supply. But on the same day there was a vehement debate on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=demonym long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campanian</a> land, the senators making almost as much noise as a public meeting. The shortness of money and the high price of corn increased the exasperation. Nor will I omit the following: the members of the colleges of the Capitolini and the Mercuriales expelled from their society a Roman knight named M. <a href=/people/463 target=_blank>Furius</a> <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, a man of bad character: the expulsion took place when he was at the meeting, and though he threw himself at the feet of each member. On the 6th of April, the eve of my departure from town, I gave a betrothal party to <a href=/people/2511 target=_blank>Crassipes</a>. That excellent boy, your and my Quintus, was not at the banquet owing to a very slight indisposition. On the 7th of April I visited Quintus and found him quite restored. He talked a good deal and with great feeling about the quarrels between our wives. What need I say more? Nothing could have been pleasanter. <a href=/people/3074 target=_blank>Pomponia</a>, however, had some complaints to make of you also: but of this when we meet. After leaving your boy I went to the site of your house: the building was going on with a large number of workmen. I urged the contractor Longilius to push on. He assured me that he had every wish to satisfy us. The house will be splendid, for it can be better seen now than we could judge from the plan: my own house is also being built with despatch. On this day I dined with <a href=/people/2511 target=_blank>Crassipes</a>. After dinner I went in my sedan to visit <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> at his suburban villa. I had not been able to call on him in the daytime as he was away from home. However, I wished to see him, because I am leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> tomorrow, and he is on the point of starting for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>. I found him at home and begged him to restore you to us as soon as possible. Immediately, he said. He is going to start, according to what he said, on the 11th of April, with the intention of embarking at ?Labrone? or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437104UPis class=place long=10.3992 lat=43.7105>Pisa</a>. Mind, my dear brother, that, as soon as he arrives, you seize the first opportunity of setting sail, provided only that the weather is favourable. I write this on the 8th of April before daybreak, and am on the point of starting on my journey, with the intention of stopping today with Titus Tititis at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417132UAna class=place long=13.1589 lat=41.7422>Anagnia</a>. Tomorrow I think of being at <a href=/people/5076 target=_blank>Laterium</a>, thence, after five days in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a>, going to my Pompeian house, just looking in upon my villa at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=place long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a> on my return journey, with the view — since <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>'s trial has been fixed for the 7th of May — of being at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the 6th, and of seeing you on that day, I hope, dearest and pleasantest of brothers. I thought it best that the building at Arcanum should be suspended till your return. Take good care, my dear brother, of your health, and come as soon as possible. </p>                        </div>

II, 6) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (RETURNING FROM SARDINIA) ROME, MAY: How delighted I was to get your letter! It had been expected by me at first, it is true, only with longing, but recently with alarm also. And, in fact, let me tell you that this is the only letter which has reached me since the one brought me by your sailor and dated <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409095UOlb class=place long=9.5078 lat=40.9236>Olbia</a>. But let everything else, as you say, be reserved till we can talk it over together. One thing, however, I cannot put off: on the 15th of May the senate covered itself with glory by refusing <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> asupplicatio. <a href=/people/5930 target=_blank>Procilius</a> vows that such a slight was never inflicted on anyone. Out of doors there is much applause. To me, gratifying as it is on its own account, it is even more so because it was done when I was not in the house. For it was an unbiassed judgment of the senate, without any attack or exercise of influence on my part. The debate previously arranged for the 15th and 16th, namely, the question of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=demonym long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campanian</a> land, did not come on. In this matter I don't quite see my way. But I have said more than I meant to say: for it is best reserved till we meet. Good-bye, best and most longed — for of brothers! Fly to me. Our boys both share my prayer: of course, you will dine with me the day of your arrival. </p>                        </div>

II, 7) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN THE COUNTRY) ROME (FEBRUARY) I thought you would like my book: that you like it as much as you say I am greatly delighted. As to your hint about my <a href=/people/10587 target=_blank>Urania</a> and your advice to remember the speech of lupiter, which comes at the end of that book, I do indeed remember it, and that whole passage was aimed at myself rather than at the rest of the world. Nevertheless, the day after you started I went long before daybreak with <a href=/people/2268 target=_blank>Vibullius</a> to call on <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>; and upon addressing him on the subject of the works and inscriptions in your honour, he answered me very kindly, gave me great hopes, said he would like to talk to <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> about it, and advised me to do so too. I joined in escorting <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> to his house on his assuming the consulate: he undertook the affair, and said that <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> would at this juncture have something that wanted to get by means of himself and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>: he thought that, if I did not baulk <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>'s views, I might get what I wanted without any opposition. I left the matter entirely in his hands and told him that I would do exactly as he wished. Publius <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> the younger was present at this conversation, who, as you know, is very warmly attached to me. What <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> wants is an honorary mission (if not by decree of the senate, then by popular vote) to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> or to Brogitarus, or to both. There is a good deal of money in it. It is a thing I don't trouble myself about much, even if I don't get what I am trying to get. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, however, has spoken to <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>. They seem to have taken the business in hand. If they carry it through, well and good: if not, let us return to my <a href=/people/6566 target=_blank>Iupiter</a>. On the 11th of February a decree passed the senate as to bribery on the motion of <a href=/people/847 target=_blank>Afranius</a>, against which I had spoken when you were in the house. To the loudly expressed disapprobation of the senate the consuls did not go on with the proposals of those who, while agreeing with <a href=/people/847 target=_blank>Afranius</a>'s motion, added a rider that after their election the praetors were to remain private citizens for sixty days. On that day they unmistakably threw over <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>. In short, they manage everything their own way, and wish all the world to understand it to be so. </p>                        </div>

Have you taken a lesson from <a href=/people/1740 target=_blank>Ateius</a>? So help me heaven, in my eyes you give me a lesson in a kind of learning which I never enjoy unless you are with me. Why, that you should talk to me, interrupt me, argue against me, or converse with me, is just what I should like. Nothing could be more delightful! Never, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, did any crazy poet read with greater zest his last composition than I listen to you, no matter what business is in hand, public or private, rural or urban. But it was all owing to my foolish scrupulousness that I did not carry you off with me when I was leaving town. You confronted me the first time with an unanswerable excuse — the health of my son: I was silenced. The second time it was both boys, yours and mine: I acquiesced. Now comes a delightful letter, but with this drop of gall in it — that you seem to have been afraid, and still to be afraid, that you might bore me. I would go to law with you if it were decent to do so; but, by heaven! if ever I have a suspicion of such a feeling on your part, I can only say that I shall begin to be afraid of boring you at times, when in your company. [I perceive that you have sighed at this. 'Tis the way of the world: But if you lived on earth ... I will never finish the quotation and say, Away with all care! ] <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, again, I should certainly have forced into my sedan — I don't mean that famous one of <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> that <a href=/people/1345 target=_blank>Anicius</a> got hold of: for I remember when I was conveying him from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PBai class=place long=14.0699 lat=40.8178>Baiae</a> in <a href=/people/1345 target=_blank>Anicius</a>'s eight-bearer sedan, with a hundred armed guards in our train, I had a real good laugh when <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, knowing nothing of his escort, suddenly drew back the curtains of the sedan — he was almost dead with fright and I with laughing: well, this same friend, I say, I should at least have carried off; to secure, at any rate, the delicate charm of that old-fashioned courtesy, and of a conversation which is the essence of culture. But I did not like to invite a man of weak health to a villa practically without a roof, and which even now it would be a compliment to describe as unfinished. It would indeed be a special treat to me to have the enjoyment of him here also. For I assure you that the neighbourhood of <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> makes the sunshine of that other country residence of mine. I will see about getting him put up in the house of <a href=/people/1345 target=_blank>Anicius</a>. For I myself, though a student, can live with workpeople in the house.

As to interrupting my book — I shall take from you just so much time for writing as you may leave me I only hope you'll leave me none at all, that my want of progress may be set down to your encroachment rather than to my idleness! In regard to politics, I am sorry that you worry yourself too much, and are a better citizen than <a href=/people/448 target=_blank>Philoctetes</a>, who, on being wronged himself, was anxious for the very spectacle that I perceive gives you pain.

II, 10) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN THE COUNTRY) ROME (FEBRUARY) I am glad you like my letter: however, I should not even now have had anything to write about, if I had not received yours. For on the 12th, when <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> had got together a thinly-attended meeting of the senate, the cold was so great that he was compelled by the general clamour to dismiss us. As to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380387RCom class=person long=38.74 lat=37.98>Commagenian</a>, because I have blown that proposition to the winds, <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> makes wonderful advances to me both personally and through <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a>; for he sees that if I adopt a similar style of discussion in the other business, February will not bring him anything in. And certainly I did chaff him pretty well, and not only wrenched from his grasp that petty township of his — situated in the territory of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370379UZeu class=place long=37.8768 lat=37.048>Zeugma</a> on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> — but also raised a loud laugh by my satire on the man's purple-edged toga, which he had been granted when <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was consul. His wish, said I, for a renewal of the same honour, to save the yearly re-dying of his purple-edged toga, I do not think calls for any decree of the house; but you, my lords, who could not endure that the Bostrian should wear the toga praetexta, will you allow the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380387RCom class=person long=38.74 lat=37.98>Commagenian</a> to do so? You see the style of chaff, and the line I took. I spoke at length against the petty princeling, with the result that he was utterly laughed out of court. Alarmed by this exhibition, as I said, <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> is making up to me For nothing could be easier than to explode the rest of his proposals. But I will not go so far as to trip him up, lest he appeal to the god of hospitality, and summon all his Greeks — it is they who make us friends again. I will do what <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> wants. I had forgotten to write to you about <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>: for I perceive what sort of letter you have been expecting. But the fact is, he has written word to <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> that the little packet of letters, in which mine and <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>'s were packed, had been so drenched with rain that he was not even aware that there was a letter from me. He had, however, made out a few words of <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>'s letter, to which he answered as follows: I perceive that you have written something about <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, which I have not fully made out: but, as far I could guess, it was of a kind that I thought was more to be wished than hoped for. Accordingly, I afterwards sent <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> a duplicate copy of the letter. Don't be put off by that passage about his want of means. In answer to it I wrote back saying that he must not stop payment from any reliance on my money chest, and descanted playfully on that subject, in familiar terms and yet without derogating from my dignity. His good feeling towards us, however, according to all accounts, is marked. The letter, indeed, on the point of which you expect to hear, will almost coincide with your return: the other business of each day I will write on condition of your furnishing me with letter-carriers. However, such cold weather is threatening, that there is very great danger that <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> may find his house frost-bitten and deserted! </p>                        </div>

II, 11) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN THE COUNTRY) ROME (15 FEBRUARY) Your black snow made me laugh, and I am very glad that you are in a cheerful frame of mind and ready for a joke. As to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, I agree with you, or rather you agree with me. For, as you know, I have long been singing the praises of your <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. Believe me, he is very close to my heart, and I am not going to let him slip from his place. Now for the history of the Ides (13th). It was <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a>'s tenth day. <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> had not obtained a full panel. I am afraid that foul ruffian, <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> <a href=/people/8189 target=_blank>Pola</a>, will appear for the prosecution. For our friend <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a> has a dead set made at him by the <a href=/people/4124 target=_blank>Clodian</a> gens. There is nothing certain as yet, but I am afraid. On the same day there was a full house for the case of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a>: the publicani of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> appeared in large numbers against them. <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> was abused roundly: the publicani were also denounced by (the consul) <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> for having escorted him on his start on horseback. Our friend Lucius <a href=/people/694 target=_blank>Lamia</a> was somewhat insolent: for on <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> saying, It is your fault, equites of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, that such things have happened: for you give verdicts laxly, he said, Yes, we give verdicts, but you senators give evidence of character. Nothing was done that day: the house stood adjourned at nightfall. On the comitial days which follow the <a href=/people/3241 target=_blank>Quirinalia</a> (17th February), <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> holds the view that he is not prevented by the lex Pupiafrom holding a meeting of the senate, and that by the lex <a href=/people/9414 target=_blank>Gabinia</a> he is even compelled to have a meeting for the legations from the 1st of February to the 1st of March. And so the elections are supposed to be put off till March. Nevertheless, on these comitial days the tribunes say that they will bring forward the case of <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>. I collect every item of intelligence, that I may have some news to tell you: but, as you see, I am short of material. Accordingly, I return to <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a> and <a href=/people/910 target=_blank>Philistus</a>, in whom I see that you have been wallowing. <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a> is a commonplace and hackneyed piece of business, like a good many Greeks. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> is a first-rate writer, terse, sagacious, concise, almost a minor <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a>; but which of his two books you have — for there are two works — I don't know. That about <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> is my favourite. For <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> himself is a magnificent intriguer, and was familiarly known to <a href=/people/910 target=_blank>Philistus</a>. But as to your Postscript — are you really going in for writing history? You have my blessing on your project: and since you furnish me with letter-carriers, you shall hear today's transactions on the <a href=/people/12178 target=_blank>Lupercalia</a> (15th February).

I am writing the treatise of which I spoke to you, On the Republic, a very bulky and laborious work. But if it turns out as I wish, it will be labour well bestowed, and if not I shall toss it into the very sea which I have before my eyes as I write, and set to work on something else; since to do nothing is beyond my power. I will carefully observe your instruction both as to attaching certain persons to myself and not alienating certain others. But my chief care will be to see your son, or rather our son, if possible, every day at any rate, and to watch the progress of his education as often as possible; and, unless he declines my help, I will even offer to be his instructor, a practice to which I have become habituated in the leisure of these days while bringing my own boy, the younger <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, on. Yes, do as you say in your letter, what, even if you had not said so, I know you do with the greatest care — digest, follow up, and carry out my instructions. For my part, when I get to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, I will let no letter-carrier of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> go without a letter for you. During these days you must excuse me: there has been no one to whom I could deliver a letter until the present bearer M.

Accordingly, I recommend him to you with more than common warmth, as a man in a brilliant position in his own town and looked up to even beyond it. Pray attach him to yourself by your liberal treatment of him: he is a military tribune in your army. You will find him grateful and attentive.

II, 13) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN GAUL) ROME (3 JUNE) On the 2nd of June, the day of my return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, I received your letter dated <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450097UPla class=place long=9.6931 lat=45.0526>Placentia</a>: then next day another dated Blandeno, along with a letter from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> filled full of courteous, earnest, and pleasant expressions. These expressions are indeed valuable, or rather most valuable, as tending very powerfully to secure our reputation and exalted position in the state. But believe me — for you know my heart — that what I value most in all this I already possess, that is, first of all, your active contribution to our common position; and, secondly, all that warm affection of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> for me, which I prefer to all the honours which he desires me to expect at his hands. His letter too, despatched at the same time as your own — which begins by saying what pleasure your arrival and the renewed memory of our old affection had given him, and goes on to say that he will take care that, in the midst of my sorrow and regret at losing you, I shall have reason to be glad that you are with him of all people — gave me extraordinary delight. Wherefore you, of course, are acting in a truly brotherly spirit when you exhort me, though, by heaven, I am now indeed forward enough to do so, to concentrate all my attentions upon him alone. Yes, I will do so, indeed, with a burning zeal: and perhaps I shall manage to accomplish what is frequently the fortune of travellers when they make great haste, who, if they have got up later than they intended, have, by increasing their speed, arrived at their destination sooner than if they had waked up before daylight. Thus I, since I have long overslept myself in cultivating that great man, though you, by heaven, often tried to wake me up, will make up for my slowness with <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and (as you say he likes my poem) a poet's chariots. Only let me have <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a> to paint in colours supplied by yourself, but with my own brush. But what am I saying? What prospect of leisure have I, especially as I remain at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> in accordance with his request? But I will see. For perhaps, as usual, my love for you will overcome all difficulties. For my having sent <a href=/people/1407 target=_blank>Trebatius</a> to him he even thanks me in very witty and polite terms, remarking that there was no one in the whole number of his staff who knew how to draw up a recognizance. I have asked him for a tribuneship for M. <a href=/people/1555 target=_blank>Curtius</a> — since <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> (the consul) would have thought that he was being laughed at, if my petition had been addressed to him, for his daily assertion is that he hasn't the appointment of so much as a military tribune: he even jested in the senate at his colleague <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> as having gone to visit <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, that he might get from him at least one tribuneship. But my request was for next year, for that was what <a href=/people/1555 target=_blank>Curtius</a> wished. Whatever line you think I ought to take in politics and in treating my opponents, be sure I shall take, and shall be gentler than any ear-lap. Affairs at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> stand thus: there is some hope of the elections taking place, but it is an uncertain one. There is some latent idea of a dictatorship, but neither is that confirmed. There is profound calm in the forum, but it is rather the calm of decrepitude than content. The opinions I express in the senate are of a kind to win the assent of others rather than my own: Such the effects of miserable war. </p>                        </div>

II, 14) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN GAUL) ROME (JULY) Well! this time I'll use a good pen, well-mixed ink, and superfine paper. For you say you could hardly read my previous letter, for which, my dear brother, the reason was none of those which you suppose. For I was not busy, nor agitated, nor out of temper with some one: but it is always my way to take the first pen that turns up and use it as if it were a good one. But now attend, best and dearest of brothers, to my answer to what you wrote in this same short letter in such a very business-like way. On this subject you beg that I should write back to you with brotherly candour, without concealment, or reserve, or consideration for your feelings — I mean whether you are to hasten home, as we had talked of, or to stay where you are, if there is any excuse for doing so, in order to extricate yourself from your embarrassments. If, my dear Quintus, it were some small matter on which you were asking my opinion, though I should have left it to you to do what you chose, I should yet have shown you what mine was. But on this subject your question amounts to this — what sort of year I expect the next to be? Either quite undisturbed as far as we are concerned, or at any rate one that will find us in the highest state of preparation for defence. This is shown by the daily throng at my house, my reception in the forum, the cheers which greet me in the theatre. My friends feel no anxiety, because they know the strength of my position in my hold upon the favour both of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. These things give me entire confidence. But if some furious outbreak of that madman occurs, everything is ready for crushing him. This is my feeling, my deliberate opinion: I write to you with entire confidence. I bid you have no doubts, and I do so with no intention of pleasing you, but with brotherly frankness. Therefore, while I should wish you to come at the time you arranged, for the sake of the pleasure we should have in each other's society, yet I prefer the course you yourself think the better one. I, too, think these objects of great importance — ample means for yourself and extrication from your load of debt. Make up your mind to this, that, free from embarrassments, we should be the happiest people alive if we keep well. For men of our habits the deficiency is small, and such as can be supplied with the greatest ease, granted only that we keep our health. There is an enormous recrudescence of bribery. Never was there anything equal to it. On the 15th of July the rate of interest rose from four to eight per cent, owing to the compact made by <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a> with the consul <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>: I wish <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> could get the better of it. <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> is very shaky. I am not exaggerating — they arrange to offer as much as 10,000 sestertia for the vote of the first century. The matter is a burning scandal. The candidates for the tribuneship have made a mutual compact — having deposited 500 sestertia apiece with <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, they agree to conduct their canvass according to his direction, with the understanding that anyone offending against it is to be condemned by him. If this election then turns out to be pure, <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> will have been of more avail than all laws and jurors put together. </p>                        </div>

II, 15) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN BRITAIN) ROME (SEPTEMBER) When you receive a letter from me by the hand of an amanuensis, you may be sure that I have not even a little leisure; when by my own — a little. For let me tell you that in regard to causes and trials in court, I have never been closer tied, and that, too, at the most unhealthy season of the year, and in the most oppressively hot weather. But these things, since you so direct me, I must put up with, and must not seem to have come short of the ideas and expectations which you and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> entertain of me, especially since, even if it were somewhat difficult not to do that, I am yet likely from this labour to reap great popularity and prestige. Accordingly, as you wish me to do, I take great pains not to hurt anyone's feelings, and to secure being liked even by those very men who are vexed at my close friendship with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, while by those who are impartial, or even inclined to this side, I may be warmly courted and loved. When some very violent debates took place in the senate on the subject of bribery for several days, because the candidates for the consulship had gone to such lengths as to be past all bearing, I was not in the house. I have made up my mind not to attempt any Cure of the political situation without powerful protection. The day I write this <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> has been acquitted on a charge of collusion by the tribuni aerarii, in the grand total by four votes, for the majority of senators and equites were for condemnation. On the same day I am to defend <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a>. That is an easy matter. The comitia have been put off to September. <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a>'s trial will take place immediately, and I shall not fail to appear for him. I don't like your Sophoclean Banqueters at all, though I see that you played your part with a good grace. I come now to a subject which, perhaps, ought to have been my first. How glad I was to get your letter from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>! I was afraid of the ocean, afraid of the coast of the island. The other parts of the enterprise I do not underrate; but yet they inspire more hope than fear, and it is the suspense rather than any positive alarm that renders me uneasy. You, however, I can see, have a splendid subject for description, topography, natural features of things and places, manners, races, battles, your commander himself — what themes for your pen! I will gladly, as you request, assist you in the points you mention, and will send you the verses you ask for, that is, An <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. But, look you! I think you are keeping me in the dark. Tell me, my dear brother, what <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> thinks of my verses. For he wrote before to tell me he had read my first book. Of the first part, he said that he had never read anything better even in Greek: the rest, up to a particular passage, somewhat careless  — that is his word. Tell me the truth — is it the subject-matter or the style that he does not like? You needn't be afraid: I shall not admire myself one whit the less. On this subject speak like a lover of truth, and with your usual brotherly frankness. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi058:Q.fr.3.1'><b>&sect; Q.fr.3.1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;CXLVII (Q.fr. III, 1) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN BRITAIN) ARPINUM AND ROME, 28 SEPTEMBER: After extraordinarily hot weather — I never remember greater heat — I have refreshed myself at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a>, and enjoyed the extreme loveliness of the river during the days of the games, having left my tribesmen under the charge of <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a>. I was at Arcanum on the 10th of September. There I found Mescidius and <a href=/people/489 target=_blank>Philoxenus</a>, and saw the water, for which they were making a course not far from your villa, running quite nicely, especially considering the extreme drought, and they said that they were going to collect it in much greater abundance. Everything is right with Herus. In your Manilian property I came across <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> outdoing himself in dilatoriness. Still, he had nothing left to construct, except baths, and a promenade, and an aviary. I liked that villa very much, because its paved colonnade gives it an air of very great dignity. I never appreciated this till now that the colonnade itself has been all laid open, and the columns have been polished. It all depends — and this I will look to — upon the stuccoing being prettily done. The pavements seemed to be being well laid. Certain of the ceilings I did not like, and ordered them to be changed. As to the place in which they say that you write word that a small entrance hall is to be built — namely, in the colonnade — I liked it better as it is. For I did not think there was space sufficient for an entrance hall; nor is it usual to have one, except in those buildings which have a larger court; nor could it have bedrooms and apartments of that kind attached to it. As it is, from the very beauty of its arched roof, it will serve as an admirable summer room. However, if you think differently, write back word as soon as possible. In the bath I have moved the hot chamber to the other corner of the dressing-room, because it was so placed that its steam-pipe was immediately under the bedrooms. A fair-sized bedroom and a lofty winter one I admired very much, for they were both spacious and well-situated — on the side of the promenade nearest to the bath. <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> had placed the columns out of the perpendicular, and not opposite each other. These, of course, he shall take down; he will learn some day to use the plumb-line and measure. On the whole, I hope <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>'s work will be completed in a few months: for <a href=/people/3151 target=_blank>Caesius</a>, who was with me at the time, keeps a very sharp lookout upon him. Thence I started straight along the via Vitularia to your Fufidianum, the estate which we bought for you a few weeks ago at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a> for 100,000 sesterces. I never saw a shadier spot in summer-water springs in many parts of it, and abundant into the bargain. In short, <a href=/people/3151 target=_blank>Caesius</a> thought that you would easily irrigate fifty jugera of the meadow land. For my part, I can assure you of this, which is more in my line, that you will have a villa marvellously pleasant, with the addition of a fish-pond, spouting fountains, a palaestra, and a shrubbery. I am told that you wish to keep this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418126UBov class=place long=12.61797 lat=41.76373>Bovillae</a> estate. You will determine as you think good. <a href=/people/1937 target=_blank>Calvus</a> said that, even if the control of the water were taken from you, and the right of drawing it off were established by the vendor, and thus an easement were imposed on that property, we could yet maintain the price in case we wished to sell. He said that he had agreed with you to do the work at three sesterces a foot, and that he had stepped it, and made it three miles. It seemed to me more. But I will guarantee that the money could nowhere be better laid out. I had sent for Cillo from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415140UVen class=place long=14.0461 lat=41.4845>Venafrum</a>, but on that very day four of his fellow servants and apprentices had been crushed by the falling in of a tunnel at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415140UVen class=place long=14.0461 lat=41.4845>Venafrum</a>. On the 13th of September I was at <a href=/people/5076 target=_blank>Laterium</a>. I examined the road, which appeared to me to be so good as to seem almost like a high road, except a hundred and fifty paces — for I measured it myself from the little bridge at the temple of Furina, in the direction of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415128USat class=place long=12.755 lat=41.513>Satricum</a>. There they had put down dust, not gravel (this shall be changed), and that part of the road is a very steep incline. But I understood that it could not be taken in any other direction, particularly as you did not wish it to go through the property of Locusta or <a href=/people/79 target=_blank>Varro</a>. The latter alone had made the road very well where it skirted his own property. Locusta hadn't touched it but I will call on him at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and think I shall be able to stir him up, and at the same time I shall ask M. <a href=/people/10933 target=_blank>Taurus</a>, who is now at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and whom I am told promised to allow you to do so, about making a watercourse through his property. I much approved of your steward Nicephorius, and I asked him what orders you had given about that small building at <a href=/people/5076 target=_blank>Laterium</a>, about which you spoke to me. He told me in answer that he had himself contracted to do the work for sixteen sestertia, but that you had afterwards made many additions to the work, but nothing to the price, and that he had therefore given it up. I quite approve, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, of your making the additions you had determined upon; although the villa as it stands seems to have the air of a philosopher, meant to rebuke the extravagance of other villas. Yet, after all, that addition will be pleasing. I praised your landscape gardener: he has so covered everything with ivy, both the foundation-wall of the villa and the spaces between the columns of the walk, that, upon my word, those Greek statues seemed to be engaged in fancy gardening, and to be showing off the ivy. Finally, nothing can be cooler or more mossy than the dressing-room of the bath. That is about all I have to say about country matters. The gardener, indeed, as well as <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> and <a href=/people/1775 target=_blank>Cincius</a> are pressing on the ornamentation of your town house; but I also often look in upon it myself, as I can do without difficulty. Wherefore don't be at all anxious about that. As to your always asking me about your son, of course I excuse you; but I must ask you to excuse me also, for I don't allow that you love him more than I do. And oh that he had been with me these last few days at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a>, as he had himself set his heart on being, and as I had no less done! As to <a href=/people/3074 target=_blank>Pomponia</a>, please write and say that, when I go out of town anywhere, she is to come with me and bring the boy. I'll do wonders with him, if I get him to myself when I am at leisure: for at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> there is no time to breathe. You know I formerly promised to do so for nothing. What do you expect with such a reward as you promise me? I now come to your letters which I received in several packets when I was at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a>. For I received three from you in one day, and, indeed, as it seemed, despatched by you at the same time — one of considerable length, in which your first point was that my letter to you was dated earlier than that to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a> at times cannot help this: the reason is that, having settled to send letter-carriers, and having received a letter from me, he is hindered by something turning up, and obliged to despatch them later than he had intended; and I don't take the trouble to have the day altered on a letter which I have once handed to him. You write about <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s extreme affection for us. This affection you must on your part keep warm, and I for mine will endeavour to increase it by every means in my power. About <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, I am carefully acting, and shall continue to act, as you advise. That my permission to you to stay longer is a welcome one, though I grieve at your absence and miss you exceedingly, I am yet partly glad. What you can be thinking of in sending for such people as <a href=/people/1782 target=_blank>Hippodamus</a> and some others, I do not understand. There is not one of those suburban estate. However, there is no reason for your fellows that won't expect a present from you equal to a classing my friend <a href=/people/1407 target=_blank>Trebatius</a> with them. I sent him to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> has done all I expected. If he has not done quite what he expected himself, I am not bound to make it up to him, and I in like manner free and absolve you from all claims on his part. Your remark, that you are a greater favourite with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> every day, is a source of undying satisfaction to me. As to <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>, who, as you say, promotes that state of things, he is the apple of my eye. I am indeed glad that you and my friend <a href=/people/951 target=_blank>Trebonius</a> like each other. As to what you say about the military tribuneship, I, indeed, asked for it definitely for <a href=/people/1555 target=_blank>Curtius</a>, and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> wrote back definitely to say that there was one at <a href=/people/1555 target=_blank>Curtius</a>'s service, and chided me for my modesty in making the request. If I have asked one for anyone else — as I told <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a> to write and tell <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> — I shall not be at all annoyed by a refusal, since those who pester me for letters are annoyed at a refusal from me. I like <a href=/people/1555 target=_blank>Curtius</a>, as I have told him, not only because you asked me to do so, but from the character you gave of him; for from your letter I have gathered the zeal he showed for my restoration. As for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=demonym long=-1.5 lat=53>British</a> expedition, I conclude from your letter that we have no occasion either for fear or exultation. As to public affairs, about which you wish Tiro to write to you, I have written to you hitherto somewhat more carelessly than usual, because I knew that all events, small or great, were reported to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. I have now answered your longest letter. Now hear what I have to say to your small one. The first point is about <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>'s letter to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. In that matter I approve of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s policy, in not having given way to your request so far as to write a single word to that Fury. The next thing is about the speech of Calventius <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>. I am surprised at your saying that you think I ought to answer it, particularly as, while no one is likely to read that speech, unless I write an answer to it, every schoolboy learns mine against him as an exercise. My books, all of which you are expecting, I have begun, but I cannot finish them for some days yet. The speeches for <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> and <a href=/people/3070 target=_blank>Plancius</a> which you clamour for I have finished. The poem to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, which I had begun, I have cut short. I will write what you ask me for, since your poetic springs are running dry, as soon as I have time. Now for the third letter. It is very pleasant and welcome news to hear from you that <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> is soon coming to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and so well accompanied! and will stay with me continuously till the 15th of May. As to your exhorting me in the same letter, as in many previous ones, to ambition and labour, I shall, of course, do as you say: but when am I to enjoy any real life? Your fourth letter reached me on the 13th of September, dated on the 10th of August from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>. In it there was nothing new except about your <a href=/people/1213 target=_blank>Erigona</a>, and if I get that from <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a> I will write and tell you what I think of it. I have no doubt I shall like it. Oh yes I had almost forgotten to remark as to the man who, you say in your letter, had written to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> about the applause given to <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> — I am not unwilling that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> should think that it was as warm as possible. And in point of fact it was so, and yet that applause, which is given to him, seems in a certain sense to be given to me. I have also received a very old letter, but which was late in coming into my hands, in which you remind me about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125STel class=place long=12.4899 lat=41.892>temple</a> of <a href=/people/12080 target=_blank>Tellus</a> and the colonnade of <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>. Both of these matters are being actively carried out. At the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125STel class=place long=12.4899 lat=41.892>temple</a> of <a href=/people/12080 target=_blank>Tellus</a> I have even got your statue placed. So, again, as to your reminder about a suburban villa and gardens, I was never very keen for one, and now my town house has all the charm of such a pleasure-ground. On my arrival in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the 18th of September I found the roof on your house finished: the part over the sitting-rooms, which you did not wish to have many gables, now slopes gracefully towards the roof of the lower colonnade. Our boy, in my absence, did not cease working with his rhetoric master. You have no reason for being anxious about his education, for you know his ability, and I see his application. Everything else I take it upon myself to guarantee, with full consciousness that I am bound to make it good. As yet there are three parties prosecuting <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>: first, L. <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, son of the flamen, who has entered a prosecution for lese majeste; secondly, Tiberius <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, with good names at the back of his indictment; thirdly, C. <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a> the tribune in conjunction with L. <a href=/people/903 target=_blank>Capito</a>. He came to the walls of the city on the 19th of September, undignified and neglected to the last degree. But in the present state of the law courts I do not venture to be confident of anything. As <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> is unwell, he has not yet been formally indicted for extortion. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> is trying hard to persuade me to be reconciled to him, but as yet he has not succeeded at all, nor, if I retain a shred of liberty, will he succeed. I am very anxious for a letter from you. You say that you have been told that I was a party to the Coalition of the consular candidates — it is a lie. The compacts made in that coalition, afterwards made public by <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, were of such a nature that no loyal man ought to have been a party to them; nor at the same time was it possible for me to be a party to a coalition from which <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> was excluded, who is thoroughly satisfied with my conduct in every particular, as also, I think, is <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>. To <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> himself I have rendered many services, which he desired and asked of me. I have put <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> under a heavy obligation by my defence of him. It is as yet very uncertain both when the elections will be and who will be consuls. Just as I was folding up this epistle letter-carriers arrived from you and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> (20th September) after a journey of twenty days. How anxious I was! How painfully I was affected by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s most kind letter! But the kinder it was, the more sorrow did his loss occasion me. But to turn to your letter. To begin with, I reiterate my approval of your staying on, especially as, according to your account, you have consulted <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> on the subject. I wonder that <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a> has anything to do with Publius, for I advised against it. Farther on in your letter you say that I am going to be made legatus to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> on the 13th of September: I have heard nothing about it, and I wrote to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> to tell him that neither <a href=/people/2268 target=_blank>Vibullius</a> nor <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a> had delivered his message to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> about my remaining at home. Why, I know not. However, it was I who restrained <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a> from doing so, because it was <a href=/people/2268 target=_blank>Vibullius</a> who should take the leading part in that matter: for with him <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had communicated personally, with <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a> only by letter. I indeed can have no second thoughts in matters connected with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. He comes next after you and our children in my regard, and not much after. I think I act in this with deliberate judgment, for I have by this time good cause for it, yet warm personal feeling no doubt does influence me also. Just as I had written these last words — which are by my own hand — your boy came in to dine with me, as <a href=/people/3074 target=_blank>Pomponia</a> was dining out. He gave me your letter to read, which he had received shortly before — a truly Aristophanic mixture of jest and earnest, with which I was greatly charmed. He gave me also your second letter, in which you bid him cling to my side as a mentor. How delighted he was with those letters! And so was I. Nothing could be more attractive than that boy, nothing more affectionate to me! — This, to explain its being in another handwriting, I dictated to Tiro while at dinner. Your letter gratified Annalis very much, as showing that you took an active interest in his concerns, and yet assisted him with exceedingly candid advice. Publius <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a> the elder, from a letter which he said he had received from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, declares himself highly obliged to you for having spoken with the greatest kindness and earnestness of his devotion to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. </p>                        </div>

III, 2) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN GAUL) ROME, OCTOBER: In the evening of the 10th of October <a href=/people/1677 target=_blank>Salvius</a> started on board ship for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Ostia</a> with the things you wished sent to you from home. On that same day <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a> gave <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> such a splendid warming in public meeting that <a href=/people/2392 target=_blank>Calidius</a> couldn't say a word for him. Tomorrow (which is strictly the day after tomorrow, for I am writing before daybreak) there is a trial before <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> for the selection of his prosecutor between <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, and Gaius and Lucius, sons of M. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>. I think the result will be in favour of <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, though a strong case is being made out for <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>. In short, he is in a fairly tight fix, unless our friend <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, to the disgust of gods and men, upsets the whole concern. Let me give you a specimen of the fellow's impudence, and extract something amusing from the public disasters. <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> having given out wherever he came that he was demanding a triumph, and having suddenly, the excellent general! invaded the city of his enemies by night, did not venture to enter the senate. Meanwhile, exactly on the tenth day, on which he was bound to report the number of the enemy and of his own soldiers who had been killed, he slunk into the house, which was very thinly attended. When he made as if to go out, he was stopped by the consuls. The publicani were introduced. The fellow was assailed on every side, and my words stinging him more than all, he lost patience, and in a voice quivering with anger called me Exile. Thereupon — Heavens I never had such a compliment paid me in all my life — the senate rose up to a man with a loud shout and made a menacing movement in his direction: the publicani made an equal noise and a similar movement. In fine, they all behaved exactly as you would have done. It is the leading topic of conversation out of the house. However, I refrain from prosecuting, with difficulty, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>! yet refrain I do: either because I don't want to quarrel with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> — the impending question of <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> is enough in that direction — or because we have no jurors worthy of the name. I fear a fiasco: besides, there is the ill-will of certain persons to me, and I am afraid my conducting the prosecution might give him some advantage: besides, I do not despair of the thing being done both without me and yet partly through my assistance. All the candidates for the consulships have had prosecutions for bribery lodged against them: <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> <a href=/people/1989 target=_blank>Calvinus</a> by <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a> (the tribune), <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a> (the candidate) by Q. Acutius, an excellent young man and a good lawyer, <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> by Q. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> by <a href=/people/1340 target=_blank>Triarius</a>. The affair causes great commotion, because it is a plain alternative between shipwreck for the men concerned or for the laws. Pressure is being applied to prevent the trials taking place. It looks like an interregnum again. The consuls desire to hold the comitia: the accused don't wish it, and especially <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, because he hopes that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s approach may secure him the consulship. But he is at a very low ebb. <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, with <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> as his colleague, I think is a certainty. <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> has lost his chance. <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> declares that he will relieve <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> even without a curiate law, and, indeed, he distinguished himself amazingly that day (I almost forgot to mention it) in an attack upon <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>. He accused him of lese majeste, and gave the names of his witnesses without <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> answering a word. That is all the public news. At home all is well: your house itself is being proceeded with by the contractors with fair expedition. </p>                        </div>

So stands my business: matters at home, however, are everything I could wish. Our boys are well, diligent in their studies, and affectionate to me and each other. The decoration of both of our houses is still in hand: but your rural works at Arcanum and <a href=/people/5076 target=_blank>Laterium</a> are now completed. For the rest, as to the water and the road, I went into the case thoroughly, in a certain letter of mine, without Omitting anything. But, in truth, the anxiety which is now giving me great uneasiness and pain is that for a period of fifty days I have heard nothing from you or from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> — nothing has found its way from those parts, either in the shape of a letter, or even of a rumour. Moreover, both the sea and land out there make me uneasy, and I never cease imagining, as one does when one's affections are deeply involved, all that I least desire. Wherefore I do not, indeed, for the present ask you to write me an account of yourself and your doings, for that you never omit doing when possible, but I wish you to know this — that I have scarcely ever been so anxious for anything as at the moment of writing I am for a letter from you. Now for what is going on in politics. One day after another for the comitia is struck out by notices of bad omens, to the great satisfaction of all the loyalists: so great is the scandal in which the consuls are involved, owing to the suspicion of their having bargained for a bribe from the candidates. The four candidates for the consulship are all arraigned: their cases are difficult of defence, but I shall do my best to secure the safety of our friend <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> — and that is inseparable from the acquittal of the others. Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> has accused <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> of bribery — his stepson <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a> his cousin <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>, and his son <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> backing the indictment. L. <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a> put in his claim to the conduct of the prosecution, and, to everybody's satisfaction, failed to establish it. You ask, What will become of <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>? We shall know in three days' time about the charge of lese majeste. In that case he is at a disadvantage from the hatred entertained by all classes for him; witnesses against him as damaging as can be: accusers in the highest degree inefficient: the panel of jurors of varied character: the president a man of weight and decision — Alfius: <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> active in soliciting the jurors on his behalf. What the result will be I don't know; I don't see, however, how he can maintain a position in the state. I show no rancour in promoting his destruction, and await the result with the utmost good temper. That is nearly all the news. I will add this one item: your boy (who is mine also) is exceedingly devoted to his rhetoric master <a href=/people/4638 target=_blank>Paeonius</a>, a man, I think, of great experience in his profession, and of very good character. But you are aware that my method of instruction aims at a somewhat more scholarly and philosophical style. Accordingly I, for my part, am unwilling that his course of training should be interrupted, and the boy himself seems to be more drawn to that declamatory style, and to like it better; and as that was the style in which I was myself initiated, let us allow him to follow in my path, for I feel sure it will eventually bring him to the same point; nevertheless, if I take him with me somewhere in the country, I shall guide him to the adoption of my system and practice. For you have held out before me a great reward, which it certainly shall not be my fault if I fail to fully obtain. I hope you will write and tell me most carefully in what district you are going to pass the winter, and what your prospects are. </p>                        </div>

III, 4) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN GAUL) ROME, 24 OCTOBER: <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> has been acquitted. Nothing could be more absolutely futile than his accuser, <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, and the backers of the indictment, or more corrupt than the jury. Yet, after all, had it not been for incredible exertions and entreaties on <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s part, and even an alarming rumour of a dictatorship, he would not have been able to answer even <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>; for even as it was, with such an accuser and such a jury, he had thirty-two votes out of seventy recorded against him. This trial is altogether so scandalous, that he seems certain to be convicted in the other suits, especially in that for extortion. But you must see that the Republic, the senate, the law courts are mere ciphers, and that not one of us has any constitutional position at all. What else should I tell you about the jurors? Two men of praetorian rank were on the panel — <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> <a href=/people/1989 target=_blank>Calvinus</a>, who voted for acquittal so openly that everybody could see; and <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, who, as soon as the voting tablets had been counted, withdrew from the ring of people, and was the first to tell <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> the news. Some people — for instance, <a href=/people/926 target=_blank>Sallust</a> — say that I ought to have been the prosecuting counsel. Was I to have exposed myself to such a jury as this? What would have been my position, if he had escaped when I conducted the case? But there were other considerations which influenced me. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> would have looked upon it as a contest with me, not for that man's safety, but for his own position: he would have entered the city; it would have become a downright quarrel; I should have seemed like a Pacideianus matched with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413148RSam class=person long=14.8 lat=41.3>Samnite</a> <a href=/people/5409 target=_blank>Aeserninus</a> — he would, perhaps, have bitten off my ear, and at least he would have become reconciled to <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>. For my part, especially if you do not disapprove of it, I strongly approve my own policy. That great man, though his advancement had been promoted by unparalleled exertions on my part, and though I owed him nothing, while he owed me all, yet could not endure that I should differ from him in politics — to put it mildly — and, when in a less powerful position, showed me what he could do against me when in my zenith. At this time of day, when I don't even care to be influential, and the Republic certainly has no power to do anything, while he is supreme in everything, was I to enter upon a contest with him? For that is what I should have had to have done. I do not think that you hold me bound to have undertaken it. Then, as an alternative, says the grave <a href=/people/926 target=_blank>Sallust</a>, you should have defended him, and have made that concession to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s earnest wish, for he begged you very hard to do so. An ingenious friend is <a href=/people/926 target=_blank>Sallust</a>, to give me the alternative of a dangerous quarrel or undying infamy! I, however, am quite pleased with the middle course which I have steered; and another gratifying circumstance is that, when I had given my evidence with the utmost solemnity, in accordance with my honour and oath, the defendant said that, if he retained his right to remain in the city, he would repay me, and did not attempt to cross-question me. As to the verses which you wish me to compose, it is true that I am deficient in industry in regard to them, which requires not only time, but also a mind free from all anxiety, but I am also wanting in inspiration. For I am not altogether without anxiety as to the coming year, though without fear. At the same time, and, upon my word, I speak without irony, I consider you a greater master of that style of writing than myself. As to filling up your Greek library, effecting interchanges of books, and purchasing <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> books, I should be very glad that your wishes should be carried out, especially as they would be very useful to me. But I have no one to employ for myself in such a business: for such books as are really worth getting are not for sale, and purchases cannot be effected except by an agent who is both well-informed and active. However, I will give orders to <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> and speak to <a href=/people/2357 target=_blank>Tyrannio</a>. I will inquire what <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> has done about the treasury. I will see that what seems to be the right thing is done. As to Ascanio, do what you like: I shall not interfere. As to a suburban property, I commend your not being in a hurry, but I advise your having one. I write this on the 24th of October, the day of the opening of the games, on the point of starting for my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> villa, and taking my dear young <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> with me as though to school (a school not for sport, but for learning), since I did not wish to be at any greater distance from town, because I purposed supporting <a href=/people/2185 target=_blank>Pomptinus</a>'s claim of a triumph on the 3rd of November. For there will be, in fact, some little difficulty; as the praetors, <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> and <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a>, threaten to forbid it, though I don't know what they can do. For he will have on his side <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> the consul, some praetors and tribunes. Still, they do threaten — and among the foremost Q. <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a>, breathing war. Most delightful and dearest of brothers, take good care of your health. </p>                        </div>

III, 5) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN GAUL) TUSCULUM (OCTOBER) You ask me what I have done about the books which I begun to write when in my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=demonym long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cuman</a> villa: I have not been idle and am not being idle now; but I have frequently changed the whole plan and arrangement of the work. I had already completed two books, in which I represented a conversation taking place on the Novendialia held in the consulship of <a href=/people/11038 target=_blank>Tuditanus</a> and <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquilius</a>, between <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a>, shortly before his death, and <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a>, <a href=/people/3662 target=_blank>Philus</a>, <a href=/people/1949 target=_blank>Manilius</a>, P. <a href=/people/1250 target=_blank>Rutilius</a>, Q. <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a>, and <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a>'s sons-in-law, <a href=/people/1133 target=_blank>Fannius</a> and <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a>; a conversation which was extended to nine days and the same number of books On the best Constitution of the State and On the best Citizen. The work was excellently composed, and the rank of the speakers added considerable weight to the style. But when these books were read to me in the presence of <a href=/people/248 target=_blank>Sallustius</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>, it was suggested to me by him that a discourse on such subjects would come with much greater force if I were myself the speaker on the Republic, especially as I was a no mere <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=demonym long=33.5 lat=43.5>Ponticus</a>, but an ex-consul, and one who had been engaged in the most important affairs in the state: that when I put them in the mouth of men of such ancient date they would have an air of unreality: that I had shown good taste in my books about the science of rhetoric in keeping the dialogue of the orators apart from myself, and yet had attributed it to men whom I had personally seen: and, finally, that <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> delivers in the first person his essays On the Republic and On the Eminent Man. I was influenced the more by this from the fact that I was unable to touch on the most important commotions in our state, because they were subsequent to the age of the speakers. Moreover, my express object then was not to offend anyone by launching into the events of my own time: as it is, I shall avoid that and at the same time be the speaker with you. Nevertheless, when I come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> I will send you the dialogues as they originally stood. For I fancy that those books will convince you that they have not been abandoned by me without some chagrin. I am extremely gratified by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s affection of which you write to me. The offers which he holds out I do not much reckon on, nor have I any thirst for honours or longing for glory; and I look forward more to the continuation of his kindness than to the fulfillment of his promises. Still, I live a life so prominent and laborious that I might seem to be expecting the very thing that I deprecate. As to your request that I should compose some verses, you could hardly believe, my dear brother, how short of time I am: nor do I feel much moved in spirit to write poetry on the subject you mention. Do you really come to me for disquisitions on things that I can scarcely conceive even in imagination — you who have distanced everybody in that style of vivid and descriptive writing? Yet I would have done it if I could, but, as you will assuredly not fail to notice, for writing poetry there is need of a certain freshness of mind of which my occupations entirely deprive me. I withdraw myself, it is true, from all political anxiety and devote myself to literature; still, I will hint to you what, by heaven, I specially wished to have concealed from you. It cuts me to the heart, my dearest brother, to the heart, to think that there is no Republic, no law courts, and that my present time of life, which ought to have been in the full bloom of senatorial dignity, is distracted with the labours of the forum or eked out by private studies, and that the object on which from boyhood I had set my heart, Far to excel, and tower above the crowd, is entirely gone: that my opponents have in some cases been left unattacked by me, in others even defended: that not only my sympathies, but my very dislikes, are not free: and that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> is the one man in the world who has been found to love me to my heart's Content, or even, as others think, the only one who was inclined to do so. However, there is none of all these vexations of such a kind as to be beyond the reach of many daily consolations; but the greatest of consolations will be our being together. As it is, to those other sources of vexation there is added my very deep regret for your absence. If I had defended <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>, which <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a> thought I ought to have done, I should have been quite ruined: those who hate him — and that is entire orders — would have begun to hate me for the sake of their hatred for him. I confined myself, as I think with great dignity, to doing only that which all the world saw me do. And to sum up the whole case, I am, as you advise, devoting all my efforts to tranquillity and peace. As to the books: <a href=/people/2357 target=_blank>Tyrannio</a> is a slow-coach: I will speak to <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a>, but it is a laborious business and requires a man of the utmost industry. I find it in my own case, for, though I am as diligent as possible, I get nothing done. As to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> books, I don't know which way to turn — they are copied and exposed for sale with such a quantity of errors! However, whatever can possibly be done I will not neglect to do. Gaius <a href=/people/3242 target=_blank>Rebilus</a>, as I wrote to you before, is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. He solemnly affirms his great obligations to you, and reports well of your health. I think the question of the treasury was settled in my absence. When you speak of having finished four tragedies in sixteen days, I presume you are borrowing from some one else? And do you deign to be indebted to others after writing the <a href=/people/388 target=_blank>Electra</a> and the Troades? Don't be idle; and don't think the proverbial γνῶθι σεαυτόν was only meant to discourage vanity: it means also that we should be aware of our own qualities. But pray send me these tragedies as well as the <a href=/people/1213 target=_blank>Erigona</a>. I have now answered your last two letters. </p>                        </div>

III, 8) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN GAUL) ROME (NOVEMBER) The earlier of your two letters is full of irritability and complainings, and you say you gave another of the same sort the day before to <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a>, who has not yet arrived — but I have nothing to say in answer to it, for your more recent letter has obliterated all trace of vexation from my mind. I will only give you this hint and make this request, that in the midst of your vexations and labours you should recall what our notion was as to your going to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. For our object was not the acquisition of certain small and unimportant gains. For what was there of that kind which we should have thought worth the price of our separation? What we sought was the strongest possible security for the maintenance of our entire political position by the countenance of a man of the highest character and most commanding influence. Our interest is not so much in the acquisition of sums of money, as in the realization of this hope: all else that you get is to be regarded only as a security against actual loss. Wherefore, if you will frequently turn your thoughts back upon what we originally proposed to ourselves and hoped to do, you will bear with less impatience the labours of military service of which you speak and the other things which annoy you, and, nevertheless, will resign them whenever you choose. But the right moment for that step is not yet come, though it is now not far off. Furthermore, I give you this hint — don't commit anything at all to writing, the publication of which would be annoying to us. There are many things that I would rather not know than learn at some risk. I shall write at greater length to you with a mind less preoccupied, when my boy <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> is, as I hope he will be, in a good state of health. Pray be careful to let me know to whom I should give the letter which I shall then send you — to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s letter-carriers, for him to forward them direct to you, or to those of <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a>? For where your <a about=https://topostext.org/place/503038UBag class=ethnic long=3.7917 lat=50.299>Nervii</a> dwell, and how far off, I have no idea. I derived great pleasure from your letter describing the courage and dignity displayed (as you say) by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> in his extreme sorrow. You bid me finish the poem in his honour which I had begun; and although I have been diverted from it by business, and still more by my feelings, yet, since <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> knows that I did begin something, I will return to my design, and will complete in these leisure days of the supplications, during which I greatly rejoice that our friend <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> and the rest are at last relieved from worry. In reckoning on him as certain to be consul with <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, you are quite in agreement with my own opinion. I will guarantee <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>: but <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a> Cherishes a hope, founded on <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, in which I think he is under a mistake. He is, indeed, quite out of it here. <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a>, again, has been long ago thrown over by <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. The business has been put off: the comitia postponed and postponed, till we may expect an interregnum. The rumour of a dictator is not pleasing to the aristocrats; for myself, I like still less what they say. But the proposal, as a whole, is looked upon with alarm, and grows unpopular. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> says outright that he doesn't wish it: to me previously he used not personally to deny the wish. <a href=/people/2236 target=_blank>Hirrus</a> seems likely to be the proposer. Ye gods! what folly! How in love with himself and without — a rival! He has Commissioned me to choke off <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a> <a href=/people/10485 target=_blank>Vinicianus</a>, a man much attached to me. Whether <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> wishes it or not, it is difficult to be sure. However, if it is <a href=/people/2236 target=_blank>Hirrus</a> who makes the proposal, he will not convince people that he does not wish it. There is nothing else being talked about in politics just now; at any rate, nothing else is being done. The funeral of the son of <a href=/people/1640 target=_blank>Serranus</a> Domesticus took place in very melancholy circumstances on the 23rd of November. His father delivered the funeral Oration which I composed for him. Now about <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> gives him no support, and is all for Gutta, saying also that he will secure <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> on his side. <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> is alarmed at this, and no wonder, and almost gives up hope if <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> is created dictator. If he assists anyone who vetoes the dictatorship by his troop and bodyguard, he fears he may excite <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s enmity: if he doesn't do so, he fears the proposal may be carried by force. He is preparing games on a most magnificent scale, at a cost, I assure you, that no one has ever exceeded. It is foolish, on two or even three accounts, to give games that were not demanded — he has already given a magnificent show of gladiators: he cannot afford it: he is only an executor, and might have reflected that he is now an executor, not an aedile.

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi058:Q.fr.3.9'><b>&sect; Q.fr.3.9</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;CLIX (Q.fr. III, 9) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN GAUL) ROME (NOVEMBER OR DECEMBER) In regard to <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>, I had not to carry out any of the measures which you suggested with such affectionate solicitude. May the earth swallow me rather, etc.! I acted with very great dignity and also with the greatest consideration. I neither bore hardly on him nor helped him. I gave strong evidence, in other respects I did not stir. The disgraceful and mischievous result of the trial I bore with the utmost serenity. And this is the advantage which, after all that has happened, has accrued to me — that I am not even affected in the least by those evils in the state and the licentious conduct of the shameless, which used formerly to make me burst with indignation: for anything more abandoned than the men and the times in which we are living there cannot be. Accordingly, as no pleasure can possibly be got from politics, I don't know why I should lose my temper. Literature and my favourite studies, along with the retirement of my country houses, and above all our two boys, furnish my enjoyments. The one man who vexes me is <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>. But I hope an end will be put to my anxieties by his getting the consulship: and to obtain this for him I shall struggle as hard as I did for my own, and you, I am sure, will continue to give assistance from over there. In his case other things are all secure, unless it is snatched from his grasp by downright violence: it is about his means that I am frightened: For he is now beyond all bearing mad, to spend 1,000,000 sesterce on his games. His want of prudence in this one particular I shall put up with as well as I can, and you should be strong-minded enough to do the same. In mentioning the changes to be expected next year, I didn't mean you to understand me to refer to domestic alarms: the reference was wholly to the state of the Republic, in which, though not charged with any actual duty, I can scarcely discharge myself from all anxiety. Yet how cautious I would have you be in writing you may guess from the fact that I do not mention in my letters to you even open acts of disorder in the state, lest my letter should be intercepted and give offence to the feelings of anyone. Wherefore, as far as domestic affairs are concerned, I would have you be quite easy: in politics I know how anxious you always are. I can see that our friend <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> will be consul, if by means of an interrex, without any prosecution, if by that of a dictator, without danger of conviction. He is not disliked by anyone. <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>'s warm support will stand him in good stead. <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>'s acquittal is looked upon as a general act of indemnity. En passant: nothing has, after all, been done as yet about a dictatorship. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> is out of town; <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> is intriguing darkly; <a href=/people/2236 target=_blank>Hirrus</a> is paving the way: there are many tribunes calculated on to veto it: the people are indifferent: the leading men disinclined to it: I don't stir a finger. I am exceedingly obliged for your promises as to slaves, and I am indeed, as you say, shorthanded both at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and on my estates. But pray do nothing for my convenience unless it entirely suits your own, and your means. About the letter of <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a> I laughed heartily. But though I know I am being watched by him, I can swallow his hatred and digest it too. You urge me to finish: well, I have finished what, in my own opinion at least, is a very pretty epic on <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, but I am in search of a trustworthy letter-carrier, lest it should share the fate of your <a href=/people/1213 target=_blank>Erigona</a> — the only personage who has missed a safe journey from Gaul during <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s governorship. What? because I had no good stone was I to pull down the whole building? — a building which I like better every day of my life: the lower court especially and the chambers attached to it are admirable. As to Arcanum, it is a building worthy of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, or, by heaven, of some one even more tasteful still. For your statues, palaestra, fish-pond, and conduit are worthy of many Philotimuses, and quite above your Diphiluses. But I will visit them personally, as well as sending men to look after them and giving orders about them. As to the will of <a href=/people/652 target=_blank>Felix</a>, you will complain more when you know all. For the document which he believed himself to have sealed, in which your name was most certainly entered as heir to a twelfth, this, by a mistake of his own and of his slave Sicura, he did not seal: while the one which he did not intend to seal he did seal. But let it go hang, so long as we keep well! I am as devoted to your son <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> as you can wish, and as he deserves, and as I am bound to be. However, I am letting him leave me, both to avoid keeping him from his teachers, and because his mother is leaving, without whom I am very much alarmed as to the boy's large appetite. Yet, after all, we see a great deal of each other. I have now answered all your letters. Dearest and best of brothers, good-bye. </p>                        </div>
