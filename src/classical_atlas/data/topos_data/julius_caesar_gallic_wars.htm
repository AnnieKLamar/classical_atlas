All these are different one from another in language, institutions, and laws. The Galli (Gauls) are separated from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450010RAqu class=ethnic long=1 lat=45>Aquitani</a> by the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/449-05WGar class=place long=-0.5381 lat=44.898>Garonne</a>, from the <a href=/people/12016 target=_blank>Belgae</a> by the Marne and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/494005WSeq class=place long=0.4631 lat=49.4717>Seine</a>. Of all these peoples the <a href=/people/12016 target=_blank>Belgae</a> are the most courageous, because they are farthest removed from the culture and civilization of the Province, and least often visited by merchants introducing the commodities that make for effeminacy; and also because they are nearest to the Germans dwelling beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>, with whom they are continually at war. For this cause the <a href=/people/12015 target=_blank>Helvetii</a> also excel the rest of the Gauls in valour, because they are struggling in almost daily fights with the Germans, either endeavouring to keep them out of Gallic territory or waging an aggressive warfare in German territory. The separate part of the country which, as has been said, is occupied by the Gauls, starts from the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437046WRho class=place long=4.5989 lat=43.6544>Rhone</a>, and is bounded by the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/449-05WGar class=place long=-0.5381 lat=44.898>Garonne</a>, the Ocean, and the territory of the <a href=/people/12016 target=_blank>Belgae</a>; moreover, on the side of the <a href=/people/12012 target=_blank>Sequani</a> and the <a href=/people/12015 target=_blank>Helvetii</a>, it touches on the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>; and its general trend is northward. The <a href=/people/12016 target=_blank>Belgae</a>, beginning from the edge of the Gallic territory, reach to the lower part of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>, bearing towards the north and east. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450010RAqu class=place long=1 lat=45>Aquitania</a>, starting from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/449-05WGar class=place long=-0.5381 lat=44.898>Garonne</a>, reaches to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426007LPyr class=place long=0.658 lat=42.632>Pyrenees</a> and to that part of the Ocean which is by Spain: its bearing is between west and north.</p>                        </div>

In the consulship of Marcus <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> and Marcus <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, his desire for the kingship led him to form a conspiracy of the nobility, and he persuaded the community to march out of their territory in full force, urging that as they excelled all in valour it was easy enough to secure the sovereignty of all Gaul. In this he persuaded them the more easily, because the <a href=/people/12015 target=_blank>Helvetii</a> are closely confined by the nature of their territory. On one side there is the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>, exceeding broad and deep, which separates the <a href=/people/12015 target=_blank>Helvetian</a> territory from the Germans; on another the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/463059LJur class=place long=5.939 lat=46.2708>Jura</a> range, exceeding high, lying between <a href=/people/12012 target=_blank>Sequani</a> and the <a href=/people/12015 target=_blank>Helvetii</a>; on the third, the Lake of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/462061UGen class=place long=6.1485 lat=46.2011>Geneva</a> and the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437046WRho class=place long=4.5989 lat=43.6544>Rhone</a>, which separates the Roman Province from the <a href=/people/12015 target=_blank>Helvetii</a>. In such circumstances their range of movement was less extensive, and their chances of waging war on their neighbours were less easy; and on this account they were greatly distressed, for they were men that longed for war. Nay, they could not but consider that the territory they occupied — to an extent of 240 miles long and 180 broad — was all too narrow for their population and for their renown of courage in war.</p>                        </div>

For the accomplishment of these objects they considered that two years were sufficient, and pledged themselves by an ordinance to take the field in the third year. For the accomplishment of these objectives <a href=/people/12156 target=_blank>Orgetorix</a> was chosen, and he took upon himself an embassage to the communities. In the course of his travels he persuaded Casticus, of the <a href=/people/12012 target=_blank>Sequani</a>, son of Catamantaloedes, who had held for many years the kingship of the <a href=/people/12012 target=_blank>Sequani</a>, and had been called by the Senate the friend of the Roman people, to seize in his own state the kingship which his father had held before him; and <a href=/people/12010 target=_blank>Dumnorix</a> also, of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469043UAug class=ethnic long=4.299 lat=46.945>Aedui</a>, brother of <a href=/people/12149 target=_blank>Diviciacus</a>, at that time holding the chieftaincy of the state and a great favourite with the common people, he persuaded to a like endeavour, and gave him his own daughter in marriage. He convinced them that it was easy enough to accomplish such endeavours, because he himself (so he said) was about to secure the sovereignty of his own state. There was no doubt, he observed, that the <a href=/people/12015 target=_blank>Helvetii</a> were the most powerful tribe in all Gaul, and he gave a pledge that he would win them their kingdoms with his own resources and his own army. Swayed by this speech, they gave a mutual pledge, confirming it by oath; and they hoped that when they had seized their kingship they would be able, through the efforts of three most powerful and most steadfast tribes, to master the whole of Gaul.</p>                        </div>

The state, being incensed at this, essayed to secure its due rights by force of arms, and the magistrates were bridging together a number of men from the country parts, when <a href=/people/12156 target=_blank>Orgetorix</a> died, not without suspicion, as the <a href=/people/12015 target=_blank>Helvetii</a> think, of suicide.</p>                        </div>

Their insolent boast of their own victory, their surprise that their outrages had gone on so long with impunity, pointed the same way; for it was the wont of the immortal gods to grant a temporary prosperity and a longer impunity to make men whom they purposed to punish for their crime smart the more severely from a change of fortune. Yet, for all this, he would make peace with the <a href=/people/12015 target=_blank>Helvetii</a>, if they would offer him hostages to show him that they would perform their promises, and if they would give satisfaction to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469043UAug class=ethnic long=4.299 lat=46.945>Aedui</a> in respect of the outrages inflicted on them and their allies, and likewise to the <a href=/people/11071 target=_blank>Allobroges</a>.

Then after a speech to encourage his troops he joined battle. The legionaries, from the upper ground, easily broke the mass-formation of the enemy by a volley of javelins, and, when it was scattered, drew their swords and charged. The Gauls were greatly encumbered for the fight because several of their shields would be pierced and fastened together by a single javelin-cast; and as the iron became bent, they could not pluck it forth, nor fight handily with the left arm encumbered. Therefore many of them preferred, after continued shaking of the arm, to cast off the shield and so to fight bare-bodied. At length, worn out with wounds, they began to retreat, retiring towards a height about a mile away. They gained the height; and as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> followed up, the <a href=/people/566 target=_blank>Boii</a> and Tulingi, who with some fifteen thousand men brought up the rear and formed the rearguard, turned from their march to attack the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> on the exposed flank, and overlapped them.

Even round the baggage the fight was continued far into the night, as the enemy had constructed a rampart of carts, and from the higher ground they continued to hurl missiles upon our advancing lines, while some of them kept discharging native pikes and darts from underneath the carts and wheels, wounding our men.

About fifteen thousand of them crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> in the first instance; then, when those fierce barbarians had got a liking for the farmlands, the civilization, and the wealth of the Gauls, more were brought over, and at the present time there are about 120,000 of them in Gaul. <br />With them the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469043UAug class=ethnic long=4.299 lat=46.945>Aedui</a> and their dependents have repeatedly fought in battle: defeat has brought great disaster, the loss of all our nobility, our senate, and our knights. It is these battles and disasters that have broken the men who by their own valour, and by the courtesy and the friendship of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, were formerly paramount in Gaul, and have obliged them to give as hostages to the <a href=/people/12012 target=_blank>Sequani</a> the noblest men of the state, and to bind the state by oath not to require the return of the hostages, not to entreat the assistance of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, nor to refuse eternal submission to the sway and sovereignty of the <a href=/people/12012 target=_blank>Sequani</a>. I am the one man of all the state of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469043UAug class=ethnic long=4.299 lat=46.945>Aedui</a> upon whom it has not been possible to prevail to take the oath or give his children as hostages.

In a few years all the natives will have been driven from the borders of Gaul, and all the Germans will have crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>; for there can be no comparison between the Gallic and the German territory, none between our usual scale of living and theirs. Having once conquered the forces of the Gauls in battle near Magetobriga, <a href=/people/7295 target=_blank>Ariovistus</a> is exercising a proud and cruel tyranny, demanding as hostages the children of the greatest nobles, and perpetrating upon them all the direst forms of torture, if anything be not performed at his nod or at his pleasure. He is a passionate, a reckless barbarian: we can endure his tyrannies no longer. Unless some means of assistance is to be found in <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and in the Roman people, all the Gauls must needs do just what the <a href=/people/12015 target=_blank>Helvetii</a> have done — emigrate, to seek another habitation, other abodes far from the Germans, and risk any fortune that may befall them.

Nor did he suppose that barbarians so fierce would stop short after seizing the whole of Gaul; but rather, like the <a href=/people/946 target=_blank>Cimbri</a> and <a href=/people/4314 target=_blank>Teutoni</a> before them, they would break forth into the Province, and push on thence into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, especially as there was but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437046WRho class=place long=4.5989 lat=43.6544>Rhone</a> to separate the <a href=/people/12012 target=_blank>Sequani</a> from the Roman Province. All this, he felt, must be faced without a moment's delay. As for <a href=/people/7295 target=_blank>Ariovistus</a> himself, he had assumed such airs, such arrogance, that he seemed insufferable.</p>                        </div>

For there was in that town an abundant supply of all things needful for war, and the place was so well fortified by Nature as to afford great facilities for the conduct of a campaign. The river Dubis (<a href=/people/5618 target=_blank>Doubs</a>), with a circuit that might have been traced by compasses, surrounds well-nigh the whole town: the remaining space of not more than sixteen hundred feet, where the river breaks off, is closed in by a height of great eminence, so placed that its foundations touch the river-bank on either side.

So great was the panic, and so suddenly did it seize upon all the army, that it affected in serious fashion the intelligence and the courage of all ranks. It began first with the tribunes, the contingent-commanders, and the others who had followed <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to court his friendship, without any great experience in warfare. Advancing various reasons which, according to their own statement, obliged them to depart, some sought his permission to leave; some were compelled by very shame to stay, to avoid the suspicion of cowardice. They were unable to disguise their looks, or even at times to restrain their tears; they hid in their tents to complain of their own fate, or to lament in company with their friends the common danger. Everywhere throughout the camp there was signing of wills. By the cowardly utterances of such as these even men who had long experience in the field, soldiers, centurions, and cavalry commanders, were gradually affected. Those of them who desired to be thought less timid would declare that they were not afraid of the enemy, but feared the narrow defiles and the vast forests which lay between themselves and <a href=/people/7295 target=_blank>Ariovistus</a>, or a possible failure of proper transport for the corn-supply. Some had even gone so far as to declare to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> that when he gave the order for camp to be shifted and standards advanced the soldiers would not obey, and by reason of cowardice would not move forward.</p>                        </div>

Then indignantly he reprimanded them, first and foremost because they thought it their business to ask or to consider in which direction or with what purpose they were being led. <a href=/people/7295 target=_blank>Ariovistus</a>, he said, in my own consulship sought most eagerly the friendship of the Roman people. Why should anyone conclude that he intends so recklessly to depart from his duty? For myself, I am persuaded that, when my demands are made known, and the fairness of my terms understood, <a href=/people/7295 target=_blank>Ariovistus</a> will not reject the goodwill of myself or the Roman people. Even if, in a fit of rage and madness, he makes war, what, pray, have you to fear? Why do you despair of your own courage or of my competence? We have made trial of this foe in the time of our fathers, on the occasion when, in the defeat of the <a href=/people/946 target=_blank>Cimbri</a> and <a href=/people/4314 target=_blank>Teutoni</a> by Gaius <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, the army was deemed to have deserved no less praise than the commander himself. We have made further trial of late in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> in the slave revolt, and yet the slaves had the practice and training which they had learnt from us to give them some measure of support. You may judge from this what profit there is in a good courage, for the very men whom you had feared without cause during a long time, when they had no arms, you subsequently subdued, though they had taken up arms and won victories. Finally, these are the selfsame men with whom the <a href=/people/12015 target=_blank>Helvetii</a> have had frequent encounters, and they have often subdued them, not only in <a href=/people/12015 target=_blank>Helvetian</a> territory but also in <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a>; yet the <a href=/people/12015 target=_blank>Helvetii</a> have not proved a match for our army. If there be any who are concerned at the defeat and flight of the Gauls, they can discover for the asking that when the Gauls were worn out by the length of the campaign <a href=/people/7295 target=_blank>Ariovistus</a>, who had kept himself for many months within his camp in the marshes, without giving a chance of encounter, attacked them suddenly when they had at last dispersed in despair of a battle, and conquered them rather by skill and stratagem than by courage. Even <a href=/people/7295 target=_blank>Ariovistus</a> himself does not expect that our own armies can be caught by tactics for which there was a chance against unskilled barbarians. Those persons who ascribe their own cowardice to a pretended anxiety for the corn-supply or to the defiles on the route are guilty of presumption, for they appear either to despair of the commander's doing his duty or to instruct him in it. These matters are my own concern; corn is being supplied by the <a href=/people/12012 target=_blank>Sequani</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/487059UTul class=ethnic long=5.8944 lat=48.6752>Leuci</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/479053UAnd class=ethnic long=5.3352 lat=47.8642>Lingones</a>, and the corn-crops in the fields are already ripe; of the route you yourselves will shortly be able to judge. As for the statement that the soldiers will not obey orders nor move forward, I am not in the least concerned by that; in any cases where an army has not obeyed its general, either fortune has failed because of some actual blunder, or else some crime shall be discovered and a charge of avarice has been brought home. My own blamelessness has been clearly seen throughout my life, my good fortune in the <a href=/people/12015 target=_blank>Helvetian</a> campaign. Accordingly I intend to execute at once what I might have put off to a more distant day, and to break camp in the fourth watch of this next night, to the intent that I may perceive at once whether honour and duty, or cowardice, prevail in your minds. Even if no one else follows, I shall march with the Tenth Legion alone; I have no doubt of its allegiance, and it will furnish the commander-in-chief's escort. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had shown special favour to this legion, and he placed the greatest reliance in it because of its courage.</p>                        </div>

As the order was being carried out, one of the soldiers of the Tenth Legion remarked with some wit that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was doing better than his promise; for he had promised to treat the Tenth Legion as the commander-in-chief's escort, and he was making new cavalry of them.</p>                        </div>

The place was about equally distant from the camps of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and of <a href=/people/7295 target=_blank>Ariovistus</a>. Thither, as agreed, they came for the parley. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> stationed the legion which he had brought on horseback two hundred paces from the mound. The horsemen of <a href=/people/7295 target=_blank>Ariovistus</a> halted at an equal distance. <a href=/people/7295 target=_blank>Ariovistus</a> demanded that they should parley on horseback, and that each should bring with him to the parley ten men besides himself. When they arrived at the spot <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> began his speech by relating the benefits conferred upon <a href=/people/7295 target=_blank>Ariovistus</a> by himself and by the Senate; the Senate had called him king and friend, and had sent gifts with a most lavish hand. This privilege, as he pointed out, had fallen to the lot of but few, and was usually granted in consideration of great personal services. <a href=/people/7295 target=_blank>Ariovistus</a>, though he had no right to audience of the Senate, and no just cause of claim, had obtained the rewards in question by the favour and generosity of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and of the Senate. He proceeded to show how long-established and how just were the reasons for a close relationship between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469043UAug class=ethnic long=4.299 lat=46.945>Aedui</a>; the frequency and the distinction of the Senate's decrees in respect of them; the manner in which, even before they had sought the friendship of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469043UAug class=ethnic long=4.299 lat=46.945>Aedui</a> had always held the primacy of all Gaul. It was the tradition of the Roman people to desire that its allies and friends should not only lose none of their possessions, but should enjoy increase of influence, dignity, and distinction; on the other hand, who, he asked, could endure that they should be despoiled of what they had brought with them to the friendship of the Roman people? He then made the same demands as those which he had given in his instructions to the deputies — that is to say, <a href=/people/7295 target=_blank>Ariovistus</a> must not make war on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469043UAug class=ethnic long=4.299 lat=46.945>Aedui</a> or on their allies; he must restore the hostages; and if he could not send back home any part of the Germans, at any rate he must not suffer any more to cross the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>.</p>                        </div>

He had crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>, he said, not of his own desire, but upon the request and summons of the Gauls; not without great hope of great rewards had he left home and kindred; the settlements he occupied in Gaul were granted by the natives, the hostages had been given with the consent of the natives; the tribute he took was by right of war, as customarily enforced by conquerors upon conquered. He had not made war upon the Gauls, but they upon him; all the states of Gaul had come to attack him and had set up their camp against him; all their forces had been beaten and overcome by him in a single action. If they wished to try the issue again, he was prepared to fight it out again; if they wished to enjoy peace, it was unjust to refuse the payment of tribute which of their own consent they had paid hitherto. The friendship of the Roman people ought to be a distinction and a security to him, not a hindrance; and he had sought it with that hope. If through the agency of the Roman people the tribute were to be remitted and the surrendered persons withdrawn, he would refuse the friendship of the Roman people no less heartily than he had sought it. As for the host of Germans that he was bringing over into Gaul, his object was to protect himself, not to attack Gaul; and the proof thereof was that he had not come except upon request, and that his warfare had been defensive, not offensive. He had come into Gaul before the Roman people. Never heretofore had an army of the Roman people left the borders of the Province of Gaul. What did <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> mean? Why did he come into his sphere of occupation? This was his province of Gaul, as the other was the Roman. As it was not right to give way to him, if he made an attack on Roman territory, so likewise the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were unjust in obstructing him in his own jurisdiction. As for <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s statement that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469043UAug class=ethnic long=4.299 lat=46.945>Aedui</a> were called brothers, <a href=/people/7295 target=_blank>Ariovistus</a> was not such a barbarian, not so ignorant of affairs as not to know that neither in the last campaign against the <a href=/people/11071 target=_blank>Allobroges</a> had the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469043UAug class=ethnic long=4.299 lat=46.945>Aedui</a> rendered assistance to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, nor in the disputes of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469043UAug class=ethnic long=4.299 lat=46.945>Aedui</a> with himself and the <a href=/people/12012 target=_blank>Sequani</a> had they enjoyed the assistance of the Roman people. He was bound to suspect, in spite of pretended friendship, that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had an army in Gaul for the purpose of crushing him. Unless, therefore, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> departed and withdrew his army from this locality, he would regard him, not as a friend, but as an enemy. And if he put <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> to death, he would gratify many nobles and leaders of the Roman people: this he knew for certain from themselves, by the messengers sent on behalf of all whose favour and friendship he could purchase by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s death. If, however, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> departed and resigned to him the uninterrupted occupation of Gaul, he would recompense him by a great reward, and would, without any exertion or risk on his part, execute any campaigns he might wish to be carried out.</p>                        </div>

His own practice, he said, and the practice of the Roman people did not suffer the abandonment of allies who had deserved so well, nor did he admit that Gaul belonged to <a href=/people/7295 target=_blank>Ariovistus</a> rather than to the Roman people. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458031UAug class=ethnic long=3.0858 lat=45.7787>Arverni</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444026USeg class=ethnic long=2.5741 lat=44.3508>Ruteni</a> had been subdued in a campaign by Quintus <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a>: the Roman people had pardoned them, and had not formed them into a province nor imposed a tribute. If priority of time was to be the standard, then the sovereignty of the Roman people in Gaul had complete justification; if the decision of the Senate was to be observed, Gaul should be free, for after conquest of the country the Senate had willed that it should continue to observe its own laws.</p>                        </div>

He thought it would be very dangerous to send one of his staff to him and so to expose a man to the ferocious Germans.

The left wing of the enemy's line was beaten and put to flight, but their right wing, by sheer weight of numbers, was pressing our line hard. Young Publius <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>, commanding our cavalry, noticed this, and as he could move more freely than the officers who were occupied in and about the line of battle, he sent the third line in support of our struggling troops.</p>                        </div>

Then, perceiving that our men were not inferior, he chose a ground before the camp naturally suitable and appropriate for forming line of battle; for the hill where the camp had been pitched, standing up but a little from the plain, offered to the front as broad a space as a line deployed could occupy; on either flank it fell away, while in front by a gentle slope it came down gradually to the level of the plain. On either flank of that hill he dug at right angles a protecting trench of about four hundred paces, and at the ends of the trenches he constructed forts and there posted his artillery, so that, when he had formed line, the enemy might not be able, because of their great superiority of numbers, to surround the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> fighting on the flanks. This done, he left in camp the two legions he had last enrolled, that they might be brought up in support wherever needed, and he put the remaining six in line of battle before the camp. The enemy likewise had led their forces out of camp and drawn them up.</p>                        </div>

The enemy were now aware that they had been deceived in their hope of storming the town and of crossing the river, and saw that our men did not advance to unfavourable ground for the sake of a battle; moreover, their own corn-supply began to fail.

For, as he was approaching an enemy, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, according to his custom, was moving with six legions in light field order; after them he had placed the baggage of the whole army; then the two legions which had been last enrolled brought up the rear of the whole column and formed the baggage-guard. Our cavalry crossed the river along with the slingers and archers, and engaged the enemy's horsemen. The latter retired repeatedly upon their comrades in the woods, and, issuing hence, again charged our men; nor did our men dare to follow in pursuit farther than the extent of level open ground. Meanwhile the six legions first to arrive measured out the work, and began to entrench camp. The moment that the first baggage-detachments of our army were seen by the enemy, who were lurking hidden in the woods — the moment agreed upon among them for joining battle — they suddenly dashed forth in full force, having already in the woods ordered their line in regular ranks and encouraged one another for the conflict; and so charged down upon our cavalry. These were easily beaten and thrown into disorder, and with incredible speed the enemy rushed down to the river, so that almost at the same moment they were seen at the edge of the woods, in the river, and then at close quarters. Then with the same speed they hastened up-hill against our camp and the troops engaged in entrenching it.</p>                        </div>

A great part of these duties was prevented by the shortness of the time and the advance of the enemy.

The rest of the men were tiring, and some of the rearmost ranks, abandoning the fight, were retiring to avoid the missiles; the enemy were not ceasing to move upwards in front from the lower ground, and were pressing hard on either flank. The condition of affairs, as he saw, was critical indeed, and there was no support that could be sent up. Taking therefore a shield from a soldier of the rearmost ranks, as he himself was come thither without a shield, he went forward into the first line, and, calling on the centurions by name, and cheering on the rank and file, he bade them advance and extend the companies, that they might ply swords more easily.

They reported this to their tribesmen, and agreed to perform his commands. A great quantity of arms was cast from the wall into the trench which was before the town, so that the heaps of weapons were well-nigh level with the top of the wall and the height of the ramp; and for all this about a third part, as was afterwards seen, was concealed and kept back in the town.

Part of them had the weapons which they had kept back and concealed, part had shields made of bark or plaited osiers and hastily (as the shortness of time necessitated) spread over with hides.

The enemy fought fiercely, as was to be expected of brave men in desperate case, where all hope of safety lay in valour alone, contending on unfavourable ground against troops who could hurl missiles at them from rampart and towers. Some four thousand men were slain, and the rest were flung back into the town.

Several causes had contributed to make the Gauls suddenly adopt the plan of renewing the war and crushing the legion. In the first place, they despised the small numbers of a legion, from which, never at full establishment, two cohorts had been withdrawn, and a considerable number of private soldiers sent off to seek supplies. In the second place, they supposed that, because of the disadvantage of position, since they themselves would charge down from the heights into the valley and hurl their missiles, not even their first onset could be withstood. Moreover, they were indignant that their children had been taken away from them under the title of hostages; and they were convinced that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were endeavouring to seize the peaks of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> and to add those districts to their neighbouring Province, not only for the sake of the routes, but to secure a permanent occupation.</p>                        </div>

He therefore summoned with speed a council of war, and proceeded to ask for expressions of opinion. The danger that had arisen was as serious as it was sudden and unexpected, and indeed by this time almost all higher ground was seen to be packed with a host of armed men, while, with the communications interrupted, reinforcements could not be attempted nor supplies brought up. In the council, therefore, the chance of safety was almost despaired of, and not a few opinions were expressed in favour of abandoning the baggage, making a sortie, and striving to win safety by the same routes which had brought them thither.

Their authority induced their neighbours — for the Gauls are sudden and spasmodic in their designs — to detain <a href=/people/3984 target=_blank>Trebius</a> and Terrasidius for the same reason, and, rapidly despatching deputies among their chiefs, they bound themselves by mutual oath to do nothing save by common consent, and to abide together the single issue of their destiny. Moreover, they urged the remaining states to choose rather to abide in the liberty received from their ancestors than to endure Roman slavery. The whole sea-coast was rapidly won to their opinion, and they despatched a deputation in common to Publius <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>, bidding him restore their hostages if he would receive back his own officers.</p>                        </div>

Therefore, as the danger was great, they began to prepare for war on a corresponding scale, and especially to provide naval equipment, and the more hopefully because they relied much on the nature of the country. They knew that on land the roads were intersected by estuaries, that our navigation was hampered by ignorance of the locality and by the scarcity of harbours, and they trusted that the Roman armies would be unable to remain long in their neighbourhood by reason of the lack of corn.

They were set at the end of tongues and promontories, so as to allow no approach on foot, when the tide had rushed in from the sea — which regularly happens every twelve hours — nor in ships, because when the tide ebbed again the ships would be damaged in shoal water. Both circumstances, therefore, hindered the assault of the strongholds; and, whenever the natives were in fact overcome by huge siege-works — that is to say, when the sea had been set back by a massive mole built up level to the town-walls — and so began to despair of their fortunes, they would bring close inshore a large number of ships, of which they possessed an unlimited supply, and take off all their stuff and retire to the nearest strongholds, there to defend themselves again with the same advantages of position. They pursued these tactics for a great part of the summer the more easily because our own ships were detained by foul weather, and because the difficulty of navigation on a vast and open sea, with strong tides and few — nay, scarcely any — harbours, was extreme.</p>                        </div>

Their keels were considerably more flat than those of our own ships, that they might more easily weather shoals and ebb-tide. Their prows were very lofty, and their sterns were similarly adapted to meet the force of waves and storms. The ships were made entirely of oak, to endure any violence and buffeting. The cross-pieces were beams a foot thick, fastened with iron nails as thick as a thumb. The anchors were attached by iron chains instead of cables. Skins and pieces of leather finely finished were used instead of sails, either because the natives had no supply of flax and no knowledge of its use, or, more probably, because they thought that the mighty ocean-storms and hurricanes could not be ridden out, nor the mighty burden of their ships conveniently controlled, by means of sails. When our own fleet encountered these ships it proved its superiority only in speed and oarsmanship; in all other respects, having regard to the locality and the force of the tempests, the others were more suitable and adaptable. For our ships could not damage them with the ram (they were so stoutly built), nor, by reason of their height, was it easy to hurl a pike, and for the same reason they were less readily gripped by grapnels. Moreover, when the wind began to rage and they ran before it, they endured the storm more easily, and rested in shoals more safely, with no fear of rocks or crags if left by the tide; whereas our own vessels could not but dread the possibility of all these chances.</p>                        </div>

It assembled in due course, and so soon as it was sighted by the enemy about two hundred and twenty of their ships, fully prepared and provided with every kind of equipment, sailed out of harbour and took station opposite ours. <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, who commanded the fleet, and his tribunes and centurions in charge of single ships, were by no means certain what to do or what plan of battle they were to pursue. For our commanders knew the enemy could not be damaged by the ram; while, even when turrets were set up on board, the lofty sterns of the native ships commanded even these, so that from the lower level missiles could not be hurled properly, while those discharged by the Gauls gained a heavier impact. One device our men had prepared to great advantage — sharp-pointed hooks let in and fastened to long poles, in shape not unlike siege-hooks. When by these contrivances the halyards which fastened the yards to the masts were caught and drawn taut, the ship was rowed hard ahead and they were snapped short. With the halyards cut, the yards of necessity fell down; and as all the hope of the Gallic ships lay in their sails and tackle, when those were torn away all chance of using their ships was taken away also. The rest of the conflict was a question of courage, in which our own troops easily had the advantage — the more so because the engagement took place in sight of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and of the whole army, so that no exploit a little more gallant than the rest could escape notice.

To them <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> sent envoys to demand the surrender of the men who had made war upon himself and Gaul. They replied that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> marked the limit of the Roman empire: if he thought it unfair that the Germans should cross into Gaul against his will, why did he claim any imperial power across the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>? <br />The <a href=/people/8470 target=_blank>Ubii</a>, on the other hand, the only tribe beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> which had sent deputies to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, made friendly terms, and given hostages, earnestly besought him to assist them, as they were grievously hard pressed by the <a href=/people/11067 target=_blank>Suebi</a>; or, if the urgent concerns of state prevented that, only to transport his army across the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>: that would suffice for their present help and future hope.

And so, although he was confronted with the greatest difficulty in making a bridge, by reason of the breadth, the rapidity, and the depth of the river, he still thought that he must make that effort, or else not take his army across. He proceeded to construct a bridge on the following plan. He caused pairs of balks eighteen inches thick, sharpened a little way from the base and measured to suit the depth of the river, to be coupled together at an interval of two feet. These he lowered into the river by means of rafts, and set fast, and drove home by rammers; not, like piles, straight up and down, but leaning forward at a uniform slope, so that they inclined in the direction of the stream. Opposite to these, again, were planted two balks coupled in the same fashion, at a distance of forty feet from base to base of each pair, slanted against the force and onrush of the stream. These pairs of balks had two-foot transoms let into them atop, filling the interval at which they were coupled, and were kept apart by a pair of braces on the outer side at each end. So, as they were held apart and contrariwise clamped together, the stability of the structure was so great and its character such that, the greater the force and thrust of the water, the tighter were the balks held in lock. These trestles were interconnected by timber laid over at right angles, and floored with long poles and wattlework. And further, piles were driven in aslant on the side facing down stream, thrust out below like a buttress and close joined with the whole structure, so as to take the force of the stream; and others likewise at a little distance above the bridge, so that if trunks of trees, or vessels, were launched by the natives to break down the structure, these fenders might lessen the force of such shocks, and prevent them from damaging the bridge.</p>                        </div>

He then dismissed them; and catching at one and the same moment a favourable wind and tide, he gave the signal, and weighed anchor, and, moving on about seven miles from that spot, he grounded his ships where the shore was even and open.11</p>                        </div>

So they sent forward their cavalry and charioteers — an arm which it is their regular custom to employ in fights — and, following up with the rest of their forces, they sought to prevent our troops from disembarking. Disembarkation was a matter of extreme difficulty, for the following reasons. The ships, on account of their size, could not be run ashore, except in deep water; the troops — though they did not know the ground, had not their hands free, and were loaded with the great and grievous weight of their arms — had nevertheless at one and the same time to leap down from the vessels, to stand firm in the waves, and to fight the enemy. The enemy, on the other hand, had all their limbs free, and knew the ground exceeding well; and either standing on dry land or advancing a little way into the water, they boldly hurled their missiles, or spurred on their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, which were trained to it.

This movement proved of great service to our troops; for the natives, frightened by the shape of the ships, the motion of the oars, and the unfamiliar type of the artillery, came to a halt, and retired, but only for a little space. And then, while our troops still hung back, chiefly on account of the depth of the sea, the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>-bearer of the Tenth Legion, after a prayer to heaven to bless the legion by his act, cried: Leap down, soldiers, unless you wish to betray your <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> to the enemy; it shall be told that I at any rate did my duty to my country and my general.

He set forth the plan and pattern of the new ships. For speed of loading and for purposes of beaching he would build them somewhat lower than those which we are accustomed to use on our own sea — and the more so because he had learnt that by reason of the frequent turns of the tides the waves off Gaul were generally smaller. For the transport of cargo, and of the numerous draught-animals, he would have the ships somewhere broader than those we use on the other seas. All of them he ordered to be fitted for oars as well as sails, to which end their lowness of build helped much. The necessary tackle for the equipment of the ships he commanded to be brought out of Spain.

He declared that his action in assaulting the camp had been the result, not of judgment or intention on his part, but of compulsion on the part of his state; and that the conditions of his own sovereignty were such that the people had as much authority over him as he himself over the people. The state, moreover, had gone to war because it had not been able to resist the sudden conspiracy of the Gauls. He could easily prove that by the insignificance of his own position; for he was not so ignorant of affairs as to believe that by his own forces the Roman people could be overcome. No, there was common consent among the Gauls: this was the day appointed for assaulting all the cantonments of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, so that one legion might not be able to come to the support of another. It would not have been easy for Gauls to refuse Gauls, especially when they considered that the design they had entered on was for the recovery of their common freedom. And now, having satisfied the Gauls as far as the claim of his country required, he had regard to his duty in response to the good offices of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; and he warned, he prayed <a href=/people/6029 target=_blank>Titurius</a>, as in private duty bound, to take measures for his own and his soldiers' safety.

He promised them, and confirmed it with an oath, that he would grant them safe passage through his borders.

They sought to show that even German forces, no matter how numerous, could be withstood by entrenched cantonments; there was proof of it in the fact that they had most gallantly withstood the first charge of the enemy, and had actually dealt them many wounds.

At dawn they marched forth from camp, as men persuaded that counsel had been given them not by an enemy, but by <a href=/people/12026 target=_blank>Ambiorix</a>, a devoted friend; the column was very lengthy, and the baggage very heavy.</p>                        </div>

They had continual quarrels together which was to stand first, and every year they struggled in fierce rivalry for the chief posts. One of them, <a href=/people/12158 target=_blank>Pullo</a>, when the fight was fiercest by the entrenchments, said: Why hesitate, <a href=/people/12160 target=_blank>Vorenus</a>? Or what chance of proving your pluck do you wait for? This day shall decide our quarrels. So saying, he stepped outside the entrenchments, and dashed upon the section of the enemy which seemed to be in closest array. Neither did <a href=/people/12160 target=_blank>Vorenus</a> keep within the rampart, but in fear of what all men would think he followed hard. Then, at short range, <a href=/people/12158 target=_blank>Pullo</a> sent his pike at the enemy, and pierced one man as he ran forward from the host. When he was struck senseless the enemy sought to cover him with their shields, and discharged their spears in a volley at the foeman, giving him no chance of retirement. <a href=/people/12158 target=_blank>Pullo</a>'s shield was penetrated, and a dart was lodged in his belt. This accident threw his scabbard out of place, and delayed his right hand as he tried to draw his sword, and while he was in difficulty the enemy surrounded him. His enemy, <a href=/people/12160 target=_blank>Vorenus</a>, ran up to him and helped him in his distress. Upon him at once all the host turned, and left <a href=/people/12158 target=_blank>Pullo</a>, supposing him to be slain by the dart. <a href=/people/12160 target=_blank>Vorenus</a> plied his sword at close quarters, and by slaying one man drove off the rest a little; while he pressed on too eagerly he fell down headlong into a dip in the ground. He was surrounded in his turn, but <a href=/people/12158 target=_blank>Pullo</a> brought assistance; and both, unhurt, though they had slain several men, retired with the utmost glory within the entrenchments. In the eagerness of their rivalry fortune so handled the two that, for all their mutual hostility, the one helped and saved the other, and it was impossible to decide which should be considered the better man in valour.</p>                        </div>

There he learnt from prisoners what was taking place at Cicero's station, and how dangerous was his case. Then he persuaded one of the Gallic troopers with great rewards to deliver a letter to Cicero. The letter he sent written in Greek characters, lest by intercepting it the enemy might get to know of our designs. The messenger was instructed, if he could not approach, to hurl a spear, with the letter fastened to the thong, inside the entrenchment of the camp. In the despatch he wrote that he had started with the legions and would speedily be with him, and he exhorted Cicero to maintain his old courage. Fearing danger, the Gaul discharged the spear, as he had been instructed. By chance it stuck fast in the tower, and for two days was not noticed by our troops; on the third day it was sighted by a soldier, taken down, and delivered to Cicero. He read it through, and then recited it at a parade of the troops, bringing the greatest rejoicing to all. Soon the smoke of the fires was to be seen in the distance, and this banished all doubt about the arrival of the legions.</p>                        </div>

When a chance offered, Cicero again asked Vertico, whom we mentioned above, for a Gaul to deliver a despatch to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. He warned the man to make his way cautiously and carefully. He wrote explicitly in the despatch that the enemy had departed from him and that the whole host had turned round to meet <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. The despatch was brought in about midnight; <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> informed his troops thereof, and encouraged them for the fight. At dawn next day he struck camp, and, having advanced about four miles, he caught sight of the enemy's host across a valley and a stream. It was a very dangerous thing for so slender a force to fight on unfavourable ground; further, as he knew that Cicero was freed from blockade, he was without anxiety, and thought that he should abate his speed. He halted, therefore, and proceeded to entrench his camp in the most favourable position to be found; and small as was the camp itself, as it was for scarce seven thousand men, and those, too, without baggage, he nevertheless compressed it by narrowing the streets as much as possible, with the object of incurring the utmost contempt on the part of the enemy.

And by now they were no farther from him than a two days' march, when they learnt that two legions were come, as despatched by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. So they pitched their camp at a distance of fifteen miles, and determined to await their German auxiliaries. <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a> learnt the design of the enemy, and in the hope that their recklessness would afford some chance of engaging them, he left a guard of five cohorts for the baggage, and set off against the enemy with twenty-five cohorts and a large detachment of cavalry. He entrenched a camp at an interval of one mile. Between <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a> and the enemy was a steep-banked river, difficult to cross. He had no intention of crossing this himself, nor did he suppose that the enemy would cross it. Their hope of auxiliaries was increasing daily. <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a> declared openly in a council of war that, as the Germans were said to be approaching, he would not risk his own and his army's fortunes, and that he would strike camp at dawn next day. This information was speedily carried to the enemy, for of a large number of Gallic horsemen natural feeling would compel some, as Gauls, to favour the Gallic cause. At nightfall <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a> summoned the military tribunes and the senior centurions, and propounded his plan; and, the more easily to give the enemy a suspicion that he was afraid, he ordered the camp to be struck with greater noise and disorder than was customary among <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>.

He sent the baggage a little forward and packed it on some rising ground. Then said he: Soldiers, you have the catch you have sought; you hold the enemy on ground that hampers and handicaps them: display under our command the same valour that you have often displayed to the commander-in-chief, and think that he is present and beholds this action with his own eyes. At the same moment he commanded the troops to wheel towards the enemy and deploy into line, and, detaching a few troops of cavalry to act as baggage-guard, he disposed the rest of the cavalry on the flanks. Speedily our troops raised a shout and hurled their pikes at the enemy. When these unexpectedly saw men whom they believed to be in retreat advancing against them in attack formation, they could not even sustain the assault, and at the first charge they were put to rout and sought the nearest woods. <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a> chased them with the cavalry, slew a great number, took a good many prisoners, and a few days later received the allegiance of the state.

And this seems to have been an ordinance from ancient days, to the end that no man of the people should lack assistance against a more powerful neighbour; for each man refuses to allow his own folk to be oppressed and defrauded, since otherwise he has no authority among them.

As for the common folk, they are treated almost as slaves, venturing naught of themselves, never taken into counsel. The more part of them, oppressed as they are either by debt, or by the heavy weight of tribute, or by the wrongdoing of the more powerful men, commit themselves in slavery to the nobles, who have, in fact, the same rights over them as masters over slaves. Of the two classes above mentioned one consists of <a href=/people/12197 target=_blank>Druids</a>, the other of knights. The former are concerned with divine worship, the due performance of sacrifices, public and private, and the interpretation of ritual questions: a great number of young men gather about them for the sake of instruction and hold them in great honour. In fact, it is they who decide in almost all disputes, public and private; and if any crime has been committed, or murder done, or there is any disposes about succession or boundaries, they also decide it, determining rewards and penalties: if any person or people does not abide by their decision, they ban such from sacrifice, which is their heaviest penalty. Those that are so banned are reckoned as impious and criminal; all men move out of their path and shun their approach and conversation, for fear they may get some harm from their contact, and no justice is done if they seek it, no distinction falls to their share. Of all these <a href=/people/12197 target=_blank>Druids</a> one is chief, who has the highest authority among them. At his death, either any other that is preëminent in position succeeds, or, if there be several of equal standing, they strive for the primacy by the vote of the <a href=/people/12197 target=_blank>Druids</a>, or sometimes even with armed force.

Thither assemble from every side all that have disputes, and they obey the decisions and judgments of the <a href=/people/12197 target=_blank>Druids</a>.

Report says that in the schools of the <a href=/people/12197 target=_blank>Druids</a> they learn by heart a great number of verses, and therefore some persons remain twenty years under training. And they do not think it proper to commit these utterances to writing, although in almost all other matters, and in their public and private accounts, they make use of Greek letters. I believe that they have adopted the practice for two reasons — that they do not wish the rule to become common property, nor those who learn the rule to rely on writing and so neglect the cultivation of the memory; and, in fact, it does usually happen that the assistance of writing tends to relax the diligence of the student and the action of the memory. The cardinal doctrine which they seek to teach is that souls do not die, but after death pass from one to another; and this belief, as the fear of death is thereby cast aside, they hold to be the greatest incentive to valour. Besides this, they have many discussions as touching the stars and their movement, the size of the universe and of the earth, the order of nature, the strength and the powers of the immortal gods, and hand down their lore to the young men.</p>                        </div>

Each man had settled where a hidden valley or a wooded locality or an entangled morass offered some hope of defence or security. These localities were known to the dwellers round about, and thus the matter required great care, not for the protection of the army as a whole (for no danger could occur to united bodies from individuals scared and scattered), but for the preservation of single soldiers, although this latter consideration affected to some degree the safety of the army. For the passion for plunder was apt to draw many men too far afield, and at the same time the woods forbade the advance of any close-formed body along the hidden and uncertain tracks. If <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> wished to finish off the business and to make away with a brood of malefactors, he must needs send several bands in different directions and move his troops at wide intervals; if he wished to keep the companies with the standards, as the established rule and custom of the Roman army required, the locality itself gave protection to the natives, and individuals among them lacked not the daring to lay secret ambush and surround scattered detachments.

On boats and rafts they crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> thirty miles below the spot where the bridge had been built and a garrison left by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; and, coming first to the borders of the <a href=/people/9292 target=_blank>Eburones</a>, they caught many persons scattered in flight, and captured a great quantity of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, of which barbarians are very covetous. They were tempted by plunder to proceed further. No march, no woods check these children of war and brigandage. From prisoners they inquire in what district <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> is; they find that he has gone on some distance, they learn that all his army is departed.

He therefore sent five cohorts to get corn in the nearest fields, between which and the camp but a single hill interposed. Several men of the legions had been left behind sick, and those of them who had recovered during the intervening days, to the number of some three hundred, were sent together under a flag; and, besides, a great host of camp-followers got leave to follow with a great number of pack-animals which had remained in the camp.</p>                        </div>

Our troops, not expecting them, were thrown into confusion by the surprise, and the cohort on guard scarcely stood the first attack. The enemy poured round the other faces of the camp to see if they could find an entry. Our troops with difficulty defended the gates; all other chances of entrance were prevented by the nature of the place itself and by the entrenchment.

They were speedily hurled down from thence, and ran headlong into the company formations, scaring the soldiers into greater alarm. Some of these proposed to form a wedge and break through speedily, as the camp was so near at hand, feeling confident that if some part were surrounded and slain, yet the remainder could be saved. Others proposed to take post on the ridge and all face the same risk together. This course was not approved by the veterans, who, as we have shown, marched out together under a flag. So they encouraged one another, and, led, by Gaius <a href=/people/951 target=_blank>Trebonius</a>, a Roman knight, who had been put in command of them, they broke through the midst of the enemy and came into camp all safe to a man. Close behind them in the same onrush came the camp-followers and the cavalry, who were saved by the valour of soldiers. But the party which had taken post on the ridge, still utterly untutored in the practice of war, had proved unable either to abide in the place they had approved and defend themselves on higher ground, or to imitate the vigour and the speed which they had seen to be of assistance to others; indeed, in the attempt to retire into camp they came down to unfavourable ground. Some of their centurions had been transferred, on account of valour, from the lower ranks of the other legion to the higher ranks of this; and these, that they might not lose the renown for military prowess won in the past, fell, fighting most gallantly. Part of the soldiers, when the enemy had been thrust aside by the valour of the centurions, arrived, though they did not expect it, safe in camp; part were surrounded by the natives and perished.</p>                        </div>

The forage could not be cut; the enemy must of necessity scatter to seek it from the homesteads; and all these detachments could be picked off daily by the horsemen. Moreover, for the sake of the common weal, the interests of private property must be disregarded; hamlets and homesteads must be burnt in every direction for such a distance from the route as the enemy seemed likely to penetrate in quest of forage. The Gauls had a supply of such necessaries, because they were assisted by the resources of the tribes in whose territory the campaign was being carried on.

They were resolved, if the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> tried to burst through the marsh, to overwhelm them from the higher ground as they stuck fast.

All these circumstances, they said, could not have happened by chance or without design; he preferred to possess the kingship of Gaul by the leave of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> rather than by favour of themselves. Accused in such sort, he replied to the charges. As for having moved the camp, it had been done, he said, actually at their own instance, through lack of forage; as for having gone nearer the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, he had been influenced by the advantage of a person which could protect itself by its own defences; further, the service of the horse should not have been needed on marshy ground, and it had been useful in the place to which they had marched. It was of purpose that he had committed the chief command to no one at his departure, for fear that his deputy might be driven by the zeal of the host to an engagement — an object for which he saw that all were zealous through weakness of spirit, because they could not longer endure hardship. If the appearance of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> on the scene had been due to chance, the Gauls had fortune to thank; if they had been summoned thither by some informer, the Gauls had that man to thank for the satisfaction of having been able to learn from their higher station the scantiness of their numbers, and to despise a courage which had not ventured to fight but had retired disgracefully to camp. He had no need to obtain from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> by treachery a title of command which he could enjoy by a victory already assured to himself and all the Gauls. Nay more, he gave the title back to them if they thought that they were bestowing honour on him rather than deriving security from him. That you may perceive, he continued, the sincerity of this statement on my part, listen to Roman soldiers. He brought forward slaves whom he had caught foraging a few days before and had tortured with hunger and chains. These had been previously instructed what to state when questioned, and said that they were soldiers of the line; they had been induced by hunger and want to go secretly out of the camp, to see if they could find any corn or <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> in the fields; the whole army was suffering from similar want, no man had any strength left, none could endure the strain of work, and therefore the commander-in-chief had decided, if they made no progress in the siege of the town, in three days to withdraw the army. These, said <a href=/people/8482 target=_blank>Vercingetorix</a>, are the benefits you have from me, whom you accuse of treachery, by whose effort, without shedding of your own blood, you behold this great victorious army wasted with hunger; while it is I who have seen to it that, when it takes shelter in disgraceful flight, no state shall admit within its borders.</p>                        </div>

Others began at long range to hurl torches and dry wood from the wall on to the ramp, and to pour down pitch and everything else that can kindle a fire, so that it was scarcely possible to form an idea in which direction the troops should hasten first or to what point bring assistance. However, as by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s standing order two legions were always in bivouac before the camp, and more, by a succession of reliefs, were engaged on the earthwork, it was speedily arranged that some troops should resist the sorties, while others dragged back the turrets and cut a gap in the ramp, and the whole host from the camp rushed up to extinguish the fire.</p>                        </div>

When they saw that the men were firm in their purpose, for as a rule in extreme peril fear admits no sense of pity, they began to cry out in a body and to make signs to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> as touching the flight.

The young men were speedily won over by the speech of the magistrate and by the bribe, and avowed that they would be the very first to support his design. Then they began to seek a means of executing it, because they were not sure that the state could be induced off-hand to undertake a war. It was resolved that <a href=/people/12150 target=_blank>Litaviccus</a> should be put in command of the ten thousand soldiers who were to be sent to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> for the war, and should be responsible for their leading, while his brethren hastened forward to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>.

All agreed in stating, what <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself had already learnt through scouts, that the crest of the ridge there was almost level, but that this hill was wooded and narrow where it gave access to the other side of the town.

At daybreak he commanded a large quantity of baggage-mules to be brought forth from camp, and the muleteers to take off the packs, and with helmets on their heads to ride round the hills, like cavalry to all seeming. With them he put a few cavalry, to range more widely by way of demonstration, and ordered them all to make for the same general destination by a long circuit. The proceeding was noticed afar from the town, as there was a bird's-eye view from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/457031XGer class=place long=3.1189 lat=45.7201>Gergovia</a> into the camp; but at so great a distance the real meaning thereof could not be discovered. He despatched one legion in the same direction, and when it had advanced a little way he halted it on the lower ground and concealed it in the woods.

He explained the disadvantage caused by the inequality of the ground, and said that this could be remedy by speed alone: it was a question of surprise, not of battle.

Matrons cast clothing and silver from the wall, and with bare breast and outstretched hands implored the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> to spare them, and then to do as they had done at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/471024UAva class=place long=2.3992 lat=47.0822>Avaricum</a>, holding their hand not even from women and children. Some of the women were lowered by hand from the wall, and were fain to deliver themselves to the troops. Lucius <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a>, a centurion of the Eighth Legion, who was known to have said that day among his company that he was spurred on by the rewards at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/471024UAva class=place long=2.3992 lat=47.0822>Avaricum</a>, and would allow no one to mount the wall before him, got three men of his company, was lifted up by them, and mounted the wall.

Behind this interval he dug all round two trenches, fifteen feet broad and of equal depth; and the inner one, where the ground was level with the plain or sank below it, he filled with water diverted from the river. Behind the trenches he constructed a ramp and palisade twelve feet high; to this he added a breastwork and battlements, with large fraises projecting at the junctions of screens and ramp, to check the upward advance of the enemy; and all round the works he set turrets at intervals of eighty feet.</p>                        </div>

Accordingly, trunks or very stout branches of trees were cut, and the tops thereof barked and sharpened, and continuous trenches five feet deep were dug. Into these the stumps were sunk and fastened at the bottom so that they could not be torn up, while the bough-ends were left projecting. They were in rows of five fastened and entangled together, and anyone who pushed into them must impale himself on the sharpest of stakes. These they called markers.10 In front of these, in diagonal rows arranged like a figure of five, pits three feet deep were dug, sloping inwards slightly to the bottom. In these, tapering stakes as thick as a man's thigh, sharpened at the top and fire-hardened, were sunk so as to project no more than four fingers' breadth from the ground; at the same time, to make all strong and firm, the earth was trodden down hard for one foot from the bottom, and the remainder of the pit was covered over with twigs and brushwood to conceal the trap. Eight rows of this kind were dug, three feet apart. From its resemblance to the flower the device was called a lily.

Various opinions were expressed, one party voting for surrender, another for a sortie while their strength sufficed; but the speech of Critognatus should not, I think, be omitted, because of its remarkable and abominable cruelty. He was of high lineage among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458031UAug class=ethnic long=3.0858 lat=45.7787>Arverni</a>, and considered to have great influence. Of their opinion, he said, who call a most disgraceful slavery by the name of surrender I purpose to say nothing; I hold that they should not be treated as citizens nor invited to the council. Let my business be with those who approve a sortie; and in their design, by your general agreement, there seems to remain a memory of ancient courage. This is faint-heartedness of yours, not courage, to be unable to endure want for a short space. It is easier to find men to fling themselves recklessly on death than men to endure pain patiently. And yet I might now have approved this view (so much weight with me has the authority of those who hold it) if I saw therein the loss of nothing but our life; but in making our decision we should have regard to the whole of Gaul, which we have aroused to our assistance. What, think ye, will be the spirit of our friends and kindred, when eighty thousand men have been slain in one spot, if they are forced to fight out the issue almost over their very bodies? Refuse to rob of your support the men who for your deliverance have disregarded their own peril; forbear by folly, recklessness, or weak-mindedness of yours to lay prostrate, and subject to everlasting slavery, the whole of Gaul. Or do you doubt their faithfulness, their resolution, because they are not arrived to the day? What then? Do ye think that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> are daily engaged in those outer trenches for mere amusement? If it may not be that your resolve should be strengthened by messages from your friends, since every approach is blocked, yet take the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> here to your witnesses that their coming draws nigh; and it is in fear thereof that they are busy in their works day and night. What, then, is my counsel? To do what our forefathers did in the war, in no wise equal to this, with the <a href=/people/946 target=_blank>Cimbri</a> and the Teutones. They shut themselves into the towns, and under stress of a like scarcity sustained life on the bodies of those whose age showed them useless for war, and delivered not themselves to the enemy. And if we had not a precedent for this, I should still have judged it a most glorious thing for the sake of liberty to set such a one and to hand it down to posterity. For wherein was that war like this? The <a href=/people/946 target=_blank>Cimbri</a> devastated Gaul, they brought great disaster upon us, yet they departed at length from our borders and sought other countries, leaving us our rights, laws, lands, liberty. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> — what else do they seek or desire than to follow where envy leads, to settle in the lands and states of men whose noble report and martial strength they have learnt, and to bind upon them a perpetual slavery? 'Tis in no other fashion they have waged wars. And if ye know not what is afoot among distant nations, look now on Gaul close at hand, which has been reduced to a province, with utter change of rights and laws, and crushed beneath the axes in everlasting slavery.</p>                        </div>

There was a view down from all the camps, which occupied the top of the surrounding ridge, and all the troops were intently awaiting the issue of the fight. The Gauls had placed archers and light-armed skirmishers here and there among the horsemen to give immediate support to their comrades if driven back and to resist the charge of the cavalry. A number of men, wounded unexpectedly by these troops, began to withdraw from the fight. When the Gauls were confident that their own men were getting the better of the battle, and saw ours hard pressed by numbers, with shouts and yells on every side — those who were confined by the entrenchments as well as the others who had come up to their assistance — they sought to inspirit their countrymen. As the action was proceeding in sight of all, and no deed, of honour or dishonour, could escape notice, both sides were stirred to courage by desire of praise and fear of disgrace. The fight lasted, and the victory was doubtful, from noon almost to sunset; then the Germans in one part of the field massed their troops of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, charged the enemy and routed them, and when they had been put to flight the archers were surrounded and slain.

Many a man was wounded, but the entrenchment was nowhere penetrated; and when daybreak drew nigh, fearing that they might be surrounded on their exposed flank by a sortie from the camps above them, they retired to their comrades. Meanwhile the inner force brought out the appliances which had been prepared by <a href=/people/8482 target=_blank>Vercingetorix</a> for a sortie, and filled in the nearer trenches; but they lingered too long in the execution of the business, and, or ever they could get near the entrenchments, they learnt that their countrymen had withdrawn.

Having reconnoitred the locality by means of scouts, the commanders of the enemy chose out of the whole host sixty thousand men belonging to the states which had the greatest reputation for courage: they determined secretly together what should be done and in what fashion, and decided that the advance should take place at the moment when it was seen to be midday.

I have tacked a supplement to the Commentaries of our great <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> on the operations in Gaul, as his previous and his subsequent writings did not otherwise fit together; and his last work, which was left unfinished from the operations at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> onwards, I have completed as far as the conclusion, not indeed of civil discord, of which we see no end, but of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s life. And I trust that those who will read it may understand how unwillingly I have undertaken the task of writing this Commentary; for so shall I the easier free myself from the charge of folly and presumption for having intruded myself in the middle of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s writings. For it is universally agreed that nothing was ever so elaborately finished by others that is not surpassed by the refinement of these Commentaries. They have been published that historians may not lack knowledge of those great achievements; and so strong is the unanimous verdict of approval as to make it appear that historians have been robbed of an opportunity rather than enriched with one. Yet herein is our own admiration greater than all other men's; the world knows how excellently, how faultlessly, but we know also how easily, how speedily he completed his Commentaries. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> possessed not only the greatest facility and refinement of style, but also the surest skill in explaining his own plans.

Accordingly, he summoned a council of war and set forth everything that had been reported to him; then he spoke encouragingly to the rank and file. To see if he could entice the enemy to a decisive battle by the appearance of only three legions, he arranged the order of the column as follows. The Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth were to march in front of all the baggage, and the Eleventh was to bring up the rear of the whole baggage-train (which, however, was but moderate, according to the custom on expeditions), to prevent the enemy from catching a sight of greater numbers than they themselves had challenged.

Anxious as he had been to fight, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was surprised at the greater number of the enemy, and set his camp over against that of the enemy, with a valley in between, deep rather than extensive. He commanded the camp to be fortified with a twelve-foot rampart, a breastwork to be built on in proportion to the height of the same, a double trench fifteen feet wide in each case to be dug with perpendicular sides, turrets three stories high to be set up at frequent intervals and connected by covered cross-bridges, having their front faces protected by a breastwork of wattles. His object was to hold the camp against the enemy by the double ditch and a double rank of defenders: one rank, posted on the bridges, from the greater safety afforded by height, could hurl its missiles with greater range and confidence; the other, posted on the actual rampart nearer the enemy, would be covered by the bridge from the showers of missiles.

Meanwhile there were frequent encounters across the marsh that lay between the two camps, for a few men would dash forward from either side; but sometimes our own Gallic or German auxiliaries would cross the marsh to pursue the enemy the more fiercely, or in turn the enemy would push across it and force our troops to give ground. Moreover, in the daily expeditions for forage it happened — as was inevitable, when forage had to be collected from homesteads few and far apart — that scattered foraging parties were surrounded in troublesome places; and this occurrence, though causing our troops an insignificant loss in draught-animals and slaves, served nevertheless to arouse foolish fancies in the mind of the natives, the more so as <a href=/people/12148 target=_blank>Commius</a>, who, as I have shown, had departed to fetch German auxiliaries, was now come with some horsemen.

In different parts of the field a fierce struggle began; and as it tended to drag on indecisively, little by little there issued from the woods a formed body of footmen, which forced our cavalry to give way. But they were speedily supported by the light-armed infantry, which, as I have mentioned, had been sent on in front of the legions, and these, taking post between the troops of our cavalry, fought stoutly. For some time the battle was evenly contested; then, as was inevitable from the nature of the engagement, the troops which had withstood the first attack from the ambuscades began to get the better of it just because they had not suffered any damage from the ambuscaders through want of judgment. Meanwhile the legions were drawing nearer, and frequent reports were being brought alike to our own side and to the enemy to the effect that the commander-in-chief was come with troops in order of battle. When they learnt this our men, relying on the support of the cohorts, fought most fiercely, for they feared that if they were too slow of execution they would be thought to have shared the glory of victory with the legions.

And so, leaving Quintus <a href=/people/1443 target=_blank>Calenus</a>, lieutenant-general, with the legions to follow after him by regular marches, he himself with the whole of the cavalry pressed on with all speed to join <a href=/people/1657 target=_blank>Caninius</a>.</p>                        </div>

He perceived that the town was surrounded by siege-works and that the enemy had no chance of retreat from an assault, and he had learnt from deserters that the townsfolk were well supplied with a large quantity of corn; he began, therefore, to try to cut off their water. A river ran through the bottom of the valley which almost entirely surrounded the hill, and on the hill was built the town of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450017UUxe class=place long=1.67731 lat=44.9513>Uxellodunum</a>, with a precipice on every side. The lie of the ground prevented a diversion of the river, for its course at the very base of the hill was such that it could nowhere be drawn off by sinking trenches. But the townsfolk had a difficult and precipitous descent to the river, so that our troops, without danger to life or limb, could prevent them from either approaching the river or retiring up the steep ascent. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> remarked this difficulty of theirs, and by posting archers and slingers thereabout, and, further, by placing artillery at certain points opposite the easiest lines of descent, he sought to cut off the townsfolk from the river-water.</p>                        </div>

All the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> wished that the townsfolk could be cut off from this spring, but <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> alone saw how it could be done. He began, just opposite the place, to push up mantlets against the hill and to build a ramp with great effort and continual fighting; for the townsfolk ran down from the higher ground and engaged without risk at long range, wounding many men as they doggedly worked upwards. However, our troops were not to be deterred from thrusting the mantlets forward and from defeating the local difficulties by sheer labour of engineering. At the same time they were pushing forward covered mines from the mantlets to the head of the spring; and this kind of work involved no risk, and could be done without suspicion on the part of the enemy. The ramp was built up to a height of sixty feet, and upon it was set a turret of ten stories, not, indeed, to reach the level of the walls, for no siege-works could effect that, but to overtop the level of the spring. When the artillery from the turret began to discharge missiles upon the line of approach to the spring, and the townsfolk could not get water without danger, not only <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and beasts of burden, but even the great host of the enemy, were like to die of thirst.</p>                        </div>

A mighty flame suddenly shot forth in the midst of the works; for everything that was discharged over the escarpment was held up by the mantlets and the ramp, and set fire to the particular object which checked its course. On the other hand, our soldiers, though handicapped by the dangerous position, none the less endured every difficulty in the most gallant spirit. For the action went on at a considerable height and in sight of our army, and great shouting arose on both sides.

So our men, when the fighting ceased, speedily extinguished or cut away the parts of the works which had caught fire. Although the townsfolk continued to resist stoutly, and stuck to their resolve, even when they had lost a great part of their number through thirst, at last by means of the mines the feeders of the spring were cut off and diverted. This caused the perpetual spring suddenly to dry up, and wrought such despair of deliverance in the townsfolk that they thought it due, not to the device of man, but to the act of God.

He was glad to use his personal influence in the contest for an intimate friend of his own, whom he had sent on a little before to pursue his candidature; he was no less eager to do so in opposition to the powerful partisanship of the few who desired, by the defeat of Marcus <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, to upset the influence of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> when he should retire from his province. And although he had heard on the way that, before he could reach <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> had been elected augur, he felt that he had no less legitimate reason for visiting the boroughs and colonies to thank them for affording <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> their support in so large numbers, and at the same time to commend himself as a candidate for the office he sought for the following year. For his opponents were insolently boasting that Lucius <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> and Gaius <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> had been elected consuls to despoil <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> of every office and distinction, and that the consulship had been wrested from <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>, though he had been far stronger in influence and votes alike, because he was intimately connected with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> by personal friendship and by service as his lieutenant-general.4</p>                        </div>

The whole population, with the children, went forth to meet him, victims were sacrificed everywhere, festal couches, duly spread, occupied market-places and temples, so as to anticipate, if possible, the joy of the triumph so long, so very long expected.

He himself marched as far as he deemed sufficient for change of stations, to keep the troops in health.

For he judged that his cause was like to be easily gained if the votes of the conscript fathers were unrestrained. Indeed, Gaius <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>, tribune of the people, had undertaken to defend the cause and the position of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; and he had often promised the Senate that, if any person suffered from apprehension of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s arms, and as the armed tyranny of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> was creating considerable alarm in the Forum, he would move that both leaders should give up arms and disband their armies. He held that by this means the state would be free and independent. And this was no mere promise, but he even tried to secure a decree by a division; however, the consuls and the friends of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> interposed to prevent it, and thus frustrated the attempt by delaying action.</p>                        </div>
