As for the one, a man would praise her when he came to understand her; but the other is blameworthy: and they are wholly different in nature. For one fosters evil war and battle, being cruel: her no man loves; but perforce, through the will of the deathless gods, men pay harsh <a href=/people/1556 target=_blank>Strife</a> her honour due. But the other is the elder daughter of dark <a href=/people/12253 target=_blank>Night</a>, and the son of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronos</a> who sits above and dwells in the aether, set her in the roots of the earth: and she is far kinder to men. She stirs up even the shiftless to toil; for a man grows eager to work when he considers his neighbour, a rich man who hastens to plough and plant and put his house in good order; and neighbour vies with is neighbour as he hurries after wealth. This <a href=/people/1556 target=_blank>Strife</a> is wholesome for men.

Then you will not wreck your ship, nor will the sea destroy the sailors, unless <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> the <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Earth-Shaker</a> be set upon it, or <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, the king of the deathless gods, wish to slay them; for the issues of good and evil alike are with them. At that time the winds are steady, and the sea is harmless. Then trust in the winds without care, and haul your swift ship down to the sea and put all the freight on board; but make all haste you can to return home again and do not wait till the time of the new wine and autumn rain and oncoming storms with the fierce gales of <a href=/people/2367 target=_blank>Notus</a> who accompanies the heavy autumn rain of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and stirs up the sea and makes the deep dangerous. </p>                        </div>

For my part I do not praise it, for my heart does not like it. Such a sailing is snatched, and you will hardly avoid mischief. Yet in their ignorance men do even this, for wealth means life to poor mortals; but it is fearful to die among the waves. But I bid you consider all these things in your heart as I say. Do not put all your goods in hollow ships; leave the greater part behind, and put the lesser part on board; for it is a bad business to meet with disaster among the waves of the sea, as it is bad if you put too great a load on your waggon and break the axle, and your goods are spoiled.
