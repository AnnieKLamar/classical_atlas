For they say that we shall sail into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381253WAeg class=place long=25.3 lat=38.1>Aegean</a> itself, and I believe the sea is dangerous and not easy to sail.

With this objective, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a> seek omens for good sailing. <br />VINEDR: You people are at any rate skilled in nautical affairs, stranger, for you have also, I suppose, designated Cynosura as a sign in the sky, and you sail by reference to it. Yet just as you are praised for your skill in sailing, so you are slandered as money-lovers and greedy rascals for your business dealings. </p>                        </div>

Instead, everything would be by nature without price and common to all, just as in the Marketplace of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>Swine</a>. Wherever it is necessary, however, for one bound to the land and subject to the seasons to sow, plow, plant, and suffer one toil after another, there it is necessary to buy and sell as well. For money is needed for farming, and without it, you will feed neither a plowman nor a vinedresser nor a cowherd nor a goatherd, nor will you have a krater from which to drink or pour a libation. In fact, the most pleasant thing in farming, namely, gathering grapes, one must contract out for hire. Otherwise, the vines will stand idle and yield no wine, as though they had been cursed. These things, stranger, I have said about the whole crowd of farmers, but my own way is far more reasonable, since I do not associate with merchants, and I do not know what the drachma is. But I either buy or myself sell a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> for grain and a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> for wine and so forth, without much talking back and forth. </p>                        </div>

Hey, what does this <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> want? He keeps going all around me, whining at my feet and offering his ear gently and tamely. <br />VINEDR: He explains my character to you, stranger — and that we are so moderate and gracious to those who arrive here that we do not allow the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> to bark at them, but rather to welcome and to fawn before those who arrive. <br />PHOEN: Is it permissible to approach a vine? <br />VINEDR: No one is stingy, since there are enough grapes for us. <br />PHOEN: What about picking figs? <br />VINEDR: This is also allowed, since there is a surplus of figs too. And I could give you nuts, apples, and countless other good things. I plant them as snacks among the vines. <br />PHOEN: What might I pay you for them? <br />VINEDR: Nothing other than to eat them with pleasure, to be satisfied, and to go away rejoicing. <br />PHOEN: But, vinedresser, do you live a reflective way of life? <br />VINEDR: Yes, indeed, with the handsome <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a>. <br />PHOEN: What connection is there between you and <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a>, if you mean the man from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>? <br />VINEDR: I do mean that man, the husband of <a href=/people/2680 target=_blank>Laodameia</a>, for he delights in hearing this epithet. <br />PHOEN: But what, indeed, does he do here? <br />VINEDR: He lives here, and we farm together. <br />PHOEN: Has he come back to life, or what has happened? <br />VINEDR: He himself does not speak about his own experiences, stranger, except, of course, that he died at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> because of <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>, but came to life again in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393223RPht class=place long=22.5 lat=39.2>Phthia</a> because he loved <a href=/people/2680 target=_blank>Laodameia</a>. <br />PHOEN: And yet he is said to have died after he came to life again and to have persuaded his wife to follow him. </p>                        </div>

But how he returned afterwards too, he does not tell me even though I've wanted to find out for a long time. He is hiding, he says, some secret of the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a>. His fellow soldiers also, who were there in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, still appear on the plain, warlike in posture and shaking the crests of their helmets. [3] <br />PHOEN: By <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, vinedresser, I don't believe it, although I wish these things were so. But if you are not attending to the plants, nor irrigating them, tell me now about these matters and what you know about <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a>. Indeed, you would please the heroes if I should go away believing. <br />VINEDR: Stranger, the plants no longer need watering at midday, since it is already late autumn and the season itself waters them. Therefore, I have leisure to relate everything in detail. Since these matters are sacred to the gods and so important, may they not escape the notice of cultivated people! It is also better for us to sit down in the beauty of this place. <br />PHOEN: Lead the way; I will follow even beyond the interior of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>. <br />VINEDR: Let us enter the vineyard, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a>. For you may even discover in it something to cheer you. <br />PHOEN: Let us enter, for a scent that is, I suppose, pleasant comes from the plants. <br />VINEDR: What do you mean? Pleasant? It is divine! The blossoms of the uncultivated trees are fragrant, as are the fruits of those cultivated. If you ever come upon a cultivated plant with fragrant blossoms, pluck rather the leaves, since the sweet scent comes from them. <br />PHOEN: How diverse is the beauty of your property, and how lush the clusters of grapes have grown! How well-arranged are all the trees, and how divine is the fragrance of the place! Indeed, I think that the walkways which you have left untilled are pleasing, but, vinedresser, you seem to me to live luxuriously since you use so much uncultivated land. <br />VINEDR: The walkways are sacred, stranger, for the hero exercises on them. [4] <br />PHOEN: You will discuss these things once we sit down where you are leading us. But now tell me this: do you farm your own property, or is someone else the owner, and do you provide food for the one who feeds you, like <a href=/people/490 target=_blank>Oineus</a> in <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>' tragedy? </p>                        </div>

But powerful men have left me completely bereft of the other fields. <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> took for himself this small piece of land, which was actually owned by <a href=/people/7038 target=_blank>Xeinis</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353254PChe class=person long=25.3905 lat=35.3186>Chersonesian</a>. He took it for himself by projecting some kind of apparition of himself at <a href=/people/7038 target=_blank>Xeinis</a>. The apparition so damaged <a href=/people/7038 target=_blank>Xeinis</a> that he went away blind. <br />PHOEN: I suppose you have acquired an excellent guard over your estate, and because your friend is so alert, you do not even fear attack by any <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>. <br />VINEDR: You speak the truth. No beast is allowed to enter the premises. No <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>, or poisonous <a href=/people/10968 target=_blank>spider</a>, or extortionist attacks us here in the field. This last beast is exceedingly shameless; it even kills in the marketplace. <br />PHOEN: Vinedresser, how were you trained in speaking? You do not seem to me to be among the uneducated. <br />VINEDR: At first, we spent our life in a city, and we were provided with teachers and studied. But my affairs were really in a bad way because the farming was left to slaves, and they did not bring anything back to us. Hence it was necessary to take loans with the field as security and to go hungry. And yes, on arriving, I tried to make <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> my advisor, but he remained silent, since he was justifiably angry at me because, having left him, I lived in a city. But when I persisted and said that I would die if neglected, he said, Change your dress. On that day, I heard this advice but did nothing; afterwards, examining it closely, I understood that he was commanding me to change my way of life. From that point on, after I was suitably dressed in a leather jacket, carrying a hoe, and no longer knew my way to town, <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> made everything in the field grow luxuriously for me. Whenever a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, a beehive, or a tree became diseased, I consulted <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> as a physician. Since I spend time with him and devote myself to the land, I am becoming more skilled than I used to be, because he excels in wisdom. </p>                        </div>

[5] <br />PHOEN: Do you then spend time with each other here, vinedresser? <br />VINEDR: Yes, right here, stranger. How did you guess? <br />PHOEN: Because this portion of the land seems to me to be most pleasant and divine. I do not know whether anyone has ever come to life again here, but if someone were to, he would live, I suppose, most pleasantly and painlessly after coming from the throng of battle. These trees are very tall, since time has reared them. This water from the springs is varied in taste, and I suppose you draw it as though drinking first one vintage wine and then another. You also produce canopies by twining and fitting together the trees, as one could not even weave together a crown from an unmown meadow. <br />VINEDR: Stranger, you have not yet even heard the nightingales that sing here both when evening comes and when day begins, just as they do in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>. <br />PHOEN: I suppose that I have heard and that I agree that they do not lament, but only sing. But say something about the heroes, for I would rather hear about them. Do you want to sit down somewhere? <br />VINEDR: The hero, who is a gracious host, agrees to offer us these seats of honor. <br />PHOEN: Look, I am at ease, for hospitality is pleasant for one listening to serious discourse.

For when <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, far from his ship, was perplexed, <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, or one of his clever followers, had an earnest conversation with him (the subject was probably the moly). And <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> by means of me will fill you with information and make you more content and wise. For knowing many things is worth much. <br />PHOEN: But I am not perplexed, my good friend. By <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>!

When the ship put in here at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401262UEla class=place long=26.2233 lat=40.0545>Elaious</a>, I dreamed I read the verses of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> in which he relates the catalogue of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a>, and I invited the Achaeans to board the ship, since it was large enough for all. When I awoke with a start (for a shuddering came over me), I attributed the dream to the slowness and length of the voyage, since apparitions of the dead make no impression on those who travel in haste. Because I wished to be advised about the meaning of the dream (for the wind has not yet allowed our sailing), I have disembarked here. While walking, as you know, I encountered you first, and we are now talking about <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a>. We shall also converse about the catalogue of the heroes, for you say that we shall do so, and cataloguing them on the ship would mean that those who have compiled the story about them would then embark. <br />VINEDR: My guest, you have truly arrived under the auspices of a god, and you have described the vision soundly. Let us then recount the story, lest you say that I have corrupted you by diverting you from it. [7] <br />PHOEN: You know at least what I long to learn. I need to understand this association which you have with <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a>, what he is like, and if he knows a story about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> times similar to that of the poets, or one unknown to them. What I mean by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> times is this sort of thing: the assembling of the army at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384236UAul class=place long=23.5925 lat=38.4335>Aulis</a> and the heroes, one by one, whether they were handsome, brave, and clever, as they are celebrated. After all, how could he narrate the war round about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> when he did not fight to the end, since they say that he was the first of the entire Hellenic army to die, the instant he disembarked there? <br />VINEDR: This is a foolish thing for you to say, my guest. To be cleansed of the body is the beginning of life for divine and thus blessed souls. For the gods, whose attendants they are, they then know, not by worshipping statues and conjectures, but by gaining visible association with them. And free from the body and its diseases, souls observe the affairs of mortals, both when souls are filled with prophetic skill and when the oracular power sends Bacchic frenzy upon them. </p>                        </div>

There was poetry about prophetic matters and about <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Herakles</a>, son of <a href=/people/1123 target=_blank>Alkmene</a>, recently arranged but not yet developed fully, but <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> had not yet sung.

This is the reason: Until now I have not met anyone who has seen such fabulous things, but rather one person claims to have heard it from another, that other person believes it, and a third one a poet convinces.

When I was still a child I believed such things, and my nurse cleverly amused me with these tales, singing and even weeping over some of them.

Certainly when we poured two <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> amphoras of wine into the skull, it was not filled.

Indeed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400236LPal class=place long=23.41 lat=40.06>Pallene</a>, which the poets call <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400236LPal class=place long=23.41 lat=40.06>Phlegra</a>, the earth holds many such bodies of giants encamped there, and rainstorms and earthquakes uncover many others. Not even a shepherd ventures at midday to that place of clattering phantoms which rage there. Disbelief in such things probably existed even at the time of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Herakles</a>. Hence, after he killed <a href=/people/894 target=_blank>Geryon</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Erytheia</a> and was alleged to have encountered the most enormous creature, <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Herakles</a> dedicated its bones at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a> so that his contest would not be disbelieved. <br />PHOEN: I consider you fortunate for your knowledge, vinedresser. I was ignorant of such great bones, and out of ignorance I disbelieved. But what about the stories of <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a>? It is time, I suppose, to come to those, since they are no longer unbelievable. </p>                        </div>

It was because of this they say even the preserved fish came back to life. You see how little of the sanctuary is left. But back then it was lovely and not small, as can be made out from its foundations. This statue here stood upon a ship, since its base has the shape of a prow, and a ship's captain dedicated it. Time has worn it away and, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, those who anoint it and seal their vows here have changed its shape. But this means nothing to me. For I spend time with him and see him, and no statue could be more pleasant than that man. [10] <br />PHOEN: Why don't you describe him to me and share what he looks like? <br />VINEDR: Gladly, my guest, by <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>. He is about twenty years old at most. Because he sailed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> at such a young age, he has a full, splendid beard and smells sweeter than autumn myrtles. Cheerful eyebrows frame his eyes, which gives him a pleasant, friendly manner. When he exerts himself, he looks intense and determined. But if we meet him at ease, ah, how lovely and friendly his eyes appear! He has blond hair of moderate length. It hangs a little over his forehead rather than covering it. The shape of his nose is perfect, like the statue's. His voice is more sonorous than trumpets and comes from a small mouth. It is most enjoyable to meet him naked, since he is well built and nimble, just like <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237AHms class=place long=23.72255 lat=37.97611>the herms</a> set up in race courses.

The cloak is sea-purple, of a divine luster, for the luster of purple cannot be expressed. [11] <br />PHOEN: And his passionate love for <a href=/people/2680 target=_blank>Laodameia</a> — how is it now? <br />VINEDR: He loves her, and he is loved by her, and they are disposed toward one another just like those hot from the bridal chambers. <br />PHOEN: Do you embrace him when he arrives, or does he escape you like smoke, as he does the poets? <br />VINEDR: He enjoys my embrace and allows me to kiss him and cling to his neck. <br />PHOEN: Does he come often or only once in a great while? <br />VINEDR: I think that I converse with him four or five times a month, whenever he wishes to plant some of these plants, to gather them, or to cut flowers. When someone is garlanded, he makes the flowers even sweeter, whenever he is around them. <br />PHOEN: You say the hero is cheerful and really married. <br />VINEDR: And self-controlled, my guest. For loving laughter because of his youth, he does not act with arrogance. If I chance on a rock while digging somewhere, he often takes up a hoe and assists me with difficult jobs, and if I don't know something about farming, he corrects me. Because I heard from <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> about long trees, I used to plant them by putting into the ground less of the tree than was above, and when <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> stopped me, I quoted the verses of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> to him.

Standing near me as I watered the flowers, he said, The perfume, my good friend, does not need water, presumably teaching me not to drench the flowers. <br />PHOEN: Where does he spend the rest of the time, vinedresser? <br />VINEDR: He says that sometimes he lives in <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>, other times in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393223RPht class=place long=22.5 lat=39.2>Phthia</a>, and even sometimes in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, where his companions are.

He says that <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> is celebrated in song worthily but <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> at too great a length.

He said, By being trampled upon. Faintheartedness immediately seized the athlete, as if he had been struck down by the oracle. After he first discovered the heel maneuver during a contest, he later realized that the oracle ordered him not to let go of his opponent's foot. For the one who wrestles with the heel must be trampled upon repeatedly and lie under his opponent. By doing so, the athlete gained an illustrious name for himself and was defeated by no one. Possibly you have also heard of the dexterous <a href=/people/3937 target=_blank>Ploutarkhos</a>? <br />PHOEN: I have, for in all likelihood you mean the boxer. <br />VINEDR: On his way to compete in his second Olympiad, he petitioned the hero to give him an oracular response about victory.

Nevertheless, they grudgingly crowned him for the pancratium. And <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> told him beforehand to be on his guard against this kind of envy, because he knew that Helix was a rival of choice athletes. <br />VINEDR: You have made a most excellent interpretation of the oracle, my guest. [16] <br />PHOEN: But what diseases does he heal? For you say that many pray to him. <br />VINEDR: He heals all the illnesses there are, especially consumptions, edemas, diseases of the eyes, and quartan fever. Lovers can also gain his counsel, for he sympathizes deeply with those unlucky in erotic matters, and he suggests charms and tricks with which they enchant their boy lovers. But he neither converses with adulterers nor offers them any erotic advice. He says that he dislikes them because they give love a bad name. An adulterer once arrived here with the very wife whom he was trying to seduce, and both of them wished to conspire against her husband who was present but did not yet realize the situation — for he was sleeping there at midday, but they already made their conspiracy while standing at the altar… <br />PHOEN: What did <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> do? <br />VINEDR: He egged on this <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, even though you can see that it is good-natured, to attack them from behind and bite them while they were still conspiring. When he had frustrated the conspiracy in this way, <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> stood near the husband and ordered him not to trouble himself about the adulterers, since their bites were incurable, but now at least to save himself as well as his own household.

As they stood around the tomb, they called the hero an enemy of <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hektor</a>, of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, and of the flocks. One said that <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> had been driven mad, another that he was in a warlike rage, but the most outrageous of the shepherds said, <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> stood firm no longer; up until this point he used to recite the verse against him as a coward. But shouting from his grave in a spine-tingling and shrill voice, <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> said, But I did stand firm. Then it is said that he even clashed his weapons together, as is usual in battle. There is no need to marvel at the suffering of those poor devils, if, since they were <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> and shepherds, they were panic-stricken at <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>'s attack, and some fell, others ran, and still others fled from their pastures. But it is worthwhile to admire <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>, since he killed none of them. Rather, he endured the drunkenness which possessed them, only showing that he was listening to them. I suppose, my guest, that <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hektor</a> is not acquainted with this virtue.

The statue was dedicated in admiration of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a> and accomplishes many useful things both for the general public and for individuals. Therefore they pray to <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hektor</a> and hold games in his honor. The statue becomes so heated and involved during the contest that sweat flows from it. Now an <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> youth came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a> and kept insulting <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hektor</a>, throwing in his face the draggings that <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> once afflicted upon him, <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>'s rock with which he was struck and died soon after, how he had initially fled from <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroklos</a>, and that not he, but others killed <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroklos</a>. He disputed the identity of <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hektor</a>'s statue and claimed that it was <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> on the basis of the hair, which <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> had shorn for <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroklos</a>.

Once when a ship put into harbor near the sanctuary of <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>, two of the strangers wandered in front of the tomb and began to play with gaming stones. <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> appeared and said, By the gods, get rid of this game, for it reminds me of the deeds of <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>, my close and clever companion.

Many appear sometimes one way, sometimes another, interchanging outward appearance, age, and armor. I hear, nevertheless, stories about <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>. There was a farmer in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a>, who did then what I do now. He had deep sympathy for <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>' suffering, and he used to sing a dirge for him when he visited the shore where it is said <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> was stoned by the Achaeans. And on the dust of <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>' grave he would place whatever people customarily bring to tombs. After selecting sweet grapes for him, he gathered them in a krater and said that he drank with <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> when he rested from his labors. He also had a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> that fawned slyly, while lying in wait for people. This <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> he called <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> and, in the name of <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>, this <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> was beaten, hearing in addition a thousand bad names. So it seemed good then to <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> to visit this admirer periodically and to give him something good. The farmer was, of course, at a certain grapevine, mending its joint, and <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>, standing by him, said, Do you recognize me, farmer? He answered, How would I recognize you whom I have never seen? Then do you love him whom you do not recognize? said the other. The farmer realized that it was <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>, and he reported that the hero's image was tall, beautiful, and brave, although he was not yet thirty years old. The farmer embraced him and said with a smile, I love you, <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>, because you seem to me to be the most sensible of all and the most fair champion in deeds of skill. You have endured most pitiful ordeals at the Achaeans' hands because of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>'s crafty designs against you. If <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>'s tomb had been here, I would have dug it out long ago. He is blood-stained and more evil than the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> that I keep in his honor. Let us spare <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> from now on, the hero said, because for these deeds I have exacted penalties from him in <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>. But you, since you love the grapevines, I suppose, tell me what you are especially afraid could happen to them. What else, said the farmer, than that the hailstones will blind and break them? So then, said <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>, let us fasten a leather strap to one of them, and the rest will not be hit. <br />PHOEN: The hero is ingenious, vinedresser, and always invents something good for people.

And he converses with some people, visits regularly, and hunts wild beasts. They conclude that it is <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> from the beauty of his physique as well as from the size and flash of his weapons. Behind him a windstorm whirls around, an attendant to his phantom. My guest, I shall lose my voice recounting such tales! For truly, they sing something even about <a href=/people/449 target=_blank>Antilokhos</a>, how a girl from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=person long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a>, wandering along the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262WSka class=place long=26.213 lat=39.994>Scamander</a>, came upon the phantom of <a href=/people/449 target=_blank>Antilokhos</a>: falling in love with the phantom, she clung to his tomb. They also sing of how, while young herdsmen were playing dice around the altar of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, one would have struck the other dead with a shepherd's crook, had not <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroklos</a> scared them away, saying, One shedding of blood on account of dice is enough for me. But it is possible to find out about these things from the cowherds or anyone living in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a>. Since we inhabit the banks of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>'s outlets, we are in close contact with each other, and, as you see, we have turned the sea into a river.

I believe I will seldom hear it. <br />VINEDR: Very seldom. Listen and pay attention. <br />PHOEN: Pay attention, you say? Not even the wild beasts listened as intently to <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a> when he sang as I, listening to you, prick up my ears, rouse my mind, and gather every detail into my memory. I even consider myself to be one of those encamped at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, so much have I been possessed by the demigods about whom I speak. <br />VINEDR: Therefore, since you are so minded, my guest, let us set out from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384236UAul class=place long=23.5925 lat=38.4335>Aulis</a> since it is true that they assembled there. As we embark on our story, let us make offerings to <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a>. How the Achaeans before they came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> plundered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=place long=28 lat=40>Mysia</a>, which was then ruled by <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephos</a>, and how <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephos</a>, fighting for his own people, was wounded by <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, you can also hear from poets since they have not neglected these stories. But the belief that the Achaeans, in ignorance of the land, thought they were carrying off the spoils of <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> slanders <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s account, which he sings about <a href=/people/662 target=_blank>Kalkhas</a> the prophet. If they sailed under prophetic skill and made his skill their guide, how could they have anchored there unintentionally? And how, once they had anchored, could they have been ignorant that they had not come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, although they met many cowherds there and many shepherds? For this region extends to the sea, and it is customary, I think, for those who put into port to ask the name of a foreign country. Even if they had not met any herdsmen or asked any such questions, <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> and <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaos</a> had already been to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, served as ambassadors, and knew the battlements of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a>. It seems unlikely to me, therefore, that they would have overlooked these matters and permitted the army to go quite so astray from the enemy's country. Indeed, the Achaeans plundered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=ethnic long=28 lat=40>Mysians</a> deliberately, because a report had come to them that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=ethnic long=28 lat=40>Mysians</a> fared best of those on the mainland. Moreover, they feared lest those who were dwelling in the vicinity of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a> might somehow be called over as allies in the battles. </p>                        </div>

Hence, he drew many infantry and cavalry into battle formation. He led troops from the part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=place long=28 lat=40>Mysia</a> that he controlled (he ruled, I believe, all of coastal <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=place long=28 lat=40>Mysia</a>), and fighting alongside him were those from upper <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=place long=28 lat=40>Mysia</a>, whom the poets call Abians and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> shepherds and drinkers of milk. The intention of the Achaeans became clear, as they made encircling maneuvers, and <a href=/people/760 target=_blank>Tlepolemos</a> sent a messenger to his kinsman aboard a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=demonym long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodian</a> merchant vessel.

The alliance of <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephos</a> was highly esteemed by both the multitude and the warriors. Just as the Achaeans celebrated in song the <a href=/people/1328 target=_blank>Aiakidai</a> and heroes as renowned as <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> and <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroklos</a>, so the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=ethnic long=28 lat=40>Mysians</a> sang the names of <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephos</a> and Haimos, son of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>. But the most renowned names were Heloros and <a href=/people/2954 target=_blank>Aktaios</a>, sons of the river god <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Istros</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a>. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=ethnic long=28 lat=40>Mysians</a> prevented the Achaeans from landing by shooting arrows and hurling javelins from the shore, and the Achaeans, though unyielding, were hard pressed.

Hence, they provided military expertise and strength for land forces, but when sailing they were good neither as men at arms nor as rowers. On the contrary, they ran the ships aground because of inexperience and daring, many of them were wounded by those stationed on the rocky shore, and a few died. But <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> and <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a>, fearful for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a>, leapt to the shore simultaneously, as if by mutual agreement, and drove back the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=ethnic long=28 lat=40>Mysians</a> because these two heroes appeared to be the most heavily armed and the noblest of the Hellenic force; they even seemed quite supernatural to their most barbarian opponents. But when <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephos</a> led his army into the plain and the Achaeans sailed to the shore undisturbed, all on board except for the pilot and petty officer immediately jumped out of the ships and assembled for battle while keeping their feelings and thoughts under control. <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> says that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> reported this about them correctly, since he praised the manner of Hellenic warfare, of which he says <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>, son of <a href=/people/258 target=_blank>Telamon</a>, was the advisor. For when <a href=/people/865 target=_blank>Menestheus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, the most learned tactician among the lords, came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> and taught the whole army at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384236UAul class=place long=23.5925 lat=38.4335>Aulis</a> the need for cooperation, he did not rebuke those who used the battle cry, but <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> dissented and criticized it as effeminate and undisciplined, for he said that the battle cry expresses courage poorly. <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> said that he and <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> together with <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroklos</a> were arrayed against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=ethnic long=28 lat=40>Mysians</a>, while <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a>, <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>, and <a href=/people/844 target=_blank>Sthenelos</a> faced Haimos, son of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>; the <a href=/people/1152 target=_blank>Atreidai</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386231ROpu class=demonym long=23.04 lat=38.65>Locrian</a>, and the remaining forces were drawn up against those coming from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Istros</a>. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly, he moved quickly against the sons of the river, since they did not share his heritage and were fighting from a four-horse chariot, as <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hektor</a> also fought. Walking haughtily amid the confusion of battle, <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> clanged his shield loudly in order to spook the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> immediately panicked and rose up on their hind legs, at which point the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, distrusting their chariot, leapt from it, since it was now in disarray, and fell upon <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>; although both Heloros and <a href=/people/2954 target=_blank>Aktaios</a> fought in a manner worthy of fame, they died. <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> also remembers how great the deeds of <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> were when he, <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a>, and <a href=/people/844 target=_blank>Sthenelos</a> killed Haimos and his companions. <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> did not consider himself worthy of any rewards of valor; rather he yielded them to <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a>, since he recognized that <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> had done everything for the honor and glory of battle. If the Hellenes, however, had proposed a crown for intellectual skill, <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> would not have lost it to any other man, since from the beginning he desired wisdom and trained himself in it. <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> says that he himself fought <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephos</a> and stripped him of his shield while still alive, but that <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> fell upon the unprotected man, wounding him at once in the thigh. And although later in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> he healed the wound, at that time <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephos</a> lost heart because of it and would have died if the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=ethnic long=28 lat=40>Mysians</a> had not together run to <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephos</a> and snatched him out of the battle. So many <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=ethnic long=28 lat=40>Mysians</a> are said then to have fallen for him that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389270WKai class=place long=27.011 lat=38.957>Kaikos</a> river ran red with their blood. <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> says that <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> contended with him for the shield since <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> was the one who wounded <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephos</a>. The Achaeans voted rather that the shield belonged to <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> because <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephos</a> would not have been wounded had he not been stripped of the shield. He says that even the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=demonym long=28 lat=40>Mysian</a> women fought from <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> alongside the men, just as the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a> do, and the leader of the cavalry was Hiera, wife of <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephos</a>. </p>                        </div>

Even the Achaeans are said to have been afflicted with passion for Hiera when she fell in battle, and the elders commanded the young soldiers neither to despoil Hiera nor to touch her as she lay dead.

For example, he fashioned verses more solemnly than <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>, excelled <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> in providing pleasure, and outdid other poets in other ways. He took the story of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> War as his subject, in which fate brought together the excellent deeds both of all the Hellenes and of the barbarians. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> introduced into the story battles involving men, <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and walls, rivers, as well as gods and goddesses. <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> says that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> also included all matters pertaining to peace: choral dances, songs, erotic encounters, and feasts; he touched on agricultural tasks and the appropriate seasons for performing them. He also described sea voyages, the making of arms in the <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaistos</a>, and especially men's appearances and their various characteristics. <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> says that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> accomplished all these things with divine power and that those who do not love him are mad.

Once when <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> was describing the shield of <a href=/people/853 target=_blank>Kyknos</a>, he sang about the <a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Gorgon</a>'s form carelessly and not poetically; hence, correcting him, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> sang about the <a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Gorgon</a> in this way: And upon it, the grim-looking <a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Gorgon</a> was set as a crown Glaring terribly, and about her were Fear and <a href=/people/1731 target=_blank>Terror</a>. </p>                        </div>

Moreover, when <a href=/people/3063 target=_blank>Pamphos</a> insightfully regarded <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> as the producer of all living things and the one through whom everything from the earth arises, he used this insight rather foolishly and sang despicable verses about <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> (for these are the words of <a href=/people/3063 target=_blank>Pamphos</a>: <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, most glorious, greatest of gods, enfolded in dung Of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and mule). <br /><a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> says that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, however, sang a hymn worthy of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>: <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, most glorious, greatest, enveloped by clouds, dwelling in the sky. While <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> fashions the living things under the sky, he also inhabits the most pure realm. <br />He says that, like <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> represented truly the battles between <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> and between <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> and <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a>, as well as how <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> fought with <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> and <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaistos</a> with the river.

He finds fault with the following verses of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>. First, because, after intermingling gods and mortals, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> spoke highly about mortals, but contemptibly and basely about the gods. Next, clearly knowing that <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, since she along with <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a> had been carried away by the winds, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> kept her on the wall of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a> so that she would see the sorry events on the plain.

While he celebrates in <a href=/people/1474 target=_blank>Demodokos</a>'s and Phemios's songs the destruction of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a> and the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> of <a href=/people/1809 target=_blank>Epeios</a> and <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, he discusses these apart from the story of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> and dedicates them rather to <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>.

And this, in old age, only those whom strength has not forsaken maintain. <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> says that in other respects <a href=/people/449 target=_blank>Antilokhos</a> resembled <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>, but that he was swifter, trim in physique, and paid no attention to his hair. He gave me the following details about <a href=/people/449 target=_blank>Antilokhos</a>: He was most fond of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and hunting with <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>, even using times of truce in the fighting for hunting. At any rate, <a href=/people/449 target=_blank>Antilokhos</a> frequented Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397268LIda class=place long=26.8423 lat=39.6922>Ida</a> with <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> and the <a href=/people/3641 target=_blank>Myrmidons</a>, and when he was on his own, he would hunt with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370217XNes class=ethnic long=21.695 lat=37.027>Pylians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a>, who provided a market-place for the army because of the great number of animals caught. He was noble in battle, swift-footed, quickly moving when armed, easily understood orders, and did not lose his pleasant manner even in battle. </p>                        </div>

He gave way to anger, was contemptuous of the throng of battle, was savage upon being rebuked, and was prepared for a more delicate lifestyle than was needed for a military camp. <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a>' conduct was just the opposite. He was modest upon rebuke, checked the eruption of his anger, and refused to insult the troops or to be disheartened. He himself considered it appropriate for an army to appear unwashed, and he commended sleeping in any opportune place; his provisions consisted of what was available, and he did not take pleasure in wine unless troubles came upon him. </p>                        </div>

Hence, both the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=ethnic long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbians</a> and all the rest of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390271RAio class=place long=27.1 lat=39>Aeolia</a>, as well as their <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=demonym long=27.3 lat=38>Ionian</a> neighbors, request oracles there, and the pronouncements of this oracle are even sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>. His head sang many prophecies to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> king, and it is said that from there an oracle was given to <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> the elder: What is mine, <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, is yours. <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> understood it in this way, namely, that he would occupy both <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417265ROdr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41.7>Odrysai</a> and Europe, because <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>, once he had become wise and powerful, had ruled over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417265ROdr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41.7>Odrysai</a> and over as many Hellenes as were inspired in his rites of initiation. But I think that he instructed <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> to be persuaded by his own fate, for when <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> had advanced beyond the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Istros</a> against the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetai</a> and the Issedonians (these tribes are Scythian), he died by the hand of a woman who ruled those barbarians, and this woman cut off the head of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> just as the Thracian women had done with that of <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>. This much, my guest, I have heard about this oracle from both <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=ethnic long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbians</a>.

[29] (<a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaos</a>, and <a href=/people/291 target=_blank>Idomeneus</a> 29.1 — 30.3) <br /><a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> says that <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> and <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaos</a> were alike neither in appearance nor strength. <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> was experienced in the arts of war, was inferior to none of the best in combat, and fulfilled all the duties of a king: he knew what was necessary for a ruler, was persuaded by whatever insight someone else had, and even by his very appearance was fit to lead the Hellenes.

He said that the others, who gave heed to <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, had come because of <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>, but he himself had come for the sake of Europe, since it was now necessary for the Hellenes to prevail over the barbarians.

When the Achaeans applauded these remarks (for they were won over by <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>' words), <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> stepped forward and said, <a href=/people/662 target=_blank>Kalkhas</a> will say what it is necessary to sacrifice, what to vow, and to whom, for such things require prophetic skill. What is in heaven and whatever is the improper or proper position of the stars, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> knows, by whom these have been arranged and invented. But you, <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>, will be less foolish by paying attention to the earth rather than by speculating about what is in heaven. Then <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> replied, If you were clever, <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, you would have understood that no one is able to say anything learned about the heavens unless he knows more about the earth. That you are wanting in these matters, I have no doubt, for they say that you <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383207IIth class=ethnic long=20.71 lat=38.34>Ithacans</a> have neither seasons nor land. Because of these words, <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> departed full of anger, and <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> went away to prepare himself against one who had already slandered him. Once when the Achaeans were in their assembly, cranes happened to fly by in their usual manner, and <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, looking at <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>, said, The cranes bear witness to the Achaeans that the cranes themselves have discovered the letters of the alphabet, not you. </p>                        </div>

Long ago, while lying in the house of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, these letters needed such a man, and the gods reveal such letters through learned men. The cranes, then, do not lay claim to the letters, but fly, commending their orderly arrangement. They travel to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> in order to engage in war on small humans. But you, now, should not be talking about order, for you are disorderly in battles. I think this is the reason for <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>'s charge, my guest: <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> held that if he ever saw <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hektor</a>, <a href=/people/1279 target=_blank>Sarpedon</a>, or <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, he would abandon his post and change his position to the easy places in the battle. In the opinion of the assembly he was youthful, and although older he was bested by the young <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>, and he used <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> as his bulwark against him while he made the Achaeans opposed to <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>. He says that once more they were brought through troubles by <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>. When <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a> descended from Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397268LIda class=place long=26.8423 lat=39.6922>Ida</a>, they devoured the young pack animals and the yoked animals round about the tents. <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> then ordered men fitted with bows and arrows and javelins to go to Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397268LIda class=place long=26.8423 lat=39.6922>Ida</a> against the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a>.

Let us pray therefore to both <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> <a href=/people/1750 target=_blank>Lykios</a> and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> Phyxios, to kill these beasts with his own arrows, </p>                        </div>

And let us, men of Hellas, take care of ourselves. To guard against the plague we must have a light diet and vigorous exercise, but all things can be achieved by cleverness. Saying this, he halted the supply of meat and ordered the army to avoid grain; instead he sustained the army on sweetmeats and wild herbs, and they trusted him and believed everything from <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> to be both divine and oracular. For indeed the plague that he foretold did strike the cities of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>, beginning, they say, from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>, and it even fell upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a>, but it touched none of the Hellenes although they were encamped in the diseased land. Thus he instructed them in their diet and exercises. After launching one hundred ships, he put the army on board in turns, rowing and competing with one another either to surround the promontory, or to touch the headland, or to run before their neighbors into some harbor or shoreline, and he persuaded <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> to offer them prizes for fast sailing. They exercised gladly then and with an understanding of health, for truly he taught them that, since the land was spoiled and was in such a state, the sea was more pleasant and safer to breathe. In addition to these things, <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> was crowned with rewards for his wisdom by the Hellenes but <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> planned to act dishonorably, and whatever villainy he had he turned against <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>. In addition to these stories, <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> reports the following: <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, who was fighting against the islands and the coastal cities, asked the Achaeans to fight along with <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>. </p>                        </div>

His fighting spirit rose up and led him away from his post in battle, where he rejoiced at <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> who was fighting alongside him; <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>, carrying him out of the rush of battle, enjoined him how one ought to fight.

Then, after saying farewell to one another, they sailed away, and both the <a href=/people/3641 target=_blank>Myrmidons</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393228PPhy class=place long=22.799 lat=39.321>Phylake</a> followed them.

Indeed, the cities were being captured and glorious deeds of <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> were reported: digging of canals through narrow passages of land, rivers diverted into the cities, pilings for harbors, forts, and a battle by night around <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264PAby class=place long=26.4091 lat=40.1951>Abydos</a>. In this battle, when they were wounded, <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> retreated but <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> did not give up, and before the middle of the night came, he conquered the place. <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, however, was composing reports to <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, reports that were false, but convincing to whoever foolishly listened, to the effect that <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> lusted after dominion over the Hellenes and that he was using <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> as a go-between. <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> said to <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, They will arrive in a little while, paying you <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and captives, but keeping for themselves money with which they will doubtless seduce powerful Hellenes against you. Thus, it is necessary to keep away from <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, to be on guard against those who know him, and to kill this schemer <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>.

Since these things seemed to have been cleverly contrived, and since <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> agreed with the plot, <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> said, Come, King, keep <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> for me around the cities where he is now, but summon <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> here on the pretense that he is going to lay siege to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a> and invent engines of war.

I believe the <a href=/people/1328 target=_blank>Aiakidai</a>, both the son of <a href=/people/552 target=_blank>Kapaneus</a> and the son of <a href=/people/183 target=_blank>Tydeus</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386231ROpu class=ethnic long=23.04 lat=38.65>Locrians</a>, and, of course, <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroklos</a> and <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> are excellent fighting machines.

But the wiles of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, which were already cleverly devised, had anticipated him. He was reputed to give in to gold and was falsely accused of being a traitor, and so with his hands twisted around behind his back, he was stoned to death, with both <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=ethnic long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383207IIth class=ethnic long=20.71 lat=38.34>Ithacans</a> throwing stones at him. The rest of Hellas had not seen these events, but were pleased with them too even though they seemed to be unjust. The proclamation against him was savage: neither to bury <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> nor to satisfy divine law by throwing earth, but rather to kill the one who took him up for burial and performed funeral rites. After <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> had announced these things, the greater <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> cast himself on the corpse and shed many tears over it. Placing <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> upon himself, he burst through the crowd with his unsheathed and ready sword. Then, after performing funeral rites for him who had been denied them, as was appropriate, he did not approach the assembly of the Hellenes or participate in their council or purpose, and he did not join in the battles. When <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> arrived, after the capture of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403265LChe class=place long=26.5 lat=40.3333>Chersonesus</a>, both were enraged over the affair of <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>. <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> was not enraged for long, for when he perceived that his allies were faring badly, he grieved and then changed his disposition. <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, however, prolonged his wrath; he created a song for the lyre called the <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> and praised him in song just as much as he did the earlier heroes. He begged for a vision to come to him in his sleep, by pouring out a libation for dreams from a krater out of which <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> drinks. Not only to <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, but also to all who possessed love of strength and wisdom, this hero seemed to show himself worthy of emulation and song. Whenever we return to the remembrance of him, <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> sheds floods of tears, praising the uncommon courage of the hero even in death. Indeed, he reports that <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> did not make supplication, either saying anything pitiable or lamenting, but after he had said, I have pity on you, <a href=/people/819 target=_blank>Truth</a>, for you have perished before me, he held out his head to the stones as though knowing that <a href=/people/194 target=_blank>Justice</a> would be in his favor. </p>                        </div>

After killing an enemy, <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> kept his hands off the weapons because killing is for a courageous man, but stripping a slain enemy of his arms is more for a clothes-stealer. No one would have uttered anything undisciplined or offensive within <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>'s hearing, nor how much they were in disagreement with one another. Instead they rose from their seats out of respect for him and withdrew from his path. Not only did the hoi polloi do so, but even those whose lot in life was highly esteemed. He had a friendship with <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, and they neither wished to malign each other nor did they stick close together. As for <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>' sorrows, even if they did not arise on account of trivial matters, he calmed them all, some as if he were a fellow sufferer, others as if he were reproving. Hellas used to pay attention to <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> and <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> when they were sitting or walking together, seeing in these men such as had not been since <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Herakles</a>.

An <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> came to him as he prayed, bearing a name from <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> for the child and giving approval to his prayers. It was absolutely clear to anyone who saw him that he did not grow up without divine aid because of the beauty and strength of his physique. Hence, <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> calls him the very picture of war.

About the things that took place in <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a> — I wish I had not been the victor in such a contest; For the earth has covered such a head for the sake of this armor — he denies that this was said by <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> there (according to <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a>, <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> did not descend to <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a> while still alive), but says that it was certainly said somewhere.

In truth, <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hektor</a> thought that to have long hair, even though it is treated with respect by princes and the children of princes, was despicable for himself because of that man. His ears were damaged, not by wrestling (for this sport, as I said, neither he nor the barbarians knew), but he fought against <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> and considered engagement with such beasts warlike. These activities also are a part of wrestling, but when he did them, he was ignorant of this sport, and for military exercise he practiced submitting to bellowing <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>, having no fear of the points of their horns, taming a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> by forcing back its neck, and not giving up, even though he was wounded by it.

He did not adorn his hair, nor was he enslaved to it. Instead, he made virtue alone his adornment, and he looked at things so vehemently that even his glance itself was sufficient against the unruly.

Although <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaukos</a>, of the two, was famed for being a man at arms, <a href=/people/1635 target=_blank>Pandaros</a> claimed that when <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=person long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycian</a> <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> stood near him while still in his youth, they joined together in archery, and thus he always prayed to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> whenever he grasped his bow for a great cause. <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> says that with the whole army the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> met <a href=/people/1279 target=_blank>Sarpedon</a>'s arrival, since besides his strength and his appearance, which was both divine and noble, he attached himself to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> and to the story of their lineage. </p>                        </div>

He could fight in all ways and, as far as knowledge of bows is concerned, he did not fall short of <a href=/people/1635 target=_blank>Pandaros</a>. <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> says that at eighteen he also sailed to Hellas, when he was a guest of <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaos</a> and seized <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> because of her beauty, and that he was not yet thirty years old when he died. He delighted in his own beauty and was not only admired by others, but also admired himself. For this reason the hero makes sport of him most elegantly: Once when he saw this <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peacock</a> (<a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> enjoys the brilliance and beauty of this bird) strutting, spreading out its wings, admiring and preening them — that they might appear arranged like necklaces of precious stones — he said, Behold, <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a>, son of <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>, whom we were mentioning just now! And when I asked him, How does the <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peacock</a> resemble <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a>.

For truly, you have so disposed me even toward <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s poems that, although I thought they seemed divine and beyond the capability of a mortal, I am now amazed more not only at the epic poetry, even if some pleasure pervades <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s poems, but to a much greater degree at the names of the heroes and their lineages, and, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, how each of them obtained the lot of killing a certain person or of dying at the hand of another. For I do not think it amazing that <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> knows these things, since he is now a daimon, but from where does knowledge of <a href=/people/1131 target=_blank>Euphorbus</a> come to <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, and of such men as <a href=/people/515 target=_blank>Helenos</a> and <a href=/people/892 target=_blank>Deiphobos</a>, and, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, of the many men of the opposing army whom he mentions in the catalogue? <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> testifies that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> did not invent these things, but that he made a narrative of deeds that had happened and were genuine, except for a few of them, which he rather seems to transform purposefully so that his poetry appears elaborate and more pleasurable. Hence, that which is said by some, that <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, after composing these poems signed the name <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> to the work, seems to me to be greatly confirmed, since knowing these stories is more fitting for a god than for a mortal. <br />VINEDR: That the gods are guides to the poets of every song, my guest, the poets themselves, I suppose, confess: some invoke <a href=/people/736 target=_blank>Calliope</a> to be present in their story, others all the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, and still others <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> in addition to the nine <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s poems were not uttered without the aid of a god, but surely they were not sung by <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> or the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> themselves. </p>                        </div>

The former sang the seven epics about the two <a href=/people/3322 target=_blank>Ajaxes</a>, how their ranks of battle were joined closely together and strong, and the latter sang songs about the affairs of his own brother, <a href=/people/1897 target=_blank>Perses</a>, songs in which he urges <a href=/people/1897 target=_blank>Perses</a> to engage in work and to devote himself to farming, so that he will not beg from others or go hungry. The following events of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s time, my guest, are quite true since <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> agrees with them. Once, at any rate, after two poets had recited a song in praise of him here and had gone away, the hero came and asked me for which one of them I would cast my vote. When I praised the simpler one (for he happened to have won the contest by far), <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> laughed and said, Panides too had the same experience as you did, vinedresser.

So then, my guest, the poet <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> existed, and these are the poems of a mortal.

He also learned these things in another manner as well, a manner both supernatural and requiring the utmost skill.

I have heard the following about him. An apparition of a daimon of the sea used to visit <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a>. Because she loved him, the daimon had intercourse with <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a>, although out of shame for the crowd she did not yet speak about herself, not even from where she came. When the sea was calm, she happened to be frolicking seated upon <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphins</a> and sea <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, while he, looking at these things from the summit of Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394230LPel class=place long=23.046 lat=39.437>Pelion</a>, became aware of the goddess and feared her approach.

When <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> was born, they made <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Kheiron</a> his foster-father. He fed him honeycombs and the marrow of fawns. When <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> reached the age at which children need wagons and knucklebones, he did not prohibit such games, but accustomed him to small javelins, darts, and race courses. <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> also had a small ashen spear hewn by <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Kheiron</a>, and he seemed to babble about military affairs. When he became an ephebe, a brightness radiated from his face, and his body was beyond natural size, since he grew more easily than do trees near springs. He was celebrated much at symposia and much in serious endeavors. When he appeared to yield to anger, <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Kheiron</a> taught him music. <a href=/people/1268 target=_blank>Music</a> was enough to tame the readiness and rising of his disposition. Without exertion, he thoroughly learned the musical modes, and he sang to the accompaniment of a lyre. He used to sing of the ancient comrades, <a href=/people/2564 target=_blank>Hyacinthus</a> and <a href=/people/10943 target=_blank>Narcissus</a>, and something about <a href=/people/430 target=_blank>Adonis</a>.

I also heard the following things: that he sacrificed to <a href=/people/736 target=_blank>Calliope</a> asking for musical skill and mastery of poetic composition, and that the goddess appeared to him in his sleep and said, Child, I give you enough musical and poetic skill that you might make banquets more pleasant and lay sufferings to rest.

I also asked <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> about the ashen spear — what its wonder was — and he says that the length of this spear was unlike that of any other, that the wooden shaft was straight and strengthened to such an extent that it could not be broken. The point of the spear was of unbreakable metal and could penetrate anything, and the spike on the other end of the shaft had been dipped in mountain copper, so that the whole spear would strike blazing like lightning.

He says that <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroklos</a> died in his own armor while distinguishing himself in battle and just grasping the wall, and the armor of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> remained inviolable and unassailable. </p>                        </div>

Protosilaos says that the armor was fashioned without distinguishing marks and discreetly, and that a variety of material was blended together on it which changed sometimes into one sheen, sometimes into another, like a rainbow. For this reason, the armor is celebrated in song as seeming to be beyond the skill even of <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaistos</a>. [48] <br />PHOEN: Will you portray <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, vinedresser, and describe him from his appearance? <br />VINEDR: Why shouldn't I, since I have met you who are so fond of listening? <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> says that <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>' hair is thick, lovelier than gold, and becoming no matter where and how either the wind or he himself may move it. His nose is not quite aquiline, but almost so; his brow is crescent-shaped. The spirit in his eyes, which are bluish-gray, casts off a certain eagerness even when he is still; when he is rushing on, they spring out along with his purpose, and then he seems more lovely than ever to those who cherish him. The Achaeans were affected by him as by strong <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a>. For although we greet <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> at rest, we are even more pleased with them whenever, after beginning to be filled with anger, they rush headlong at a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>, a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>, or one of the bellicose beasts. <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> says <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>' courage is evident even from his neck, since it is straight and erect. By nature and through association with <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Kheiron</a>, he became the most just of the heroes. I tell you, being filled with suspicion about possessions accompanied <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> from then on. For he was so set against them that, from the twenty-three cities that he himself captured, although he took the most prisoners of war, he was able to resist all of them except for a maiden, whom he did not even give to himself, but asked the Achaeans for her. When <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a> charged the Achaeans with injustice unless <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> should receive the most possessions, <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> said, Let the greater part of the deed be mine, and let whoever wishes be greedy for possessions. </p>                        </div>

He says that neither against <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, although he was so great, would the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262WSka class=place long=26.213 lat=39.994>Scamander</a> have been at a loss and weaker than the mighty rivers in this encounter, nor would <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> have rushed headlong against the river. For even if it had roared violently against him, he would have avoided it by turning away and not moving close to the water. <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a>, I believe, recounts those events more plausibly than <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>. He says that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> were driven together into the river, and more of them perished than had in the entire war; surely these deeds were not done by <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> alone, but since the Hellenes had already been made confident by his presence, they went down against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> and slaughtered them in the river. He says that <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> was heedless of these things, but contended for a prize in the following contest. There was a man who had come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415220RPai class=place long=22.01 lat=41.5>Paionia</a>, whom <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> also remembered.

Although the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415220RPai class=person long=22.01 lat=41.5>Paionian</a> was the mightiest of both the Achaeans and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> and rushed into the spears like a wild beast, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> disregarded this story. Having just arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, he led a fresh force, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415220RPai class=demonym long=22.01 lat=41.5>Paionian</a> horsemen, whom <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> repulsed by frightening them; they thought that a daimon had fallen upon them because they had not yet encountered such a man. When <a href=/people/1935 target=_blank>Asteropaios</a> alone stood his ground, <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> feared for himself more than when he fought with <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hektor</a>, and he did not go unwounded when he killed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415220RPai class=demonym long=22.01 lat=41.5>Paionian</a>. For this reason, when the allies forbade him to fight with <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hektor</a> on that day, he did not endure these words, but as he said, Let him see that I am even mightier than my wounds, he rushed headlong against <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hektor</a> who was stationed before the wall.

It is especially necessary to know what <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> is reported to have said to Telamonian <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> about his friends, for afterwards, when <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> asked him what sort of deeds were most dangerous to him, <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> said, Those on behalf of friends. Again, when asked what sort were both sweeter and less troublesome, he gave the same answer. When <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> wondered how the same deed might be both difficult and easy, he said, Because when on behalf of friends I readily take risks that are great, I cease from grieving for them. But what sort of wound hurt you the most, <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>? <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> asked. The wound that I received from <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hektor</a>. And yet surely you were not wounded by him, said <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>. By <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, he wounded my head and my hands, said <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, for I consider you my own head, and <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroklos</a> was my hands.

He said that <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroklos</a> rejoiced whenever <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> also rejoiced, was distressed in the same manner, was always giving some advice when he sang. <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> says that even his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> carried <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroklos</a> safe and sound, just as they did <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>. In size and bravery he was between the two <a href=/people/3322 target=_blank>Ajaxes</a>. He fell short of the son of <a href=/people/258 target=_blank>Telamon</a> in all things, but he surpassed both the size and bravery of the son of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386231ROpu class=place long=23.04 lat=38.65>Locris</a>. <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroklos</a> had an olive complexion, black eyes, and sufficiently fine eyebrows, and he commended moderately long hair.

He reports, however, that when <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> was in the bloom of youth, Thessaly, because it was both famed for its <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and noble, with some divine help nurtured two <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, one white and one chestnut, marvelous in their speed and magnificent in their disposition. And because everyone believed what was spoken by divine providence about <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, it immediately seemed that the nature of the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> was divine and appeared to surpass the mortal. [51] <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>' life came to an end, which <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> also knows. He says that <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> died at the hands of both <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a> and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, knowing, I suppose, what happened in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399263SThy class=place long=26.29 lat=39.89>Thymbraion</a>, and how <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> fell, murdered treacherously while engaged in sacrifices and sacred oaths, of which he made <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> a witness. The sacrifice of <a href=/people/10611 target=_blank>Polyxena</a> on his tomb and <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>' passion for her, which you hear from the poets, happened like this: <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> loved <a href=/people/10611 target=_blank>Polyxena</a> and was negotiating this marriage for himself with the understanding that he would make the Achaeans withdraw from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a>. <a href=/people/10611 target=_blank>Polyxena</a> also loved <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>; they had seen one another during the ransom negotiations for <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hektor</a>. For when <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> came to <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, he made his own child lead him by the hand, since she was the youngest of those <a href=/people/2138 target=_blank>Hekabe</a> had borne for him. (Younger children always used to assist their fathers' step.) And thus <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> so displayed a certain self-control by his sense of justice, even in his amorous desires, that he did not abduct the girl, even though she was under his power, but promised <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> a marriage with her and trusted him when he delayed the wedding. After he died unarmed, uttering oaths about these matters, <a href=/people/10611 target=_blank>Polyxena</a>, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> women were fleeing from the sanctuary and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> men were scattered (they did not even carry away <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>' corpse without fear), is said to have deserted </p>                        </div>

But when <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>' body had already been buried for three days, she ran to the tomb at night and leaned upon a sword while speaking many words of pity and marriage. At this time she also asked <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> to remain her lover and to take her in marriage lest their marriage be proved false. <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> says that what is said by <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> in the second Weighing of Souls, if indeed those verses are by <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, that after <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> died the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> lamented him with songs and the <a href=/people/590 target=_blank>Nereids</a> by beating their breasts, is not too big a boast. <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a> says that the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> neither arrived nor sang, nor did any <a href=/people/590 target=_blank>Nereids</a> appear to the army, although they were known to have come, but that other wondrous events took place and they were not very different from those reported by <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>.

When the sea came closer and dashed against the camp, a piercing and incessant lament resounded like that which a throng of women utter in mourning. Because this event seemed godlike and supernatural, and because all agreed that the wave carried the <a href=/people/590 target=_blank>Nereids</a> (for it did not flood the land, but came to rest upon the earth gently and smoothly), the subsequent events seemed far more divine. For when darkness followed next, <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a>'s lamentation went through the army, as she shrieked and cried aloud for her son. She made a {greatly} piercing and ringing shout exactly like an echo in the mountains, and then the Achaeans especially understood that <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a> bore <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, although they did not believe otherwise.

After they have put into harbor and welcomed the land, they go to the sanctuary to pray to <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> and offer sacrifices. The sacred victim of its own will stands near the altar opposite the ship and the sailors. My guest, the story concerning the golden pitcher that once appeared in the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a> has been told by skilled men, and what might someone grasp anew of tales told plainly? <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> himself is said to have appeared to a merchant who once visited the island often, related what took place in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, entertained him with drink as well, and ordered him after sailing to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a> to bring him a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> maiden, </p>                        </div>

When the guest was astonished at the command and because of his new-found boldness asked <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> why he needed a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> slave, <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> said, Because, my guest, she was born of the lineage from which <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hektor</a> and those living before him came and is what remains of the blood of the descendants of <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401264UDar class=place long=26.3725 lat=40.086>Dardanos</a>. Of course, the merchant thought that <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> was in love, and after he bought the maiden, he sailed back to the island. When he came, <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> praised the merchant and ordered him to guard the maiden for him on the ship, because, I suppose, the island was inaccessible for women. He ordered the merchant to come to the sanctuary at evening and to be entertained sumptuously with him and <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>. When he arrived <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> gave him many things that merchants are unable to resist; he said that he considered him a guest-friend and granted him lucrative trade and safe passage for his ship. When day came, he said, Sail away with these things, but leave the girl on the shore for me. They had not yet gone a stade away from the land when the girl's wailing struck them, because <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> was pulling her apart and tearing her limb from limb. In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, however, <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> did not kill the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a>, whom some of the poets say came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> to fight <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>. I do not know how it is plausible that, after <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> had fought against them on the side of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a> during the reign of <a href=/people/3898 target=_blank>Mygdon</a>, the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a> later would have come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a> as allies.

For them a troop of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> enough for the army is tended in marshy meadows. They do not permit men to live in their own country, but, whenever they need children, they go down to the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416359WHal class=place long=35.883 lat=41.569>Halys</a> to do business in the marketplace and to have intercourse with men in any old place. After they return to their haunts and homes, they carry to the borders of the country whatever male children they bear so that those who have begotten them can claim them; those men claim whatever child each happens to find and make them slaves. But the females to whom they give birth they are said to love immediately, to regard as belonging to their own race, and to care for them as is the nature of mothers, except for withholding their milk. They do this because of their battles, so that the children do not become effeminate and their breasts do not hang down. Let us believe that the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a>' name comes from not being reared at the breast. They nurse the infants with the milk of grazing <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and with honeycombs full of the dew that settles on the reeds of the river like honey. </p>                        </div>

Rather, let their deed concerning the island be told, what sort of thing was done by them, and to what end it was accomplished, since this is part of <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaos</a>'s accounts. When ships were once more numerous, some sailors and shipbuilders, from among those people who brought merchandise to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a> from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>, were carried off course down toward the left shore of the sea, round about which the women are said to live. After they were captured by the women, for a period of time they were kept locked up, being fed at mangers, so that the women, taking them across the river, could sell them to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> cannibals. But when one of the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a> took pity on a lad who had been captured along with them because of his youth, and when some erotic attraction resulted, she asked the chief <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazon</a>, who was her sister, not to sell the strangers. After the men were released and had formed close friendships with the women, they now began to speak in their idiom. While they were recounting their tale about the winter storm and their experiences on the sea, they passed on to their recollection of the sanctuary, since they had sailed to the island not long before, and they told about the wealth in it. Since the strangers were both sailors and shipbuilders, and since that area was also suitable to them for shipbuilding, the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a> who had come upon them had them make a ship for transporting <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> in the hope that they would possess <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> along with his mares (for once the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a> dismount from their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, they are female in gender and women in every respect). Indeed, first the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a> engaged in rowing and practiced sailing, and so they gathered knowledge of sailing. Getting underway from the outlets of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412369WThe class=place long=36.942 lat=41.194>Thermodon</a> at about springtime, they went forth on fifty ships, I think, to the sanctuary, about two thousand stades away. When they anchored at the island, they first ordered their Hellespontian guests to cut down the trees with which the sanctuary was adorned round about. But when their axes, driven back against them, went into the head of some, into the neck of others, and all fell near the trees, the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a> streamed to the sanctuary, crying aloud and driving on their mares. And <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, on seeing the heat and terror in them and leaping as he had at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262WSka class=place long=26.213 lat=39.994>Scamander</a> and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a>, </p>                        </div>

The <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> took on the habits of wild beasts, and as they fell upon the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a>, who lay on the ground, the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> thrust their hooves, bristled their manes, and pricked up their ears against them, just like savage <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a>. They ate the naked forearms of the supine women, and after they had broken open their chests, they devoted themselves to the entrails and gulped them down. Stuffed with human flesh, they stamped around the island and raged, sated with gore. Then, standing on the promontories and seeing the wide surface of the sea, they thought that they had encountered a wide plain and hurled themselves down toward the sea. The <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a>' ships also perished, when a violent wind blew upon them; because they lay at anchor empty and in disarray, they struck against one another and were dashed into pieces, I suppose. Ship sank ship and broke up just as in a naval battle, and just as many rammings of ship against ship, both athwart and prow-to-prow, as helmsmen make while fighting at sea, these all fell upon the ships, which were empty and floating without direction. Because many pieces of wreckage were carried back to the sanctuary and because humans were lying in it still breathing and half-eaten — both scattered human limbs and the pieces of flesh that the mares had spat upon — <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> easily purified the island, for by drawing in a wave of the sea he both washed these things clean and rinsed them.

But after you have filled us with heroic stories, I would no longer ask how he himself returned to life, since you say that he treats that story as inviolable and secret. On those who dwell by the Kokytos and the <a href=/people/2659 target=_blank>Pyriphlegethon</a>, and about the Akherousias, and such names of rivers and seas, and, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, the <a href=/people/1328 target=_blank>Aiakidai</a> and their courts of justice and places of punishments, you yourself will perhaps report and he will agree to set forth the details. <br />VINEDR: He agrees, but it is already evening and the herds must go to their rest.
