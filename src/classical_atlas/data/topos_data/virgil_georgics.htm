The great Father himself willed it, <br />that the ways of farming should not be easy, and first <br />stirred the fields with skill, rousing men’s minds to care, <br />not letting his regions drowse in heavy lethargy. <br />Before <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>’s time no farmers worked the land: <br />it was wrong to even mark the fields or divide them <br />with boundaries: men foraged in common, and the earth <br />herself gave everything more freely, unasked. <br />He added the deadly venom to shadowy <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a>, <br />made the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a> predators, and stirred the seas, <br />shook honey from the trees, concealed fire, <br />and curbed the wine that ran everywhere in streams, <br />so that thoughtful practice might develop various skills, <br />little by little, and search out shoots of grain in the furrows, <br />and strike hidden fire from veins of flint. <br />Then, rivers knew the hollowed alder-boat: <br />then, sailors told and named the constellations, <br />the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a>, the <a href=/people/1564 target=_blank>Hyades</a>, and <a href=/people/717 target=_blank>Lycaon</a>’s gleaming Bears: <br />then men learned to snare game in nets, deceive <br />with birdlime, and surround great glades with <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>: <br />Now one strikes into a broad river, seeking the depths, <br />while another drags his dripping net through the sea: <br />then came rigid iron and the melodious saw-blade <br />(since the first men split the fissile wood with wedges), <br />then came the various arts. Hard labour conquered all, <br />and poverty’s oppression in harsh times. <br /><a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a> first taught men to plough the earth with iron, <br />when the oaks and strawberry-trees of the sacred grove <br />failed, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395208SDod class=place long=20.7878 lat=39.5464>Dodona</a> denied them food. <br />Soon the crops began to suffer and the stalks <br />were badly blighted, and useless thistles flourish in the fields: <br />the harvest is lost and a savage growth springs up, <br />goose-grass and star-thistles, and, amongst the bright corn, <br />wretched darnel and barren oats proliferate. <br />So that unless you continually attack weeds with your hoe, <br />and scare the birds with noise, and cut back the shade <br />from the dark soil with your knife, and call up rain <br />with prayers, alas, you’ll view others’ vast hayricks in vain, <br />and stave off hunger in the woods, shaking the oak-branches. </p>                        </div>

Fields with soils <br />that crumble are best: the wind and cold frost <br />take care of that, and the digger who moves and shakes the land. <br />But if these men are to let nothing escape them, <br />they first identify similar plots, where the vines can be prepared, early, for their supporting trees, or where they can be taken later, <br />and planted out, so they don’t suddenly reject the change of soil. <br />They even print on the bark the region of the sky each one faced, <br />so they can identically align the side that withstood <br />the southern heat, and that which was turned to the northern pole: <br />we grow accustomed to so much in tender years. <br />Consider first whether it’s better to plant the vines on the slopes <br />or on the level. If you’re laying out fertile fields on the plain, <br />plant close: <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a> is no more sluggish in close-planted soil: <br />but if the soil rises in mounds and sloping hills, give the rows room: <br />and again, when the vines are set, let all the paths <br />be squared off neatly with a clear-cut boundary. <br />As in great battles often, when the legion deploys its cohorts <br />in a long line, and the column holds the open ground, <br />the troops ranked deep, and the whole plain far and wide <br />heaves with shining bronze, the grim conflict not yet joined, <br />but <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> wanders uncertainly between the troops: <br />so let all your paths be laid out equal in size: <br />not just so that the view might nourish idle thought, <br />but because only like this will the earth grant equal vigour <br />to all, and the stems be able to extend into free air. <br />Perhaps you’ll also ask what depth the trenches should be. <br />I’d even trust a vine to a shallow furrow. <br />But sink the tree deep in the earth, <br />the oak above all, which stretches its crown to the air of heaven, <br />as far as it stretches its roots down to <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a>. <br />So that no storms, or gales, or rains uproot it: <br />it remains untouched, and, enduring, it outlasts <br />many generations and centuries of men as they roll by. <br />It extends strong trunks and branches to either side, <br />and itself, in the middle, casts a vast shadow. <br />Don’t let your vineyard slope towards the setting sun, <br />and don’t plant hazel among the vines, or attack <br />the top shoots, or take cuttings from the tip <br />(they prefer the ground so much) or damage young plants <br />with a blunt knife, or graft into trunks of wild olive. <br />Since often fire’s left behind by a careless shepherd, <br />fire that lurking, hidden under the rich bark, <br />seizes the trunk and climbing to the high foliage <br />sends a great roaring to the sky: then following <br />the branches and tall crowns, rules supreme, <br />engulfing the whole grove in flames, and throwing up <br />dark clouds of thick pitch-black smoke, <br />especially if a gale from above has descended on the woods, <br />and a following wind intensifies the burning. <br />When this happens the tree stumps are worthless, <br />and can’t survive being cut back, or resurrect <br />their previous greenness from the depths of the earth: <br />only the wretched bitter-leaved oleaster remains. <br />And don’t let anyone be so wise as to convince you <br />to turn the solid earth when a North wind’s blowing. <br />Since winter grips the soil with frost and won’t let a shoot <br />that’s planted then fix its frozen roots in the ground. <br />The optimum season for planting vines is when the stork <br />that enemy of long <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a>, arrives, in the first blush of spring, <br />or in autumn’s first chill before the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> of the swift sun <br />touch winter, when summer is on the wane. <br />Spring benefits the leaves of the groves and woods, <br />in Spring soil swells and demands life-bringing seed. <br />Then <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a>, the omnipotent father, descends as fertile rain, <br />into the lap of his joyful consort, and joining his power <br />to her vast body nourishes all growth. <br />Then the wild thickets echo to the songs of birds, <br />and in the settled days the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> renew their loves: <br />the kindly earth gives birth, and the fields open their hearts, <br />in the warm West winds: gentle moisture flows everywhere, <br />and the grasses safely dare to trust to the new sun. <br />the vine-shoots don’t fear a rising Southerly, <br />or rain driven through the sky, by great Northerly gales, <br />but put out their buds, and unfold all their leaves. <br />I can believe such days shone at the first dawn <br />of the nascent world, and took such temperate course. <br />That was true Spring, the great world passed its Spring, <br />and the Easterlies spared their wintry gales, <br />when the first <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> drank in the dawn, <br />and the iron race of men lifted their heads from the hard ground, <br />and wild creatures were freed in the woods, and stars in the sky. <br />And tender things could not endure their labour, <br />if this respite did not come between the cold and the heat, <br />and heaven’s gentleness welcome the earth. <br />What’s more, whatever cuttings you push into the earth, <br />sprinkle them with manure, and don’t forget to bury them with soil, <br />and dig in porous stones or rough shell: <br />then the water will slip between, and the fine air steal in, <br />and the sown plants will breathe. And some have been known <br />to cover them with stones, and large heavy tiles: <br />defending them against driving showers, and when the Dog-Star brings its heat, splitting the cracked fields with thirst. </p>                        </div>

The farmer’s work returns, driven <br />in a cycle, and the year revolves on itself over its own track. <br />And once the vineyard has shed its autumn leaves, <br />and the cold North wind has shaken the glory from the woods, <br />the keen farmer already gives thought to the coming year, <br />and attacks the vines he left, trimming them with <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a>’s <br />curved blade, and shaping them by pruning. <br />Be first to dig the ground, first to carry the off-cuts away <br />and burn them, and first to put the stakes away under cover: <br />be the last to harvest. Twice, leaf shadow thickens on the vines, <br />twice, weeds and briars cover the vineyard: either labour <br />is heavy: praise the large estates but farm a small one. <br />Also rough shoots of broom must be cut, in the woods, <br />and reeds from the river, along the banks, <br />and you’re kept busy tending the beds of wild willows. <br />Now the vines are tied, now they’re free of the pruning knife, <br />now the last vine-dresser sings of his finished rows: <br />still you must stir the soil, and trouble the dust, <br />and be fearful of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>’s rain on your ripening grapes. </p>                        </div>

The best-shaped <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a><br />is fierce, her head ugly, with plenty of neck, <br />and dewlaps hanging down from chin to leg: <br />then there’s no end to her long flanks: all’s large, <br />even the feet: and there are shaggy ears under crooked horns. <br />One marked with blotches, and whiteness, wouldn’t displease me, <br />shirking the yoke, and also fierce with her horns, <br />and more like a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> in looks, tall overall, <br />sweeping her hoof prints with the tip of her tail as she walks. <br />The age for bearing, and regular breeding, <br />starts after the fourth, and ends before the tenth year: else, <br />they’re not fit for breeding, or strong enough for the plough. <br />Let loose the males, then, while fertile youth remains in the herd: <br />send your <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> to mate first, and produce generation <br />after generation of offspring, through breeding. <br />The best day’s of life are always the first to vanish, <br />for mortal beings: disease and old age creep on, and suffering, <br />and the harshness of cruel death snatches us away. <br />There’ll always be some <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> whose form you want to alter: <br />always refresh the stock, and lest you look for what’s already lost, <br />anticipate, and each year sort the offspring from the herd. <br />The same selection is needed for <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> as for <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>. <br />Only spend special effort, from their earliest age, <br />on those you decide to rear for the good of the breed. <br />The foal from a noble line always steps higher <br />over the ground, and brings his hooves down more gently: <br />he dares to lead the way, and attempt menacing rivers, <br />and commit himself to the unknown bridge, <br />and not start at idle noise. He has a long neck, <br />a graceful head, a short belly and solid back, <br />and his spirited chest is muscular. Chestnuts and greys <br />are handsome, the least desirable are white, and dun. <br />Again if distant battle sounds he can’t stand still, <br />he pricks up his ears, and trembles in his limbs, <br />and snorts the gathered heat from his nostrils. <br />His mane is dense, tossed back to fall on his right shoulder: <br />a double ridge runs along his thighs, his hoof scrapes <br />the ground, and rings deeply with the solid horn. <br />Such was <a href=/people/4501 target=_blank>Cyllarus</a>, tamed by the reins of <a href=/people/327 target=_blank>Pollux</a><br />of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370224UAmy class=place long=22.4502 lat=37.0363>Amyclae</a>, and those the Greek poets remember, <br /><a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>’s yoked <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and great <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>’s team. <br />Such too was swift <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a> himself flinging his mane, <br />a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>’s, over his shoulder, at his wife’s arrival, <br />filling high <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394230LPel class=place long=23.046 lat=39.437>Pelion</a> with his shrill neighing, as he fled. <br />Stable a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> too, when he declines, worn with illness, <br />or slower with age, don’t forgive his wretched senility. <br />Old, he’s cold in desire, and works uselessly at a thankless task, <br />and when he comes to the struggle, he rages in vain, <br />as a great fire does at times, without force, in the stubble. <br />So note their age and spirit particularly: <br />then their other virtues and their bloodline, <br />and the pain each shows in defeat, the pride in winning. <br />Have you seen the chariots pour from the barrier, <br />rushing to attack the flat, competing headlong, <br />when young men’s hopes are roused, and fear throbs, <br />draining each exultant heart? On they go with writhing whips, <br />bending forward to loosen the rein, the red-hot axle turns: <br />Now low, now lifted high, they seem to be carried <br />through the void, and leap into the air: <br />no delay, no rest: a cloud of yellow dust rises, <br />and they’re wet with foam, and the breath of those pursuing: <br />so strong the desire for glory, so dear is victory. <br /><a href=/people/913 target=_blank>Ericthonius</a> was the first who dared to yoke four <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a><br />to his chariot, and stand above the swift wheels, victorious. <br />The <a href=/people/721 target=_blank>Lapiths</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=person long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a> gave us the bridle, and the circuit, <br />mounting on horseback, and teaching the armed rider <br />to taunt the earth, and gather in his proud paces. <br />Each requires equal breeding, equally the trainers require <br />young <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, with fiery spirit and eager for the course: <br />though some older one may often have driven the enemy <br />to flight, and claims <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> or noble <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377228PMyk class=place long=22.7561 lat=37.7308>Mycenae</a> for his birthplace, <br />and traces his line of ancestry from <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a> himself. </p>                        </div>

See how he swims the straits <br />in a confusion of steep waterspouts, late in the dark of night. <br /><a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a>’s might doorway thunders above him, and the waves <br />striking the cliffs re-echo: his unlucky parents cannot stop him, <br />nor the girl who’ll die because of his cruel fate. <br />What of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a>’s spotted lynxes, and the fierce <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> species, <br />and <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>? What of the battles waged by peaceful stags? <br />Surely the frenzy of mares is conspicuous among them all: <br /><a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> herself endowed them with passion, at that time <br />when the four Potnian <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> tore <a href=/people/1197 target=_blank>Glaucus</a> apart with their teeth. <br /><a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a> leads them over Mount <a href=/people/3846 target=_blank>Gargarus</a>, and the roaring <a href=/people/387 target=_blank>Ascanius</a>: <br />they climb mountains and swim rivers. And as soon as <br />the flame has crept deep into their eager marrow, <br />(in spring above all, because spring revives the heat in their bones) <br />they all take to the high cliffs, faces towards the west winds, <br />catching the light air, and often without union, <br />made pregnant by the breeze (a marvellous tale) <br />they run over rocks and crags and through low-lying valleys, <br />not towards your rising, East wind, nor the sun’s, but north <br />and north-west, or where the darkest southerlies rise <br />and cloud the skies with freezing rain. <br />Only then does the poisonous hippomanes, the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>-madness, <br />as the shepherds rightly call it, drip slowly from their sex, <br />hippomanes that evil stepmothers often collect <br />and mix with herbs and not un-harmful spells. </p>                        </div>

The ploughman goes sadly <br />to unyoke the bullock that grieves for its brother’s death, <br />and leaves the blade stuck fast in the middle of its work. <br />No shadows of the deep woods, no soft meadows <br />can stir its spirits, no stream purer than amber <br />flowing over the stones, as it seeks the plain: but the depths <br />of his flanks loosen, and stupor seizes his listless eyes, <br />and his neck sinks to earth with dragging weight. <br />What use are his labour and his service? What matter that he turned <br />the heavy earth with the blade? And yet no gifts of Massic wine <br />or repeated banquets harmed these creatures: <br />they graze on leaves and simple grass, for sustenance, <br />their drink is from clear fountains, and rivers racing <br />in their course, and no cares disturb their healthy rest. <br />At that time, and no other, they say they searched the land <br />for bullocks for <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>’s rites, and the chariot was pulled <br />by unmatched wild <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> to her high altar. <br />So they scratch the ground with harrows, painfully, <br />and bury the seed with their own fingernails, and drag <br />the creaking wagons, with straining shoulders, over the high hills. <br />The <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> tries no tricks around the sheepfold, <br />and doesn’t prowl by night among the flocks: a stronger <br />concern tames him. Timid deer and swift stags <br />wander among the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> now, and around the houses. <br />Now the wave washes up the children of the vast deep, <br />and all swimming things, like shipwrecked corpses, at the edge <br />of the shore: strange <a href=/people/10989 target=_blank>seals</a> swim into the rivers. <br />The viper dies, defended in vain by her winding nest, <br />and the water-<a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a>, his scales standing up in terror. <br />Even the air is unkind to the birds, and they fall headlong, <br />leaving their lives behind high in the clouds. <br />Even a change of pasture no longer helps, and the remedies <br />looked for cause harm: the masters of medicine die, <br /><a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Chiron</a>, Phillyra’s son, and <a href=/people/790 target=_blank>Melampus</a>, son of <a href=/people/2080 target=_blank>Amythaon</a>. <br />Pale <a href=/people/1495 target=_blank>Tisiphone</a> rages, and, sent to the light from the Stygian dark, <br />drives <a href=/people/4233 target=_blank>Disease</a> and Fear in front of her, while day by day <br />raising herself higher, she lifts her greedy head. <br />The rivers and dry banks and sloping hills resound <br />to the bleating of flocks and the endless lowing. <br />And now she wreaks havoc in the herds, and the bodies <br />pile up in the very stalls, decaying with vile disease, <br />until men learn to cover them with earth and bury them in pits. <br />As the hides cannot be used, nor can the meat <br />be cleansed with water, or be cooked on the fire. <br />They couldn’t even shear the fleeces, consumed <br />by plague and filth, nor touch the decaying yarn: <br />truly if anyone handled their hateful clothing, <br />feverish blisters and foul sweat would cover <br />his stinking limbs, and he’d not long to wait <br />before the accursed fire was eating his infected body. </p>                        </div>

There’s a vast cave <br />carved in a mountain side, from which many a wave <br />is driven by the wind, and separates into secluded bays, <br />safest of harbours at times for unwary sailors: <br /><a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a> hides himself in there behind a huge barrier of rock. <br />Here the Nymph placed the youth, hidden from the light, <br />she herself stood far off, veiled in mist. <br />Now the Dog Star blazed in the sky, fiercely parching <br />the thirsty <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, and the fiery sun had consumed <br />half his course: the grass withered, and deep rivers were heated <br />and baked, by the rays at their parched sources, down to the mud, <br />when <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a> came from the sea, to find his customary cave. <br />Round him the moist race of the vast sea frolicked, <br />scattering the salt spray far and wide. <br />The <a href=/people/10989 target=_blank>seals</a> lay down to sleep here and there on the shore: <br />he himself sat on the rock in the middle, as the guardian <br />of a sheepfold on the hills sometimes sits, when Vesper brings <br />the calves home from pasture, and the bleating of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> rouses <br />the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>, hearing them, and the shepherd counts his flock. <br />As soon as chance offered itself, <a href=/people/1282 target=_blank>Aristaeus</a>, <br />hardly allowed the old man to settle his weary limbs <br />before he rushed on him, with a great shout, and fettered him <br />as he lay there.

Where could he turn, twice robbed of his wife? <br />With what tears could he move the spirits, with what voice <br />move their powers? Cold now, she floated in the Stygian boat. <br />They say he wept for seven whole months, <br />beneath an airy cliff, by the waters of desolate <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408238WStr class=place long=23.8489 lat=40.7858>Strymon</a>, <br />and told his tale, in the icy caves, softening the tigers’ mood, <br />and gathering the oak-trees to his song: <br />as the nightingale grieving in the poplar’s shadows <br />laments the loss of her chicks, that a rough ploughman saw <br />snatching them, featherless, from the nest: <br />but she weeps all night, and repeats her sad song perched <br />among the branches, filling the place around with mournful cries. <br />No love, no wedding-song could move <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>’s heart. <br />He wandered the Northern ice, and snowy <a about=https://topostext.org/place/473393WTan class=place long=39.336 lat=47.268>Tanais</a>, <br />and the fields that are never free of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/520255LRhi class=place long=25.5 lat=52>Rhipaean</a> frost, <br />mourning his lost <a href=/people/2283 target=_blank>Eurydice</a>, and Dis’s vain gift: <br />the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410255RKik class=demonym long=25.5 lat=41>Ciconian</a> women, spurned by his devotion, <br />tore the youth apart, in their divine rites and midnight <br />Bacchic revels, and scattered him over the fields. <br />Even then, when Oeagrian <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407260WHeb class=place long=26.1825 lat=40.78557>Hebros</a> rolled the head onwards, <br />torn from its marble neck, carrying it mid-stream, <br />the voice alone, the ice-cold tongue, with ebbing breath, <br />cried out: ‘<a href=/people/2283 target=_blank>Eurydice</a>, ah poor <a href=/people/2283 target=_blank>Eurydice</a>!’ <br />‘<a href=/people/2283 target=_blank>Eurydice</a>’ the riverbanks echoed, all along the stream. </p>                        </div>
