Now the differences in the way in which their life originates, in their qualities and in their life-history are comparatively easy to observe and are simpler, while those shewn in their 'parts' present more complexity. Indeed it has not even been satisfactorily determined what ought and what ought not to be called 'parts,' and some difficulty is involved in making the distinction. </p>                        </div>
                        <div class="text-right bottommargin-sm">

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0093.tlg001:1.1.2'><b>&sect; 1.1.2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it appears that by a 'part,' seeing that it is something which belongs to the plant's characteristic nature, we mean something which is permanent either absolutely or when once it has appeared (like those parts of animals which remain for a time undeveloped) — permanent, that is, unless it be lost by disease, age or mutilation. However some of the parts of plants are such that their existence is limited to a year, for instance, flower, 'catkin,'leaf, fruit, in fact all those parts which are antecedent to the fruit or else appear along with it. Also the new shoot itself must be included with these; for trees always make fresh growth every' year alike in the parts above ground and in those which pertain to the roots. So that if one sets these down as 'parts,'the number of parts will be indeterminate and constantly changing; if on the other hand these are not to be called 'parts,' the result will be that things which are essential if the plant is to reach its perfection, and which are its conspicuous features, are nevertheless not 'parts'; for any plant always appears to be, as indeed it is, more comely and more perfect when it makes new growth, blooms, and bears fruit. Such, we may say, are the difficulties involved in defining a 'part.' </p>                        </div>
                        <div class="text-right bottommargin-sm">

(However, if such a product seems fairest to the eye, because the plant is then in its prime, we can draw no inference from this in support of our argument, since even among animals those that are with young are at their best.) </p>                        </div>

And so too it appears to be with the growth of plants; for of course growth leads up to reproduction as the completion of the process. </p>                        </div>

And that is why the number also of parts is indeterminate; for a plant has the power of growth in all its parts, inasmuch as it has life in all its parts. Wherefore we should assume the truth to be as I have said, not only in regard to the matters now before us, but in view also of those which will come before us presently; for it is waste of time to take great pains to make comparisons where that is impossible, and in so doing we may lose sight also of our proper subject of enquiry. The enquiry into plants, to put it generally, may either take account of the external parts and the form of the plant generally, or else of their internal parts: the latter method corresponds to the study of animals by dissection. </p>                        </div>

And again, if in some cases analogy ought to be considered (for instance, an analogy presented by animals), we must keep this also in view; and in that case we must of course make the closest resemblances and the most perfectly developed examples our standard; and, finally, the ways in which the parts of plants are affected must be compared to the corresponding effects in the case of animals, so far as one can in any given case find an analogy for comparison. So let these definitions stand. </p>                        </div>

Now the unlikeness between them is seen in form, colour, closeness of arrangement or its opposite, roughness or its opposite, and the other qualities; and again there are the various differences of flavour. The inequality is seen in excess or defect as to number or size, or, to speak generally, all the above-mentioned differences too are included under excess and defect: for the 'more' and the 'less' are the same thing as excess and defect, whereas 'differently arranged' implies a difference of position; for instance, the fruit may be above or below the leaves, and, as to position on the tree itself, the fruit may grow on the apex of it or on the side branches, and in some cases even on the trunk, as in the sycamore; while some plants again even bear their fruit underground, for instance arakhidna and the plant called in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> uingon; again in some plants the fruit has a stalk, in some it has none. There is a like difference in the floral organs: in some cases they actually surround the fruit, in others they are differently placed: in fact it is in regard to the fruit, the leaves, and the shoots that the question of position has to be considered. </p>                        </div>

In fact your plant is a thing various and manifold, and so it is difficult to describe in general terms: in proof whereof we have the fact that we cinnot here seize on any universal character which is common to all, as a mouth and a stomach are common to all animals; whereas in plants some characters are the same in all, merely in the sense that all have analogous characters, while others correspond otherwise. For not all plants have root, stem, branch, twig, leaf, flower or fruit, or again bark, core, fibres or veins; for instance, fungi and truffles; and yet these and such like characters belong to a plant's essential nature.

For in the case of some plants it might seem that our definitions overlap; and some under cultivation appear to become different and depart from their essential nature, for instance, mallow when it grows tall and becomes tree-like. For this comes to pass in no long time, not more than six or seven months, so that in length and thickness the plant becomes as great as a spear, and men accordingly use it as a walking-stick, and after a longer period the result of cultivation is proportionately greater. So too is it with the beets; they also increase in stature under cultivation, and so still more do chaste-tree Christ's thorn ivy, so that, as is generally admitted, these become trees, and yet they belong to the class of shrubs. On the other hand the myrtle, unless it is pruned, turns into a shrub, and so does filbert: indeed this last appears to bear better and more abundant fruit, if one leaves a good many of its branches untouched, since it is by nature like a shrub. Again neither the apple nor the pomegranate nor the pear would seem to be a tree of a single stem, nor indeed any of the trees which have side stems from the roots, but they acquire the character of a tree when the other stems are removed. However some trees men even leave with their numerous stems because of their slenderness, for instance, the pomegranate and the apple, and they leave the stems of the olive and the fig cut short. Indeed it might be suggested that we should classify in some cases simply by size, and in some cases by comparative robustness or length of life. For of under-shrubs and those of the pot-herb class some have only one stem and come as it were to have the character of a tree, such as cabbaore and rue: wherefore some call these 'tree-herbs'; and in fact all or most of the pot-herb class, when they have been long in the ground, acquire a sort of branches, and the whole plant comes to have a tree-like shape, though it is shorter lived than a tree. </p>                        </div>

Now in using the terms 'cultivated' and 'wild' we must make these on the one hand our standard, and on the other that which is in the truest sense 'cultivated.'

Such differences would seem to give us a kind of division into classes, for instance, between that of aquatic plants and that of plants of the dry land, corresponding to the division which we make in the case of animals. For there are some plants which cannot live except in wet; and again these are distinguished from one another by their fondness for different kinds of wetness; so that some grow in marshes, others in lakes, others in rivers, others even in the sea, smaller ones in our own sea, larger ones in the Red Sea. Some again, one may say, are lovers of very wet places, or plants of the marshes, such as the willow and the plane.

But to consider all these exceptions and, in general, to consider in such a manner is not the right way to proceed. For in such matters too nature certainly does not thus go by any hard and fast law. Our distinctions therefore and the study of plants in general must be understood accordingly.

And it is perhaps also proper to take into account the situation in which each plant naturally grows or does not grow.

Again the 'male' trees have more knots than the 'female' in those trees in which both forms are found, as cypress, silver-fir, hop-hornbeam, cornelian cherry — for there is a kind called 'female cornelian cherry' (cornel) — and wild trees have more knots than trees in cultivation: this is true both in general and when we compare those of the same kind, as the wild and cultivated forms of olive fig and pear. All these have more knots in the wild state; and in general those of closer growth have this character more than those of open growth; for in fact the 'male' plants are of closer growth, and so are the wild ones; except that in some cases, as in box and nettle-tree, owing to the closer growth there are no knots at all, or only a few. </p>                        </div>

This is especially evident in the wild olive and in reeds — in which the joint corresponds to the knot in trees. Again some knots are opposite one another, as those of the wild olive, while others are set at random. Again some trees have double knots, some treble, some more at the same point; some have as many as five. — In the silver-fir both the knots and the smaller branches are set at right angles, as if they were stuck in, but in other trees they are not so.

Most peculiar are the knots of the apple, for they are like the faces of wild animals; there is one large knot, and a number of small ones round it. Again some knots are blind, others productive; by 'blind' I mean those from which there is no growth. These come to be so either by nature or by mutilation, according as either the knot' is not free and so the shoot does not make its way out, or, a bough having been cut off, the place is mutilated, for example by burning. Such knots occur more commonly in the thicker boughs, and in some cases in the stem also. And in general, wherever one chops or cuts part of the stem or bough, a knot is formed, as though one thing were made thereby into two and a fresh growing point produced, the cause being the mutilation or some other such reason; for the effect of such a blow cannot of course be ascribed to nature. </p>                        </div>

The young leaves in these are round, the old ones angular, and eventually all the leaves assume that form. On the other hand in the ivy, when it is young, the leaves are somewhat angular, but when it is older, they become rounder: for in this plant too a change of form takes place. There is a peculiarity special to the olive lime elm and abele: their leaves appear to invert the upper surface after the summer solstice, and by this men know that the solstice is past. Now all leaves differ as to their upper and under surfaces; and in most trees the upper surfaces are greener and smoother, as they have the fibres and veins in the under surfaces, even as the human hand has its 'lines,'but even the upper surface of the leaf of the olive is sometimes whiter and less smooth. So all or most leaves display their upper surfaces, and it is these surfaces which are exposed to the light. Again most leaves turn towards the sun; wherefore also it is not easy to say which surface is next to the twig; for, while the way in which the upper surface is presented seems rather to make the under surface closer to it, yet nature desires equally that the upper surface should lie the nearer, and this is specially seen in the turning back of the leaf towards the sun. One may observe this in trees whose leaves are crowded and opposite, such as those of myrtle. </p>                        </div>

Some have, as it were, spinous' leaves, as fir, Aleppo pine, prickly cedar; some, as it were, fleshy leaves; and this is because their leaves are of fleshy substance, as cypress, tamarisk, apple, among under-shrubs kneoros, and stoibe, and among herbaceous plants house-leek, and hulwort. This plant is good against moth in clothes. For the leaves of beet and cabbage are fleshy in another way, as are those of the various plants called rue; for their fleshy character is seen in the flat instead of in the round. Among shrubby plants the tamarisk has fleshy leaves. Some again have reedy leaves, as date-palm, doum-palm and such like. But, generally speaking, the leaves of these end in a point; for reeds galingale sedge and the leaves of other marsh plants are of this character. The leaves of all these are compounded of two parts, and the middle is like a keel, placed where in — other leaves is a large passage dividing the two halves. Leaves differ also in their shapes; some are round, as those of pear, some rather oblong, as those of the apple; some come to a sharp point and have spinous projections at the side, as those of smilax. So far I have spoken of undivided leaves; but some are divided and like a saw, as those of silver-fir and of fern. To a certain extent those of the vine are also divided, while those of the fig one might compare to a <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>'s foot. Some leaves again have notches, as those of elm filbert and oak, others have spinous projections both at the tip and at the edges, as those of kermes oak, oak, smilax, bramble, Christ's thorn and others. The leaf of fir, Aleppo pine, silver-fir and also of prickly cedar and kedris (juniper) has a spinous point at the tip. Among other trees there is none that we know which has spines for leaves altogether, but it is so with other woody plants, as akorna, drypis, pine thistle and almost all the plants which belong to that class. For in all these spines, as it were, take the place of leaves, and, if one is not to reckon these plants.

However each of these too has its own peculiar point of attachment and character; this is most obvious in the separation of the pomegranate seeds, for the stone is attached to each, and the connexion is not, as in figs, obscured by the moisture. For here too there is a difference, although in both cases the seeds are enclosed in a sort of fleshy substance, as well as in the case which encloses this and the other parts of the fruit.

But the smells even of those in this class must in all cases be called winelike, though they differ in different kinds, on which matter we must speak more precisely, when we come to speak of flavours,- reckoning up the different kinds themselves, and stating what differences there are between them, and what is the natural character and property of each. </p>                        </div>

To speak generally, all saps correspond to the special character of the several trees, one might almost add, to that of each plant. For every plant has a certain temperament and composition of its own, which plainly belongs in a special sense to the fruits of each. And in niost of these is seen a sort of correspondence with the character of the plant as a whole, which is not however exact nor obvious; it is chiefly in the fruitcases that it is seen, and that is why it is the character of the flavour which becomes more complete and matures into something separate and distinct; in fact we must consider the one as 'matter,' the other — as 'form' or specific character. </p>                        </div>

Again some of these flowers are conspicuous, while that of the olive, though it is 'leafy,' is inconspicuous. Again it is in annual and herbaceous plants alike that we find some leafy, some downy. All plants again have flowers either of two colours or of one; most of the flowers of trees are of one colour and white, that of the pomegranate being almost the only one which is red, while that of some almonds is reddish. The flower of no other cultivated trees is gay nor of two colours, though it may be so with some uncultivated trees, as with the flower of silverfir, for its flower is of saffron colour; and so with the flowers of those trees by the ocean which have, they say, the colour of roses. </p>                        </div>

The majority of flowers have the fruit-case in the middle of them, or, it may be, the flower is on the top of the fruit-case, as in pomegranate apple pear plum and myrtle, and among under-shrubs, in the rose and in many of the coronary plants.

Others say that it bears both in this way and also on the branches, like the carob; for the latter bears on the branches too, though not abundantly: (the name carob is given to the tree which produces what are called 'Egyptian figs'). Again some trees, and some plants in general, produce fruit at the top, others at the sides, others in both ways. But bearing fruit at the top is less common in trees than in other plants, as among grains in those which have an ear, among shrubby plants in heath privet chaste tree and certain others, and among pot-herbs in those with a bulbous root. Among plants which bear both on the top and at the sides are certain trees and certain potherbs, as blite, orach, cabbage. I say trees, since the olive does this too in a way, and they say that, when it bears at the top, it is a sign of fruitfulness. The date-palm too bears at the top, in a sense, but this tree also has its leaves and shoots at the top; indeed it is in the top that its whole activity is seen.

So the commonest ways of growth with all plants are from a piece torn off or from seed; for all plants that have seeds grow also from seed. And they say that the bay too grows from a piece torn off, if one takes off the young shoots and plants them; but it is necessary that the piece torn off should have part of the root or stock attached to it. However the pomegranate and 'spring apple' will grow even without this, and a slip of almond grows if it is planted. The olive grows, one may say, in more ways than any other plant; it grows from a piece of the trunk or of the stock, from the root, from a twig, and from a stake, as has been said. Of other plants the myrtle also can be propagated in several ways; for this too grows from pieces of wood and also from pieces of the stock. It is necessary however with this, as with the olive, to cut up the wood into pieces not less than a span long and not to strip off the bark. </p>                        </div>

Of such changes the soothsayers t-ake no account, any more than they do of those instances in which the soil produces a natural change, as was said of the pomegranate in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. But it is surprising when such a change occurs in our own country, because there are only one or two instances and these separated by wide intervals of time. However, if such changes occur, it is natural that the variation should be rather in the trait than in the tree as a whole. In fact the following irregularity also occurs in fruits; a fig-tree has been known to produce i.s figs from behind the leaves, pomegranate and vines from the stem, while the vine has been known to bear fruit without leaves. The olive again has been known to lose its leaves and yet produce its fruit; this is said to have happened to <a href=/people/4802 target=_blank>Thettalos</a>, son of <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Pisistratus</a>. This may be due to inclement weather; and some changes, which seem to be abnormal, but are not really so, are due to other accidental causes; for instance, there was an olive that, after being completely burnt down, sprang up again entire, the tree and all its branches. And in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a> an olive whose young shoots had been eaten off by locusts grew again: in this case however the shoots had, so to speak, only been shed. But after all such phenomena are perhaps far from strange, since the cause in each case is obvious; rather is it strange that trees should bear fruit not at the places where it naturally forms, or else fruit which does not belong to the character of the tree.

Now in trees such changes, if they occur, are spontaneous, but in annual plants they are deliberately brought about: for instance, one-seeded wheat and rice-wheat change into wheat, if bruised before they are sown; and this does not happen at once, but in the third year. This change resembles that produced in the seeds by difference of soil; for these grains vary according to the soil, and the change takes about the same time as that which occurs in one-seeded wheat. Again wild wheats and barleys also with tendance and cultivation change in a like period. </p>                        </div>

To make lentils vigorous they plant the seeds in dung; to make chick-peas large they bid one moisten the seed while still in the pods, before sowing.

So also changes in the nature of the ground produce changes in animals, for instance, the water-<a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> changes into a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>viper</a>, if the marshes dry up. Most obvious are certain changes in regard to the way in which animals are produced, and such changes run through a series of creatures; thus a caterpillar changes into a chrysalis, and this in turn into the perfect insect; and the like occurs in a number of other cases. But there is hardly anything abnormal in this, nor is the change in plants, which is the subject of our enquiry, analogous to it. That kind of change occurs in trees and in all woodland plants generally, as was said before, and its effect is that, when a change of the required character occurs in the climatic conditions, a spontaneous change in the way of growth ensues.

There is another kind of gall-insect which is called kentrines; these insects are sluggish, like drones, they kill those of the other kind who are entering the figs, and they themselves die in the fruit.

There are other admitted and observable kinds, as when a river in flood gets over its banks or has altogether changed its course, even as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418238WNes class=place long=24.771 lat=41.0916>Nesos</a> in the district of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410250PAbd class=place long=24.9833 lat=40.95>Abdera</a> often alters its course, and in so doing causes such a growth of forest in that region that by the third year it casts a thick shade. The same result ensues when heavy rains prevail for a long time; during these too many plants shoot up. Now, as the flooding of a river, it would appear, conveys seeds of fruits of trees, and, as they say, irrigation channels convey the seeds of herbaceous plants, so heavy rain acts in the same way; for it brings down many of the seeds with it, and at the same time causes a sort of decomposition of the earth and of the water. In fact, the mere mixture of earth with water in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> seems to produce a kind of vegetation. And in some places, if the ground is merely lightly worked and stirred, the plants native to the district immediately spring up; for instance, the cypress in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>. And something similar to this occurs even in smaller plants; as soon as the earth is stirred, wherever it may be, a sort of vegetation comes up. And in partly saturated soil, if you break up the ground, they say that caltrop appears. Now these ways of origination are due to the change which takes place in the soil, whether there were seeds in it already, or whether the soil itself somehow produces the result. And the latter explanation is perhaps not strange, seeing that the moist element is also locked up in the soil. Again, in some places they say that after rain a more singular abundance of vegetation has been known to spring up; for instance, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a>, after a heavy pitchy shower had fallen: for it was under these circumstances that there sprang up the wood which is near the town, though till then it did not exist. They say also that silphium has been known to appear from some such cause, where there was none before.

To wild trees, as compared with cultivated ones, belong the special properties of fruiting late, of greater vigour, of abundance of fruit, produced if not matured; for they ripen their fruit later, and in general their time of flowering and making growth is later; also they are more vigorous in growth, and so, though they produce more fruit, they ripen it less; if this is not universally true, at least it holds good of the wild olive and pear as compared with the cultivated forms of these trees. This is generally true with few exceptions, as in the cornelian cherry and sorb; for the wild forms of these, they say, ripen their fruit better, and it is sweeter than in the cultivated forms. And the rule also does not hold good of anything which does not admit of cultivation, whether it be a tree or one of the smaller plants, as silphium caper and, among leguminous plants, the lupin; these one might say are specially wild in their character. For, as with animals which do not submit to domestication, so a plant which does not submit to cultivation may be called wild in its essential character. However <a href=/people/4166 target=_blank>Hippon</a> declares that of every plant there exists both a cultivated and a wild form, and that 'cultivated' simply means that the plant has received attention, while 'wild' means that it has not; but though he is partly right, he is partly wrong. It is true that any plant deteriorates by neglect and so becomes wild; but it is not true that every plant may be improved by attention, as has been said. Wherefore we must make our distinction and call some things wild, others cultivated — the latter class corresponding to those animals which live with man and can be tamed. </p>                        </div>

Before it come cornelian cherry and cornel, after it bay and alder; a little before the spring equinox come lime zygia Valonia oak fig. Hazel oak and elder are also early in budding, and still more those trees which seem to have no fruit and to grow in groves,' abele elm willow black poplar; and the plane is a little later than these. The others which bud when the spring is, as it were, becoming established, are such as wild fig alaternus cotoneaster Christ's thorn terebinth hazel chestnut. The apple is late in budding, latest of all generally are ipsos (cork-oak) aria (holm-oak) tetragonia odorous cedar yew. Such are the times of budding. The flowering times in general follow in proportion; but they present some irregularity, and so in still more cases and to a greater extent do the times at which the fruit is matured. The cornelian cherry produces its fruit about the summer solstice; the early kind, that is to say, and this tree is about the earliest of all. The late form, which some call 'female cornelian cherry' (cornel), fruits quite at the end of autumn. The fruit of this kind is inedible and its wood is weak and spongy; that is what the difference between the two kinds amounts to. The terebinth produces its fruit about the time of wheat-harvest or a little later, manna-ash and maple in summer; alder, hazel, and a certain kind of wild pear in autumn; oak and chestnut later still, about the setting of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiad</a>; and in like manner alaternus, kermes-oak, Christ's-thorn, cotoneaster, after the setting of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiad</a>; aria (holm-oak) when winter is beginning, apple with the first cold weather, wild pear late — in winter. <a href=/people/8813 target=_blank>Andrachne</a> and hybrid arbutus first ripen their fruit when the grape is turning, and again when winter is beginning; for these trees appear to bear twice.

Peculiar to some also is the growth of what are called winter buds,' for instance in the abovementioned trees; silver-fir, fir, and oak have them, and also lime, hazel, chestnut, and Aleppo pine. These are found in the oak before the leaf-buds grow, when the spring season is just beginning. This growth consists of a sort of leaf-like formation, which occurs between the first swelling of the leaf-buds and the time when they burst into leaf. In the sorb it occurs in the autumn after the shedding of the leaves, and has from the first a glistening look,' as though swelling had taken place, just as if it were about to burst into leaves; and it persists through the winter till the spring. The filbert after casting its fruit produces its clustering growth, which is as large as a good-sized grub: several of these grow from one stalk, and some call them catkins. Each of these is made up of small processes arranged like scales, and resembles the cone of the fir, so that its appearance is not unlike that of a young green fir-cone, except that it is longer and almost of the same thickness throughout. This grows through the winter (when spring comes, the scale-like processes open and turn yellow); it grows to the length of three fingers, but, when in spring the leaves are shooting, it falls off, and the cup-like fruit-cases of the nut are formed, closed all down the stalk and coiresponding in number to the flowers; and in each ot these is a single nut. The case of the lime and of any other tree that produces winter-buds needs further consideration. </p>                        </div>

In other trees not even the knots are opposite to one another, except in some few cases, as wild olive and others.' Here too we find a difference in the manner of growth which belongs to all trees alike, both cultivated and wild: in some cases the growth is from the top of the shoots and also from the sidebuds,' as in pear pomegranate fig myrtle and the majority of trees, one may say: in some cases the growth is not from the top, but only from the sidebuds, and the already existing part is pushed out further, as is the whole trunk with the upper branches. This occurs in the walnut and in the filbert as well as in other trees. In all such trees the buds end in a single leaf; wherefore it is reasonable that they should not make fresh buds and growth from this point, as they have no point of departure. (To a certain extent the growth of corn is similar; for it also regularly increases by pushing forward of the already existing part, even if the leaves are mutilated, as in corn which is bitten down by animals. Corn however does not make side-growths, as some leguminous plants do.) Here then we may find a difference which occurs both in the making of buds and in the making of fresh growth. </p>                        </div>

Some simply speak of a cultivated and a wild kind, not recognising any distinction made by the sweetness of the fruit; (for sweetest is that of the kind called Valonia oak, and this they make the wild kind), but distinguishing the cultivated kind by its growing more commonly on tilled land and having smoother timber, while the Valonia oak has rough wood and grows in mountain districts. Thus some make four kinds, others five. They also in some cases vary as to the names assigned; thus the kind which bears sweet fruit is called by some hemeris, by others 'true oak.'

However the fruit is not always sweet in the kinds specified as such; sometimes it is bitter, that of the Valonia oak for instance. There are also differences in the size shape and colour of the acorns. Those of Valonia oak and sea-bark oak are peculiar; in both of these kinds on what are called the 'male' trees the acorns become stony at one end or the other; in one kind this hardening takes place in the end which is attached to the cup, in the other in the flesh itself.

For it is the 'female' fir which contains what is called the aigis; this is the heart of the tree; the reason being that it is less resinous, less soaked with pitch, smoother, and of straighter grain. This aigis is found in the larger trees, when, as they have fallen down, the white outside part has decayed; when this has been stripped off and the core left, it is cut out of this with the axe; and it is of a good colour with fine fibre.

The wood of the 'male' tree is hard yellow more branched closer, and also more fragrant; that of the 'female' is whiter. The bark of the 'male' is thicker, and, when stripped off, is unbending because of its hardness; that of the 'female' is thinner and flexible; men make their writingcases out of it. The 'male' has neither fruit nor flower, but the 'female' has both flower and fruit; the flower is cup-shaped, and appears alongside of the stalk of the leaf, or alongside of next year's winter-bud on a separate stalk; it is green, when in the cup-like stage, but brownish as it opens; it appears at the same time as in the cultivated trees. The fruit is rounded oblong as large as a bean, resembling the fruit of the ivy; when mature, it has five angular projections, as it were, made by projecting fibres which meet in a point; the immature fruit is less articulated. When the mature fruit is pulled to pieces,- it shows some small fine seeds of the same size as those of orach. The leaf and the bark are well flavoured and sweet; the leaf is like that of the ivy in shape, except that it rounds more gradually, being most curved at the part next the stalk, but in the middle contracting to a sharper and longer apex, and its edge is somewhat puckered and jagged. The timber contains little core, which is not much softer than the other part; for the rest of the wood is also soft. </p>                        </div>

The difference between zygia and maple proper is that the latter has white wood of finer fibre, while that of zygia is yellow and of compact texture. The leaf in both trees is large, resembling that of the plane in the way in which it is divided; it is smooth/ but more delicate, less fleshy, softer, longer in proportion to its breadth, and the divisions — all tend to meet in a point, while they do not occur so much in the middle of the leaf, but rather at the tip; and for their size the leaves have not many fibres. The bark too is somewhat rougher than that of the lime, of blackish colour thick closer than that of the Aleppo pine and stiff; the roots are few shallow and compact for the most part, both those of the yellow and those of the whitewooded tree. This tree occurs chiefly in wet ground, as the people of Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352248LIda class=place long=24.7708 lat=35.2263>Ida</a> say, and is rare.

Of these one is lofty and of strong growth with white wood of good fibre, softer, with less knots, and of more compact texture; the other is shorter, less vigorous in growth, rougher harder and yellower. The leaves in shape are like those of the bay, that is, the broad-leaved bay, but they contract to a sharper point, and they have a sort of jagged outline with sharp points. The whole leaf (if one may consider this as a 'leaf' because it is all shed at once) grows on a single stalk; on either side of a single fibre, as it were, the leaflets grow at a joint in pairs, which are numerous and distinct, just as in the sorb. In some leaves the joints are short and the pairs fewer in number, but in those of the white kind the joint is long and the pairs more numerous, while the leaflets are longer narrower and leek-green in colour. Also this tree has a smooth bark, which is dry thin and red in colour. The roots are matted stout and shallow. As to the fruit, the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352248LIda class=place long=24.7708 lat=35.2263>Ida</a> supposed it to have none, and no flower either; however it has a nut-like fruit in a thin pod, like the fruit of the almond, and it is somewhat bitter in taste. And it also bears certain other things like winter-buds, as does the bay, but they are more solid,' and each separate one is globular, like those of the plane; some of these occur around the fruit, some, in fact the greater number, are at a distance from it. The smooth kind grows mostly in deep ravines and damp places, the rough kind occurs also in dry- and rocky parts. Some, for instance the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, call the one 'ash' (manna-ash), the other 'horse-ash' (ash). The 'horse-ash' is a larger and more spreading tree, wherefore it is of less compact appearance. It is naturally a tree of the plains and rough, while the other belongs to the mountains and is smooth; the one which grows on the mountains is fair-coloured smooth hard and stunted, while that of the plains is colourless spreading and rough. (In general one may say of trees that grow in the plain and on the mountain respectively, that the latter are of fair colour hard and smooth, as beech elm and the rest; while those of the plain are more spreading, of less good colour and inferior, except the pear apple and wild pear, according to the people of Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a>. These when they grow in the plain are better both in fruit and in wood; for on the mountain they are rough spinous and much branched, in the plain smoother larger and with sweeter and fleshier fruit.

It resembles the arkeuthos (<a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> cedar), differing chiefly in the leaf, that of 'cedar' being hard, sharp and spinous, while that of arkeuthos is softer: the latter tree also seems to be of taller growth. However some do not give them distinct names, but call them both 'cedar' distinguishing them however as 'the cedar' and 'prickly cedar.' Both are branching trees with many joints and twisted wood. On the other hand arkeuthos has only a small amount of close core, which, when the tree is cut, soon rots, while the trunk of 'cedar' consists mainly of heart and does not rot. The colour of the heart in each case is red: that of the 'cedar' is fragrant, but not that of the other. The fruit of 'cedar' is yellow, as large as the myrtle-berry, fragrant, and sweet to the taste. That of arkeuthos is like it in other respects, but black, of astringent taste and practically uneatable; it remains on the tree for a year, and then, when another grows, last year's fruit falls off. According to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a> it has three fruits on the tree at once, last year's, which is not yet ripe, that of the year before last which is now ripe and eatable, and it also shews the new fruit. <a href=/people/397 target=_blank>Satyrus</a> said that the wood-cutters gathered him specimens of both kinds which were flowerless. The bark is like that of the cypress but rougher. Both kinds have spreading shallow roots. These trees grow in rocky cold parts and seek out such districts. There are three kinds of mespile, anthedon 'oriental thorn), sataneios (medlar) and anthedonoeides (hawthorn), as the people of mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352248LIda class=place long=24.7708 lat=35.2263>Ida</a> distinguish them. The fruit of the medlar is larger paler more spongy and contains softer stones; in the other kinds it is somewhat smaller, more fragrant and of more astringent taste, so that it can be stored for a longer time. The wood also of these kinds is closer and yellower, though in other respects it does not differ. The flower in all the kinds is like the almond flower, except that it is not pink, as that is, but greenish — In stature the tree is large and it has thick foliage. The leaf in the young tree is round but much divided and like celery at the tip; but the leaf of older trees is very much divided and forms angles with larger di\isions; it is smooth fibrous thinner and more oblong than the celery leaf, both as a whole and in its divisions, and it has a jagged edge all round. It has a long thin stalk, and the leaves turn bright red before they are shed. The tree has many roots, which run deep; wherefore it lives a long time and is hard to kill. The wood is close and hard and does not rot. The tree grows from seed and also from a piece torn off. It is subject to a disease which causes it to become wormeaten in its old age, and the worms are large and different to those engendered by other trees. </p>                        </div>

There are moreover differences in the fruit of the 'female' kind; in some forms it is round, in others oblong and egg-shaped. There are also differences in taste; the round fruits are generally more fragrant and sweeter, the oval ones are often sour and less fragrant. The leaves in both grow attached to a long fibrous stalk, and project on each side in a row like the feathers of a bird's wing, the whole forming a single leaf but being divided into lobes with divisions which extend to the rib; but each pair are some distance apart,- and, when the leaves fall, these divisions do not drop separately, but the whole wing-like structure drops at once. When the leaves are older and longer, the pairs are more numerous; in the younger and shorter leaves they are fewer; but in all at the end of the leaf-stalk there is an extra leaflet, so that the total number of leaflets is an odd number. In form the leaflets resemble the leaves of the 'fine-leaved' bay, except that they are jagged and shorter and do not narrow to a sharp point but to a more rounded end. The flower is clustering and made up of a number of small white blossoms from a single knob. The fruit too is clustering, when the tree fruits well; for a number of fruits are formed from the same knob, giving an appearance like a honeycomb. The fruit gets eaten by worms on the tree before it is ripe to a greater extent than that of medlar pear or wild pear, and yet it is much more astringent than any of these. The tree itself also gets worm-eaten, and so withers away as it ages; and the worm which infests it is a peculiar one, red and hairy. This tree bears fruit when it is quite young, that is as soon as it is three years old. In autumn, when it has shed its leaves, it immediately produces its winter-bud-like knob, which is glistening and swollen as though the tree were just about to burst into leaf, and this persists through the winter. The sorb, like the medlar, is thornless; it has smooth rather shiny bark, (except when the tree is old), which in colour is a whitish yellow; but in old trees it is rough and black. The tree is of a good size, of erect growth and with well balanced foliage; for in general it assumes a conelike shape as to its foliage, unless something interferes. The wood is hard close strong and of a good colour; the roots are not numerous and do not run deep, but they are strong and thick and indestructible. The tree grows from a root, from a piece torn off, or from seed, and seeks a cold moist position; in such a position it is tenacious of life and hard to kill: however it also grows on mountains. </p>                        </div>

For, as to the view that the helix by natural development turns into the ivy, some insist that this is not so, the only true ivy according to these being that which was ivy from the first; (whereas if, as some say, the helix invariably turns into ivy, the difference would be merely one of age and condition, and not of kind, like the difference between the cultivated and the wild pear). However the leaf even of the fullgrown helix is very different from that of the ivy, and it happens but rarely and in a few specimens that in this plant a change in the leaf occurs as it grows older, as it does in the abele and the castor-oil plant. There are several forms of the helix, of which the three most conspicuous and important are the green 'herbaceous' kind (which is the commonest), the white, and the variegated, which some call the 'Thracian' helix. Each of these appears to present variations; of the green one form is slenderer and has more regular and also closer leaves, the other has all these characteristics in a less degree. Of the variegated kind again one sort has a larger, one a smaller leaf, and the variegation is variable. In like manner the various forms of the white helix differ in size and colour. The 'herbaceous' kind is the most vigorous and covers most space. They say that the form which is supposed to turn into ivy is clearly marked not only by its leaves, because they are larger and broader, but also by its shoots; for these are straight from the first, and this form does not bend over like the other; also because the shoots are slenderer and larger, while those of the ivy-like form are shorter and stouter.

This form also more than the others grows stout and becomes treelike, and in fact becomes itself an independent ivy tree, though in general it likes and seeks to be against another tree, and is, as it were, parasitic. Moreover from the first it has also this natural characteristic, that it regularly puts forth roots from the shoots between the leaves, by means of which it gets a hold of trees and walls, as if these roots were made by nature on purpose. Wherefore also by withdrawing and drinking up the moisture it starves its host, while, if it is cut off below, it is able to survive and live.

The fir is fairest and tallest in a sunny position, and does not grow at all in a shady one; the silver-fir on the contrary is fairest in a shady place, and not so vigorous in a sunny one. </p>                        </div>

Wherefore men do not use these for expensive work, such as doors or other choice articles, but rather for ship-building and house-building.

However it is true of all trees anywhere that with a north aspect the wood is closer and more compact and better generally; and, generally speaking, more trees grow in positions facing the north. Again trees which are close together grow and increase more in height, and so become unbranched straight and erect, and the best oar-spars are made from these, while those that grow far apart are of greater bulk and denser habit; wherefore they grow less straight and with more branches, and in general have harder wood and a closer grain. </p>                        </div>

Further that each tree seeks an appropriate position and climate is plain from the fact that some districts bear some trees but not others; (the latter do not grow there of their own accord, nor can they easily be made to grow), and that, even if they obtain a hold, they do not bear fruit — as was said of the date-palm the sycamore and others; for there are many trees which in many places either do not grow at all, or, if they do, do not thrive nor bear fruit, but are in general of inferior quality.

It cannot ripen unless it is scraped; but they scrape it with iron 'claws'; the fruits thus scraped ripen in four days. If these are removed, others and others again grow from exactly the same point, and this some say occurs three times over, others say it can happen more times than that. Again the tree is very full of sap, and its wood is useful for many purposes. There is another peculiar property which it appears to possess; when it is cut, it is at first green, but it dries in deep water; they put it at once in a hole or in pools and so season it; and it becomes dry by being soaked in the deep water, and when it is completely dry, it is fetched up and floats and is then thought to be duly seasoned; for it is now light and porous.

They say also that the water is in some places quite sweet, but in others quite close by it is brackish; that where however other things grow, the soil is dry and waterless; and that in places even the wells are a hundred fathoms deep, so that they draw water by means of a windlass worked by beasts.

Thus they say that ivy and olive do not grow in Asia in the parts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> which are five days' journey from the sea; but that in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> ivy appears on the mountain called <a href=/people/4206 target=_blank>Meros</a>, whence, according to the tale, <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> came. Wherefore it is said that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, when he came back from an expedition, was crowned with ivy, himself and his army. But elsewhere in Asia it is said to grow only in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a>, for that country seems in a way to surround and join on to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Euxine</a> Sea.

The country then does not admit this plant on account of the climate, and it grudgingly admits the box and the lime; for even these give much trouble to those engaged in the gardens. It also produces some peculiar trees and shrubs. And in general the lands of the East and South appear to have peculiar plants, as they have peculiar animals; for instance. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> have, among many others, that which is called the '<a href=/people/538 target=_blank>Median</a>' or 'Persian apple' (citron). This tree has a leaf like to and almost identical with that of the andrachne, but it has thorns like those of the pear or white-thorn, which however are smooth and very sharp and strong. The 'apple' is not eaten, but it is very fragrant, as also is the leaf of the tree. And if the 'apple' is placed among clothes, it keeps them from being moth-eaten. It is also useful when one has drunk deadly poison; for being given in wine it upsets the stomach and brings up the poison; also for producing sweetness of breath; for, if one boils the inner part of the 'apple' in a sauce, or squeezes it into the mouth in some other medium, and then inhales it, it makes the breath sweet. The seed is taken from the fruit and sown in spring in carefully tilled beds, and is then watered every fourth or fifth day. And, when it is growing vigorously, it is transplanted, also in spring, to a soft well-watered place, where the soil is not too fine; for such places it loves. And it bears its apples at all seasons; for when some have been gathered, the flower of others is on the tree and it is ripening others. Of the flowers, as we have said, those which have, as it were, a distaff projecting in the middle are fertile, while those that have it not are infertile. It is also sown, like date-palms, in pots with a hole in them.

The roots as they grow are easily distinguished from the branches, being whiter hairy crooked and leafless.- The foliage above is also abundant, and the whole tree is round and exceedingly large. They say that it extends its shade for as much as two furlongs; and the thickness of the stem is in some instances more than sixty paces, while many specimens are as much as forty paces through.

In general they say that the trees which grow in the sea and those which grow on the land and are overtaken by the tide are of the same kind, and that those which grow in the sea are small and look like seaweed, while those that grow — on land are large and green and have a fragrant flower and a fruit like a lupin. </p>                        </div>

Inside it has tubes which run distinct from one another right through, like a honey-comb: on this is set the 'head,' which is like a round <a href=/people/10963 target=_blank>wasps</a>' nest, and in each of the cells is a 'bean,' which slightly projects from it; at most there are thirty of these. The flower is twice as large as a poppy's, and the colour is like a rose, of a deep shade; the 'head' is above the water. Large leaves grow at the side of each plant, equal in size to a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> hat; these have a stalk exactly like that of the plant.

And the fruit grows on the stalk in the same way as that of the 'bean.'

This is like millet. — In the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> they say that the 'head' and the flowers sink and go under water in the evening till midnight, and sink to a considerable depth; for one can not even reach them by plunging one's hand in; and that after this, when dawn comes round, they rise and go on rising towards day-break, being visible above the water when the sun appears; and that then the plant opens its flower, and, after it is open, it still rises; and that it is a considerable part which projects above the water. These 'heads' the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> heap together and leave to decay, and when the 'pod' has decayed, they wash the 'head' in the river and take out the 'fruit,' and, having dried and pounded it, they make loaves of it, which they use for food. The root of the lotos is called korsion, and it is round and about the size of a quince; it is enclosed in a black 'bark,' like the shell of a chestnut. The inside is white; but when it is boiled or roasted, it becomes of the colour of the yolk of an egg and is sweet to taste.

However quite peculiar to this plant is the hair-like character of the growths which spring from the stalk; for these are neither leaves nor stalk; though reeds and other things have also sidegrowths. </p>                        </div>

This then is a matter for further enquiry. The 'fruiting' — ones are in general scarcer, for the 'entire rush' is more useful for wicker-work because of its fleshiness and pliancy. The 'fruiting' rush in general produces a club-like head which swells straight from the wiry stem, and then bears egg-like bodies; for attached to a single wiry base it has its very spike-like branches all round it, and on the ends of these it has its round vessels borne laterally and gaping '; in each of these is the small seed, which is pointed and black, and like that of the Michaelmas daisy, except that it is less solid. It has a long root, which is stouter than that of the ordinary rush; this withers every year, and then another strikes down again from the 'head' of the plant. And it is easy to observe that some of the roots as they are let down are withered, some green. The 'head' is like that of an onion or long onion, being, as it were, made up of several united together; it is broad, and underneath it has reddish scales. Now it is a peculiar fact about the roots of this plant that they wither every year and that the fresh growth of roots comes from the part of the plant which is above ground.

Now how this is may perhaps be another story, but anyhow it is plain that there is a great difference between trees in this respect; the kinds that have been mentioned, and many others besides, are long-lived, while the following are admittedly short-lived — pomegranate, fig, apple: and among apples the 'spring' sort and the 'sweet' apple are shorter-lived than the 'sour' apple, even as the 'stoneless' pomegranate is shorter-lived than the other kinds. Also some kinds of vine are shortlived, especially those which bear much fruit; and it appears that trees which grow by water are shorter-lived than those which live in dry places: this is true of willow, abele, elder, and black poplar. </p>                        </div>

About these one might enquire whether one should call the new growth the same tree or a new one; to take a similar case, if, after cutting down the trunk, one should, as the husbandmen do, encourage — the new shoots to grow again, or if one should cut the tree right down to the roots and burn the stump, (for these things are commonly done, and they also sometimes occur naturally); are we then here too, to call the new growth the same tree, or another one? In so far as it is always the parts of the tree which appear to alternate their periods of growth and decay and also the prunings which they themselves thus make, so far the new and the old growth might seem to be the same tree; for what difference can there be in the one as compared with the other? On the other hand, in so far as the trunk would seem to be above all the essential part of the tree, which gives it its special character, when this changes, one might suppose that the whole tree becomes something different — unless indeed one should lay down that to have the same starting-point constitutes identity; whereas it often happens that the roots too are different and undergo a change, since some decay and others grow afresh. For if it be true, as some assert, that the reason why the vine is the longest lived of trees, is that, instead of producing new roots, it always renews itself from the existing ones, such an illustration must surely lead to an absurd conclusion, unless we assume that the stock persists, as it must do, since it is, as it were, the fundamental and essential part of a tree. However it cannot matter much for our present purpose which account is the right one. Perhaps we may say that the longest-lived tree is that which in all ways is able to persist, as does the olive by its trunk, by its power of developing sidegrowth, and by the fact that its roots are so hard to destroy. It appears that the life of the individual olive (in regard to which one should make the trunk the essential part and standard in estimating the time), lasts for about two hundred years. But if it is true of the vine, as some say, that, if the roots are partly removed, the trunk is able to survive, and the whole character of the tree remains the same and produces like fruits for any period, however long, then the vine will be the longest-lived of all trees. They say that, when the vine seems to be deteriorating, this is what one should do: — one should encourage the growth of branches and gather the fruit that year: and after that one should dig on one side of the vine and prune away all the roots on that side, and then fill the hole with brushwood and heap up the soil. In that year, they say, the vine bears very badly, but better in the next, while in the third and fourth it becomes normal again and bears many fair clusters, so that it is quite as good as when it was in its prime. And when it goes off again, they say one should dig on the other side and apply the same treatment; and that so treated the tree lasts for ever; and this should be done at intervals of about ten years. And this is why those who adopt this treatment never cut down the vine, but the same stems remain for many generations, so that even those who planted the trees cannot remember doing so. However perhaps one should enquire of those who have had experience before accepting this statement. These examples may serve for considering which trees are long-lived and which short-lived. </p>                        </div>

Cultivated kinds however, they say, are subject to various diseases, some of which are, one may say, common to all or to most, while others are special to particular kinds. General diseases are those of being worm-eaten, of being sun-scorched, and rot. All trees, it may be said, have worms, but some less, as fig and apple, some more, as pear. Speaking generally, those least liable to be worm-eaten are those which have a bitter acrid juice, and these are also less liable to sunscorch.

All perish alike, if the bark is stripped off all round; one may say that every tree, except the andrachne,- perishes under these circumstances; and this tree does so also, if one does violence to the flesh, and so breaks off the new growth which is forming. However one should perhaps except the cork-oak; for this, they say, is all the stronger if its bark is stripped off, that is, the outer bark and also that which lies below it next the flesh — as with the andrachne. For the bark is also stripped from the bird-cherry the vine and the lime (and from this the ropes are made), and, among smaller plants, from the mallow; but in these cases it is not the real nor the first bark which is taken, but that which grows above that, which even of its own accord sometimes falls off because fresh bark is forming underneath. </p>                        </div>

As some think, in many cases a new bark forms underneath, while the outer bark withers and cracks and in many cases falls off of its own accord; but the process is not so obvious as it is in the above mentioned cases. Wherefore, as they think, all trees are destroyed by stripping the bark, though the destruction is not in all cases equally rapid or complete. Some in fact, as fig, lime, and oak, survive for some time; indeed some say that these recover, and also the elm and date-palm, and that the bark even of the lime almost entirely closes up again, while in other trees it forms as it were a callus and acquires a peculiar new character. Men try to help the tree by plastering it with mud and tying pieces of bark reeds or something of the kind about it, so that it may not take cold nor become dried up. And they say that the bark has been known to grow again; — for instance that that of the fig-trees at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388224RTra class=demonym long=22.4 lat=38.75>Trachinian</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388224PHer class=place long=22.4313 lat=38.794>Heraclea</a> did so. However this does not only depend on the quality of the soil and on the climate; the other circumstances which ensue must also be favourable; for, if great cold or heat ensues, the tree perishes at once. The season also makes a difference. For if one strips the bark of a silver-fir or fir at the time when the buds are shooting during <a href=/people/12205 target=_blank>Thargelion</a> or Skirrophorion, at which season it is separable, the tree dies at once. If it is done however in winter, the tree holds out longer; and this is especially true of the strongest trees, such as kermes-oak and oak; these it takes longer to kill. However the piece stripped off must be of a certain breadth to cause the death of the tree, especially in the case of the strongest trees; for, if one does it only a little, it is not surprising that the tree should not be killed; though some indeed say that, if it is done at all, the tree certainly dies; this however is probably true only of the weaker kinds. For some, they say, if they are in bad barren soil, die even if the bark is not stripped all round. This then, as has been said, is a universal cause of death. </p>                        </div>

But all other trees shoot again after being lopped, and some, such as the olive, become all the fairer. However most trees perish if the stem is split; for no tree seems able to stand this, except vine, fig, pomegranate, and apple; and some perish even if they are wounded severely and deeply.

Now these are the right seasons for cutting timber: — for 'round' timber and that whose bark is to be stripped the time is when the tree is coming into leaf. For then the bark is easily stripped (which process they call 'peeling') because of the moisture which forms beneath it. At a later time it is hard to strip, and the timber obtained is black and uncomely. However square logs can be cut after the time of peeling, since trimming with the axe removes the uncomeliness. In general any wood is at the best season as to strength when it has not merely ceased coming into leaf, but has even ripened its fruit; however on account of the bark-stripping it comes to pass that 'round' timber is in season when it is cut before it is ripe, so that, as it happens, the seasons are here reversed. Moreover the wood of the silver-fir is of a better colour at the time of the first peeling. </p>                        </div>

The oak is cut latest of all, in early winter at the end of autumn. If it is cut at the time of peeling, it rots almost more quickly than at any other time, whether it has the bark on or not. This is especially so if it is cut during the first peeling, less so during the second, and least during the third. What is cut after the ripening of the fruit remains untouched by worms, even if it has not peeled: however worms get in under the bark and mark the surface of the stem, and such marked pieces of wood some use as seals. Oak-wood if cut in the right season does not rot and is remarkably free from worms, and its texture is hard and close like horn; for it is like the heart of a tree throughout, except that that of the kind called sea-bark oak is even at that time of poor quality. </p>                        </div>

At this season however they are harder to cut because the wood is tougher. It is also recommended to do the cutting when the moon has set, since then the wood is harder and less likely to rot.

Wood is said to 'coil' when there is in it closer twisting than usual, made up of an unusual number of rings: this is not quite like a knot, nor is it like the ordinary curling of the wood, which runs right through it and is uniform. 'Coiling' is much more troublesome and difficult to deal with than knots; it seems to correspond to the so-called 'centres' which occur in marbles. That vigorous growth covers up the knots is plain from simple observation of the fact and also from other similar instances. For often some part of the tree itself is absorbed by the rest of the tree which has grown into it; and again, if one makes a hole in a tree and puts a stone into it or some other such thing, it becomes buried, being completely enveloped by the wood which grows all round it: this happened with the wild olive in the market-place at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=place long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megara</a>; there was an oracle that, if this were cut open, the city would be taken and plundered, which came to pass when <a href=/people/234 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> took it. For, when this tree was split open, there were found greaves and certain other things of Attic workmanship hanging there, the hole in the tree having been made at the place where the things were originally hung on it as offerings. Of this tree a small part still exists, and in many other places further instances have occurred. Moreover, as has been said, such occurrences happen also with various other trees. </p>                        </div>

The sweet chestnut under like treatment is also proof against decay. They say that the wood of the fir is more liable to be eaten by the teredon than that of the silver-fir; for that the latter is dry, while the fir has a sweet taste, and that this is more so, the more the wood is soaked with resin; they go on to say that all woods are eaten by the teredon except the olive, wild or cultivated, and that these woods escape because of their bitter taste. Now woods which decay in sea-water are eaten by the teredon, those which decay on land by the skolex and thrips; for the teredon does not occur except in the sea. It is a creature small in size, but has a large head and teeth; the thrips resembles the skolex, and these creatures gradually bore through timber. The harm that these do is easy to remedy; for, if the wood is smeared with pitch, it does not let in water when it is dragged down into the sea; but the harm done by the teredon cannot be undone. Of the skolekes which occur in wood some come from the decay of the wood itself, some from other skolekes which engender therein. For these produce their young in timber, as the worm called the 'horned worm' does in trees, having bored and scooped out a sort of <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mouse</a>-hole by turning round and round. But it avoids wood which has a strong smell or is bitter or hard, such as boxwood, since it is unable to bore through it. They say too that the wood of the silver-fir, if barked just before the time of budding, remains in water without decaying, and that this was clearly seen at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379223PPhe class=place long=22.307 lat=37.9117>Pheneos</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a>, when their plain was turned into a lake since the outlet was blocked up. For at that time they made their bridges of this wood, and, as the water rose, they placed more and more atop of them, and, when the water burst its way through and disappeared, all the wood was found to be undecayed. This fact then became known by means of an accident. In the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/262505ITyl class=place long=50.5205 lat=26.2328>Tylos</a> off the <a href=/people/275 target=_blank>Arabian</a> coast they say that there is a kind of wood of which they build their ships, and that in sea-water this is almost proof against decay; for it lasts more than 200 years if it is kept under water, while, if it is kept out of water, it decays sooner, though not for some time. They also tell of another strange thing, though it has nothing to do with the question of decay: they say that there is a certain tree, of which they cut their staves, and that these are very handsome, having a variegated appearance like the tiger's skin; and that this wood is exceedingly heavy, yet when one throws it down on hard ground it breaks in pieces like pottery. </p>                        </div>

Inferior iron tools can cut hard wood better than soft: for on soft wood tools lose their edge, as was said in speaking of the lime, while hard woods actually sharpen it: wherefore cobblers make their strops of wild pear. </p>                        </div>

In olive box and such woods this is not so obvious; wherefore they say that box and olive lack this tendency; for that these woods are less apt to 'draw' than any others. 'Drawing' is the closing in of the wood as the core is disturbed. For since the core remains alive, it appears, for a long time, it is always removed from any article whatever made of this wood, but especially from doors,' so that they may not warp: and that is why the wood is split. </p>                        </div>

Yet it is a fact that masts and yard-arms are useless, if it has been removed from the wood of which they are made. This is however an accidental exception, because the wood in question has several coats,- of which the strongest and also thinnest is the outermost, since this is the driest, while the other coats are strong and thin in proportion to their nearness to the outermost. If therefore the wood be split, the driest parts are necessarily stripped off. Whether however in the other case the object of removing the core is to secure dryness is matter for enquiry. However, when the core 'draws' it twists the wood, whether it has been split or sawn, if the sawing is improperly performed: the saw-cut should be made straight and not slantwise. Thus, if the core be represented by the line A, the cut must be made along the line BD, and not along the line BC: for in that case, they say, the core will be destroyed, while, if cut in the other way, it will live. For this reason men think that every wood has a core: for it is clear that those which do not seem to possess one nevertheless have it, as box nettle-tree kermes-oak: a proof of this is the fact that men make of these woods the pivots of expensive doors, and accordingly the headcraftsmen specify that wood with a core shall not be used. This is also a proof that any core 'draws,' even those of the hardest woods, which some call the heart. In almost every wood, even in that of the silver-fir, the core is the hardest part, and the part which has the least fibrous texture: — it is least fibrous because the fibres are far apart and there is a good deal of fleshy matter between them, while it is the hardest part because the fibres and the fleshy substance are the hardest parts. Wherefore the headcraftsmen specify that the core and the parts next it are to be removed, that they may secure the closest and softest part of the wood. </p>                        </div>

Worst of the woods mentioned is oak, since it contains most mineral matter, and the wood of older trees is inferior to that of the younger, and for the same reason that of really old trees is specially bad.

Again better charcoal comes from trees- in a sunny dry position with a north aspect than from those grown in a shady damp position facing south. Or, if the wood used contains a good deal of moisture, it should be of close texture; for such wood contains more sap. And, for the same reason, that which is of closer texture either from its own natural character or because it was grown in a drier spot, is, whatever the kind of tree, better. But different kinds of charcoal are used for different purposes: for some uses men require it to be soft; thus in iron-mines they use that which is made of sweet chestnut when the iron has been already smelted, and in silver-mines they use charcoal of pine-wood: and these kinds are also used by the crafts. Smiths require charcoal of fir rather than of oak: it is indeed not so strong, but it blows up better into a flame, as it is less apt to smoulder: and the flame from these woods is fiercer. In general the flame is fiercer not only from these but from any wood which is of open texture and light, or which is dry': while that from wood which is of close texture or green is more sluggish and dull. The fiercest flame of all is given by brushwood; but charcoal cannot be made from it at all, since it has not the necessary substance. </p>                        </div>

The stationary piece should be made of one of these, the drill of bay; for the active and passive parts of the apparatus should not be of the same wood, but different in their natural properties to start with, one being of active, the other of passive character. Nevertheless they are sometimes made of the same wood, and some suppose that it makes no difference. They are made in fact of buckthorn kemiesoak, lime and almost any wood except olive; which seems surprising, as olive-wood is rather hard and oily; however it is plainly its moisture which makes it less suitable for kindling. The wood of the buckthorn is also good, and it makes a satisfactory stationary piece; for, besides being dry and free from sap it is necessary that this should also be of rather open texture, that the friction may be effectual; while the drill should be one which gets little worn by use.

The obvious character of both is alike, except as to size; for narthex grows very tall, while narthekia is a small plant.

For a considerable distance they embrace the stalk, like the leaves of the reed, but they turn back from it more owing to their softness and their size; for the leaf is large soft and much divided, so that it is almost hair-like; the largest leaves are the lowest ones next the ground, and so on in proportion. The flower is quince-yellow and inconspicuous, the fruit like dill, but larger. The plant divides at the top and has some small branches, on which grow the flower and the fruit. It also bears flowers and fruit on the side-stalks all the way up, like dill.

The stalk lasts only a year, like that of ferula. Now in spring it sends up this maspelon, which purges <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and greatly fattens them, and makes their flesh wonderfully delicious; after that it sends up a stalk, which is eaten, it is said, in all ways, boiled and roast, and this too, they say, purges the body in forty days. It has two kinds of juice, one from the stalk and one from the root; wherefore the one is called 'stalk-juice,' the other 'root-juice.' The root has a black bark, which is stripped off. They have regulations, like those in use in mines, for cutting the root, in accordance with which they fix carefully the proper amount to be cut, having regard to previous cuttings and the supply of the plant. For it is not allowed to cut it wrong nor to cut more than the appointed amount; for, if the juice is kept and not used, it goes bad and decays. When they are conveying it to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Peiraeus</a>, they deal with it thus: having put it in vessels and mixed meal with it, they shake it for a considerable time, and from this process it gets its colour, and this treatment makes it thenceforward keep without decaying. Such are the facts in regard to the cutting and treatment. The plant is found over a wide tract of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, for a distance, they say, of more than four thousand furlongs, but it is most abundant near the Syrtis, starting from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/321201UEue class=place long=20.063 lat=32.114>Euesperides</a> islands.

Roses can be grown from seed, which is to be found below the flower in the 'apple' and is like that of safflower or pine-thistle, but it has a sort of fluff, so that it is not unlike the seeds which have a pappus. As however the plant comes slowly from seed, they make cuttings of the stem, as has been said, and plant them. If the bush is burnt or cut over, it bears better flowers; for, if left to itself, it grows luxuriantly and makes too much wood. Also it has to be often transplanted; for then, they say, the roses are improved.

However it is a point for consideration with which herbs the time of sowing makes a difference and with which it makes none; thus it is said that radish germinates on the third day whether it be sown in summer or in winter, while beet, as has been said, behaves differently according to the season. Anyway such are and are said to be the seasons of germination in each case. </p>                        </div>

Some come up quicker from old seed, as celery beet cress savory coriander marjoram (unless indeed they are raised from fresh seed in the manner which we have mentioned). There is, they say, a singular feature about beet; the seed does not all germinate at once, but some of it not for some time, some even in the next or in the third year; wherefore it is said that little comes up from much seed. </p>                        </div>

Some plants even which are not bulbous but longer-lived make offsets, as celery and beet; for these send out roots from which grow leaves and stems. Long onion and leek also make offsets, sending out a 'head' below, like the bulb of purse-tassels, from which the leaves spring; but this only takes place when the stem has withered and the seed has been removed. But, as the 'heads' of such plants are not useful, they do not collect them for storing dry; wherefore also they do not plant these.

Wherefore, when they are shifting plants for seeding, they plant the seedlings wide apart. Good and inferior seed can be easily distinguished by their appearance; the seed of a good plant is fine, that of a poor one coarse.

Of these the annual kind is small but very sweet, while the divided and the Ascalonian differ plainly as to their character as well as in respect of their cultivation. For the 'divided' kind they leave untended in winter with its foliage, but in spring they strip off the outside leaves and tend the plant in other ways; when the leaves are stripped off, others grow, and at the same time division takes place under ground, which is the reason of the name 'divided.' Some indeed say that all kinds should be thus treated, in order that the force of the plant may be directed downwards and it may not go to seed. The Ascalonian kind has a somewhat peculiar character; it is the only kind which does not divide and which does not, as it were, reproduce itself from the root; moreover in the plant itself there is no power of increasing and multiplying; wherefore many do not plant these, but raise them from seed; and the sowing is made late, towards the spring; and then, when the seed has germinated, they transplant. And the plant arrives at maturity so fast that it is taken up with the others or even earlier; whereas, if it is left a longer time in the ground, it rots. If planted on the other hand, it sends up a stem and merely produces seed, and then shrivels up and withers. Such then is the character of these. </p>                        </div>

They are planted either entire or else in sections made by cutting at the 'head.' The growth which results is not uniform; from the lower part comes an onion, from the upper only foliage; while, if the plant is divided vertically, no growth at all takes place. The kind called horn- onion has no head/ but has as it were a long neck, at the top of which comes the new growth; it is often cut, like the leek; wherefore it is raised from seed and not planted.

There are different kinds distinguished as late or early, for there is one kind which matures in sixty days. There are also differences as to size. There is one kind which excels in size, especially that variety which is called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a>, which is not cooked but used for salads, and, when it is pounded up, it increases wondrously in bulk, making a foaming dressing. There is a further difference, in that some kinds cannot be divided into cloves. The sweetness of taste and smell and the vigour depend on the position and on cultivation, as with other herbs. Garlic reaches maturity from seed, but slowly, for in the first year it acquires a 'head' which is only as large as that of the leek, but in the next year it divides into cloves, and in the third is fully grown, and is not inferior, indeed some say it is superior, to the garlic which has been planted. The growth of the root in garlic and onion is not the same; in garlic, when the clove has swollen, the whole of it becomes convex; then it increases and divides again into the cloves, and becomes several plants instead of one by the maturing of the 'head,' while the onion puts out another and another growth straight from the root, as do purse-tassels and squill and all such plants. For both onions and garlic multiply if they are not removed but left alone. They say also that garlic produces garlic heads on the stalk, and that the onion in like manner produces onions.

The dung which is most commended is that which is mixed with litter, while that of beasts of burden is held to be bad, because it is most apt to lose its moisture. Dung which is mixed with the seed is most in request, but some cast the manure on while they are sowing, and they also use fresh human dung as a liquid manure. The winter crops like moisture more than the summer ones, and the weak more than the strong, as well as those which specially need feeding. Onion and long onion also love moisture, though some say that they do not require it, if at the outset it has been applied twice or thrice. Fresh cold water is the best, and the worst is that which is brackish and thick: wherefore the water from irrigation ditches is not good, for it brings with it seeds of weeds. Rain-water is good, for it also appears to destroy the pests which devour the young plants. Some however say that rain-water is not good for melons nor for onions. Most herbs are watered in early morning or at evening, so that they may not be dried up; but basil is watered even at noon, for it is said that it grows more quickly if it is watered at first with warm water. In general water seems to be extremely beneficial, especially if it is mixed with dung; for, they say, pot-herbs often are hungry, and experienced gardeners can recognise when this is so. </p>                        </div>

For some are plants which belong properly to summer as to their growth and their flowering, as golden thistle and squirting cucumber, as was said of shrubby plants and of konyza caper and the rest; for of these too none blooms or grows before its proper season. Wherefore in this respect too these plants would seem to differ from trees. For trees make their growth all at once or nearly so, or at all events we may say that they do so all at one season; but the plants of which we are now speaking have their times of growing and still more of flowering at many or rather at all seasons; so that, if one will consider it, both the growing and the flowering are almost continuous throughout the year; for one continually succeeds to another, so that all seasons are covered; thus after the dandelion will come the crocus anemone groundsel and the other plants of winter, and after these those of spring summer and autumn. Some again, as was said, because they do not produce all their bloom at once, cover a longer season; for there are some that thus bloom, for instance dandelion bugloss chicory plantain, and others; but because of this continuity and overlapping it does not seem easy in some cases to define which first make growth and which are late in growing, unless one were to lay down that the 'year' begins when a certain season begins. Further in these plants it is not easy to define in each case the time of first growth and the season when, the fruits being matured, it makes a fresh start in reproduction. This seems chiefly to occur after the autumnal equinox; for by that time most of the seeds are matured, like most of the fruits of trees: moreover a change then takes place in the seed itself as well as in the season. But in the case of any seeds which are still immature and unripe and so are overtaken by winter, the period of first growth, the flowering of the new plant, and the period of maturity are proportionally later. Wherefore it comes to pass that some bloom at the solstice, some at the rising of the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-star, and some after the rising of <a href=/people/632 target=_blank>Arcturus</a> and the autumnal equinox. </p>                        </div>

In this connexion we may distinguish kinds which mature in three or in two months, and those, if there be such, which take a less number of days; for instance, they say that in the region of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404229PAin class=place long=22.8341 lat=40.4754>Aineia</a> there is a kind which ripens and attains perfection within forty days from the time of sowing; they say too that this grain is strong and heavy, not light like that which takes three months; wherefore they give it even to the servants, for it also does not contain much bran. Now this kind is the rarest and the quickest to mature. But there is also a kind which takes two months; this was brought to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=place long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaia</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>; it is not however prolific nor fertile, though as food it is light and sweet. There is another such kind which grows in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a> and especially in the region of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380244PKar class=place long=24.427 lat=38.027>Karystos</a>. There are several kinds that take three months, and these, wherever they are found, are light and not prolific; their growth consists of a single 'reed,' and in general they are not robust. Lightest of all we may say is the Politic wheat; the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> is heavier than most of those imported into Hellas, but heavier still than this is the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=demonym long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotian</a>; in proof of which it is said that the athletes in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a> consume scarcely three pints, while, when they come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, they easily manage five. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconian</a> kind is also light. The reason for these differences is to be found in the respective soils and in the climate; for in Asia not far from <a href=/people/1066 target=_blank>Bactra</a> they say that in a certain place the corn is so vigorous that the grains grow as large as an olive-stone, while in the country called that of the Pissatoi it is so strong that, if a man eats too much of it, he bursts, which was actually the fate of many of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>. There is one curious thing about the corn of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>, which is an exception to the rule as to the lightness of crops raised in three months; for there the hard crops are those of the spring, the soft ones those of the winter; for soft kinds are exceedingly light. Two sowings, as it appears, are made of all corn alike, one in winter and one in spring, at which time they also plant the seed of the pulses. </p>                        </div>

And they say that the erection is complete, when the pile is 180 cubits in circumference, and fifty, or at most- sixty, in height; or again when it is a hundred cubits in circumference and a hundred in height, if the wood happens to be rich in pitch. Having then thus arranged the pile and having covered it in with timber they throw on earth and completely cover it, so that the fire may not by any means show through; for, if this happens, the pitch is ruined. Then they kindle the pile where the passage is left, and then, having filled that part up too with the timber and piled on earth, they mount a ladder and watch wherever they see the smoke pushing its way out, and keep on piling on the earth, so that the fire may not even shew itself. And a conduit is prepared for the pitch right though the pile, so that it may flow into a hole about fifteen cubits off, and the pitch as it flows out is now cold to the touch. The pile burns for nearly two days and nights; for on the second day before sunset it has burnt itself out and the pile has fallen in; for this occurs if the pitch is no longer flowing.

Thus it is said that one should draw three circles round mandrake with a sword, and cut it with one's face towards the west; and at the cutting of the second piece one should dance round the plant and say as many things as possible about the mysteries of love. (This seems to be like the direction given about cummin, that one should utter curses at the time of sowing.) One should also, it is said, draw a circle round the black hellebore and cut it standing towards the east and saying prayers, and one should look out for an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> both on the right and on the left; for that there is danger to those that cut, if your <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> should come near, that they may die within the year.

This plant is marvellous in virtue and is useful for many purposes, but especially for women in child-birth. Its leaf is like pennyroyal, to which it also bears some resemblance in taste; but the twigs are slenderer. They use the leaves, not the twigs nor the fruit: and the leaf is useful for many other purposes, but above all, as was said, against difficult labour in women; for it is said that either it makes labour quite easy or at least it confessedly makes the pains to cease: it is given as a draught in water. It is a scarce plant: for the region which bears it is not extensive, and the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> graze it down because they are fond of it. The story of the arrows is also said to be true, that, if <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> eat it when they have been shot, it rids them of the arrow.

This plant has a leaf like the almond, but smaller, and the flower is red like a rose. The plant itself (which loves hilly country) forms a large bush; the root is red and large, and, if this is dried, it gives off a fragrance like wine. And this does not seem surprising, since there is a sort of 'bouquet' given off by a thing which has the peculiar quality of wine. </p>                        </div>

Thus they say that tripolion according to <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> and <a href=/people/905 target=_blank>Musaeus</a> is useful for every good purpose, wherefore they dig it up by night, camping on the spot. So too what is said of good or fair fame as affected by plants is quite as foolish or more so: for they say that the plant called snapdragon produces fair fame. This plant is like bedstraw but it has no root: and the fruit has what resembles a calf's nostrils. The man who anoints himself with this they say wins fair fame. And they say that the same result follows, if he crowns himself with the flower of gold-flower, sprinkling it with unguent from a vessel of unfired gold. The flower of gold-flower is like gold, the leaf is white. The stem also is white and hard, the root is slender and does not run deep. Men use it in wine against the bites of <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a>, and to make a plaster for burns after burning it and mixing the ashes with honey. Such tales then, as was said before, proceed from men who desire to glorify their own crafts. </p>                        </div>
