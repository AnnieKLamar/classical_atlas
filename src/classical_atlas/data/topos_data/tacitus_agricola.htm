Many indeed considered it rather a matter of self-respect than arrogance to recount their own lives, and a <a href=/people/1250 target=_blank>Rutilius</a> <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a> or an <a href=/people/116 target=_blank>Aemilius</a> <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> could do so without scepticism or disparagement; virtue indeed being most esteemed in those ages which give birth to it most readily. But in this day and age, though I set out to write the life of one already dead, I am forced to seek the indulgence which an attack upon him would not require, so savage is the spirit of these times, and hostile to virtue. </p>                        </div>

We would have lost memory itself as well as speech if to forget were as easy as to be silent. </p>                        </div>

Though it is still in the nature of human frailty that the remedy acts more slowly than the disease, and just as the body is slow to grow, swift to decay, so it is easier to destroy wit and enthusiasm than it is to revive them, while inertia has a certain charm, and the apathy we hate at first we later love. <br />During the space of fifteen years, a large part of a lifetime, change on change did for many, the Emperor’s savagery for others, they being the most resolute: while we few who remain have outlived, so to speak, not merely our neighbours, but ourselves; since those years were stolen from our prime of life, while youths reached age, and old men the very edge of the grave, in silence. <br />Even though my speech is hoarse and unpractised, I shall not hesitate to compose a record of our former slavery, and our present blessings. In the meantime this work’s intention is to honour <a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a>, my father-in-law: and it will be commended for, or at least excused by, its profession of filial affection. </p>                        </div>

Julius <a href=/people/9452 target=_blank>Graecinus</a>, his father, was a Senator noted for his pursuit of rhetoric and philosophy; the very virtues which earned for him <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a>’s anger; ordered to prosecute Marcus <a href=/people/816 target=_blank>Silanus</a> he refused and was put to death. His mother was <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a> Procilla, a woman of rare rectitude. Raised in her loving care he spent his boyhood and youth cultivating all the civilised accomplishments. He was protected from any temptation towards wrongdoing not only by his own sound and virtuous nature but also by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433054PMas class=place long=5.36 lat=43.3>Massilia</a> who provided the foundation to his studies and acted as his guide, he representing a happy mixture of Greek refinement and provincial simplicity. I remember how he used to say himself that when young he was inclined to drink more deeply of philosophy than is acceptable for a Roman and a Senator, his mother’s prudence restraining his glowing passion. No doubt his noble and aspiring mind desired the beauty and splendour of great and glorious ideas with more violence than restraint. Soon age and reason calmed him, and he preserved, as is most difficult, moderation in his studies. </p>                        </div>

Though the leadership and strategy were another’s, though the high command and credit for securing the province were the general’s, yet the young soldier gained skill, experience and a sense of purpose. <a href=/people/1185 target=_blank>Desire</a> for military glory invaded his spirit, unwelcome in an age which looked unfavourably on those who distinguished themselves and where great reputation was no less a danger than ill-repute. </p>                        </div>

The marriage proved a brilliant ornament and a support to him in his career. They lived in wonderful harmony, through their mutual affection and wish to put each other first, a good wife deserving greater praise the more one finds fault with a bad one. <br />The chances of the quaestorship brought him <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> Minor as his province (64AD), and <a href=/people/1677 target=_blank>Salvius</a> <a href=/people/6028 target=_blank>Titianus</a> as his pro-consul, neither of which corrupted him, though the province was rich and open to exploitation, while the proconsul was filled with greed, and ready for anything that would buy mutual silence regarding wrongdoing. There, a daughter (<a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a>, later wife to <a href=/people/3256 target=_blank>Tacitus</a>) was born to him, a help and consolation, since he lost the son he had briefly carried in his arms. <br />He passed the year between his quaestorship and his tribunate of the plebs in peace and quiet, as well as his year (66AD) of office, skilfully surviving <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>’s reign (54-68AD), when it was wise to remain passive. His praestorship (68AD) followed the same even tenor; no judicial duties falling to his lot. As for the games and other vanities of office, he held the mean between lavishness and thrift, far from extravagance on the one hand, closer to public opinion on the other. Chosen by <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a> (June 68AD) to take an inventory of temple treasures his diligent inquiries showed that the State judged there to have been no sacrilege other than that perpetrated by <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>. </p>                        </div>

Thanks to his native shrewdness, <a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a>, though among civilians, dealt with them readily and justly. His official duties and his hours of relaxation were carefully partitioned: when judicial business required it, he was serious, focused and severe, yet more often merciful; when the demands of office had been satisfied there was no further show of power; he eschewed moroseness, arrogance and greed. With him, as is most rare, an easy manner did not serve to diminish his authority nor his severity affection. To refer to the honesty and restraint of such a man is almost to insult virtue itself. Fame which even good men often covet, he never sought, neither by parading his virtues, nor by practising intrigue: incapable of fuelling rivalry with colleagues nor contending with the agents of empire, he thought it inglorious to succeed so, and sordid to be thus contaminated. <br />He was retained for less than three years in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450010RAqu class=place long=1 lat=45>Aquitania</a>, and then recalled with hopes of an immediate consulship, to an accompanying rumour that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a> would be granted him as his province, not that he ever spoke of it, but simply because he seemed suitable. <a href=/people/1271 target=_blank>Rumour</a> is not always in error; sometimes it even determines the choice.

Where earlier writers embellished with rhetoric what was not yet fully discovered, here facts will be faithfully recorded. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a> comprises the largest island known to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, in extent and situation stretching over towards <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germania</a> eastwards and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390000RIbe class=place long=-4 lat=39>Hispania</a> westwards, while to the south it is in sight of Gaul; its northern shores alone have no land facing them, but are washed by wastes of open sea. <a href=/people/1839 target=_blank>Livy</a> the most eloquent of ancient and <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> <a href=/people/3955 target=_blank>Rusticus</a> of modern authors respectively likened its shape to a lengthened shoulder-blade, or a double axe-head.

Under <a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a> a Roman fleet first navigated the shore of the furthest sea (AD84), and confirmed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a> as an island, in the same voyage reaching the unexplored islands known as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/590000IOrc class=place long=-3 lat=59>Orcades</a> and claiming them. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000UThu class=place long=-1.257 lat=60.333>Thule</a> was merely sighted, as their orders took them only thus far, and winter was approaching. But they declared the waves sluggish, resistant to the oar, and likewise unresponsive to the wind, presumably because mountainous land, the cause and origin of storms, is scarcer, and the unbroken mass of deeper water is harder to set in motion. It is not for this work to seek out the nature of the ocean and its tides, besides many have recorded them: I would only add that nowhere has the sea greater power: many currents set in all directions, the tides not merely washing the shore then ebbing, but penetrating the coastline and drowning it, even piercing the mountain chains as though deep in their own element. </p>                        </div>

The outcome of a single battle restored its former submission; though the majority remained under arms, conscious of their failure, and in personal terror of the governor, fearing that despite his virtues he might deal ruthlessly with those who surrendered, punishing them severely as one who never overlooked an injury done to himself. <br /><a href=/people/908 target=_blank>Petronius</a> Turpilianus was therefore appointed to the province (AD61), being less inflexible and new to any prior hostile actions, so more lenient if they repented of them.

Shortly before his arrival, the Ordovices (of North Wales) had almost destroyed one wing of the army, and this initiative had roused the province. Those who desired war approved the action, and were waiting to see the reaction of their new governor. <br /><a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a>, meanwhile, decided to confront the danger, although summer was now ending, his forces were scattered throughout the province, and his soldiers had ceased their campaigns for that year, which would hinder and delay a re-commencement, and despite the majority view which was rather for keeping an eye on the disaffected areas. He concentrated detachments of several legions, plus a small force of auxiliaries, and when the Ordovices refused to venture from the hills, directed the army to them, leading his men, to inspire others to face danger with equal courage. He almost eliminated the whole tribe, and aware of the need to follow up his success after that first campaign, in order to terrorise the rest, he determined to reduce the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/533000IMon class=place long=-4.3333 lat=53.2833>Mona</a> (Anglesey), from whose conquest <a href=/people/2646 target=_blank>Paulinus</a> had been recalled by the wider rebellion in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>. <br />Not having anticipated the action, <a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a> lacked the presence of the fleet: yet through his resourcefulness and determination the straits were bridged. Unloading the baggage train, he selected auxiliaries who knew the shallows, and had the skill in crossing at low tide attributed to their people, maintaining equal control of their own movements, their weapons and the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>; then he launched them suddenly, so as to astonish an enemy who expected ships, a fleet, by sea, and who concluded that nothing seemed difficult or proved impossible to those who waged war in such a way. So they sought peace, and surrendered the island, regarding <a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a> as a great man, a brilliant general, who on entering the province, at the moment others spent in ostentation, courting attention, chose effort and danger. Even now, with success, <a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a> refrained from boastfulness and talk of campaigns or victories, in controlling a conquered nation; nor did he attach laurels to his despatches; yet his deprecation of his achievements, added to them, considering how great his future hopes must have been given his silence regarding so great an outcome. </p>                        </div>

He took hostages from them, and ordered his naval commander to circumnavigate <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>. He granted him forces for the voyage, and terror ran before them. He himself, travelling slowly, so that the very leisureliness of his passage might strike fear into fresh tribes, reached winter quarters. Simultaneously the fleet, favoured by the weather and its reputation, gained the harbour of Trucculum, from which it had previously returned intact after coasting along the adjacent <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=demonym long=-1.5 lat=53>British</a> shoreline. </p>                        </div>

That the name of a private individual should be exalted above that of the Leader, was what he most feared: it was useless to silence the forum’s eloquence, and the noble arts of peace, if another were to grasp military glory. Moreover, while it was easy to ignore other qualities, those of leadership were an Imperial matter. Troubled by these anxieties, but content to keep them secret, a sign of his murderous intent, he decided to conceal his hatred for the time, until the first glow of fame and the army’s plaudits had abated: since <a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a> still held <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>. </p>                        </div>

Receiving a brief embrace, and not a word of enquiry, he melted into the crowd of courtiers. For the rest, to temper his military fame, offensive to the idle, with other virtues, he drank deep of the cup of leisure and tranquillity, modest in his dress, easy in conversation, attended by only one or two friends; so that society, whose habit it is to judge great men by their ostentation, seeing and noting <a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a>, questioned the extent of his reputation, comprehended by few. </p>                        </div>

No crime was responsible for his predicament, no complaint by any victim of an offence; simply an Emperor hostile to virtue, the man’s achievements and, worst of enemies, those who praise. Indeed a period of national troubles followed, in which <a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a> should not have been ignored. Various armies in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440205RMys class=place long=20.5 lat=44>Moesia</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=place long=25 lat=44.5>Dacia</a>, <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=place long=19 lat=45>Pannonia</a> were destroyed by the rashness or inattention of their generals (84-94AD), many battalions and their officers, were defeated and taken captive. Not only was the frontier of empire, the shore of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Danube</a>, in danger, but the winter-quarters of the legions and the retention of whole provinces. So as the losses mounted, and every year witnessed death and disaster, popular voices began to demand <a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a>’s recall. His energy, stamina, and experience in war, was compared everywhere to the inertia and timorousness of the current military hierarchy. Of which mutterings sufficient reached <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>’s ears also; with his freedmen seeking, the best out of love and loyalty, the worst out of malice and jealousy, to influence a leader inclined to prefer the inferior. So <a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a> was pushed precipitously towards the very attention he had avoided, both by his own qualities and others faults. </p>                        </div>

He was approached by certain of those aware of the Leader’s intentions, who were to inquire, as if of their own accord, as to whether <a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a> would accept a province. At first subtly praising peace and retirement, they were soon offering their own aid in support of his excusing himself from office, and finally, without further ado, advising and warning him, dragged him before <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>. The Emperor, ready with his usual dissimulation, assumed a calm demeanour, listened to <a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a>’s request to be excused, nodded in approval, and allowed himself to be thanked, unashamed of granting such a plea out of envy. However he failed to gift <a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a> a governor’s usual salary, conceded by himself on occasion, offended by it not being sought, or out of conscience, not wishing it to appear as if the outcome had been bought. It is characteristic of human nature to hate those you have harmed: but in truth <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>, though irritable by nature, and as unrelenting as he was secretive, was mollified by <a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a>’s moderation and discretion, who neither invited infamy and ruin through defiance or a foolish show of independence. Let those whose way it is to admire only what is rebellious, learn that great men can exist even under bad leaders, and obedience and moderation, if accompanied by industry and vigour, achieve that glory more often realised through dangerous actions, without benefit to the state, and an ostentatious end. </p>                        </div>

No one who heard of his death was gratified or quick to forget him. Adding to the sorrow was a persistent rumour that he had been eliminated by poisoning: I would not venture to claim there is any evidence. However, during <a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a>’s illness, with a frequency unusual in a prince who appears by proxy, his leading freedmen and private physicians visited him, whether out of concern or policy. <br />When the final moment neared, every last breath was communicated to the palace by lines of messengers, none believing it would thus hasten any show of grief in <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>. Yet he did show a kind of sadness in his manner and expression, his hatred tempered by feelings of renewed security, though he always concealed delight more easily than fear. It was evident that when <a href=/people/12009 target=_blank>Agricola</a>’s will was read, naming <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> alongside the best of wives and the most dutiful of daughters, <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> was delighted at the tactful offering.

You would easily have believed him to be a good man, and been glad to think him great. As for the man himself, though snatched away in his prime, he lived a long life if measured by his renown. He achieved those true blessings which reside in virtue; and what more could fortune have granted a man who had been a consul, also, and worn the ornaments of triumph? <br />He could not boast of excessive riches, but had ample wealth.

To be sure we had received his wishes, his last requests to enshrine deeply in our hearts. But this was our sadness, a blow to us, that through the circumstance of our long absence he was lost to us four years before its end.
