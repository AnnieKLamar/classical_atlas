For thou wilt hardly meet with any one else in the city able to serve thee; for we saw most of the rest ascending with the stranger up to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225CKor class=demonym long=22.5217 lat=38.5158>Corycian</a> cave and to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225ULyk class=place long=22.5152 lat=38.4915>Lycorea</a>. <br />BASILOCLES: This same stranger is not only covetous of seeing what may be seen, but wonderfully civil and genteel. <br />PHILINUS: He is besides a great lover of science, and studious to learn. But these are not the only exercises which are to be admired in him. He is a person modest, yet facetious, smart and prudent in dispute, void of all passion and contumacies in his answers; in short, you will say of him at first sight that he is the son of a virtuous father.

But the stranger was but indifferently taken with the form and workmanship of the statues, being one, as it appeared, who had already been a spectator of many rare pieces of curiosity. He admired the beautiful color of the brass, not foul and rusty, but shining with a tincture of blue. What, said he, was it any certain mixture and composition of the ancient artists in brass, like the famous art of giving a keen edge to swords, without which brass could not be used in war? For <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a> brass received its lustre not from art, but by chance, when a fire had devoured some house wherein there was both gold and silver, but of brass the greater plenty; which, being intermixed and melted into one mass, derives its name from the brass, of which there was the greater quantity. Then <a href=/people/2072 target=_blank>Theo</a> interposing said: But we have heard another more remarkable reason than this; how an artist in brass at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>, happening upon a chest full of gold, and fearing to have it divulged, cut the gold into small pieces, and mixed it by degrees with the brass, till he found the more noble metal gave a more than usual lustre to the baser, and so transformed it that he sold at a great rate the unknown mixture, that was highly admired for its beauty and color. But I believe both the one and the other to be fabulous; for by all likelihood this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a> brass was a certain mixture and temperature of metals, prepared by art; just as at this day artisans temper gold and silver together, and make a peculiar and wonderful pale yellow metal; howbeit, in my eye it is of a sickly color and a corrupt hue, without any beauty in the world. </p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/2072 target=_blank>Theo</a> replied: Seeing that of those first and most natural elements, which are and ever will be, — that is to say, fire, air, earth, and water, — there is none that approaches so near to brass or that so closely environs it as air alone, we have most reason to believe that the air occasions it, and that from thence proceeds the difference which brass displays from other metals. Or did you know this even before <a href=/people/1029 target=_blank>Theognis</a> was born, as the comic poet intimates; but would you know by what natural quality or by what virtual power this same air thus colors the brass, being touched and surrounded by it? Yes, said <a href=/people/1624 target=_blank>Diogenianus</a>; and so would I, dear son, replied the worthy <a href=/people/2072 target=_blank>Theo</a>. First then let us endeavor, altogether with submission to your good pleasure, said the first propounder, to find out the reason wherefore of all moistures oil covers brass with rust. For it cannot be imagined that oil of itself causes that defilement, if when first laid on it is clean and pure. By no means, said the young gentleman, in regard the effect seems to proceed from another cause; for the rust appears through the oil, which is thin, pure, and transparent, whereas it is clouded by other more thick and muddy liquors, and so is not able to show itself. It is well said, son, replied the other, and truly; but hear, however, and then consider the reason which <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> produces. I am ready, returned the young gentleman. He says then, answered the other, that the rust insensibly penetrates and dilates itself through other liquids, as being of parts unequal, and of a thin substance; but that it grows to a consistency, and is, as it were, incorporated by the more dense substance of the oil. Now if we could but suppose how this might be done, we should not want a charm to lull this doubt asleep. </p>                        </div>

When we approved this argument, the stranger declared his opinion, that it needed no more than one of those suppositions to clear the doubt; for, said he, that tenuity or subtilty seems to be in some measure contrary to that thickness supposed to be in the air, and therefore there is no reason to suppose it; for the brass, as it grows old, of itself exhales and sends forth that rust, which afterwards, being stopped and fixed by the thickness of the air, becomes apparent by reason of its quantity. Then <a href=/people/2072 target=_blank>Theo</a> replied: and what hinders but that the same thing may be thick and thin both together, like the woofs of silk or fine linen? — of which <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> says: Thin was the stuff, Yet liquid oil ran o'er the tissued woof, intimating the extreme fineness of the texture, yet so close woven that it could not suffer oil to pass through it. In like manner may we make use of the subtilty of the air, not only to scour the brass and fetch the rust out of it, but also to render the color more pleasing and more azure-like, by intermixing light and splendor amidst the blue. </p>                        </div>

I have often wondered, said <a href=/people/1624 target=_blank>Diogenianus</a>, at the meanness and ill-contrived hobbling of the verses which conveyed the ancient oracles into the world. And yet <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> is called the chief of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>; whom it therefore behooved to take no less care of elegancy and beauty in style and language, than of the voice and manner of singing. Besides, he must needs be thought to surpass in a high degree either <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> or <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> in poetic skill. Nevertheless we find several of the oracles lame and erroneous, as well in reference to the measure as to the words. Upon which the poet <a href=/people/1678 target=_blank>Serapio</a>, newly come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, being then in company, said: If we believe that those verses were composed by <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, can we acknowledge what you allege, that they come short of the beauty and elegancy which adorn the writings of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> and <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a>; and shall we not make use of them as examples of neatness and curiosity, correcting our judgment anticipated and forestalled by evil custom? To whom <a href=/people/1395 target=_blank>Boethus</a> the geometer (the person who you know has lately gone over to the camp of <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>) said: Have you not heard the story of <a href=/people/3230 target=_blank>Pauson</a> the painter? Not I, replied <a href=/people/1678 target=_blank>Serapio</a>. It is worth your attention, answered <a href=/people/1395 target=_blank>Boethus</a>. He, having contracted to paint a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> wallowing upon his back, drew the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> galloping at full speed; at which when the person that had agreed with him seemed to be not a little displeased, <a href=/people/3230 target=_blank>Pauson</a> fell a laughing, and turned the picture upside downward; by which means the posture was quite altered, and the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> that seemed to run before lay tumbling now upon the ground. This (as <a href=/people/1168 target=_blank>Bion</a> says) frequently happens to propositions, when they are once inverted; for some will deny the oracles to be elegant, because they come from <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>; others will deny <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> to be the author, because of their rude and shapeless composure. For the one is dubious and uncertain; but this is manifest, that the verses wherein the oracles are generally delivered are no way laboriously studied. Nor can I appeal to a better judge than yourself, whose compositions and poems are not only written so gravely and philosophically, but, for invention and elegancy, more like to those of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> and <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> than the homely <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> raptures. </p>                        </div>

For if the oracles were to be set down in writing, not verbally to be pronounced, surely we should not find fault with the hand, taking it to be <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>'s, because the letters were not so fairly written as in the epistles of kings. For neither the voice, nor the sound, nor the word, nor the metre proceeds from the God, but from the woman.

It is very probable, answered <a href=/people/1395 target=_blank>Boethus</a>; for, to tell you truth, we do not think it sufficient to enclose the Divinity every month in a mortal body, unless we incorporate him with every stone and lump of brass; as if <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> and Chance were not sufficient artists to bring about such accidents and events. Say ye so then? said I.

What so prodigious or unlooked for, either by land or sea, either in respect of cities or men, which, if it be foretold, may not naturally come to pass at one season or other, in process of time? So that such a prophecy, to speak properly, cannot be called a prediction, but a bare speech or report, or rather a scattering or sowing of words in boundless infinity that have no probability or foundation; which, as they rove and wander in the air, <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> accidentally meets, and musters together by chance, to correspond and agree with some event. For, in my opinion, there is a great difference between the coming to pass of what has been said and the saying of what shall happen. For the discourse of things that are not, being already in itself erroneous and faulty, cannot, in justice, claim the honor of after-credit from a fortuitous accident. Nor is it a true sign that the prophet foretells of his certain knowledge, because what he spoke happened to come to pass; in regard there are an infinite number of accidents, that fall in the course of nature, suitable to all events. He therefore that conjectures best, and whom the common proverb avers to be the exactest diviner, is he who finds out what shall happen hereafter, by tracing the footsteps of future probabilities. Whereas these Sibyls and enthusiastic wizards have only thrown into the capacious abyss of time, as into a vast and boundless ocean, whole heaps of words and sentences, comprehending all sorts of accidents and events, which, though some perchance may come to pass, were yet false when uttered, though afterwards by chance they may happen to be true. </p>                        </div>

One fairly guessed that such a captain should get the victory, and he won the field; another cried that such things portended the subversion of such a city, and it was laid in ashes. But when the person does not only foretell the event, but how and when, by what means, and by whom it shall come to pass, this is no hazardous conjecture, but an absolute demonstration, and pre-inspired discovery of what shall come to pass hereafter, and that too by the determined decree of fate, long before it comes to pass. For example, to instance the halting of <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>, beware, though thou art fierce and proud, Lest a lame king thy ancient glories cloud; For then 'twill be thy fate to undergo Tedious turmoils of war, and sudden woe; together with what was prophesied concerning the island which the sea threw up right against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364255PThe class=place long=25.477 lat=36.364>Thera</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365253IThe class=place long=25.3401 lat=36.4524>Therasia</a>; as also the prediction of the war between King <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> and the Romans, When <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> race shall tame <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a> bold, Prodigious wonders shall the world behold; From burning seas shall flames immense ascend; Lightning and whirlwinds hideous rocks shall rend From their foundations, and an island rear, Dreadful to sight and terrible to hear. In vain shall greater strength and valor then Withstand the contemned force of weaker men. Soon after this island shot up out of the ocean, surrounded with flames and boiling surges; and then it was that <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> was overthrown, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> were subdued by the distressed and almost ruined Romans, and that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=ethnic long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aitolians</a>, assisted by the Romans, vanquished <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> King of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=person long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedon</a>. So that it is never to be imagined that these things were the effects of negligent and careless chance; besides, the series and train of events ensuing the prodigy clearly demonstrate the foreknowledge of a prophetic spirit. The same may be said of the prophecy made five hundred years beforehand to the Romans of the time when they should be engaged in war with all the world at once; which happened when their own slaves made war upon their masters. In all this there was nothing of conjecture, nothing of blind uncertainty, nor is there any occasion to grope into the vast obscurity of chance for the reason of these events; but we have many pledges of experience, that plainly demonstrate the beaten path by which destiny proceeds. For certainly there is no man who will believe that ever those events answered accidentally the several circumstances of the prediction; otherwise we may as well say that <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> himself never wrote his book of dogmatic precepts, but that the work was perfected by the accidental meeting and interchange of the letters, one among another. </p>                        </div>

But let us refer these things to the tragical monstrosity of Stoical opinions, and now make some particular reflections touching the extravagant pieces of certain artificers, who, as they are ingenious and elegant in some things, so are no less weakly curious and ambitious in others of their inventions; like him who, designing to signify the dawn of day-light or the hours of sunrise, painted a cock upon the hand of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>. And thus may these <a href=/people/10983 target=_blank>frogs</a> be thought to have been designed by the artist to denote the spring, when the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> begins to exercise his power in the air and to dissolve the winter congealments; at least, if we may believe, as you yourselves affirm, that <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> and the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> are both one God, and not two distinct Deities. Why, said <a href=/people/1678 target=_blank>Serapio</a>, do you think the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> differ the one from the other? Yes, said I, as the Moon differs from the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>. Nay, the difference is somewhat greater. For the Moon neither very often nor from all the world conceals the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>; but the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> is the cause that all men are ignorant of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, by sense withdrawing the rational intellect from that which is to that which appears. </p>                        </div>

It is reported that <a href=/people/868 target=_blank>Alyattes</a>, the father of <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a>, married a second wife, by whom he had other children. This same step-dame, therefore, designing to remove <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> out of the way, gave the woman-baker a dose of poison, with a strict charge to put it in the bread which she made for the young prince.

By which means <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> quietly succeeded his father; when he did no less than acknowledge the fidelity of the woman by making even the God himself a testimony of his gratitude, wherein he did like a worthy and virtuous prince.

Walking therefore to the south side, we took our seats on the steps of the temple toward the shrine of <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Ge</a> (<a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>) and the fountain; insomuch that <a href=/people/1395 target=_blank>Boethus</a> presently told us that the very place itself favored the stranger's question. For formerly there was a shrine of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, close by the source of the rivulet, whence they drew their water for the sacrifices, according to that of <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>: There flows the spring, whose limpid stream supplies The fair-haired <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> water for their hands, Before they touch the hallowed sacrifice.

And therefore <a href=/people/670 target=_blank>Eudoxus</a> erroneously gave credit to those that gave the epithet of Stygian to this water, near which the wiser sort placed the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, as guardians of the springs and assistants to prophecy; as also the shrine of <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Ge</a>, to which the oracle appertained, and where the answers were delivered in verses and songs. And here it was, as some report, that first a certain heroic verse was heard to this effect: Ye birds, bring hither all your plumes; Ye <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>, bring all your wax; which related to the time that the oracle, forsaken by the Deity, lost its veneration. </p>                        </div>

To the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> consulting the oracle concerning their expedition into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, he gave order to send for the priestess of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382234PEry class=place long=23.4032 lat=38.2358>Erythrae</a>; which priestess went by the name of <a href=/people/3186 target=_blank>Hesychia</a>, or repose.

And when <a href=/people/3017 target=_blank>Dinomenes</a> replied, But then, most powerful <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, let it be to their confusion; the God made answer, That also I both grant and promise. The consequence of which was, that <a href=/people/1134 target=_blank>Gelo</a> was troubled with the dropsy during his reign, <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hiero</a> was afflicted with the stone, and the third, <a href=/people/253 target=_blank>Thrasybulus</a>, surrounded with war and sedition, was in a short time expelled his dominions. <a href=/people/960 target=_blank>Procles</a> also, the tyrant of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376232PEpi class=place long=23.1602 lat=37.6335>Epidaurus</a>, after he had cruelly and tyrannically murdered several others, put <a href=/people/296 target=_blank>Timarchus</a> likewise to death, who fled to him for protection from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> with a great sum of money, — after he had pledged him his faith and received him at his first arrival with large demonstrations of kindness and affection, — and then threw his carcass into the sea, enclosed in a pannier.

Upon which the tyrant, understanding that the oracle commanded him either to throw himself into the sea or to bury himself in the earth (in regard that a stag, when he sheds his antlers, scrapes a hole in the ground and hides his ignominy), demurred a while; but at length, seeing the condition of his affairs grew every day worse and worse, he resolved to save himself by flight; at which time the friends of <a href=/people/296 target=_blank>Timarchus</a>, having seized upon his person, slew him and threw his body into the sea.

Nevertheless, some time since a young man, no way vicious and covetous of honor, yet doting upon a new married wife, took upon him the dignity. At first he was very chaste and temperate, and abstained from the woman; but soon after, the young lady coming to give him a visit as he was laid down to rest himself after a brisk dancing and drinking bout, he could not resist the charming temptation. But then, coming to himself and remembering what he had done, perplexed and terrified, he fled to the oracle to consult <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> upon the crime which he had committed; who returned him this answer, All things necessary God permitteth. But should we grant that in our age no oracles are delivered in verse, we should be still doubtful about the ancient times, when the oracles were delivered sometime in verse sometime in prose. Though, whether it be in prose or verse, the oracle is never a whit the falser or the more miraculous, so that we have but a true and religious opinion of the Deity; not irreverently conceiting that formerly he composed a stock of verses to be now repeated by the prophetess, as if he spoke through masks and visors. </p>                        </div>

For the present, therefore, let us only call to mind thus much, that the body makes use of several instruments, and the soul employs the body and its members; the soul being the organ of God. Now the perfection of the organ is to imitate the thing that makes use of it, so far as it is capable, and to exhibit the operation of its thought, according to the best of its own power; since it cannot show it as it is in the divine operator himself, — neat, without any affection, fault, or error whatsoever, — but imperfect and mixed. For of itself, the thing is to us altogether unknown, till it is infused by another and appears to us as fully partaking of the nature of that other. I forbear to mention gold or silver, brass or wax, or whatever other substances are capable to receive the form of an imprinted resemblance. For true it is, they all admit the impression; but still one adds one distinction, another another, to the imitation arising from their presentation itself; as we may readily perceive in mirrors, both plane, concave, and convex, infinite varieties of representations and faces from one and the same original; there being no end of that diversity. But there is no mirror that more exactly represents any shape or form, nor any instrument that yields more obsequiously to the use of Nature, than the Moon herself. And yet she, receiving from the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> his masculine splendor and fiery light, does not transmit the same to us; but when it intermixes with her pellucid substance, it changes color and loses its power. For warmth and heat abandon the pale planet, and her light grows dim before it can reach our sight. And this is that which, in my opinion, <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heraclitus</a> seems to have meant, when he said that the prince who rules the oracle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> neither speaks out nor conceals, but signifies. Add then to these things thus rightly spoken this farther consideration, that the Deity makes use of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> prophetess, so far as concerns her sight and hearing, as the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> makes use of the Moon; for he makes use of a mortal body and an immortal soul as the organs of prediction. Now the body lies dull and immovable of itself; but the soul being restless, when once the soul begins to be in motion, the body likewise stirs, not able to resist the violent agitation of the nimbler spirit, while it is shaken and tossed as in a stormy sea by the tempestuous passions that ruffle within it. For as the whirling of bodies that merely move circularly is nothing violent, but when they move round by force and tend downward by nature, there results from both a confused and irregular circumrotation; thus that divine rapture which is called enthusiasm is a commixture of two motions, wherewith the soul is agitated, the one extrinsic, as by inspiration, the other by nature. For, seeing that as to inanimate bodies, which always remain in the same condition, it is impossible by preternatural violence to offer a force which is contrary to their nature and intended use, as to move a cylinder spherically or cubically, or to make a lyre sound like a flute, or a trumpet like a harp; how is it possible to manage an animate body, that moves of itself, that is indued with reason, will, and inclination, otherwise than according to its pre-existent reason, power, or nature; as (for example) to incline to music a person altogether ignorant and an utter enemy to music, or to make a grammarian of one that never knew his letters, or to make him speak like a learned man that never understood the least tittle of any science in the world? </p>                        </div>

Thus, dost thou not find it to be true, friend <a href=/people/1624 target=_blank>Diogenianus</a>, that when <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> would persuade the Greeks to undertake any enterprise, she brings <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> upon the stage? — when she designs to break the truce, she finds out <a href=/people/1635 target=_blank>Pandarus</a>? — when she designs a rout of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a>, she addresses herself to <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a>? For the one was stout of body and valiant; the other was a good archer, but without brains; the other a shrewd politician and eloquent. For <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> was not of the same opinion with <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a>, at least if it was <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> that made the following verses: Were it the will of Heaven, an ozier bough Were vessel safe enough the seas to plough. For he well knew that there were different abilities and natures designed for different effects, every one of which is qualified with different motions, though there be but one moving cause that gives motion to all. So that the same virtual power which moves the creature that goes upon all four cannot cause it to fly, no more than he that stammers can speak fluently and eloquently, or he that has a feeble squeaking voice can give a loud hollow. Therefore in my opinion it was that <a href=/people/586 target=_blank>Battus</a>, when he consulted the oracle, was sent into Africa, there to build a new city, as being a person who, although he lisped and stammered, had nevertheless endowments truly royal, which rendered him fit for sovereign government. In like manner it is impossible the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> priestess should learn to speak learnedly and elegantly; for, though it cannot be denied but that her parentage was virtuous and honest, and that she always lived a sober and a chaste life, yet her education was among poor laboring people; so that she was advanced to the oracular seat rude and unpolished, void of all the advantages of art or experience. For as it is the opinion of <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, that a virgin ready to be espoused ought to be carried to the bridegroom's house when she has seen and heard as little as possible; so the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> priestess ought to converse with <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, illiterate and ignorant almost of every thing, still approaching his presence with a truly and pure virgin soul. But it is a strange fancy of men; they believe that the God makes use of herons, wrens, and <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crows</a> to signify future events, expressing himself according to their vulgar notes, but do not expect of these birds, although they are the messengers and ambassadors of the God, to deliver their predictions in words clear and intelligible; but they will not allow the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> priestess to pronounce her answers in plain, sincere, and natural expressions, but they demand that she shall speak in the poetical magnificence of high and stately verses, like those of a tragic chorus, with metaphors and figurative phrases, accompanied with the delightful sounds of flutes and hautboys. </p>                        </div>

First then, as hath been said already, that the ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> priestesses pronounced most of their oracles in prose. Secondly, that those ages produced complexions and tempers of body much more prone and inclined to poetry, with which immediately were associated those other ardent desires, affections, and preparations of the mind, which wanted only something of a beginning and a diversion of the fancy from more serious studies, not only to draw to their purpose (according to the saying of <a href=/people/922 target=_blank>Philinus</a>) astrologers and philosophers, but also in the heat of wine and pathetic affections, either of sudden compassion or surprising joy, to slide insensibly into voices melodiously tuned, and to fill banquets with charming odes or love songs, and whole volumes with amorous canzonets and mirthful inventions. Therefore, though <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> tells us, <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a> makes men poets who before no music knew, he does not mean that love infuses music and poetry into men that were not already inclined to those accomplishments, but that it warms and awakens that disposition which lay unactive and drowsy before. Otherwise we might say that now there were no lovers in the world, but that <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Cupid</a> himself was vanished and gone, because that now-a-days there is not one Who now, true archer-like, Lets his poetic raptures fly To praise his mistress's lip or eye, as <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> said. But this were absurd to affirm. For amorous impatiencies torment and agitate the minds of many men not addicted either to music or poetry, that know not how to handle a flute or touch a harp, and yet are no less talkative and inflamed with desire than the ancients. And I believe there is no person who would be so unkind to himself as to say that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAca class=place long=23.707 lat=37.992>Academy</a> or the quires of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> and <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> were void of love, with whose discourses and conferences touching that passion we frequently meet, though they have not left any of their poems behind. And would it not be the same thing to say, there never was any woman that studied courtship but <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a>, nor ever any that were endued with the gift of prophecy but <a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibylla</a> and Aristonica and those that delivered their oracles and sacred raptures in verse? For wine, as saith <a href=/people/2096 target=_blank>Chaeremon</a>, soaks and infuses itself into the manners and customs of them that drink it. Now poetic rapture, like the raptures of love, makes use of the ability of its subject, and moves every one that receives it, according to its proper qualification. </p>                        </div>

For the use of speech seems to be like the exchange of money; that which is good and lawful is commonly current and known, and goes sometimes at a higher, sometimes at a lower value. Thus there was once a time when the stamp and coin of language was approved and passed current in verses, songs, and sonnets; for then all histories, all philosophical learning, all affections and subjects that required grave and solid discussion, were written in poetry and fitted for musical composition. For what now but a few will scarce vouchsafe to hear, then all men listened to, The shepherd, ploughman, and bird-catcher too, as it is in <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a>; all delighted in songs and verses. For such was the inclination of that age and their readiness to versify, that they fitted their very precepts and admonitions to vocal and instrumental music. If they were to teach, they did it in songs fitted to the harp. If they were to exhort, reprove, or persuade, they made use of fables and allegories. And then for their praises of the Gods, their vows, and paeans after victory, they were all composed in verse; by some, as being naturally airy and flowing in their invention; by others, as habituated by custom. And therefore it is not that <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> envies this ornament and elegancy to the science of divination; nor was it his design to banish from the Tripos his beloved <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a>, but rather to introduce her when rejected by others, being rather a lover and kindler of poetic rapture in others, and choosing rather to furnish laboring fancies with imaginations, and to assist them to bring forth the lofty and learned kind of language, as most becoming and most to be admired. But afterwards, when the conversation of men and custom of living altered with the change of their fortunes and dispositions, consuetude expelling and discarding all manner of superfluity rejected also golden top-knots, and silken vestments loosely flowing in careless folds, clipped their long dishevelled locks, and, laying aside their embroidered buskin, taught men to glory in sobriety and frugality in opposition to wantonness and superfluity, and to place true honor in simplicity and modesty, not in pomp and vain curiosity. And then it was that, the manner of writing being quite altered, history alighted from versifying, as it were from riding in chariots, and on foot distinguished truth from fable; and philosophy, in a clear and plain style, familiar and proper to instruct rather than to astonish the world with metaphors and figures, began to dispute and enquire after truth in common and vulgar terms. And then it was, that <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> caused the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> priestess to surcease calling her fellow-citizens fire-inflaming, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>-devourers, men by the name of Oreanes, and rivers by the name of mountain-drainers; and discarding verses, uncouth words, circumlocutions, and obscurity, taught the oracles to speak as the laws discourse to cities, and as princes speak to their people and their subjects, or as masters teach their scholars, appropriating their manner of speech to good sense and persuasive grace. </p>                        </div>

And ever since belief and perspicuity thus associated together, it came to pass by alteration of circumstances that, whereas formerly the vulgar looked with a high veneration upon whatever was extraordinary and extravagant, and conceived a more than common sanctity to lie concealed under the veil of obscurity, afterwards men desirous to understand things clearly and easily, without flowers of circumlocutions and disguisements of dark words, not only began to find fault with oracles enveloped with poetry, as repugnant to the easy understanding of the real meaning, and overshadowing the sentence with mist and darkness, but also suspected the truth of the very prophecy itself which was muffled up in so many metaphors, riddles, and ambiguities, which seemed no better than holes to creep out at and evasions of censure, should the event prove contrary to what had been foretold. And some there were who reported that there were several extempore poets entertained about the Tripos, who were to receive the words as they dropped roughly from the oracle, and presently by virtue of their extempore fancy to model them into verses and measures, that served (as it were) instead of hampers and baskets to convey the answers from place to place. I forbear to tell how far those treacherous deceivers like <a href=/people/3440 target=_blank>Onomacritus</a>, <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> (?), and Cyneso, have contributed to dishonor the sacred oracles, by their interlarding of bombast expressions and high-flown phrases, where there was no necessity of any such alteration. It is also as certain, that those mountebanks, jugglers, impostors, gipsies, and all that altar-licking tribe of vagabonds that set up their throats at the festivals and sacrifices to <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a> and <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Serapis</a>, have highly undervalued poesy; some of them extempore, and others by lottery from certain little books, composing vain predictions, which they may sell to servants and silly women, that easily suffer themselves to be deluded by the overawing charms of serious ambiguity couched in strained and uncouth ballatry. Whence it comes to pass, that poetry, seeming to prostitute itself among cheats and deluders of the people, among mercenary gipsies and mumping charlatans, has lost its ancient credit, and is therefore thought unworthy the honor of the Tripos. </p>                        </div>

For certainly never any private person consulted the oracle when he went to buy a slave or hire workmen; but potent cities, kings and princes, whose undertakings and concernments were of vast and high concernment, and whom it was not expedient for those that had the charge of the oracle to disoblige or incense by the return of answers ungrateful to their ears. For the deity is not bound to observe that law of <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, where he says, <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a> alone, and none but he, Should unto men the prophet be. Therefore, when he makes use of mortal prophets and agents, of whom it behooves him to take a more especial care that they be not destroyed in his service, he does not altogether go about to suppress the truth, but only eclipses the manifestation of it, like a light divided into sundry reflections, rendering it by the means of poetic umbrage less severe and ungrateful in the delivery. For it is not convenient that princes or their enemies should presently know what is by <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a> decreed to their disadvantage. Therefore he so envelops his answers with doubts and ambiguities as to conceal from others the true understanding of what was answered; though to them that came to the oracle themselves, and gave due attention to the deliverer, the meaning of the answer is transparently obvious. Most impertinent therefore are they who, considering the present alteration of things, accuse and exclaim against the Deity for not assisting in the same manner as before. </p>                        </div>

Therefore it behooved those that formerly lived to have extraordinary memories, to retain the marks of places, the times of such and such transactions, the ceremonies of deities beyond the sea, the hidden monuments of heroes, hard to be found in countries far from Greece. For in those expeditions of <a href=/people/11028 target=_blank>Phalanthus</a> and several other admirals of great navies, how many signs were they forced to observe, how many conjectures to make, ere they could find the seat of rest allotted by the oracle! In the observance of which there were some nevertheless that failed, as <a href=/people/586 target=_blank>Battus</a> among others. For he said that he failed because he had not landed in the right place to which he was sent; and therefore returning back he complained to the oracle.

For now we repose altogether in the soft slumbers of peace; all our wars are at an end. There are now no tumults, no civil seditions, no tyrannies, no pestilences nor calamities depopulating Greece, no epidemic diseases needing powerful and choice drugs and medicines. Now, when there is nothing of variety, nothing of mystery, nothing dangerous, but only bare and ordinary questions about small trifles and vulgar things, as whether a man may marry, whether take a voyage by sea, or lend his money safely at interest, — and when the most important enquiries of cities are concerning the next harvest, the increase of their <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, or the health of the inhabitants, — there to make use of verses, ambiguous words, and confounding obscurities, where the questions require short and easy answers, causes us to suspect that the sacred minister studies only cramp expressions, like some ambitious sophist, to wrest admiration from the ignorant. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=person long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> priestess is naturally of a more generous disposition; and therefore, when she is busy with the Deity, she has more need of truth than of satisfying her vain-glory, or of minding either the commendations or the dispraise of men. </p>                        </div>

But on the contrary, being in a quandary and jealousy lest the oracle should lose the reputation it has had for these three thousand years, and lest people should forsake it and forbear going to it, we frame excuses to ourselves, and feign causes and reasons of things which we do not know, and which it is not convenient for us to know; out of a fond design to persuade the persons thus oddly dissatisfied, whom it became us rather to let alone. For certainly the mistake must redound to ourselves, when we shall have such an opinion of our Deity as to approve and esteem those ancient and pithy proverbs of wise men, Know thyself, Nothing to excess, as containing in few words a full and close compacted sentence, and yet find fault with the modern oracle for delivering answers concise and plain. Whereas those apophthegms are like waters crowded and pent up in a narrow room or running between contracted banks, where we can no more discern the bottom of the water than we can the depth and meaning of the sentence. And yet, if we consider what has been written and said concerning those sentences by such as have dived into their signification with an intent to clear their abstruseness, we shall hardly find disputes more prolix than those are. But the language of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> priestess is such as the mathematicians define a right line to be, that is to say, the shortest that may be drawn betwixt two points. So likewise doth she avoid all winding and circles, all double meanings and abstruse ambiguities, and proceed directly to the truth. And though she has been obnoxious to strict examination, yet is she not to be misconstrued without danger, nor could ever any person to this very day convict her of falsehood; but on the other side, she has filled the oracle with presents, gifts, and offerings, not only of the Greeks but barbarians, and adorned it with the magnificent structures and fabrics of the <a href=/people/371 target=_blank>Amphictyons</a>. And we find many additions of new buildings, many reparations of the old ones that were fallen down or decayed by time. And as we see from trees overgrown with shade and verdant boughs other lesser shoots sprout up; thus has the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphian</a> concourse afforded growth and grandeur to the assembly of the <a href=/people/371 target=_blank>Amphictyons</a>, which is fed and maintained by the abundance and affluence arising from thence, and has the form and show of magnificent shrines, stately meetings, and sacred waters; which, but for the ceremonies of the altar, would not have been brought to perfection in a thousand years. And to what other cause can we attribute the fertility of the Galaxion in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a> but to their vicinity to this oracle, and to their being blessed with the neighboring influences of the Deity, where from the well-nourished udders of the bleating ewes milk flows in copious streams, like water from so many fountain-heads? Their pails run o'er, and larger vessels still With rich abundance all their dairies fill. To us appear yet more clear and remarkable signs of the Deity's liberality, while we behold the glory of far-famed store and plenty overflowing former penury and barrenness. And I cannot but think much the better of myself for having in some measure contributed to these things with <a href=/people/331 target=_blank>Polycrates</a> and Petraeus. Nor can I less admire the first author and promoter of this good order and management. And yet it is not to be thought that such and so great change should come to pass in so small a time by human industry, without the favor of the Deity assisting and blessing his oracle. </p>                        </div>
