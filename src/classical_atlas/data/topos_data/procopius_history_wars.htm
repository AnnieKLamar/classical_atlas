The memory of these events he deemed would be a great thing and most helpful to men of the present time, and to future generations as well, in case time should ever again place men under a similar stress. For men who purpose to enter upon a war or are preparing themselves for any kind of struggle may derive some benefit from a narrative of a similar situation in history, inasmuch as this discloses the final result attained by men of an earlier day in a struggle of the same sort, and foreshadows, at least for those who are most prudent in planning, what outcome present events will probably have. </p>                        </div>

For in them more remarkable feats have been performed than in any other wars with which we are acquainted; unless, indeed, any reader of this narrative should give the place of honour to antiquity, and consider contemporary achievements unworthy to be counted remarkable. There are those, for example, who call the soldiers of the present day bowmen, (toxotai) while to those of the most ancient times they wish to attribute such lofty terms as hand-to-hand fighters (anchemachoi), shield-men, and other names of that sort; and they think that the valour of those times has by no means survived to the present,—an opinion which is at once careless and wholly remote from actual experience of these matters. For the thought has never occurred to them that, as regards the Homeric bowmen who had the misfortune to be ridiculed by this term derived from their art, they were neither carried by <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> nor protected by spear or shield. In fact there was no protection at all for their bodies; they entered battle on foot, and were compelled to conceal themselves, either singling out the shield of some comrade, or seeking safety behind a tombstone on a grave mound, </p>                        </div>

Least of all could they participate in a decisive struggle in the open, but they always seemed to be stealing something which belonged to the men who were engaged in the struggle. And apart from this they were so indifferent in their practice of archery that they drew the bowstring only to the breast, so that the missile sent forth was naturally impotent and harmless to those whom it hit. Such, it is evident, was the archery of the past. But the bowmen of the present time go into battle wearing corselets and fitted out with greaves which extend up to the knee. From the right side hang their arrows, from the other the sword. And there are some who have a spear also attached to them and, at the shoulders, a sort of small shield without a grip, such as to cover the region of the face and neck. They are expert horsemen, and are able without difficulty to direct their bows to either side while riding at full speed, and to shoot an opponent whether in pursuit or in flight. They draw the bowstring along by the forehead about opposite the right ear, thereby charging the arrow with such an impetus as to kill whoever stands in the way, shield and corselet alike </p>                        </div>

These men would rise against the government, and, after destroying <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, would make themselves tyrants without difficulty, since the boy had no kinsman in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> to be his guardian.

When <a href=/people/4862 target=_blank>Arcadius</a> was confronted with this difficult situation, though he had not shewn himself sagacious in other matters, he devised a plan which was destined to preserve without trouble both his child and his throne, either as a result of conversation with certain of the learned men, such as are usually found in numbers among the advisers of a sovereign, or from some divine inspiration which came to him. For in drawing up the writings of his will, he designated the child as his successor to the throne, but appointed as guardian over him Isdigerdes, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=person long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> King, enjoining upon him earnestly in his will to preserve the empire for <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> by all his power and foresight.

This army the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> were quite unwilling to encounter, and they made haste to flee in every direction.

Even as he was considering this matter, chance brought it about that, without dishonouring the law, he could still keep his word. For the first man who came to him happened to be Adergoudounbades, a young man who was a relative of Gousanastades and an especially capable warrior. He addressed <a href=/people/12226 target=_blank>Cabades</a> as Lord, and was the first to do obeisance to him as king, and besought him to use him as a slave for any service whatever. 488 A.D. </p>                        </div>

And he was favoured by a piece of good fortune; for the defence of the very tower which happened to be nearest to the passage had fallen by lot to those of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> who are most careful in their observances, whom they call monks. These men, as chance would have it, were keeping some annual religious festival to God on that day. When night came on they all felt great weariness on account of the festival, and, having sated themselves with food and drink beyond their wont, they fell into a sweet and gentle sleep, and were consequently quite unaware of what was going on. So the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> made their way through the passage inside the fortifications, a few at a time, and, mounting the tower, they found the monks still sleeping and slew them to a man. When <a href=/people/12226 target=_blank>Cabades</a> learned this, he brought his ladders up to the wall close by this tower. It was already day. And those of the townsmen who were keeping guard on the adjoining tower became aware of the disaster, and ran thither with all speed to give assistance. </p>                        </div>

And the general promised that he should have everything he desired, and thus dismissed the fellow. He then tore his garments in a dreadful manner, and, assuming the aspect of one who had been weeping, entered the city. And coming before Glones, and tearing his hair he said: O Master, I happened to be bringing in for you all the good things from my village, when some Roman soldiers chanced upon me (for, as you know, they are constantly wandering about the country here in small bands and doing violence to the miserable country-folk), and they inflicted upon me blows not to be endured, and, taking away everything, they departed,—the robbers, whose ancient custom it is to fear the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and to beat the farmers.

For neither could they retire to the rear, since their opponents were behind them, nor were they able to flee anywhere else in a hostile land. But as well as they could under the circumstances, they arrayed themselves for battle and tried to drive back their assailants; but being at a great disadvantage in numbers they were vanquished, and all of them together with Glones were destroyed. Now when the son of Glones learned of this, being deeply grieved and at the same time furious with anger because he had not been able to defend his father, he fired the sanctuary of Symeon, a holy man, where Glones had his lodging.

And not even with this did they begin any fighting, but when we did not join battle with them at all, joyfully and considering that matters had gone better for them than they had hoped, they withdrew to the wall. For this reason too it happened that they were not thrown into confusion, for they had not yet come into the dangers of battle. But if the fighting comes to close quarters, fear will seize upon them, and this, together with their inexperience, will throw them, in all probability, into their customary disorder. Such, therefore, is the case with regard to the enemy; but do you, O men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, call to mind the judgment of the King of Kings.

For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> come against us basing their confidence on nothing else than our disorder. But this time also they will be disappointed in this hope, and will depart just as in the previous encounter. And as for the great numbers of the enemy, by which more than anything else they inspire fear, it is right for you to despise them. For their whole infantry is nothing more than a crowd of pitiable peasants who come into battle for no other purpose than to dig through walls and to despoil the slain and in general to serve the soldiers. For this reason they have no weapons at all with which they might trouble their opponents, and they only hold before themselves those enormous shields in order that they may not possibly be hit by the enemy.

In this place from the beginning lived barbarians, the Tzanic nation, subject to no one, called Sani in early times; they made plundering expeditions among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who lived round about, maintaining a most difficult existence, and always living upon what they stole; for their land produced for them nothing good to eat. Wherefore also the Roman emperor sent them each year a fixed amount of gold, with the condition that they should never plunder the country thereabout. And the barbarians had sworn to observe this agreement with the oaths peculiar to their nation, and then, disregarding what they had sworn, they had been accustomed for a long time to make unexpected attacks and to injure not only the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a>, but also the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who lived next to them as far as the sea; then, after completing their inroad in a short space of time, they would immediately betake themselves again to their homes. And whenever it so happened that they chanced upon a Roman army, they were always defeated in the battle, but they proved to be absolutely beyond capture owing to the strength of their fastnesses. In this way Sittas had defeated them in battle before this war; and then by many manifestations of kindness in word and in deed he had been able to win them over completely. For they changed their manner of life to one of a more civilized sort, and enrolled themselves among the Roman troops, and from that time they have gone forth against the enemy with the rest of the Roman army. They also abandoned their own religion for a more righteous faith, and all of them became <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>.

For the water is covered by a bog of great depth, extending about fifty stades in length and twenty in breadth; and reeds grow in this mud in great abundance. But the earth there is of such a hard sort that it seems to those who chance upon it to be nothing else than solid ground, so that both pedestrians and horsemen travel over it without any fear. Nay more, even wagons pass over the place in great numbers every day, but they are wholly insufficient to shake the bog or to find a weak spot in it at any point. The natives burn the reeds every year, to prevent the roads being stopped up by them, and once, when an exceedingly violent wind struck the place, it came about that the fire reached the extremities of the roots, and the water appeared at a small opening; but in a short time the ground closed again, and gave the spot the same appearance which it had had before.

Then the man perceived that he was not satisfying the oracle by doing these things, and he again went about looking everywhere and found a certain spot in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a> very closely resembling the one among the <a href=/people/2942 target=_blank>Taurians</a>.

For this is not likely and besides it is not in keeping with the course of human events, but this idea is most unfortunate for those who are possessed by it. For when men who expect that all the good things will come to them fail at any time, if it so happen, they are distressed more than is seemly by the very hope which wrongly led them on. Therefore, since men have not always confidence in fortune, they do not enter into the danger of war in a straightforward way, even if they boast that they surpass the enemy in every respect, but by deception and divers devices they exert themselves to circumvent their opponents.

And he guarded the land from plunder constantly, for both to the barbarians over whom he ruled and no less to the enemy, Abochorabus always seemed a man to be feared and an exceptionally energetic fellow.

Formerly this was not the limit of the Roman empire, but it lay beyond there as far as one would advance in a seven days' journey; but the Roman Emperor <a href=/people/1446 target=_blank>Diocletian</a> came there, and observed that the tribute from these places was of the smallest possible account, since the land is at that point extremely narrow (for rocks rise to an exceedingly great height at no great distance from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> and spread over the rest of the country), while a very large body of soldiers had been stationed there from of old, the maintenance of which was an excessive burden upon the public; and at the same time the Nobatae who formerly dwelt about the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/255307UOas class=place long=30.7305 lat=25.5968>Oasis</a> used to plunder the whole region; so he persuaded these barbarians to move from their </p>                        </div>

It was necessary, therefore, that the chanaranges should come speedily to meet him as he returned, in order that he might confer with him and give him all the directions which would be of advantage to the army, and that he should bid his attendants travel behind him on the road. When the chanaranges received this message, he was overjoyed at the honour shown him by the king, and in complete ignorance of his own evil plight, he immediately carried out the instructions.

Thus, then, these two men betook themselves to their homes, and, as long as it was night, they remained there quietly. <br />But on the following day at sunrise it became known to the people that both men had quit the palace where they had been staying. So the whole population ran to them, and they declared <a href=/people/4562 target=_blank>Hypatius</a> emperor and prepared to lead him to the market-place to assume the power. But the wife of <a href=/people/4562 target=_blank>Hypatius</a>, Mary, a discreet woman, who had the greatest reputation for prudence, laid hold of her husband and would not let go, but cried out with loud lamentation and with entreaties to all her kinsmen that the people were leading him on the road to death. But since the throng overpowered her, she unwillingly released her husband, and he by no will of his own came to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290ACCn class=place long=28.97127 lat=41.00849>Forum of Constantine</a>, where they summoned him to the throne; </p>                        </div>

By this time the members of the senate were assembling,—as many of them as had not been left in the emperor's residence,—and many expressed the opinion that they should go to the palace to fight. But Origenes, a man of the senate, came forward and spoke as follows: Fellow <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, it is impossible that the situation which is upon us be solved in any way except by war. Now war and royal power are agreed to be the greatest of all things in the world. But when action involves great issues, it refuses to be brought to a successful conclusion by the brief crisis of a moment, but this is accomplished only by wisdom of thought and energy of action, which men display for a length of time. Therefore if we should go out against the enemy, our cause will hang in the balance, and we shall be taking a risk which will decide everything in a brief space of time; and, as regards the consequences of such action, we shall either fall down and worship <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> or reproach her altogether. For those things whose issue is most quickly decided, fall, as a rule, under the sway of fortune. But if we handle the present situation more deliberately, not even if we wish shall we be able to take <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> in the palace, but he will very speedily be thankful if he is allowed to flee; for authority which is ignored always loses its power, since its strength ebbs away with each day.

So spoke Origenes. But the rest, as a crowd is accustomed to do, insisted more excitedly and thought that the present moment was opportune, and not least of all <a href=/people/4562 target=_blank>Hypatius</a> (for it was fated that evil should befall him) bade them lead the way to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362BHiA class=place long=36.1717 lat=36.2269>hippodrome</a>. But some say that he came there purposely, being well-disposed toward the emperor. <br />Now the emperor and his court were deliberating as to whether it would be better for them if they remained or if they took to flight in the ships. And many opinions were expressed favouring either course. And the Empress <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> also spoke to the following effect: As to the belief that a woman ought not to be daring among men or to assert herself boldly among those who are holding back from fear, I consider that the present crisis most certainly does not permit us to discuss whether the matter should be regarded in this or in some other way. For in the case of those whose interests have come into the greatest danger nothing else seems best except to settle the issue immediately before them in the best possible way. My opinion then is that the present time, above all others, is inopportune for flight, even though it bring safety. For while it is impossible for a man who has seen the light not also to die, for one who has been an emperor it is unendurable to be a fugitive. May I never be separated from this purple, and may I not live that day on which those who meet me shall not address me as mistress.

When the queen had spoken thus, all were filled with boldness, and, turning their thoughts towards resistance, they began to consider how they might be able to defend themselves if any hostile force should come against them. Now the soldiers as a body, including those who were stationed about the emperor's court, were neither well disposed to the emperor nor willing openly to take an active part in fighting, but were waiting for what the future would bring forth. All the hopes of the emperor were centred upon <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and <a href=/people/12180 target=_blank>Mundus</a>, of whom the former, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, had recently returned from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> war bringing with him a following which was both powerful and imposing, and in particular he had a great number of spearmen and guards who had received their training in battles and the perils of warfare. <a href=/people/12180 target=_blank>Mundus</a> had been appointed general of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a>, and by mere chance had happened to come under summons to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> on some necessary errand, bringing with him <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Erulian</a> barbarians. <br />When <a href=/people/4562 target=_blank>Hypatius</a> reached the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362BHiA class=place long=36.1717 lat=36.2269>hippodrome</a>, he went up immediately to where the emperor is accustomed to take his place and seated himself on the royal throne from which the emperor was always accustomed to view the equestrian and athletic contests.

But since the soldiers had decided to support neither side, until one of them should be manifestly victorious, they pretended not to hear at all and thus put him off. So <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> returned to the emperor and declared that the day was lost for them, for the soldiers who guarded the palace were rebelling against him. The emperor therefore commanded him to go to the so-called Bronze Gate and the propylaea there. So <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, with difficulty and not without danger and great exertion, made his way over ground covered by ruins and half-burned buildings, and ascended to the stadium. And when he had reached the Blue Colonnade which is on the right of the emperor's throne, he purposed to go against <a href=/people/4562 target=_blank>Hypatius</a> himself first; but since there was a small door there which had been closed and was guarded by the soldiers of <a href=/people/4562 target=_blank>Hypatius</a> who were inside, he feared lest while he was struggling in the narrow space the populace should fall upon him, and after destroying both himself and all his followers, should proceed with less trouble and difficulty against the emperor.

But the populace, who were standing in a mass and not in order, at the sight of armoured soldiers who had a great reputation for bravery and experience in war, and seeing that they struck out with their swords unsparingly, beat a hasty retreat. Then a great outcry arose, as was natural, and <a href=/people/12180 target=_blank>Mundus</a>, who was standing not far away, was eager to join in the fight,—for he was a daring and energetic fellow—but he was at a loss as to what he should do under the circumstances; when, however, he observed that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was in the struggle, he straightway made a sally into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362BHiA class=place long=36.1717 lat=36.2269>hippodrome</a> through the entrance which they call the Gate of <a href=/people/257 target=_blank>Death</a>. Then indeed from both sides the partisans of <a href=/people/4562 target=_blank>Hypatius</a> were assailed with might and main and destroyed. When the rout had become complete and there had already been great slaughter of the populace, Boraedes and <a href=/people/1511 target=_blank>Justus</a>, nephews of the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, without anyone daring to lift a hand against them, dragged <a href=/people/4562 target=_blank>Hypatius</a> down from the throne, and, leading him in, handed him over together with <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> to the emperor. And there perished among the populace on that day more than thirty thousand. But the emperor commanded the two prisoners to be kept in severe confinement. Then, while <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> was weeping and uttering pitiable words (for the man was wholly inexperienced in such misfortunes), <a href=/people/4562 target=_blank>Hypatius</a> reproached him at length and said that those who were about to die unjustly should not lament.

Later, however, he restored to the children of <a href=/people/4562 target=_blank>Hypatius</a> and <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> and to all others the titles which they had formerly held, and as much of their property as he had not happened to bestow upon his friends.

And the empress, hearing the whole account from Antonina, expressed approval of what she had planned, and by her exhortations raised her enthusiasm to a much higher pitch still. <br />When the appointed day was at hand, Antonina bade the empress farewell and departed from the city, and she went to Rufinianae, as if to begin on the following day her journey to the East; hither too came John at night in order to carry out the plan which had been agreed upon.

All his property was immediately confiscated to the public treasury, but a large proportion of this the emperor remitted to him, for he was still inclined to spare him. There it was possible for John to live, disregarding all dangers and enjoying great wealth, both that which he himself had concealed and that which by the decision of the emperor remained with him, and to indulge in luxury at his pleasure, and, if he had reasoned wisely, to consider his present lot a happy one. </p>                        </div>

And while John had not been clearly convicted as guilty of the murder of <a href=/people/1157 target=_blank>Eusebius</a>, it seemed that God's justice was exacting from him the penalties of the world.

But the blow which had been dealt him was not a fatal one, this account goes on to say, and he fled with a great outcry and suddenly fell among these very soldiers.

But since the emperor kept assailing him with frequent reproaches for his hesitation, led on by the slanders of Adolius, the son of <a href=/people/2703 target=_blank>Acacius</a>, Sittas at last made his preparations for the conflict.

And the tribe called the Aspetiani, great in power and in numbers, was willing to join him. And they went to Sittas and begged him to give them pledges in writing that, if they abandoned their kinsmen in the battle and came to the Roman army, they should remain entirely free from harm, retaining their own possessions.

But by some chance those who carried the tablets went by another road and did not succeed at all in meeting the Aspetiani. Moreover a portion of the Roman army happened upon some few of them, and not knowing the agreement which had been made, treated them as enemies. And Sittas himself caught some of their women and children in a cave and slew them, either because he did not understand what had happened or because he was angry with the Aspetiani for not joining him as had been agreed. <br />But they, being now possessed with anger, arrayed themselves for battle with all the rest.

He therefore commanded that they should either cut off the rock by making a deep ditch along the wall, lest anyone should essay to mount from there upon the fortifications, or that they should build upon it a great tower and connect its structure with the wall of the city. But to the architects of public buildings it seemed that neither one of these things should be done. For, as they said, the work would not be completed in a short time with the attack of the enemy so imminent, while if they began this work and did not carry it to completion, they would do nothing else than shew to the enemy at what point in the wall they should make their attack. Germanus, though disappointed in this plan, had some hope at first because he expected an army from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. </p>                        </div>

Some of the population of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> thereupon departed from there with their money and fled as each one could.

Not long after this the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> army also came. There they all pitched their tents and made camp fronting on the River <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361360WOro class=place long=35.9902 lat=36.0677>Orontes</a> and not very far from the stream. <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> then sent <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> up beside the fortifications and demanded money from the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, saying that for ten centenaria of gold he would depart from there, and it was obvious that he would accept even less than this for his withdrawal. And on that day their ambassadors went before <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>, and after speaking at length concerning the breaking of the peace and hearing much from him, they retired. But on the morrow the populace of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> (for they are not seriously disposed, but are always engaged in jesting and disorderly performance) heaped insults upon <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> from the battlements and taunted him with unseemly laughter; and when <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> came near the fortifications and exhorted them to purchase freedom for themselves and the city for a small </p>                        </div>

On account of this <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>, boiling with anger, decided to storm the wall. <br />On the following day, accordingly, he led up all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> against the wall and commanded a portion of the army to make assaults at different points along the river, and he himself with the most of the men and best troops directed an attack against the height. For at this place, as has been stated by me above, the wall of fortification was most vulnerable. Thereupon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, since the structure on which they were to stand when fighting was very narrow, devised the following remedy. Binding together long timbers they suspended them between the towers, and in this way they made these spaces much broader, in order that still more men might be able to ward off the assailants from there. So the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, pressing on most vigorously from all sides, were sending their arrows thickly everywhere, and especially along the crest of the hill. Meanwhile the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were fighting them back with all their strength, not soldiers alone, but also many of the most courageous youths of the populace. But it appeared that those who were attacking the wall there were engaged in a battle on even terms with their enemy. For the rock which was broad and high and, as it were, drawn up against the fortifications caused the conflict to be just as if on level ground. And if anyone of the Roman army had had the courage to get outside the fortifications with three hundred men and to anticipate the enemy in seizing this rock and to ward off the assailants </p>                        </div>

For the barbarians had no point from which they could have conducted their assault, for they would be exposed to missiles from above both from the rock and from the wall; but as it was (for it was fated that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> be destroyed by this army of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>), this idea occurred to no one. So then while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> were fighting beyond their power, since <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> was present with them and urging them on with a mighty cry, giving their opponents not a moment in which to look about or guard against the missiles discharged from their bows, and while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, in great numbers and with much shouting, were defending themselves still more vigorously, the ropes with which the beams had been bound together, failing to support the weight, suddenly broke asunder and the timbers together with all those who had taken their stand on them fell to the ground with a mighty crash. When this was heard by other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> also, who were fighting from the adjoining towers, being utterly unable to comprehend what had happened, but supposing that the wall at this point had been destroyed, they beat a hasty retreat. Now many young men of the populace who in former times had been accustomed to engage in factional strife with each other in the hippodromes descended into the city from the fortification wall, but they refused to flee and remained where they were, while the soldiers with Theoctistus and Molatzes straightway leaped upon the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> which happened to be ready there and rode away to the gates, telling the others a tale to the effect that Bouzes had come with an army and they wished to </p>                        </div>

Thereupon many of the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> and all the women with their children made a great rush toward the gates; but since they were crowded by the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, being in very narrow quarters, they began to fall down. The soldiers, however, sparing absolutely no one of those before them, all kept riding over the fallen still more fiercely than before, and a great many were killed there, especially about the gates themselves. <br />But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, with no one opposing them, set ladders against the wall and mounted with no difficulty. And quickly reaching the battlements, for a time they were by no means willing to descend, but they seemed like men looking about them and at a loss what to do, because, as it seems to me, they supposed that the rough ground was beset with some ambuscades of the enemy. For the land inside the fortifications which one traverses immediately upon descending from the height is an uninhabited tract extending for a great distance and there are found there rocks which rise to a very great height, and steep places.

Now at that time the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/354364PApa class=place long=36.4017 lat=35.4195>Apamea</a>, upon learning that the army of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> was coming against them, began to be in great fear. And when they heard that <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> was absolutely untruthful, they came to <a href=/people/6014 target=_blank>Thomas</a>, the chief priest of the city, and begged him to shew them the wood of the cross, in order that after worshipping it for the last time they might die. And he did as they requested. </p>                        </div>

For while the priest was carrying the wood and shewing it, above him followed a flame of fire, and the portion of the roof over him was illuminated with a great and unaccustomed light. And while the priest was moving through every part of the temple, the flame continued to advance with him, keeping constantly the place above him in the roof. So the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/354364PApa class=place long=36.4017 lat=35.4195>Apamea</a>, under the spell of joy at the miracle, were wondering and rejoicing and weeping, and already all felt confidence concerning their safety. And <a href=/people/6014 target=_blank>Thomas</a>, after going about the whole temple, laid the wood of the cross in the chest and covered it, and suddenly the light had ceased. Then upon learning that the army of the enemy had come close to the city, he went in great haste to <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>. And when the king enquired of the priest whether it was the will of the citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/354364PApa class=place long=36.4017 lat=35.4195>Apamea</a> to marshal themselves on the wall against the army of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, the priest replied that no such thing had entered the minds of the men. Therefore, said <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>, receive me into the city accompanied by a few men with all the gates opened wide. And the priest said Yes, for I have come here to invite thee to do this very thing. So the whole army pitched their tents and made camp before the fortifications. <br />Then <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> chose out two hundred of the best of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and entered the city.

And I believe that he would not have shrunk from enslaving and plundering the whole city, unless some divine providence had manifestly prevented him; to such a degree did avarice overpower him and the desire of fame turn his mind. For he thought the enslavement of the cities a great glory for himself, considering it absolutely nothing that disregarding treaties and compacts he was performing such deeds against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. This attitude of <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> will be revealed by what he undertook to do concerning the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372410UDar class=place long=40.953 lat=37.1772>Daras</a> during his withdrawal at this same time, when he treated his agreements with absolute disregard, and also by what he did to the citizens of <a href=/people/2600 target=_blank>Callinicus</a> a little later in time of peace, as will be told by me in the following narrative.

Now as for this chest (since it is adorned with gold and precious stones), we do not begrudge thy taking it and keeping it with all the rest, but this wood here, it is our salvation and precious to us, this, I beg and entreat thee, give to me.

And he himself went up there also, eager to be a spectator of the performances. And since he had heard long before that the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> was extraordinarily fond of the Venetus colour, which is blue, wishing to go against him there also, he was desirous of bringing about victory for the green. So the charioteers, starting from the barriers, began the contest, and by some chance he who was clad in the blue happened to pass his rival and take the lead. And he was followed in the same tracks by the wearer of the green colour. And <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>, thinking that this had been done purposely, was angry, and he cried out with a threat that the Caesar had wrongfully surpassed the others, and he commanded that the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> which were running in front should be held up, in order that from then on they might contend in the rear; and when this had been done just as he commanded, then <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> and the green faction were accounted victorious. At that time one of the citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/354364PApa class=place long=36.4017 lat=35.4195>Apamea</a> came before <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> and accused a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> of entering his house and violating his maiden daughter. Upon hearing this, <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>, boiling with anger, commanded that the man should be brought. And when he came before him, he directed that he should be impaled in the camp. And when the people learned this, they raised a mighty shout as loud as they could, demanding that the man be saved from the king's anger. And <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> promised that he would release the man to them, but he secretly impaled him not long afterwards.

For he was led on to this by a saying of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, and it kept irritating his mind, because they maintained that it could not be taken, for the following reason. There was a certain Augarus (Abgar) in early times, toparch of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371388UEde class=place long=38.7844 lat=37.1455>Edessa</a> (for thus the kings of the different nations were called then). Now this Augarus was the most clever of all men of his time, and as a result of this was an especial friend of the Emperor <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>. For, desiring to make a treaty with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; and when he conversed with <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, he so astonished him by the abundance of his wisdom that <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> wished never more to give up his company; for he was an ardent lover of his conversation, and whenever he met him, he was quite unwilling to depart from him. A long time, therefore, was consumed by him in this visit. And one day when he was desirous of returning to his native land and was utterly unable to persuade <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> to let him go, he devised the following plan. He first went out to hunt in the country about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; for it happened that he had taken considerable interest in the practice of this sport.

Then Augustus went up into the hippodrome and seated himself as was his wont, and Augarus came before him and displayed the earth and the animals, telling over from what district each portion of earth was and what animals they were. Then he gave orders to put the earth in different parts of the hippodrome, and to gather all the animals into one place and then to release them. So the attendants did as he directed. And the animals, separating from each other, went each to that portion of earth which was from the district in which it itself had been taken. And <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> looked upon the performance carefully for a very long time, and he was wondering that nature untaught makes animals miss their native land. Then Augarus, suddenly laying hold upon his knees, said: But as for me, O Master, what thoughts dost thou think I have, who possess a wife and children and a kingdom, small indeed, but in the land of my fathers? And the emperor, overcome and compelled by the truth of his saying, granted not at all willingly that he should go away, and bade him ask besides whatever he wished.

And as for me, since I am human, and have come here from the West after a long interval, it is impossible that some of the necessary things should not escape me. So it behoves you, without any too modest regard for my opinion, to say outright whatever is going to be of advantage for ourselves and for the emperor. Now in the beginning, fellow officers, we came here in order to prevent the enemy from making any invasion into our land, but at the present time, since things have gone better for us than we had hoped, it is possible for us to make his land the subject of our deliberation.

When <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> ascertained that the Roman army was in that place with John, he sent an army and a general, Aniabedes, against them in order to capture the place at the first onset.

And it has only one approach on the level ground, and that not very broad; for exceedingly high cliffs overhang it on either side. At that point those who formerly built the city provided that that portion of the wall should not be open to attack by making long walls which ran along beside either cliff and guarded the approach for a great distance. And they built two towers, one in each of these walls, not following the customary plan, but as follows. They refused to allow the space in the middle of the structure to be empty, but constructed the entire towers from the ground up to a great height of very large stones which fitted together, in order that they might never be shaken down by a ram or any other engine. Such, then, are the fortifications of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418418FPet class=place long=41.7538 lat=41.7681>Petra</a>.

For they, coming out from their stronghold against us, in case of success, should it so happen, will feel unlimited confidence in assailing us, and in case of defeat they will easily escape from our attack. For we shall only be able to pursue them a short distance, and from this no harm will come to the city, which you surely see cannot be captured by storming the wall when soldiers are defending it. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly he broke camp and moved forward with the whole army. And after accomplishing a day's journey, they came upon a fortress which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> call Sisauranon.

It was natural, therefore, that not one of those who had contracted the disease expected to die from it.

But from then on very marked differences developed; and I am unable to say whether the cause of this diversity of symptoms was to be found in the difference in bodies, or in the fact that it followed the wish of Him who brought the disease into the world. For there ensued with some a deep coma, with others a violent delirium, and in either case they suffered the characteristic symptoms of the disease. For those who were under the spell of the coma forgot all those who were familiar to them and seemed to be sleeping constantly. And if anyone cared for them, they would eat without waking, but some also were neglected, and these would die directly through lack of sustenance. But those who were seized with delirium suffered from insomnia and were victims of a distorted imagination; for they suspected that men were coming upon them to destroy them, and they would become excited and rush off in flight, crying out at the top of their voices. And those who were attending them were in a state of constant exhaustion and had a most difficult time of it throughout. For this reason everybody pitied them no less than the sufferers, not because they were threatened by the pestilence in going near it (for neither physicians nor other persons were found to contract this malady through contact with the sick or with the dead, for many who were constantly engaged either in burying or in attending those in no way connected with them </p>                        </div>

For when the patients fell from their beds and lay rolling upon the floor, they, kept patting them back in place, and when they were struggling to rush headlong out of their houses, they would force them back by shoving and pulling against them. And when water chanced to be near, they wished to fall into it, not so much because of a desire for drink (for the most of them rushed into the sea), but the cause was to be found chiefly in the diseased state of their minds. They had also great difficulty in the matter of eating, for they could not easily take food. And many perished through lack of any man to care for them, for they were either overcome by hunger, or threw themselves down from a height. And in those cases where neither coma nor delirium came on, the bubonic swelling became mortified and the sufferer, no longer able to endure the pain, died. And one would suppose that in all cases the same thing would have been true, but since they were not at all in their senses, some were quite unable to feel the pain; for owing to the troubled condition of their minds they lost all sense of feeling. <br />Now some of the physicians who were at a loss because the symptoms were not understood, supposing that the disease centred in the bubonic swellings, decided to investigate the bodies of the dead. And upon opening some of the swellings, they found a strange sort of carbuncle that had grown inside them. </p>                        </div>

With many also a vomiting of blood ensued without visible cause and straightway brought death. Moreover I am able to declare this, that the most illustrious physicians predicted that many would die, who unexpectedly escaped entirely from suffering shortly afterwards, and that they declared that many would be saved, who were destined to be carried off almost immediately. So it was that in this disease there was no cause which came within the province of human reasoning; for in all cases the issue tended to be something unaccountable. For example, while some were helped by bathing, others were harmed in no less degree. And of those who received no care many died, but others, contrary to reason, were saved. And again, methods of treatment shewed different results with different patients. Indeed the whole matter may be stated thus, that no device was discovered by man to save himself, so that either by taking precautions he should not suffer, or that when the malady had assailed him he should get the better of it; but suffering came without warning and recovery was due to no external cause. <br />And in the case of women who were pregnant death could be certainly foreseen if they were taken with the disease. For some died through miscarriage, but others perished immediately at the time of birth with the infants they bore. </p>                        </div>

At that time, too, those of the population who had formerly been members of the factions laid aside their mutual enmity and in common they attended to the burial rites of the dead, and they carried with their own hands the bodies of those who were no connections of theirs and buried them.

And when <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a> heard this, he was indignant, and he heaped reproaches and abuse upon his fellow-commanders for their hesitation.

The troops broke camp, accordingly, and without the guidance of generals and without observing any definite formation, they moved forward in complete confusion; for neither had they any countersign among themselves, as is customary in such perilous situations, nor were they arranged in their proper divisions. For the soldiers marched forward, mixed in with the baggage train, as if going to the ready plunder of great wealth.

Thereupon <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> in anger commanded the envoys to be gone with all speed. <br />On the eighth day of the siege he formed the design of erecting an artificial hill against the circuit wall of the city; accordingly he cut down trees in great numbers from the adjacent districts and, without removing the leaves, laid them together in a square before the wall, at a point which no missile from the city could reach; then he heaped an immense amount of earth right upon the trees and above that threw on a great quantity of stones, not such as are suitable for building, but cut at random, and only calculated to raise the hill as quickly as possible to a great height. And he kept laying on long timbers in the midst of the earth and the stones, and made them serve to bind the structure together, in order that as it became high it should not be weak. But Peter, the Roman general (for he happened to be there with <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> and Peranius), wishing to check the men who were engaged in this work, sent some of the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> who were under his command against them.

For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> are beyond all other men singular in their ways, and they are excessively rigid as regards the routine of daily life.

When, therefore, <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> perceived this, he was eager to anticipate with certainty any move on their part to revolt against him.

For he received Isdigousnas into the city with only twenty men. <br />So having failed in this attempt, the barbarian came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> as if on an embassy, bringing with him his wife and two daughters (for this was his pretext for the crowd which had been gathered about him); but when he came before the emperor, he was unable to say anything great or small about any serious matter, although he wasted no less than ten months in Roman territory. However, he gave the emperor the gifts from <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>, as is customary, and a letter, in which <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> requested the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> to send word whether he was enjoying the best possible health. Nevertheless the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> received this Isdigousnas with more friendliness and treated him with greater honour than any of the other ambassadors of whom we know. So true was this that, whenever he entertained him, he caused Braducius, who followed him as interpreter, to recline with him on the couch, a thing which had never before happened in all time. For no one ever saw an interpreter become a table-companion of even one of the more humble officials, not to speak of a king. But he both received and dismissed this man in a style more splendid than that which befits an ambassador, although he had undertaken the embassy for no serious business, as I have said. For if anyone should count up the money expended and the gifts which Isdigousnas carried with him when he went away, he will find them amounting to more than ten centenaria of gold.

He sent into the country a great amount of lumber suitable for the construction of ships, explaining to no one what his purpose was in so doing, but ostensibly he was sending it in order to set up engines of war on the fortifications of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418418FPet class=place long=41.7538 lat=41.7681>Petra</a>. Next he chose out three hundred able warriors of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, and sent them there under command of Phabrizus, whom I have lately mentioned, ordering him to make away with <a href=/people/12131 target=_blank>Goubazes</a> as secretly as possible; as for the rest, he himself would take care. Now when this lumber had been conveyed to <a href=/people/9676 target=_blank>Lazica</a>, it happened that it was struck suddenly by lightning and reduced to ashes.

Now it was in the territory of <a href=/people/9676 target=_blank>Lazica</a>, in the part which was altogether uninhabited, that the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> founded the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418418FPet class=place long=41.7538 lat=41.7681>Petra</a> in my own time. This was the place where John, surnamed Tzibus, established the monopoly, as I have told in the previous narrative, and gave cause to the <a href=/people/4580 target=_blank>Lazi</a> to revolt. And as one leaves the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418418FPet class=place long=41.7538 lat=41.7681>Petra</a> going southward, the Roman territory commences immediately, and there are populous towns there, and one which bears the name of Rhizaeum, also <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> and certain others as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410397PTra class=place long=39.727 lat=40.999>Trapezus</a>. Now when the <a href=/people/4580 target=_blank>Lazi</a> brought in <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>, they crossed the River <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365231PBoi class=place long=23.062 lat=36.517>Boas</a> and came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418418FPet class=place long=41.7538 lat=41.7681>Petra</a> keeping the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=place long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasis</a> on the right, because, as they said, they would thus provide against being compelled to spend much time and trouble in ferrying the men across the River <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=place long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasis</a>, but in reality they did not wish to display their own homes to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>.

(The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call the roads through such passes clisurae when they put their own word into a Greek form.)

For while he ought to have sent certainly the greater part of the army to the pass, and perhaps should have assisted in person in this enterprise, he sent only one hundred men, just as if he were managing a matter of secondary importance. </p>                        </div>

For in depth this river is not inferior to the deepest rivers, and it spreads out to a great width. Moreover it has such a strong current that when it empties into the sea, it goes on as a separate stream for a very great distance, without mingling at all with the sea-water. Indeed, those who navigate in those parts are able to draw up drinking water in the midst of the sea. Moreover, the <a href=/people/4580 target=_blank>Lazi</a> have erected fortresses all along the right bank of the river, in order that, even when the enemy are ferried across in boats, they may not be able to disembark on the land. <br />The Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> at this time sent to the nation of the Sabeiri the money which had been agreed upon, and he rewarded <a href=/people/12131 target=_blank>Goubazes</a> and the <a href=/people/4580 target=_blank>Lazi</a> with additional sums of money. And it happened that long before this time he had sent another considerable army also to <a href=/people/9676 target=_blank>Lazica</a>, which had not yet arrived there. The commander of this army was Rhecithancus, from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, a man of discretion and a capable warrior.

For he did not by any means think that the victuals which they had brought in with them would suffice for the garrison there, amounting to three thousand men.

He therefore selected five thousand men and left them there, appointing as commanders over them Phabrizus and three others. For it seemed to him unnecessary to leave more men there, since there was no enemy at all. And he himself with the rest of the army came into <a href=/people/10033 target=_blank>Persarmenia</a> and remained quietly in the country around Doubios. <br />Now the five thousand, upon coming nearer to the frontier of <a href=/people/9676 target=_blank>Lazica</a>, encamped in a body beside the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=place long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasis</a> River, and from there they went about in small bands and plundered the neighbouring country. Now when <a href=/people/12131 target=_blank>Goubazes</a> perceived this, he sent word to Dagisthaeus to hasten there to his assistance: for it would be possible for them to do the enemy some great harm.

For at that time the Empress <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> had reached the term of her life. However, he was quite unable to recover any of his former dignities, but he continued to hold the priestly honour against his will; and yet the vision had often come to the man that he would arrive at royalty. For the divine power is accustomed to tempt those whose minds are not solidly grounded by nature, by holding before their vision, on great and lofty hopes, that which is counted splendid among men. At any rate the marvel-mongers were always predicting to this John many such imaginary things, and especially that he was bound to be clothed in the garment of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>. Now there was a certain priest in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> by name, who guarded the treasures of the temple of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290EASo class=place long=28.9802 lat=41.00864>Sophia</a>.

After <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, the Roman Emperor, had departed from the world, having proved himself one of the most just of men and an able warrior, his kingdom was taken over by his two sons, <a href=/people/4862 target=_blank>Arcadius</a>, the elder, receiving the Eastern portion, and <a href=/people/7775 target=_blank>Honorius</a>, the younger, the Western. [Jan. 17, 395 A.D.] But the Roman power had been thus divided as far back as the time of <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a> and his sons; for he transferred his government to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, and making the city larger and much more renowned, allowed it to be named after him. <br />Now the earth is surrounded by a circle of ocean, either entirely or for the most part (for our knowledge is not as yet at all clear in this matter); and it is split into two continents by a sort of outflow from the ocean, a flow which enters at the western part and forms this Sea which we know, beginning at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gadira</a> and extending all the way to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/460370WMai class=place long=37 lat=46>Maeotic</a> Lake.

Septem is the name given by the natives to the fort at that point, since seven hills appear there; for septem has the force of seven in the Latin tongue. And the whole continent opposite this was named Europe. And the strait at that point separates the two continents by about eighty-four stades, but from there on they are kept apart by wide expanses of sea as far as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>.

Such, then, was the size of the Roman empire in the ancient times. <br />And there fell to him who held the power in the West the most of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, extending ninety days' journey — for such is the distance from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gadira</a> to the boundaries of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329132UOea class=place long=13.1758 lat=32.8999>Tripolis</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>; and in Europe he received as his portion territory extending seventy-five days' journey — for such is the distance from the northern of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361000LPHe class=place long=-5.3464 lat=36.123>Pillars of Heracles</a> to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a>. And one might add also the distance around the gulf. And the emperor of the East received territory extending one hundred and twenty days' journey, from the boundaries of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413194PEpi class=place long=19.4449 lat=41.3164>Epidamnus</a>, which lies on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a> and is called at the present time <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413194PEpi class=place long=19.4449 lat=41.3164>Dyrrachium</a>, as well as that portion of the country about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Euxine</a> Sea which, as previously stated, is subject to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. Now one day's journey extends two hundred and ten stades, or as far as from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=place long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megara</a>. Thus, then, the Roman emperors divided either continent between them. And among the islands <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>, which is outside the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361000LPHe class=place long=-5.3464 lat=36.123>Pillars of Heracles</a> and by far the largest of all islands, was counted, as is natural, with the West; and inside the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361000LPHe class=place long=-5.3464 lat=36.123>Pillars</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389014IPit class=place long=1.436 lat=38.907>Ebusa</a>, which lies in the Mediterranean in what we may call the Propontis, just inside the opening where the ocean enters, about seven days' journey from the opening, and two others near it, Majorica and Minorica, as they are called by the natives, were also assigned to the Western empire. And each of the islands in the Sea itself fell to the share of that one of the two emperors within whose boundaries it happened to lie.</p>                        </div>

[395-423 A.D.] There were many Gothic nations in earlier times, just as also at the present, but the greatest and most important of all are the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a>, and <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a>. In ancient times, however, they were named <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490315RSar class=ethnic long=31.5 lat=49>Sauromatae</a> and <a href=/people/12118 target=_blank>Melanchlaeni</a>; and there were some too who called these nations <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435268RGet class=demonym long=26.8 lat=43.5>Getic</a>. All these, while they are distinguished from one another by their names, as has been said, do not differ in anything else at all. For they all have white bodies and fair hair, and are tall and handsome to look upon, and they use the same laws and practise a common religion. For they are all of the Arian faith, and have one language called Gothic; and, as it seems to me, they all came originally from one tribe, and were distinguished later by the names of those who led each group. This people used to dwell above the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> River from of old.

And the barbarians, finding that they had no hostile force to encounter them, became the most cruel of all men. For they destroyed all the cities which they captured, especially those south of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a>, so completely that nothing has been left to my time to know them by, unless, indeed, it might be one tower or one gate or some such thing which chanced to remain.

Among the youths in the army whose beards had not yet grown, but who had just come of age, he chose out three hundred whom he knew to be of good birth and possessed of valour beyond their years, and told them secretly that he was about to make a present of them to certain of the patricians in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, pretending that they were slaves. And he instructed them that, as soon as they got inside the houses of those men, they should display much gentleness and moderation and serve them eagerly in whatever tasks should be laid upon them by their owners; and he further directed them that not long afterwards, on an appointed day at about midday, when all those who were to be their masters would most likely be already asleep after their meal, they should all come to the gate called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPSa class=place long=12.4985 lat=41.9107>Salarian</a> and with a sudden rush kill the guards, who would have no previous knowledge of the plot, and open the gates as quickly as possible. After giving these orders to the youths, <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> straightway sent ambassadors to the members of the senate, stating that he admired them for their loyalty toward their emperor, and that he would trouble them no longer, because of their valour and faithfulness, with which it was plain that they were endowed to a remarkable degree, and in order that tokens of himself might be preserved among men both noble and brave, he wished to present each one of them with some domestics. After making this declaration and sending the youths not long afterwards, he commanded the barbarians to make preparations for the departure, and he let this be known to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. And they heard his words gladly, and receiving the gifts began to be exceedingly happy, since they were completely ignorant of the plot of the barbarian. For the youths, by being unusually obedient to their owners, averted suspicion, and in the camp some were already seen moving from their positions and raising the siege, while it seemed that the others were just on the point of doing the very same thing. But when the appointed day had come, <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> armed his whole force for the attack and was holding them in readiness close by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPSa class=place long=12.4985 lat=41.9107>Salarian</a> Gate; for it happened that he had encamped there at the beginning of the siege. And all the youths at the time of the day agreed upon came to this gate, and, assailing the guards suddenly, put them to death; then they opened the gates and received <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> and the army into the city at their leisure. </p>                        </div>

These two came to be at variance in regard to matters of state, but they attained to such a degree of highmindedness and excellence in every respect that if one should call either of them the last of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> he would not err, so true was it that all the excellent qualities of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were summed up in these two men. One of these, Boniface, was appointed by Placidia general of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. Now this was not in accord with the wishes of <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a>, but he by no means disclosed the fact that it did not please him. For their hostility had not as yet come to light, but was concealed behind the countenance of each. But when Boniface had got out of the way, <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a> slandered him to Placidia, saying that he was setting up a tyranny and had robbed her and the emperor of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, and he said that it was very easy for her to find out the truth; for if she should summon Boniface to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, he would never come. And when the woman heard this, <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a> seemed to her to speak well and she acted accordingly. But <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a>, anticipating her, wrote to Boniface secretly that the mother of the emperor was plotting against him and wished to put him out of the way. And he predicted to him that there would be convincing proof of the plot; for he would be summoned very shortly for no reason at all. Such was the announcement of the letter. And Boniface did not disregard the message, for as soon as those arrived who were summoning him to the emperor, he refused to give heed to the emperor and his mother, disclosing to no one the warning of <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a>. So when Placidia heard this, she thought that <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a> was exceedingly well-disposed towards the emperor's cause and took under consideration the question of Boniface. But Boniface, since it did not seem to him that he was able to array himself against the emperor, and since if he returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> there was clearly no safety for him, began to lay plans so that, if possible, he might have a defensive alliance with the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, who, as previously stated, had established themselves in Spain not far from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. There Godigisclus had died and the royal power had fallen to his sons, <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, who was born to him from his wedded wife, and <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, of illegitimate birth. But the former was still a child and not of very energetic temper, while <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> had been excellently trained in warfare, and was the cleverest of all men. Boniface accordingly sent to Spain those who were his own most intimate friends and gained the adherence of each of the sons of Godigisclus on terms of complete equality, it being agreed that each one of the three, holding a third part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, should rule over his own subjects; but if a foe should come against any one of them to make war, that they should in common ward off the aggressors. On the basis of this agreement the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> crossed the strait at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gadira</a> and came into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, and the <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a> in later times settled in Spain. But in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> the friends of Boniface, remembering the character of the man and considering how strange his action was, were greatly astonished to think that Boniface was setting up a tyranny, and some of them at the order of Placidia went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. </p>                        </div>

And though the woman was dumbfounded, she did nothing unpleasant to <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a> nor did she upbraid him for what he had done to the emperor's house, for he himself wielded great power and the affairs of the empire were already in an evil plight; but she disclosed to the friends of Boniface the advice <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a> had given, and, offering oaths and pledges of safety, entreated them to persuade the man, if they could, to return to his fatherland and not to permit the empire of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> to lie under the hand of barbarians. And when Boniface heard this, he repented of his act and of his agreement with the barbarians, and he besought them incessantly, promising them everything, to remove from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. But since they did not receive his words with favour, but considered that they were being insulted, he was compelled to fight with them, and being defeated in the battle, he retired to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369077UHip class=place long=7.7467 lat=36.8813>Hippo</a> Regius, a strong city in the portion of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a> that is on the sea. There the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> made camp under the leadership of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> and began a siege; for <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> had already died. And they say that he perished at the hand of his brother. The <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, however, do not agree with those who make this statement, but say that <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>' was captured in battle by Germans in Spain and impaled, and that <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> was already sole ruler when he led the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. This, indeed, I have heard from the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, stated in this way.

And those of the enemy whom they took alive they reduced to slavery and held under guard. Among these happened to be <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a>, who later upon the death of <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> assumed the imperial power. At that time, however, <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> commanded that the captives be brought into the king's courtyard, in order that it might be possible for him, by looking at them, to know what master each of them might serve without degradation. And when they were gathered under the open sky, about midday, the season being summer, they were distressed by the sun and sat down. And somewhere or other among them <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a>, quite neglected, was sleeping. Then an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> flew over him spreading out his wings, as they say, and always remaining in the same place in the air he cast a shadow over <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a> alone. And <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, upon seeing from the upper storey what was happening, since he was an exceedingly discerning person, suspected that the thing was a divine manifestation, and summoning the man enquired of him who he might be. And he replied that he was a confidential adviser of Aspar; such a person the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call a domesticus in their own tongue. And when <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> heard this and considered first the meaning of the bird's action, and then remembered how great power Aspar exercised in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, it became evident to him that the man was being led to royal power. He therefore by no means deemed it right to kill him, reasoning that, if he should remove him from the world, it would be very clear that the thing which the bird had done was nothing (for he would not honour with his shadow a king who was about to die straightway), and he felt, too, that he would be killing him for no good cause; and if, on the other hand, it was fated that in later times the man should become king, it would never be within his power to inflict death upon him; for that which has been decided upon by God could never be prevented by a man's decision. But he bound <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a> by oaths that, if it should be in his power, he would never take up arms against the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> at least. [450 A.D.] Thus, then, <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a> was released and came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, and when at a later time <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> died he received the empire.

But this happened in later times. <br />At that time <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, after conquering Aspar and Boniface in battle, displayed a foresight worth recounting, whereby he made his good fortune most thoroughly secure. For fearing lest, if once again an army should come against him from both <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> might not be able to use the same strength and enjoy the same fortune, (since human affairs are wont to be overturned by <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a> and to fail by reason of the weakness of men's bodies), he was not lifted up by the good fortune he had enjoyed, but rather became moderate because of what he feared, and so he made a treaty with the Emperor <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a> providing that each year he should pay to the emperor tribute from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, and he delivered over one of his sons, Honoric, as a hostage to make this agreement binding. So <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> both showed himself a brave man in the battle and guarded the victory as securely as possible, and, since the friendship between the two peoples increased greatly, he received back his son Honoric. And at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> Placidia had died before this time, and after her, <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a>, her son, also died, having no male offspring, but two daughters had been born to him from Eudoxia, the child of <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>. And I shall now relate in what manner <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a> died. <br />There was a certain <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, a Roman senator, of the house of that <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a> who, while usurping the imperial power, was overthrown by the elder <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> and put to death, and on whose account also the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> celebrate the annual festival named from the defeat of <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a>. This younger <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a> was married to a woman discreet in her ways and exceedingly famous for her beauty. For this reason a desire came over <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a> to have her to wife. And since it was impossible, much as he wished it, to meet her, he plotted an unholy deed and carried it to fulfilment. For he summoned <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a> to the palace and sat down with him to a game of draughts, and a certain sum was set as a penalty for the loser; and the emperor won in this game, and receiving <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a>' ring as a pledge for the agreed amount, he sent it to his house, instructing the messenger to tell the wife of <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a> that her husband bade her come as quickly as possible to the palace to salute the queen Eudoxia. And she, judging by the ring that the message was from <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, entered her litter and was conveyed to the emperor's court. And she was received by those who had been assigned this service by the emperor, and led into a certain room far removed from the women's apartments, where <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a> met her and forced her, much against her will. And she, after the outrage, went to her husband's house weeping and feeling the deepest possible grief because of her misfortune, and she cast many curses upon <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a> as having provided the cause for what had been done. <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, accordingly, became exceedingly aggrieved at that which had come to pass, and straightway entered into a conspiracy against the emperor; but when he saw that <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a> was exceedingly powerful, for he had recently conquered <a href=/people/8922 target=_blank>Attila</a>, who had invaded the Roman domain with a great army of <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a> and the other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, the thought occurred to him that <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a> would be in the way of his undertaking. And upon considering this matter, it seemed to him that it was the better course to put <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a> out of the way first, paying no heed to the fact that the whole hope of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> centred in him. And since the eunuchs who were in attendance upon the emperor were well-disposed toward him, he persuaded the emperor by their devices that <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a> was setting on foot a revolution. And <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a>, judging by nothing else than the power and valour of <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a> that the report was true, put the man to death. [Sept. 21, 454 A.D.] Whereupon a certain Roman made himself famous by a saying which he uttered. For when the emperor enquired of him whether he had done well in putting <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a> to death, he replied saying that, as to this matter, he was not able to know whether he had done well or perhaps otherwise, but one thing he understood exceedingly well, that he had cut off his own right hand with the other. <br />So after the death of <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a>, <a href=/people/8922 target=_blank>Attila</a>, since no one was a match for him, plundered all Europe with no trouble and made both emperors subservient and tributary to himself. For tribute money was sent to him every year by the emperors. At that time, while <a href=/people/8922 target=_blank>Attila</a> was besieging <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a>, a city of great size and exceedingly populous situated near the sea and above the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a>, they say that the following good fortune befell him. For they tell the story that, when he was able to capture the place neither by force nor by any other means, he gave up the siege in despair, since it had already lasted a long time, and commanded the whole army without any delay to make their preparations for the departure, in order that on the morrow all might move from there at sunrise. And the following day about sunrise, the barbarians had raised the siege and were already beginning the departure, when a single male stork which had a nest on a certain tower of the city wall and was rearing his nestlings there suddenly rose and left the place with his young. And the father stork was flying, but the little storks, since they were not yet quite ready to fly, were at times sharing their father's flight and at times riding upon his back, and thus they flew off and went far away from the city. And when <a href=/people/8922 target=_blank>Attila</a> saw this (for he was most clever at comprehending and interpreting all things), he commanded the army, they say, to remain still in the same place, adding that the bird would never have gone flying off at random from there with his nestlings, unless he was prophesying that some evil would come to the place at no distant time. Thus, they say, the army of the barbarians settled down to the siege once more, and not long after that a portion of the wall — the very part which held the nest of that bird — for no apparent reason suddenly fell down, and it became possible for the enemy to enter the city at that point, and thus <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a> was captured by storm. Such is the story touching <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a>. <br />Later on <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a> slew the emperor with no trouble and secured the tyranny, and he married Eudoxia by force. [455 A.D.] For the wife to whom he had been wedded had died not long before. And on one occasion in private he made the statement to Eudoxia that it was all for the sake of her love that he had carried out all that he had done. And since she felt a repulsion for <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a> even before that time, and had been desirous of exacting vengeance from him for the wrong done <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a>, his words made her swell with rage still more against him, and led her on to carry out her plot, since she had heard <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a> say that on account of her the misfortune had befallen her husband. And as soon as day came, she sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> entreating <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> to avenge <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a>, who had been destroyed by an unholy man, in a manner unworthy both of himself and of his imperial station, and to deliver her, since she was suffering unholy treatment at the hand of the tyrant. And she impressed it upon <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> that, since he was a friend and ally and so great a calamity had befallen the imperial house, it was not a holy thing to fail to become an avenger. For from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> she thought no vengeance would come, since <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> had already departed from the world and <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a> had taken over the empire.

And going up to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, since no one stood in his way, he took possession of the palace. Now while <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a> was trying to flee, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> threw stones at him and killed him, and they cut off his head and each of his other members and divided them among themselves. But <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> took Eudoxia captive, together with <a href=/people/5000 target=_blank>Eudocia</a> and Placidia, the children of herself and <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a>, and placing an exceedingly great amount of gold and other imperial treasure in his ships sailed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, having spared neither bronze nor anything else whatsoever in the palace. He plundered also the temple of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=person long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitolinus</a>, and tore off half of the roof. Now this roof was of bronze of the finest quality, and since gold was laid over it exceedingly thick, it shone as a magnificent and wonderful spectacle. But of the ships with <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, one, which was bearing the statues, was lost, they say, but with all the others the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> reached port in the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> then married <a href=/people/5000 target=_blank>Eudocia</a> to Honoric, the elder of his sons; but the other of the two women, being the wife of <a href=/people/5846 target=_blank>Olybrius</a>, a most distinguished man in the Roman senate, he sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> together with her mother, Eudoxia, at the request of the emperor. Now the power of the East had by now fallen to <a href=/people/627 target=_blank>Leon</a>, who had been set in this position by Aspar, since <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a> had already passed from the world. [457 A.D.] <br />Afterwards <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> devised the following scheme. He tore down the walls of all the cities in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> except <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, so that neither the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> themselves, espousing the cause of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, might have a strong base from which to begin a rebellion, nor those sent by the emperor have any ground for hoping to capture a city and by establishing a garrison in it to make trouble for the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. Now at that time it seemed that he had counselled well and had ensured prosperity for the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> in the safest possible manner; but in later times when these cities, being without walls, were captured by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> all the more easily and with less exertion, <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> was then condemned to suffer much ridicule, and that which for the time he considered wise counsel turned out for him to be folly. For as fortunes change, men are always accustomed to change with them their judgments regarding what has been planned in the past. And among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> all who happened to be men of note and conspicuous for their wealth he handed over as slaves, together with their estates and all their money, to his sons Honoric and Genzon. For <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a>, the youngest son, had died already, being altogether without offspring, either male or female. And he robbed the rest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> of their estates, which were both very numerous and excellent, and distributed them among the nation of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, and as a result of this these lands have been called <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>' estates up to the present time. And it fell to the lot of those who had formerly possessed these lands to be in extreme poverty and to be at the same time free men; and they had the privilege of going away wheresoever they wished. And <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> commanded that all the lands which he had given over to his sons and to the other <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> should not be subject to any kind of taxation. But as much of the land as did not seem to him good he allowed to remain in the hands of the former owners, but assessed so large a sum to be paid on this land for taxes to the government that nothing whatever remained to those who retained their farms. And many of them were constantly being sent into exile or killed. For charges were brought against them of many sorts, and heavy ones too; but one charge seemed to be the greatest of all, that a man, having money of his own, was hiding it. Thus the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> were visited with every form of misfortune. <br />The <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and the <a href=/people/2232 target=_blank>Alani</a> he arranged in companies, appointing over them no less than eighty captains, whom he called chiliarchs, making it appear that his host of fighting men in active service amounted to eighty thousand. And yet the number of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and <a href=/people/2232 target=_blank>Alani</a> was said in former times, at least, to amount to no more than fifty thousand men. However, after that time by their natural increase among themselves and by associating other barbarians with them they came to be an exceedingly numerous people. But the names of the <a href=/people/2232 target=_blank>Alani</a> and all the other barbarians, except the Moors, were united in the name of <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. At that time, after the death of <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a>, <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> gained the support of the Moors, and every year at the beginning of spring he made invasions into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, enslaving some of the cities, razing others to the ground, and plundering everything; and when the land had become destitute of men and of money, he invaded the domain of the emperor of the East. And so he plundered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> and the most of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a> and of the rest of Greece and all the islands which lie near it. And again he went off to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and kept plundering and pillaging all places in turn. And one day when he had embarked on his ship in the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, and the sails were already being spread, the pilot asked him, they say, against what men in the world he bade them go. And he in reply said: Plainly against those with whom God is angry. Thus without any cause he kept making invasions wherever chance might lead him.</p>                        </div>

And he collected a fleet of ships from the whole of the eastern Mediterranean, shewing great generosity to both soldiers and sailors, for he feared lest from a parsimonious policy some obstacle might arise to hinder him in his desire to carry out his punishment of the barbarians. Therefore, they say, thirteen hundred centenaria were expended by him to no purpose. But since it was not fated that the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> should be destroyed by this expedition, he made <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a> commander-in-chief, the brother of his wife Berine, a man who was extraordinarily desirous of the royal power, which he hoped would come to him without a struggle if he won the friendship of Aspar. For Aspar himself, being an adherent of the Arian faith, and having no intention of changing it for another, was unable to enter upon the imperial office, but he was easily strong enough to establish another in it, and it already seemed likely that he would plot against the Emperor <a href=/people/627 target=_blank>Leon</a>, who had given him offence. So they say that since Aspar was then fearful lest, if the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> were defeated, <a href=/people/627 target=_blank>Leon</a> should establish his power most securely, he repeatedly urged upon <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a> that he should spare the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>. <br />[467 A.D.] Now before this time <a href=/people/627 target=_blank>Leon</a> had already appointed and sent <a href=/people/10775 target=_blank>Anthemius</a>, as Emperor of the West, a man of the senate of great wealth and high birth, in order that he might assist him in the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandalic</a> war. And yet <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> kept asking and earnestly entreating that the imperial power be given to <a href=/people/5846 target=_blank>Olybrius</a>, who was married to Placidia, the daughter of <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a>, and on account of his relationship well-disposed toward him, and when he failed in this he was still more angry and kept plundering the whole land of the emperor. Now there was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a> a certain <a href=/people/7923 target=_blank>Marcellianus</a>, one of the acquaintances of <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a> and a man of repute, who, after <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a> had died in the manner told above, no longer deigned to yield obedience to the emperor, but beginning a revolution and detaching all the others from allegiance, held the power of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a> himself, since no one dared encounter him. But the Emperor <a href=/people/627 target=_blank>Leon</a> at that time won over this <a href=/people/7923 target=_blank>Marcellianus</a> by very careful wheedling, and bade him go to the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>, which was then subject to the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. And he drove out the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and gained possession of it with no great difficulty.

Such, then, was the sequence of events which formed the prelude of the war. <br />But <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a> with his whole fleet put in at a town distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> no less than two hundred and eighty stades (now it so happened that a temple of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> had been there from of old, from which fact the place was named Mercurium; for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercurius</a>), and if he had not purposely played the coward and hesitated, but had undertaken to go straight for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, he would have captured it at the first onset, and he would have reduced the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> to subjection without their even thinking of resistance; so overcome was <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> with awe of <a href=/people/627 target=_blank>Leon</a> as an invincible emperor, when the report was brought to him that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329132UOea class=place long=13.1758 lat=32.8999>Tripolis</a> had been captured, and he saw the fleet of <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a> to be such as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were said never to have had before. But, as it was, the general's hesitation, whether caused by cowardice or treachery, prevented this success. And <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, profiting by the negligence of <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a>, did as follows. Arming all his subjects in the best way he could, he filled his ships, but not all, for some he kept in readiness empty, and they were the ships which sailed most swiftly. And sending envoys to <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a>, he begged him to defer the war for the space of five days, in order that in the meantime he might take counsel and do those things which were especially desired by the emperor. They say, too, that he sent also a great amount of gold without the knowledge of the army of <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a> and thus purchased this armistice. And he did this, thinking, as actually did happen, that a favouring wind would rise for him during this time. And <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a>, either as doing a favour to Aspar in accordance with what he had promised, or selling the moment of opportunity for money, or perhaps thinking it the better course, did as he was requested and remained quietly in the camp, awaiting the moment favourable to the enemy. <br />But the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, as soon as the wind had arisen for them which they had been expecting during the time they lay at rest, raised their sails and, taking in tow the boats which, as has been stated above, they had made ready with no men in them, they sailed against the enemy. And when they came near, they set fire to the boats which they were towing, when their sails were bellied by the wind, and let them go against the Roman fleet. And since there were a great number of ships there, these boats easily spread fire wherever they struck, and were themselves readily destroyed together with those with which they came in contact. And as the fire advanced in this way the Roman fleet was filled with tumult, as was natural, and with a great din that rivalled the noise caused by the wind and the roaring of the flames, as the soldiers together with the sailors shouted orders to one another and pushed off with their poles the fire-boats and their own ships as well, which were being destroyed by one another in complete disorder. And already the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> too were at hand ramming and sinking the ships, and making booty of such of the soldiers as attempted to escape, and of their arms as well. But there were also some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who proved themselves brave men in this struggle, and most of all John, who was a general under <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a> and who had no share whatever in his treason. For a great throng having surrounded his ship, he stood on the deck, and turning from side to side kept killing very great numbers of the enemy from there, and when he perceived that the ship was being captured, he leaped with his whole equipment of arms from the deck into the sea. And though Genzon, the son of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, entreated him earnestly not to do this, offering pledges and holding out promises of safety, he nevertheless threw himself into the sea, uttering this one word, that John would never come under the hands of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>. <br />So this war came to an end, and <a href=/people/918 target=_blank>Heracleius</a> departed for home; for <a href=/people/7923 target=_blank>Marcellianus</a> had been destroyed treacherously by one of his fellow-officers. And <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a>, coming to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, seated himself as a suppliant in the sanctuary of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> the Great God (<a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290EASo class=place long=28.9802 lat=41.00864>Sophia</a> the temple is called by the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> who consider that this designation is especially appropriate to God), and although, by the intercession of Berine, the queen, he escaped this danger, he was not able at that time to reach the throne, the thing for the sake of which everything had been done by him. For the Emperor <a href=/people/627 target=_blank>Leon</a> not long afterwards destroyed both Aspar and Ardaburius in the palace, because he suspected that they were plotting against his life. [471 A.D.] Thus, then, did these events take place.</p>                        </div>

[Oct. 10, 472 A.D.] And when <a href=/people/627 target=_blank>Leon</a> also had died in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, the imperial office was taken over by the younger <a href=/people/627 target=_blank>Leon</a>, the son of <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> and <a href=/people/421 target=_blank>Ariadne</a>, the daughter of <a href=/people/627 target=_blank>Leon</a>, while he was still only a few days old. And his father having been chosen as partner in the royal power, the child forthwith passed from the world. [474 A.D.] Majorinus also deserves mention, who had gained the power of the West before this time. For this Majorinus, who surpassed in every virtue all who have ever been emperors of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, did not bear lightly the loss of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, but collected a very considerable army against the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=place long=8.3 lat=44.3>Liguria</a>, intending himself to lead the army against the enemy. For Majorinus never showed the least hesitation before any task and least of all before the dangers of war. But thinking it not inexpedient for him to investigate first the strength of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and the character of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> and to discover how the Moors and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> stood with regard to friendship or hostility toward the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, he decided to trust no eyes other than his own in such a matter. Accordingly he set out as if an envoy from the emperor to <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, assuming some fictitious name. And fearing lest, by becoming known, he should himself receive some harm and at the same time prevent the success of the enterprise, he devised the following scheme. His hair, which was famous among all men as being so fair as to resemble pure gold, he anointed with some kind of dye, which was especially invented for this purpose, and so succeeded completely in changing it for the time to a dark hue. And when he came before <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, the barbarian attempted in many ways to terrify him, and in particular, while treating him with engaging attention, as if a friend, he brought him into the house where all his weapons were stored, a numerous and exceedingly noteworthy array. Thereupon they say that the weapons shook of their own accord and gave forth a sound of no ordinary or casual sort, and then it seemed to <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> that there had been an earthquake, but when he got outside and made enquiries concerning the earthquake, since no one else agreed with him, a great wonder, they say, came over him, but he was not able to comprehend the meaning of what had happened. So Majorinus, having accomplished the very things he wished, returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=place long=8.3 lat=44.3>Liguria</a>, and leading his army on foot, came to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361000LPHe class=place long=-5.3464 lat=36.123>Pillars of Heracles</a>, purposing to cross over the strait at that point, and then to march by land from there against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. And when <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> became aware of this, and perceived that he had been tricked by Majorinus in the matter of the embassy, he became alarmed and made his preparations for war. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, basing their confidence on the valour of Majorinus, already began to have fair hopes of recovering <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> for the empire. [461 A.D.] But meantime Majorinus was attacked by the disease of dysentery and died, a man who had shewn himself moderate toward his subjects, and an object of fear to his enemies. [July 24, 474 A.D.] And another emperor, <a href=/people/12142 target=_blank>Nepos</a>, upon taking over the empire, and living to enjoy it only a few days, died of disease, and Glycerius after him entered into this office and suffered a similar fate. [474-475 A.D.] And after him <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> assumed the imperial power. There were, moreover, still other emperors in the West before this time, but though I know their names well, I shall make no mention of them whatever. For it so fell out that they lived only a short time after attaining the office, and as a result of this accomplished nothing worthy of mention. Such was the course of events in the West. <br />But in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a>, being no longer able to master his passion for royal power, made an attempt to usurp the throne, and succeeded without difficulty, since <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>, together with his wife, sought refuge in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=place long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isauria</a>, which was his native home. [471 A.D.] And while he was maintaining his tyranny for a year and eight months he was detested by practically everyone and in particular by the soldiers of the court on account of the greatness of his avarice. And <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>, perceiving this, collected an army and came against him. And <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a> sent an army under the general <a href=/people/9472 target=_blank>Harmatus</a> in order to array himself against <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>. But when they had made camp near one another, <a href=/people/9472 target=_blank>Harmatus</a> surrendered his army to <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>, on the condition that <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> should appoint as Caesar <a href=/people/9472 target=_blank>Harmatus</a>' son <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a>, who was a very young child, and leave him as successor to the throne upon his death. And <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a>, deserted by all, fled for refuge to the same sanctuary as formerly. And <a href=/people/2703 target=_blank>Acacius</a>, the priest of the city, put him into the hands of <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>, charging him with impiety and with having brought great confusion and many innovations into the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> doctrine, having inclined toward the heresy of <a href=/people/5387 target=_blank>Eutyches</a>. And this was so. And after <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> had thus taken over the empire a second time, he carried out his pledge to <a href=/people/9472 target=_blank>Harmatus</a> formally by appointing his son <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a> Caesar, but not long afterwards he both stripped him of the office and put <a href=/people/9472 target=_blank>Harmatus</a> to death. And he sent <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a> together with his children and his wife into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a> in the winter season, commanding that they should be destitute of food and clothes and every kind of care. And there, being hard pressed by both cold and hunger, they took refuge in one another's arms, and embracing their loved ones, perished. And this punishment overtook <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a> for the policy he had pursued. These things, however, happened in later times. <br />But at that time <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> was plundering the whole Roman domain just as much as before, if not more, circumventing his enemy by craft and driving them out of their possessions by force, as has been previously said, and he continued to do so until the emperor <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> came to an agreement with him and an endless peace was established between them, by which it was provided that the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> should never in all time perform any hostile act against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> nor suffer such a thing at their hands. And this peace was preserved by <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> himself and also by his successor in the empire, <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a> And it remained in force until the time of the emperor Justinus. But <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, who was the nephew of Justinus, succeeded him in the imperial power, and it was in the reign of this <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> that the war with which we are concerned came to pass, in the manner which will be told in the following narrative. [477 A.D.] <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, after living on a short time, died at an advanced age, having made a will in which he enjoined many things upon the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and in particular that the royal power among them should always fall to that one who should be the first in years among all the male offspring descended from <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> himself. So <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, having ruled over the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> thirty-nine years from the time when he captured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, died, as I have said.</p>                        </div>

During the time when this Honoric ruled the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> they had no war against anyone at all, except the Moors. For through fear of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> the Moors had remained quiet before that time, but as soon as he was out of their way they both did much harm to the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and suffered the same themselves. And Honoric shewed himself the most cruel and unjust of all men toward the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. For he forced them to change over to the Arian faith, and as many as he found not readily yielding to him he burned, or destroyed by other forms of death; and he also cut off the tongues of many from the very throat, who even up to my time were going about in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> having their speech uninjured, and perceiving not the least effect from this punishment; but two of these, since they saw fit to go in to harlots, were thenceforth no longer able to speak. And after ruling over the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> eight years he died of disease; and by that time the Moors dwelling on Mt. Aurasium had revolted from the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and were independent (this Aurasium is a mountain of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a>, about thirteen days' journey distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> and fronting the south); and indeed they never came under the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> again, since the latter were unable to carry on a war against Moors on a mountain difficult of access and exceedingly steep. <br />After the death of Honoric the rule of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> fell to Gundamundus, the son of Genzon, the son of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>. [485 A.D.] For he, in point of years, was the first of the offspring of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>. This Gundamundus fought against the Moors in numerous encounters, and after subjecting the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> to still greater suffering, he died of disease, being now at about the middle of the twelfth year of his reign. [496 A.D.] And his brother Trasamundus took over the kingdom, a man well-favoured in appearance and especially gifted with discretion and highmindedness. However he continued to force the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> to change their ancestral faith, not by torturing their bodies as his predecessors had done, but by seeking to win them with honours and offices and presenting them with great sums of money; and in the case of those who would not be persuaded, he pretended he had not the least knowledge of what manner of men they were. And if he caught any guilty of great crimes which they had committed either by accident or deliberate intent, he would offer such men, as a reward for changing their faith, that they should not be punished for their offences. And when his wife died without becoming the mother of either male or female offspring, wishing to establish the kingdom as securely as possible, he sent to <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>, the king of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, asking him to give him his sister Amalafrida to wife, for her husband had just died. And <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> sent him not only his sister but also a thousand of the notable <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> as a bodyguard, who were followed by a host of attendants amounting to about five thousand fighting men. And <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> also presented his sister with one of the promontories of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, which are three in number, — the one which they call <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378124ULil class=place long=12.4342 lat=37.7991>Lilybaeum</a>, — and as a result of this Trasamundus was accounted the strongest and most powerful of all those who had ruled over the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. He became also a very special friend of the emperor <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a>. It was during the reign of Trasamundus that it came about that the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> suffered a disaster at the hands of the Moors such as had never befallen them before that time. <br />There was a certain Cabaon ruling over the Moors of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329132UOea class=place long=13.1758 lat=32.8999>Tripolis</a>, a man experienced in many wars and exceedingly shrewd. This Cabaon, upon learning that the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> were marching against him, did as follows. First of all he issued orders to his subjects to abstain from all injustice and from all foods tending towards luxury and most of all from association with women; and setting up two palisaded enclosures, he encamped himself with all the men in one, and in the other he shut the women, and he threatened that death would be the penalty if anyone should go to the women's palisade. And after this he sent spies to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> with the following instructions: whenever the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> in going forth on the expedition should offer insult to any temple which the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> reverence, they were to look on and see what took place; and when the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> had passed the place, they were to do the opposite of everything which the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> had done to the sanctuary before their departure. And they say that he added this also, that he was ignorant of the God whom the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> worshipped, but it was probable that if He was powerful, as He was said to be, He should wreak vengeance upon those who insulted Him and defend those who honoured Him. So the spies came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> and waited quietly, observing the preparation of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>; but when the army set out on the march to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329132UOea class=place long=13.1758 lat=32.8999>Tripolis</a>, they followed, clothing themselves in humble garb. And the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, upon making camp the first day, led their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and their other animals into the temples of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, and sparing no insult, they acted with all the unrestrained lawlessness natural to them, beating as many priests as they caught and lashing them with many blows over the back and commanding them to render such service to the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> as they were accustomed to assign to the most dishonoured of their domestics. And as soon as they had departed from there, the spies of Cabaon did as they had been directed to do; for they straightway cleansed the sanctuaries and took away with great care the filth and whatever other unholy thing lay in them, and they lighted all the lamps and bowed down before the priests with great reverence and saluted them with all friendliness; and after giving pieces of silver to the poor who sat about these sanctuaries, they then followed after the army of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. And from then on along the whole route the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> continued to commit the same offences and the spies to render the same service. And when they were coming near the Moors, the spies anticipated them and reported to Cabaon what had been done by the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and by themselves to the temples of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, and that the enemy were somewhere near by. And Cabaon, upon learning this, arranged for the encounter as follows. He marked off a circle in the plain where he was about to make his palisade, and placed his <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a> turned sideways in a circle as a protection for the camp, making his line fronting the enemy about twelve <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a> deep. Then he placed the children and the women and all those who were unfit for fighting together with their possessions in the middle, while he commanded the host of fighting men to stand between the feet of those animals, covering themselves with their shields. And since the phalanx of the Moors was of such a sort, the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> were at a loss how to handle the situation; for they were neither good with the javelin nor with the bow, nor did they know how to go into battle on foot, but they were all horsemen, and used spears and swords for the most part, so that they were unable to do the enemy any harm at a distance; and their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, annoyed at the sight of the <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a>, refused absolutely to be driven against the enemy. And since the Moors, by hurling javelins in great numbers among them from their safe position, kept killing both their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and men without difficulty, because they were a vast throng, they began to flee, and, when the Moors came out against them, the most of them were destroyed, while some fell into the hands of the enemy; and an exceedingly small number from this army returned home. Such was the fortune which Trasamundus suffered at the hands of the Moors. And he died at a later time, having ruled over the Moors twenty-seven years.</p>                        </div>

Hoamer, accordingly, his nephew and an able warrior, led the armies against any with whom the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> were at war; he it was whom they called the <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. During the reign of this <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a> the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> were defeated in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a> by the Moors, who were ruled by Antalas, and it so fell out that they became enemies instead of allies and friends to <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. For they put Amalafrida in prison and destroyed all the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, charging them with revolutionary designs against the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a>. However, no revenge came from <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>, for he considered himself unable to gather a great fleet and make an expedition into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, and <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a> was a very particular friend and guest-friend of <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, who had not yet come to the throne, but was administering the government according to his pleasure; for his uncle Justinus, who was emperor, was very old and not altogether experienced in matters of state. And <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a> and <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> made large presents of money to each other. <br />Now there was a certain man in the family of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, the son of Geilaris, the son of Genzon, the son of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, who was of such age as to be second only to <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a>, and for this reason he was expected to come into the kingdom very soon. This man was thought to be the best warrior of his time, but for the rest he was a cunning fellow and base at heart and well versed in undertaking revolutionary enterprises and in laying hold upon the money of others. Now this <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, when he saw the power coming to him, was not able to live in his accustomed way, but assumed to himself the tasks of a king and usurped the rule, though it was not yet due him; and since <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a> in a spirit of friendliness gave in to him, he was no longer able to restrain his thoughts, but allying with himself all the noblest of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, he persuaded them to wrest the kingdom from <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a>, as being an unwarlike king who had been defeated by the Moors, and as betraying the power of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> into the hand of the Emperor Justinus, in order that the kingdom might not come to him, because he was of the other branch of the family; for he asserted slanderously that this was the meaning of <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a>'s embassy to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, and that he was giving over the empire of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> to Justinus. And they, being persuaded, carried out this plan. [530 A.D.] Thus <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> seized the supreme power, and imprisoned <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a>, after he had ruled over the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> seven years, and also Hoamer and his brother Euagees. <br />[527 A.D.] But when <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> heard these things, having already received the imperial power, he sent envoys to <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> with the following letter: You are not acting in a holy manner nor worthily of the will of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, keeping in prison an old man and a kinsman and the king of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> (if the counsels of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> are to be of effect), and robbing him of his office by violence, though it would be possible for you to receive it after a short time in a lawful manner. Do you therefore do no further wrong and do not exchange the name of king for the title of tyrant, which comes but a short time earlier. But as for this man, whose death may be expected at any moment, allow him to bear in appearance the form of royal power, while you do all the things which it is proper that a king should do; and wait until you can receive from time and the law of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, and from them alone, the name which belongs to the position. For if you do this, the attitude of the Almighty will be favourable and at the same time our relations with you will be friendly. Such was his message. But <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> sent the envoys away with nothing accomplished, and he blinded Hoamer and also kept <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a> and Euagees in closer confinement, charging them with planning flight to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. And when this too was heard by the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, he sent envoys a second time and wrote as follows: We, indeed, supposed that you would never go contrary to our advice when we wrote you the former letter. But since it pleases you to have secured possession of the royal power in the manner in which you have taken and now hold it, get from it whatever <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a> grants. But do you send to us <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a>, and Hoamer whom you have blinded, and his brother, to receive what comfort they can who have been robbed of a kingdom or of sight; for we shall not let the matter rest if you do not do this. And I speak thus because we are led by the hope which I had based on our friendship. And the treaty with <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> will not stand as an obstacle for us. For it is not to make war upon him who has succeeded to the kingdom of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> that we come, but to avenge <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> with all our power. <br />When <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> had read this, he replied as follows: King <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> to the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>. Neither have I taken the office by violence nor has anything unholy been done by me to my kinsmen. For <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a>, while planning a revolution against the house of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, was dethroned by the nation of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>; and I was called to the kingdom by my years, which gave me the preference, according to the law at least. Now it is well for one to administer the kingly office which belongs to him and not to make the concerns of others his own. Hence for you also, who have a kingdom, meddling in other's affairs is not just; and if you break the treaty and come against us, we shall oppose you with all our power, calling to witness the oaths which were sworn by <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>, from whom you have received the kingdom which you hold. The Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, upon receiving this letter, having been angry with <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> even before then, was still more eager to punish him. And it seemed to him best to put an end to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> war as soon as possible and then to make an expedition to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>; and since he was quick at forming a plan and prompt in carrying out his decisions, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, the General of the East, was summoned and came to him immediately, no announcement having been made to him nor to anyone else that he was about to lead an army against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, but it was given out that he had been removed from the office which he held. And straightway the treaty with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> was made, as has been told in the preceding narrative.</p>                        </div>

But when he disclosed to the magistrates that he was gathering an army against the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, the most of them began immediately to show hostility to the plan, and they lamented it as a misfortune, recalling the expedition of the Emperor <a href=/people/627 target=_blank>Leon</a> and the disaster of <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a>, and reciting how many soldiers had perished and how much money the state had lost. But the men who were the most sorrowful of all, and who, by reason of their anxiety, felt the keenest regret, were the pretorian prefect, whom the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call praetor, and the administrator of the treasury, and all to whom had been assigned the collection of either public or imperial taxes, for they reasoned that while it would be necessary for them to produce countless sums for the needs of the war, they would be granted neither pardon in case of failure nor extension of time in which to raise these sums. And every one of the generals, supposing that he himself would command the army, was in terror and dread at the greatness of the danger, if it should be necessary for him, if he were preserved from the perils of the sea, to encamp in the enemy's land, and, using his ships as a base, to engage in a struggle against a kingdom both large and formidable. The soldiers, also, having recently returned from a long, hard war, and having not yet tasted to the full the blessings of home, were in despair, both because they were being led into sea-fighting, — a thing which they had not learned even from tradition before then, — and because they were sent from the eastern frontier to the West, in order to risk their lives against <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and Moors. But all the rest, as usually happens in a great throng, wished to be spectators of new adventures while others faced the dangers. <br />But as for saying anything to the emperor to prevent the expedition, no one dared to do this except John the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=person long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocian</a>, the pretorian prefect, a man of the greatest daring and the cleverest of all men of his time. For this John, while all the others were bewailing in silence the fortune which was upon them, came before the emperor and spoke as follows: O Emperor, the good faith which thou dost shew in dealing with thy subjects enables us to speak frankly regarding anything which will be of advantage to thy government, even though what is said and done may not be agreeable to thee. For thus does thy wisdom temper thy authority with justice, in that thou dost not consider that man only as loyal to thy cause who serves thee under any and all conditions, nor art thou angry with the man who speaks against thee, but by weighing all things by pure reason alone, thou hast often shewn that it involves us in no danger to oppose thy purposes. Led by these considerations, O Emperor, I have come to offer this advice, knowing that, though I shall give perhaps offence at the moment, if it so chance, yet in the future the loyalty which I bear you will be made clear, and that for this I shall be able to shew thee as a witness. For if, through not hearkening to my words, thou shalt carry out the war against the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, it will come about, if the struggle is prolonged for thee, that my advice will win renown. For if thou hast confidence that thou wilt conquer the enemy, it is not at all unreasonable that thou shouldst sacrifice the lives of men and expend a vast amount of treasure, and undergo the difficulties of the struggle; for victory, coming at the end, covers up all the calamities of war. But if in reality these things lie on the knees of God, and if it behoves us, taking example from what has happened in the past, to fear the outcome of war, on what grounds is it not better to love a state of quiet rather than the dangers of mortal strife? Thou art purposing to make an expedition against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, to which, if one goes by land, the journey is one of a hundred and forty days, and if one goes by water, he is forced to cross the whole open sea and go to its very end. So that he who brings thee news of what will happen in the camp must needs reach thee a year after the event. And one might add that if thou art victorious over thy enemy, thou couldst not take possession of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> while <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> lie in the hands of others; and at the same time, if any reverse befall thee, O Emperor, the treaty having already been broken by thee, thou wilt bring the danger upon our own land. In fact, putting all in a word, it will not be possible for thee to reap the fruits of victory, and at the same time any reversal of fortune will bring harm to what is well established. It is before an enterprise that wise planning is useful. For when men have failed, repentance is of no avail, but before disaster comes there is no danger in altering plans. Therefore it will be of advantage above all else to make fitting use of the decisive moment. <br />Thus spoke John; and the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, hearkening to his words, checked his eager desire for the war. But one of the priests whom they call bishops, who had come from the East, said that he wished to have a word with the emperor. And when he met <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, he said that God had visited him in a dream, and bidden him go to the emperor and rebuke him, because, after undertaking the task of protecting the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> from tyrants, he had for no good reason become afraid. And yet, He had said, I will Myself join with him in waging war and make him lord of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. When the emperor heard this, he was no longer able to restrain his purpose, and he began to collect the army and the ships, and to make ready supplies of weapons and of food, and he announced to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> that he should be in readiness, because he was very soon to act as general in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. Meanwhile Pudentius, one of the natives of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329132UOea class=place long=13.1758 lat=32.8999>Tripolis</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, caused this district to revolt from the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, and sending to the emperor he begged that he should despatch an army to him; for, he said, he would with no trouble win the land for the emperor. And <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> sent him Tattimuth and an army of no very great size. This force Pudentius joined with his own troops and, the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> being absent, he gained possession of the land and made it subject to the emperor. And <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, though wishing to inflict punishment upon Pudentius, found the following obstacle in his way. <br />There was a certain Godas among the slaves of <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, a <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goth</a> by birth, a passionate and energetic fellow possessed of great bodily strength, but appearing to be well-disposed to the cause of his master. To this Godas <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> entrusted the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>, in order both to guard the island and to pay over the annual tribute. But he neither could digest the prosperity brought by fortune nor had he the spirit to endure it, and so he undertook to establish a tyranny, and he refused to continue the payment of the tribute, and actually detached the island from the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and held it himself. And when he perceived that the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> was eager to make war against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> and <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, he wrote to him as follows: <br />It was neither because I yielded to folly nor because I had suffered anything unpleasant at my master's hands that I turned my thoughts towards rebellion, but seeing the extreme cruelty of the man both toward his kinsmen and toward his subjects, I could not, willingly at least, be reputed to have a share in his inhumanity. For it is better to serve a just king than a tyrant whose commands are unlawful. But do thou join with me to assist in this my effort and send soldiers so that I may be able to ward off my assailants. <br />And the emperor, on receiving this letter, was pleased, and he sent Eulogius as envoy and wrote a letter praising Godas for his wisdom and his zeal for justice, and he promised an alliance and soldiers and a general, who would be able to guard the island with him and to assist him in every other way, so that no trouble should come to him from the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. But Eulogius, upon coming to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>, found that Godas was assuming the name and wearing the dress of a king and that he had attached a body-guard to his person. And when Godas read the emperor's letter, he said that it was his wish to have soldiers, indeed, come to fight along with him, but as for a commander, he had absolutely no desire for one. And having written to the emperor in this sense, he dismissed Eulogius.</p>                        </div>

But at the present time there is nothing to prevent anyone from assuming this name, since time will by no means consent to keep names attached to the things to which they were formerly applied, but conditions are ever changing about according to the desire of men who control them, and men pay little heed to the meaning which they originally attached to a name. And the commanders of the foederati were <a href=/people/1368 target=_blank>Dorotheus</a>, the general of the troops in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a>, and <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, who was acting as manager for the general <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>; (such a person the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call domesticus. Now this <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> was a eunuch, but it was not by the devising of man that he had suffered mutilation, but some accident which befell him while in swaddling clothes had imposed this lot upon him); and there were also <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a>, <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>, <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a>, Althias, John, <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>, and the <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a> whom I have mentioned above; and the commanders of the regular cavalry were <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a> and Aïgan, who were of the house of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, and Barbatus and Pappus, while the regular infantry was commanded by <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a>, who was surnamed Cteanus, and <a href=/people/217 target=_blank>Terentius</a>, Zaïdus, <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a>, and <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Sarapis</a>. And a certain John, a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413194PEpi class=place long=19.4449 lat=41.3164>Epidamnus</a>, which is now called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413194PEpi class=place long=19.4449 lat=41.3164>Dyrrachium</a>, held supreme command over all the leaders of infantry. Among all these commanders <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> was from a place in the East, at the very extremity of the Roman domain, where the city called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372410UDar class=place long=40.953 lat=37.1772>Daras</a> now stands, and Aïgan was by birth of the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a> whom they now call <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a>; and the rest were almost all inhabitants of the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>. And there followed with them also four hundred <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>, whom Pharas led, and about six hundred barbarian allies from the nation of the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a>, all mounted bowmen; these were led by Sinnion and Balas, men endowed with bravery and endurance in the highest degree. And for the whole force five hundred ships were required, no one of which was able to carry more than fifty thousand medimni, nor any one less than three thousand. And in all the vessels together there were thirty thousand sailors, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=ethnic long=27.3 lat=38>Ionians</a> for the most part, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=ethnic long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicians</a>, and one commander was appointed over all the ships, Calonymus of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=person long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>. And they had also ships of war prepared as for sea-fighting, to the number of ninety-two, and they were single-banked ships covered by decks, in order that the men rowing them might if possible not be exposed to the bolts of the enemy. Such boats are called dromones by those of the present time; for they are able to attain a great speed. In these sailed two thousand men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, who were all rowers as well as fighting men; for there was not a single superfluous man among them. And <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> was also sent, a man of patrician standing who had already been pretorian prefect both in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, but he then held the position of prefect of the army; for thus the officer charged with the maintenance of the army is designated. But as general with supreme authority over all the emperor sent <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, who was in command of the troops of the East for the second time. And he was followed by many spearmen and many guards as well, men who were capable warriors and thoroughly experienced in the dangers of fighting. And the emperor gave him written instructions, bidding him do everything as seemed best to him, and stating that his acts would be final, as if the emperor himself had done them. The writing, in fact, gave him the power of a king. Now <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was a native of <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germania</a>, which lies between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>. These things, then, took place in this way. <br />Gelimer, however, being deprived of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329132UOea class=place long=13.1758 lat=32.8999>Tripolis</a> by Pudentius and of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a> by Godas, scarcely hoped to regain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329132UOea class=place long=13.1758 lat=32.8999>Tripolis</a>, since it was situated at a great distance and the rebels were already being assisted by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, against whom just at that moment it seemed to him best not to take the field; but he was eager to get to the island before any army sent by the emperor to fight for his enemies should arrive there. He accordingly selected five thousand of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and one hundred and twenty ships of the fastest kind, and appointing as general his brother Tzazon, he sent them off. And so they were sailing with great enthusiasm and eagerness against Godas and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>. In the meantime the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> was sending off <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> and <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> in advance of the others in order to await the rest of the army in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a>. And when these two had embarked upon their ships, it came to the emperor's mind that there was something which he wished to enjoin upon them, — a thing which he had wished to say previously, but he had been so busied with the other matters of which he had to speak that his mind had been occupied with them and this subject had been driven out. He summoned them, accordingly, intending to say what he wished, but upon considering the matter, he saw that it would not be propitious for them to interrupt their journey. He therefore sent men to forbid them either to return to him or to disembark from their ships. And these men, upon coming near the ships, commanded them with much shouting and loud cries by no means to turn back, and it seemed to those present that the thing which had happened was no good omen and that never would one of the men in those ships return from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. For besides the omen they suspected that a curse also had come to the men from the emperor, not at all by his own will, so that they would not return. Now if anyone should so interpret the incident with regard to these two commanders, <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> and <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a>, he will find the original opinion untrue. But there was a certain man among the body-guards of <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a>, Stotzas by name, who was destined to be an enemy of the emperor, to make an attempt to set up a tyranny, and by no means to return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, and one might suppose that curse to have been turned upon him by <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a>. But whether this matter stands thus or otherwise, I leave to each one to reason out as he wishes. But I shall proceed to tell how the general <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and the army departed.</p>                        </div>

Thither came also <a href=/people/3592 target=_blank>Epiphanius</a>, the chief priest of the city, and after uttering an appropriate prayer, he put on the ships one of the soldiers who had lately been baptized and had taken the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> name. And after this the general <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and Antonina, his wife, set sail. And there was with them also <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a>, who wrote this history; now previously he had been exceedingly terrified at the danger, but later he had seen a vision in his sleep which caused him to take courage and made him eager to go on the expedition. For it seemed in the dream that he was in the house of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, and one of the servants entering announced that some men had come bearing gifts; and <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> bade him investigate what sort of gifts they were, and he went out into the court and saw men who carried on their shoulders earth with the flowers and all. And he bade him bring these men into the house and deposit the earth they were carrying in the portico; and <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> together with his guardsmen came there, and he himself reclined on that earth and ate of the flowers, and urged the others to do likewise; and as they reclined and ate, as if upon a couch, the food seemed to them exceedingly sweet. Such, then, was the vision of the dream. <br />And the whole fleet followed the general's ship, and they put in at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410280UPer class=place long=27.953 lat=40.971>Perinthus</a>, which is now called Heracleia, where five days' time was spent by the army, since at that place the general received as a present from the emperor an exceedingly great number of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> from the royal pastures, which are kept for him in the territory of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>. And setting sail from there, they anchored off <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264PAby class=place long=26.4091 lat=40.1951>Abydus</a>, and it came about as they were delaying there four days on account of the lack of wind that the following event took place. Two <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a> killed one of their comrades who was ridiculing them, in the midst of their intemperate drinking; for they were intoxicated. For of all men the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a> are the most intemperate drinkers. <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, accordingly, straightway impaled these two men on the hill which is near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264PAby class=place long=26.4091 lat=40.1951>Abydus</a>. And since all, and especially the relatives of these two men, were angry and declared that it was not in order to be punished nor to be subject to the laws of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> that they had entered into an alliance (for their own laws did not make the punishment for murder such as this, they said); and since they were joined in voicing the accusation against the general even by Roman soldiers, who were anxious that there should be no punishment for their offences, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> called together both the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a> and the rest of the army and spoke as follows: If my words were addressed to men now for the first time entering into war, it would require a long time for me to convince you by speech how great a help justice is for gaining the victory. For those who do not understand the fortunes of such struggles think that the outcome of war lies in strength of arm alone. But you, who have often conquered an enemy not inferior to you in strength of body and well endowed with valour, you who have often tried your strength against your opponents, you, I think, are not ignorant that, while it is men who always do the fighting in either army, it is God who judges the contest as seems best to Him and bestows the victory in battle. Now since this is so, it is fitting to consider good bodily condition and practice in arms and all the other provision for war of less account than justice and those things which pertain to God. For that which may possibly be of greatest advantage to men in need would naturally be honoured by them above all other things. Now the first proof of justice would be the punishment of those who have committed unjust murder. For if it is incumbent upon us to sit in judgment upon the actions which from time to time are committed by men toward their neighbours, and to adjudge and to name the just and the unjust action, we should find that nothing is more precious to a man than his life. And if any barbarian who has slain his kinsman expects to find indulgence in his trial on the ground that he was drunk, in all fairness he makes the charge so much the worse by reason of the very circumstance by which, as he alleges, his guilt is removed. For it is not right for a man under any circumstances, and especially when serving in an army, to be so drunk as readily to kill his dearest friends; nay, the drunkenness itself, even if the murder is not added at all, is worthy of punishment; and when a kinsman is wronged, the crime would clearly be of greater moment as regards punishment than when committed against those who are not kinsmen, at least in the eyes of men of sense. Now the example is before you and you may see what sort of an outcome such actions have. But as for you, it is your duty to avoid laying violent hands upon anyone without provocation, or carrying off the possessions of others; for I shall not overlook it, be assured, and I shall not consider anyone of you a fellow-soldier of mine, no matter how terrible he is reputed to be to the foe, who is not able to use clean hands against the enemy. For bravery cannot be victorious unless it be arrayed along with justice. So spoke <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. And the whole army, hearing what was said and looking up at the two men impaled, felt an overwhelming fear come over them and took thought to conduct their lives with moderation, for they saw that they would not be free from great danger if they should be caught doing anything unlawful.</p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg4029.tlg001:3.13.1'><b>&sect; 3.13.1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;After this <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> bethought him how his whole fleet should always keep together as it sailed and should anchor in the same place. For he knew that in a large fleet, and especially if rough winds should assail them, it was inevitable that many of the ships should be left behind and scattered on the open sea, and that their pilots should not know which of the ships that put to sea ahead of them it was better to follow. So after considering the matter, he did as follows. The sails of the three ships in which he and his following were carried he painted red from the upper corner for about one third of their length, and he erected upright poles on the prow of each, and hung lights from them, so that both by day and by night the general's ships might be distinguishable; then he commanded all the pilots to follow these ships. Thus with the three ships leading the whole fleet not a single ship was left behind. And whenever they were about to put out from a harbour, the trumpets announced this to them. <br />And upon setting out from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264PAby class=place long=26.4091 lat=40.1951>Abydus</a> they met with strong winds which carried them to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262USig class=place long=26.1802 lat=39.9901>Sigeum</a>. And again in calm weather they proceeded more leisurely to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364232LMal class=place long=23.198 lat=36.436>Malea</a>, where the calm proved of the greatest advantage to them. For since they had a great fleet and exceedingly large ships, as night came on everything was thrown into confusion by reason of their being crowded into small space, and they were brought into extreme peril. At that time both the pilots and the rest of the sailors shewed themselves skilful and efficient, for while shouting at the top of their voices and making a great noise they kept pushing the ships apart with their poles, and cleverly kept the distances between their different vessels; but if a wind had arisen, whether a following or a head wind, it seems to me that the sailors would hardly have preserved themselves and their ships. But as it was, they escaped, as I have said, and put in at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364225STai class=place long=22.4867 lat=36.4018>Taenarum</a>, which is now called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365224UKai class=place long=22.4357 lat=36.4624>Caenopolis</a>. Then, pressing on from there, they touched at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368217UMot class=place long=21.705 lat=36.817>Methone</a>, and found <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> and <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> with their men, who had reached the same place a short time before. And since there were no winds blowing, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> anchored the ships there, and disembarked the whole army; and after they were on shore he assigned the commanders their positions and drew up the soldiers. And while he was thus engaged and no wind at all arose, it came about that many of the soldiers were destroyed by disease caused in the following manner. <br />The pretorian prefect, John, was a man of worthless character, and so skilful at devising ways of bringing money into the public treasury to the detriment of men that I, for my part, should never be competent to describe this trait of his. But this has been said in the preceding pages, when I was brought to this point by my narrative. But I shall tell in the present case in what manner he destroyed the soldiers. The bread which soldiers are destined to eat in camp must of necessity be put twice into the oven, and be cooked so carefully as to last for a very long period and not spoil in a short time, and loaves cooked in this way necessarily weigh less; and for this reason, when such bread is distributed, the soldiers generally received as their portion one-fourth more than the usual weight. John, therefore, calculating how he might reduce the amount of firewood used and have less to pay to the bakers in wages, and also how he might not lose in the weight of the bread, brought the still uncooked dough to the public baths of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, in the basement of which the fire is kept burning, and bade his men set it down there. And when it seemed to be cooked in some fashion or other, he threw it into bags, put it on the ships, and sent it off. And when the fleet arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368217UMot class=place long=21.705 lat=36.817>Methone</a>, the loaves disintegrated and returned again to flour, not wholesome flour, however, but rotten and becoming mouldy and already giving out a sort of oppressive odour. And the loaves were dispensed by measure to the soldiers by those to whom this office was assigned, and they were already making the distribution of the bread by quarts and bushels. And the soldiers, feeding upon this in the summer time in a place where the climate is very hot, became sick, and not less than five hundred of them died; and the same thing was about to happen to more, but <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> prevented it by ordering the bread of the country to be furnished them. And reporting the matter to the emperor, he himself gained in favour, but he did not at that time bring any punishment upon John. <br />These events, then, took place in the manner described. And setting out from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368217UMot class=place long=21.705 lat=36.817>Methone</a> they reached the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378209PZak class=place long=20.8921 lat=37.7872>Zacynthus</a>, where they took in enough water to last them in crossing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421170WAdr class=place long=16.95 lat=42.09>Adriatic</a> Sea, and after making all their other preparations, sailed on. But since the wind they had was very gentle and languid, it was only on the sixteenth day that they came to land at a deserted place in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> near which Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377150LAit class=place long=15.001 lat=37.748>Aetna</a> rises. And while they were being delayed in this passage, as has been said, it so happened that the water of the whole fleet was spoiled, except that which <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> himself and his table-companions were drinking. For this alone was preserved by the wife of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> in the following manner. She filled with water jars made of glass and constructed a small room with planks in the hold of the ship where it was impossible for the sun to penetrate, and there she sank the jars in sand, and by this means the water remained unaffected. So much, then, for this.</p>                        </div>

But most of all he was disturbed by the soldiers, who were in mortal dread of sea-fighting and had no shame in saying beforehand that, if they should be disembarked on the land, they would try to show themselves brave men in the battle, but if hostile ships assailed them, they would turn to flight; for, they said, they were not able to contend against two enemies at once, both men and water.

And he bade him, when he should have accomplished his commands, return and meet him at the place called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368145UCau class=place long=14.5073 lat=36.7882>Caucana</a>, about two hundred stades distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a>, where both he and the whole fleet were to anchor. But he let it be understood that he was sending him to buy provisions, since the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were willing to give them a market, this having been decided upon by the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> and <a href=/people/12065 target=_blank>Amalasountha</a>, the mother of Antalaric, who was at that time a boy being reared under the care of his mother, <a href=/people/12065 target=_blank>Amalasountha</a>, and held sway over both the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>. For when <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> had died and the kingdom came to his nephew, Antalaric, who had already before this lost his father, <a href=/people/12065 target=_blank>Amalasountha</a> was fearful both for her child and for the kingdom and cultivated the friendship of <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> very carefully, and she gave heed to his commands in all matters and at that time promised to provide a market for his army and did so. <br />Now when <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a>, he unexpectedly met a man who had been a fellow-citizen and friend of his from childhood, who had been living in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a> for a long time engaged in the shipping business, and he learned from him what he wanted; for this man showed him a domestic who had three days before that very day come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, and he said that they need not suspect that there would be any ambush set for the fleet by the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. For from no one in the world had they learned that an army was coming against them at that time, but all the active men among the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> had actually a little before gone on an expedition against Godas. And for this reason <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, with no thought of an enemy in his mind and regardless of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> and all the other places on the sea, was staying in <a href=/people/1148 target=_blank>Hermione</a>, which is in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>, four days' journey distant from the coast; so that it was possible for them to sail without fearing any difficulty and to anchor wherever the wind should call them. When <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> heard this, he took the hand of the domestic and walked to the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153WAre class=place long=15.2929 lat=37.0573>Arethousa</a> where his boat lay at anchor, making many enquiries of the man and searching out every detail. And going on board the ship with him, he gave orders to raise the sails and to make all speed for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368145UCau class=place long=14.5073 lat=36.7882>Caucana</a>. And since the master of the domestic stood on the shore wondering that he did not give him back the man, <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> shouted out, when the ship was already under way, begging him not to be angry with him; for it was necessary that the domestic should meet the general, and, after leading the army to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, would return after no long time to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a> with much money in his pocket. <br />But upon coming to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368145UCau class=place long=14.5073 lat=36.7882>Caucana</a> they found all in deep grief. For <a href=/people/1368 target=_blank>Dorotheus</a>, the general of the troops of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a>, had died there, leaving to the whole army a great sense of loss. But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, when the domestic had come before him and related his whole story, became exceedingly glad, and after bestowing many praises upon <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a>, he issued orders to give the signal for departure with the trumpets. And setting sail quickly they touched at the islands of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360143IGau class=place long=14.2915 lat=36.0329>Gaulus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/359144IMel class=place long=14.44 lat=35.88>Melita</a>, which mark the boundary between the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421170WAdr class=place long=16.95 lat=42.09>Adriatic</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscan</a> Seas. There a strong east wind arose for them, and on the following day it carried the ships to the point of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, at the place which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call in their own tongue Shoal's Head. For its name is Caputvada, and it is five days' journey from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> for an unencumbered traveller.</p>                        </div>

Thereupon many speeches were made inclining to either side, and <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> came forward and spoke as follows: <br />I admire, indeed, the virtue of our general, who, while surpassing all by far in judgment and possessing the greatest wealth of experience, and at the same time holding the power alone, has proposed an open discussion and bids each one of us speak, so that we shall be able to choose whichever course seems best, though it is possible for him to decide alone on what is needful and at his leisure to put it into execution as he wishes. But as for you, my fellow officers — I do not know how I am to say it easily — one might wonder that each one did not hasten to be the first to oppose the disembarkation. And yet I understand that the making of suggestions to those who are entering upon a perilous course brings no personal advantage to him who offers the advice, but as a general thing results in bringing blame upon him. For when things go well for men, they attribute their success to their own judgment or to fortune, but when they fail, they blame only the one who has advised them. Nevertheless I shall speak out. For it is not right for those who deliberate about safety to shrink from blame. You are purposing to disembark on the enemy's land, fellow-officers; but in what harbour are you planning to place the ships in safety? Or in what city's wall will you find security for yourselves? Have you not then heard that this promontory — I mean from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> to Iouce — extends, they say, for a journey of nine days, altogether without harbours and lying open to the wind from whatever quarter it may blow? And not a single walled town is left in all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> except <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, thanks to the decision of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>. And one might add that in this place, they say, water is entirely lacking. Come now, if you wish, let us suppose that some adversity befall us, and with this in view make the decision. For that those who enter into contests of arms should expect no difficulty is not in keeping with human experience nor with the nature of things. If, then, after we have disembarked upon the mainland, a storm should fall upon us, will it not be necessary that one of two things befall the ships, either that they flee away as far as possible, or perish upon this promontory? Secondly, what means will there be of supplying us with necessities? Let no one look to me as the officer charged with the maintenance of the army. For every official, when deprived of the means of administering his office, is of necessity reduced to the name and character of a private person. And where shall we deposit our superfluous arms or any other part of our necessaries when we are compelled to receive the attack of the barbarians? Nay, as for this, it is not well even to say how it will turn out. But I think that we ought to make straight for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. For they say that there is a harbour called Stagnum not more than forty stades distant from that city, which is entirely unguarded and large enough for the whole fleet. And if we make this the base of our operations, we shall carry on the war without difficulty. And I, for my part, think it likely that we shall win <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> by a sudden attack, especially since the enemy are far away from it, and that after we have won it we shall have no further trouble. For it is a way with all men's undertakings that when the chief point has been captured, they collapse after no long time. It behoves us, therefore, to bear in mind all these things and to choose the best course. So spoke <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>. <br />And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> spoke as follows: Let no one of you, fellow-officers, think that my words are those of censure, nor that they are spoken in the last place to the end that it may become necessary for all to follow them, of whatever sort they may be. For I have heard what seems best to each one of you, and it is becoming that I too should lay before you what I think, and then with you should choose the better course. But it is right to remind you of this fact, that the soldiers said openly a little earlier that they feared the dangers by sea and would turn to flight if a hostile ship should attack them, and we prayed God to shew us the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> and allow us a peaceful disembarkation upon it. And since this is so, I think it the part of foolish men first to pray to receive from God the more favourable fortune, then when this is given them, to reject it and go in the contrary direction. And if we do sail straight for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> and a hostile fleet encounters us, the soldiers will remain without blame, if they flee with all their might — for a delinquency announced beforehand carries with it its own defence — but for us, even if we come through safely, there will be no forgiveness. Now while there are many difficulties if we remain in the ships, it will be sufficient, I think, to mention only one thing, — that by which especially they wish to frighten us when they hold over our heads the danger of a storm. For if any storm should fall upon us, one of two things, they say, must necessarily befall the ships, either that they flee far from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> or be destroyed upon this headland. What then under the present circumstances will be more to our advantage to choose? to have the ships alone destroyed, or to have lost everything, men and all? But apart from this, at the present time we shall fall upon the enemy unprepared, and in all probability shall fare as we desire; for in warfare it is the unexpected which is accustomed to govern the course of events. But a little later, when the enemy have already made their preparation, the struggle we shall have will be one of strength evenly matched. And one might add that it will be necessary perhaps to fight even for the disembarkation, and to seek for that which now we have within our grasp but over which we are deliberating as a thing not necessary. And if at the very time, when we are engaged in conflict, a storm also comes upon us, as often happens on the sea, then while struggling both against the waves and against the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, we shall come to regret our prudence. As for me, then, I say that we must disembark upon the land with all possible speed, landing <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and arms and whatever else we consider necessary for our use, and that we must dig a trench quickly and throw a stockade around us of a kind which can contribute to our safety no less than any walled town one might mention, and with that as our base must carry on the war from there if anyone should attack us. And if we shew ourselves brave men, we shall lack nothing in the way of provisions. For those who hold the mastery over their enemy are lords also of the enemy's possessions; and it is the way of victory, first to invest herself with all the wealth, and then to set it down again on that side to which she inclines. Therefore, for you both the chance of safety and of having an abundance of good things lies in your own hands. <br />When <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had said this, the whole assembly agreed and adopted his proposal, and separating from one another, they made the disembarkation as quickly as possible, about three months later than their departure from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. And indicating a certain spot on the shore the general bade both soldiers and sailors dig the trench and place the stockade about it. And they did as directed. And since a great throng was working and fear was stimulating their enthusiasm and the general was urging them on, not only was the trench dug on the same day, but the stockade was also completed and the pointed stakes were fixed in place all around. Then, indeed, while they were digging the trench, something happened which was altogether amazing. A great abundance of water sprang forth from the earth, a thing which had not happened before in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>, and besides this the place where they were was altogether waterless. Now this water sufficed for all uses of both men and animals. And in congratulating the general, <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> said that he rejoiced at the abundance of water, not so much because of its usefulness, as because it seemed to him a symbol of an easy victory, and that <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a> was foretelling a victory to them. This, at any rate, actually came to pass. So for that night all the soldiers bivouacked in the camp, setting guards and doing everything else as was customary, except, indeed, that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> commanded five bowmen to remain in each ship for the purpose of a guard, and that the ships-of-war should anchor in a circle about them, taking care that no one should come against them to do them harm.</p>                        </div>

For I have disembarked you upon this land basing my confidence on this alone, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a>, being <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> from of old, are unfaithful and hostile to the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, and for this reason I thought that no necessaries would fail us and, besides, that the enemy would not do us any injury by a sudden attack. But now this your lack of self-control has changed it all and made the opposite true. For you have doubtless reconciled the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> to the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, bringing their hostility round upon your own selves. For by nature those who are wronged feel enmity toward those who have done them violence, and it has come round to this that you have exchanged your own safety and a bountiful supply of good things for some few pieces of silver, when it was possible for you, by purchasing provisions from willing owners, not to appear unjust and at the same time to enjoy their friendship to the utmost. Now, therefore, the war will be between you and both <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a>, and I, at least, say further that it will be against God himself, whose aid no one who does wrong can invoke. But do you cease trespassing wantonly upon the possessions of others, and reject a gain which is full of dangers. For this is that time in which above all others moderation is able to save, but lawlessness leads to death. For if you give heed to these things, you will find God propitious, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=demonym long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyan</a> people well-disposed, and the race of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> open to your attack. <br />With these words <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> dismissed the assembly. And at that time he heard that the city of Syllectus was distant one day's journey from the camp, lying close to the sea on the road leading to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, and that the wall of this city had been torn down for a long time, but the inhabitants of the place had made a barrier on all sides by means of the walls of their houses, on account of the attacks of the Moors, and guarded a kind of fortified enclosure; he, accordingly, sent one of his spearmen, Boriades, together with some of the guards, commanding them to make an attempt oh the city, and, if they captured it, to do no harm in it, but to promise a thousand good things and to say that they had come for the sake of the people's freedom, that so the army might be able to enter into it. And they came near the city about dusk and passed the night hidden in a ravine. But at early dawn, meeting country folk going into the city with waggons, they entered quietly with them and with no trouble took possession of the city. And when day came, no one having begun any disturbance, they called together the priest and all the other notables and announced the commands of the general, and receiving the keys of the entrances from willing hands, they sent them to the general. <br />On the same day the overseer of the public post deserted, handing over all the government <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. And they captured also one of those who are occasionally sent to bear the royal responses, whom they call veredarii[49]; and the general did him no harm but presented him with much gold and, receiving pledges from him, put into his hand the letter which the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> had written to the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, that he might give it to the magistrates of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. And the writing was as follows: Neither have we decided to make war upon the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, nor are we breaking the treaty of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, but we are attempting to dethrone your tyrant, who, making light of the testament of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, has imprisoned your king and is keeping him in custody, and those of his relatives whom he hated exceedingly he put to death at the first, and the rest, after robbing them of their sight, he keeps under guard, not allowing them to terminate their misfortunes by death. Do you, therefore, join forces with us and help us in freeing yourselves from so wicked a tyranny, in order that you may be able to enjoy both peace and freedom. For we give you pledges in the name of God that these things will come to you by our hand. Such was the message of the emperor's letter. But the man who received this from <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> did not dare to publish it openly, and though he shewed it secretly to his friends, he accomplished nothing whatever of consequence.</p>                        </div>

He chose out three hundred of his guards, men who were able warriors, and handed them over to John, who was in charge of the expenditures of the general's household; such a person the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call optio. And he was an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> by birth, a man gifted with discretion and courage in the highest degree. This John, then, he commanded to go ahead of the army, at a distance of not less than twenty stades, and if he should see anything of the enemy, to report it with all speed, so that they might not be compelled to enter into battle unprepared. And the allied <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a> he commanded to travel constantly on the left of the army, keeping as many stades away or more; and he himself marched in the rear with the best troops. For he suspected that it would not be long before <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, following them from <a href=/people/1148 target=_blank>Hermione</a>, would make an attack upon them. And these precautions were sufficient, for on the right side there was no fear, since they were travelling not far from the coast. And he commanded the sailors to follow along with them always and not to separate themselves far from the army, but when the wind was favouring to lower the great sails, and follow with the small sails, which they call dolones, and when the wind dropped altogether to keep the ships under way as well as they could by rowing. <br />And when <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> reached Syllectus, the soldiers behaved with moderation, and they neither began any unjust brawls nor did anything out of the way, and he himself, by displaying great gentleness and kindness, won the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> to his side so completely that thereafter he made the journey as if in his own land; for neither did the inhabitants of the land withdraw nor did they wish to conceal anything, but they both furnished a market and served the soldiers in whatever else they wished. And accomplishing eighty stades each day, we completed the whole journey to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, passing the night either in a city, should it so happen, or in a camp made as thoroughly secure as the circumstances permitted. Thus we passed through the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/357109ULep class=place long=10.8663 lat=35.6781>Leptis</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358106UHad class=place long=10.6387 lat=35.8258>Hadrumetum</a> and reached the place called Grasse, three hundred and fifty stades distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. In that place was a palace of the ruler of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and a park the most beautiful of all we know. For it is excellently watered by springs and has a great wealth of woods. And all the trees are full of fruit; so that each one of the soldiers pitched his tent among fruit-trees, and though all of them ate their fill of the fruit, which was then ripe, there was practically no diminution to be seen in the fruit. <br />But <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, as soon as he heard in <a href=/people/1148 target=_blank>Hermione</a> that the enemy were at hand, wrote to his brother Ammatas in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> to kill <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a> and all the others, connected with him either by birth or otherwise, whom he was keeping under guard, and commanded him to make ready the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and all others in the city serviceable for war, in order that, when the enemy got inside the narrow passage at the suburb of the city which they call <a href=/people/7581 target=_blank>Decimum</a>, they might come together from both sides and surround them and, catching them as in a net, destroy them. And Ammatas carried this out, and killed <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a>, who was a relative of his, and Euagees, and all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> who were intimate with them. For Hoamer had already departed from the world. And arming the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, he made them ready, intending to make his attack at the opportune moment. But <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> was following behind, without letting it be known to us, except, indeed, that, on that night when we bivouacked in Grasse, scouts coming from both armies met each other, and after an exchange of blows they each retired to their own camp, and in this way it became evident to us that the enemy were not far away. As we proceeded from there it was impossible to discern the ships. For high rocks extending well into the sea cause mariners to make a great circuit, and there is a projecting <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371110LHer class=place long=11.0435 lat=37.0777>headland</a>, inside of which lies the town of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>. <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> therefore commanded <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>, the prefect, and Calonymus, the admiral, not to put in at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, but to remain about two hundred stades away until he himself should summon them. And departing from Grasse we came on the fourth day to <a href=/people/7581 target=_blank>Decimum</a>, seventy stades distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>.</p>                        </div>

But as for me, during this struggle I was moved to wonder at the ways of <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a> and of men, noting how God, who sees from afar what will come to pass, traces out the manner in which it seems best to him that things should come to pass, while men, whether they are deceived or counsel aright, know not that they have failed, should that be the issue, or that they have succeeded, God's purpose being that a path shall be made for <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, who presses on inevitably toward that which has been foreordained. For if <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had not thus arranged his forces, commanding the men under John to take the lead, and the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a> to march on the left of the army, we should never have been able to escape the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. And even with this planned so by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, if Ammatas had observed the opportune time, and had not anticipated this by about the fourth part of a day, never would the cause of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> have fallen as it did; but as it was, Ammatas came to <a href=/people/7581 target=_blank>Decimum</a> about midday, in advance of the time, while both we and the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandal</a> army were far away, erring not only in that he did not arrive at the fitting time, but also in leaving at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> the host of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, commanding them to come to <a href=/people/7581 target=_blank>Decimum</a> as quickly as possible, while he with a few men and not even the pick of the army came into conflict with John's men. And he killed twelve of the best men who were fighting in the front rank, and he himself fell, having shewn himself a brave man in this engagement. And the rout, after Ammatas fell, became complete, and the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, fleeing at top speed, swept back all those who were coming from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> to <a href=/people/7581 target=_blank>Decimum</a>. For they were advancing in no order and not drawn up as for battle, but in companies, and small ones at that; for they were coming in bands of twenty or thirty. And seeing the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> under Ammatas fleeing, and thinking their pursuers were a great multitude, they turned and joined in the flight. And John and his men, killing all whom they came upon, advanced as far as the gates of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. And there was so great a slaughter of <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> in the course of the seventy stades that those who beheld it would have supposed that it was the work of an enemy twenty thousand strong. <br />At the same time Gibamundus and his two thousand came to Pedion Halon, which is forty stades distant from <a href=/people/7581 target=_blank>Decimum</a> on the left as one goes to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, and is destitute of human habitation or trees or anything else, since the salt in the water permits nothing except salt to be produced there; in that place they encountered the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> and were all destroyed. Now there was a certain man among the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a>, well gifted with courage and strength of body, the leader of a few men; this man had the privilege handed down from his fathers and ancestors to be the first in all the Hunnic armies to attack the enemy. For it was not lawful for a man of the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a> to strike first in battle and capture one of the enemy until, indeed, someone from this house began the struggle with the enemy. So when the two armies had come not far from each other, this man rode out and stopped alone close to the army of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. And the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, either because they were dumbfounded at the courageous spirit of the man or perhaps because they suspected that the enemy were contriving something against them, decided neither to move nor to shoot at the man. And I think that, since they had never had experience of battle with the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a>, but heard that the nation was very warlike, they were for this reason terrified at the danger. And the man, returning to his compatriots, said that God had sent them these strangers as a ready feast. Then at length they made their onset and the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> did not withstand them, but breaking their ranks and never thinking of resistance, they were all disgracefully destroyed.</p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, seeing a place well adapted for a camp, thirty-five stades distant from <a href=/people/7581 target=_blank>Decimum</a>, surrounded it with a stockade which was very well made, and placing all the infantry there and calling together the whole army, he spoke as follows: Fellow-soldiers, the decisive moment of the struggle is already at hand; for I perceive that the enemy are advancing upon us; and the ships have been taken far away from us by the nature of the place; and it has come round to this that our hope of safety lies in the strength of our hands. For there is not a friendly city, no, nor any other stronghold, in which we may put our trust and have confidence concerning ourselves. But if we should show ourselves brave men, it is probable that we shall still overcome the enemy in the war; but if we should weaken at all, it will remain for us to fall under the hand of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and to be destroyed disgracefully. And yet there are many advantages on our side to help us on toward victory; for we have with us both justice, with which we have come against our enemy (for we are here in order to recover what is our own), and the hatred of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> toward their own tyrant. For the alliance of God follows naturally those who put justice forward, and a soldier who is ill-disposed toward his ruler knows not how to play the part of a brave man. And apart from this, we have been engaged with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> all the time, but the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, since the time they conquered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, have seen not a single enemy except naked Moors. And who does not know that in every work practice leads to skill, while idleness leads to inefficiency? Now the stockade, from which we shall have to carry on the war, has been made by us in the best possible manner. And we are able to deposit here our weapons and everything else which we are not able to carry when we go forth; and when we return here again, no kind of provisions can fail us. And I pray that each one of you, calling to mind his own valour and those whom he has left at home, may so march with contempt against the enemy. <br />After speaking these words and uttering a prayer after them, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> left his wife and the barricaded camp to the infantry, and himself set forth with all the horsemen. For it did not seem to him advantageous for the present to risk an engagement with the whole army, but it seemed wise to skirmish first with the horsemen and make trial of the enemy's strength, and finally to fight a decisive battle with the whole army. Sending forward, therefore, the commanders of the foederati, he himself followed with the rest of the force and his own spearmen and guards. And when the foederati and their leaders reached <a href=/people/7581 target=_blank>Decimum</a>, they saw the corpses of the fallen — twelve comrades from the forces of John and near them Ammatas and some of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. And hearing from the inhabitants of the place the whole story of the fight, they were vexed, being at a loss as to where they ought to go. But while they were still at a loss and from the hills were looking around over the whole country thereabouts, a dust appeared from the south and a little later a very large force of <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandal</a> horsemen. And they sent to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> urging him to come as quickly as possible, since the enemy were bearing down upon them. And the opinions of the commanders were divided. For some thought that they ought to close with their assailants, but the others said that their force was not sufficient for this. And while they were debating thus among themselves, the barbarians drew near under the leadership of <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, who was following a road between the one which <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was travelling and the one by which the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a> who had encountered Gibamundus had come. But since the land was hilly on both sides, it did not allow him to see either the disaster of Gibamundus or <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>' stockade, nor even the road along which <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>' men were advancing. But when they came near each other, a contest arose between the two armies as to which should capture the highest of all the hills there. For it seemed a suitable one to encamp upon, and both sides preferred to engage with the enemy from there. And the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, coming first, took possession of the hill by crowding off their assailants and routed the enemy, having already become an object of terror to them. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in flight came to a place seven stades distant from <a href=/people/7581 target=_blank>Decimum</a>, where, as it happened, Uliaris, the personal guard of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, was, with eight hundred guardsmen. And all supposed that Uliaris would receive them and hold his position, and together with them would go against the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>; but when they came together, these troops all unexpectedly fled at top speed and went on the run to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. <br />From then on I am unable to say what happened to <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> that, having the victory in his hands, he willingly gave it up to the enemy, unless one ought to refer foolish actions also to God, who, whenever He purposes that some adversity shall befall a man, touches first his reason and does not permit that which will be to his advantage to come to his consideration. For if, on the one hand, he had made the pursuit immediately, I do not think that even <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> would have withstood him, but our cause would have been utterly and completely lost, so numerous appeared the force of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and so great the fear they inspired in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>; or if, on the other hand, he had even ridden straight for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, he would easily have killed all John's men, who, heedless of everything else, were wandering about the plain one by one or by twos and stripping the dead. And he would have preserved the city with its treasures, and captured our ships, which had come rather near, and he would have withdrawn from us all hope both of sailing away and of victory. But in fact he did neither of these things. Instead he descended from the hill at a walk, and when he reached the level ground and saw the corpse of his brother, he turned to lamentations, and, in caring for his burial, he blunted the edge of his opportunity — an opportunity which he was not able to grasp again. Meantime <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, meeting the fugitives, bade them stop, and arrayed them all in order and rebuked them at length; then, after hearing of the death of Ammatas and the pursuit of John, and learning what he wished concerning the place and the enemy, he proceeded at full speed against <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> and the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. But the barbarians, having already fallen into disorder and being now unprepared, did not withstand the onset of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, but fled with all their might, losing many there, and the battle ended at night. Now the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> were in flight, not to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> nor to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>, whence they had come, but to the plain of Boulla and the road leading into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a>. So the men with John and the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a> returned to us about dusk, and after learning all that had happened and reporting what they had done, they passed the night with us in <a href=/people/7581 target=_blank>Decimum</a>.</p>                        </div>

For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> opened the gates and burned lights everywhere and the city was brilliant with the illumination that whole night, and those of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> who had been left behind were sitting as suppliants in the sanctuaries. But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> prevented the entrance in order to guard against any ambuscade being set for his men by the enemy, and also to prevent the soldiers from having freedom to turn to plundering, as they might under the concealment of night. On that day, since an east wind arose for them, the ships reached the headland, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>, for they already sighted them, removed the iron chains of the harbour which they call Mandracium, and made it possible for the fleet to enter. Now there is in the king's palace a room filled with darkness, which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> call Ancon, where all were cast with whom the tyrant was angry. In that place, as it happened, many of the eastern merchants had been confined up to that time. For <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> was angry with these men, charging them with having urged the emperor on to the war, and they were about to be destroyed, all of them, this having been decided upon by <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> on that day on which Ammatas was killed in <a href=/people/7581 target=_blank>Decimum</a>; to such an extremity of danger did they come. The guard of this prison, upon hearing what had taken place in <a href=/people/7581 target=_blank>Decimum</a> and seeing the fleet inside the point, entered the room and enquired of the men, who had not yet learned the good news, but were sitting in the darkness and expecting death, what among their possessions they would be willing to give up and be saved. And when they said they desired to give everything he might wish, he demanded nothing of all their treasures, but required them all to swear that, if they escaped, they would assist him also with all their power when he came into danger. And they did this. Then he told them them the whole story, and tearing off a plank from the side toward the sea, he pointed out the fleet approaching, and releasing all from the prison went out with them. <br />But the men on the ships, having as yet heard nothing of what the army had done on the land, were completely at a loss, and slackening their sails they sent to the town of Mercurium; there they learned what had taken place at <a href=/people/7581 target=_blank>Decimum</a>, and becoming exceedingly joyful sailed on. And when, with a favouring wind blowing, they came to within one hundred and fifty stades of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> and the soldiers bade them anchor there, fearing the warning of the general, but the sailors would not obey. For they said that the promontory at that point was without a harbour and also that the indications were that a well-known storm, which the natives call Cypriana, would arise immediately. And they predicted that, if it came upon them in that place, they would not be able to save even one of the ships. And it was as they said. So they slackened their sails for a short time and deliberated; and they did not think they ought to try for Mandracium (for they shrank from violating the commands of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, and at the same time they suspected that the entrance to Mandracium was closed by the chains, and besides they feared that this harbour was not sufficient for the whole fleet) but Stagnum seemed to them well situated (for it is forty stades distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>), and there was nothing in it to hinder them, and also it was large enough for the whole fleet. There they arrived about dusk and all anchored, except, indeed, that Calonymus with some of the sailors, disregarding the general and all the others, went off secretly to Mandracium, no one daring to hinder him, and plundered the property of the merchants dwelling on the sea, both foreigners and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>. <br />On the following day <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> commanded those on the ships to disembark, and after marshalling the whole army and drawing it up in battle formation, he marched into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>; for he feared lest he should encounter some snare set by the enemy. There he reminded the soldiers at length of how much good fortune had come to them because they had displayed moderation toward the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a>, and he exhorted them earnestly to preserve good order with the greatest care in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. For all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> had been <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in earlier times and had come under the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> by no will of their own and had suffered many outrages at the hands of these barbarians. For this very reason the emperor had entered into war with the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, and it was not holy that any harm should come from them to the people whose freedom they had made the ground for taking the field against the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. [Sept. 15, 533 A.D.] After such words of exhortation he entered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, and, since no enemy was seen by them, he went up to the palace and seated himself on <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>'s throne. There a crowd of merchants and other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> came before <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> with much shouting, persons whose homes were on the sea, and they made the charge that there had been a robbery of their property on the preceding night by the sailors. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> bound Calonymus by oaths to bring without fail all his thefts to the light. And Calonymus, taking the oath and disregarding what he had sworn, for the moment made the money his plunder, but not long afterwards he paid his just penalty in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. For being taken with the disease called apoplexy, he became insane and bit off his own tongue and then died. But this happened at a later time.</p>                        </div>

This place the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call Delphix, not in their own tongue, but using the Greek word according to the ancient custom. For in the palace at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, where the dining couches of the emperor were placed, a tripod had stood from olden times, on which the emperor's cupbearers used to place the cups. Now the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call a tripod Delphix, since they were first made at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, and from this both in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and wherever there is a king's dining couch they call the room Delphix; for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> follow the Greek also in calling the emperor's residence <a href=/people/3651 target=_blank>Palatium</a>. For a Greek named <a href=/people/5345 target=_blank>Pallas</a> lived in this place before the capture of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> and built a noteworthy house there, and they called this dwelling <a href=/people/3651 target=_blank>Palatium</a>; and when <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> received the imperial power, he decided to take up his first residence in that house, and from this they call the place wherever the emperor resides <a href=/people/3651 target=_blank>Palatium</a>. So <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> dined in the Delphix and with him all the notables of the army. And it happened that the lunch made for <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> on the preceding day was in readiness. And we feasted on that very food and the domestics of <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> served it and poured the wine and waited upon us in every way. And it was possible to see <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> in her glory and making a display of the fact that all things are hers and that nothing is the private possession of any man. And it fell to the lot of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> on that day to win such fame as no one of the men of his time ever won nor indeed any of the men of olden times. For though the Roman soldiers were not accustomed to enter a subject city without confusion, even if they numbered only five hundred, and especially if they made the entry unexpectedly, all the soldiers under the command of this general showed themselves so orderly that there was not a single act of insolence nor a threat, and indeed nothing happened to hinder the business of the city; but in a captured city, one which had changed its government and shifted its allegiance, it came about that no man's household was excluded from the privileges of the marketplace; on the contrary, the clerks drew up their lists of the men and conducted the soldiers to their lodgings, just as usual, and the soldiers themselves, getting their lunch by purchase from the market, rested as each one wished. <br />Afterwards <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> gave pledges to those <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> who had fled into the sanctuaries, and began to take thought for the fortifications. For the circuit-wall of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> had been so neglected that in many places it had become accessible to anyone who wished and easy to attack. For no small part of it had fallen down, and it was for this reason, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> said, that <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> had not made his stand in the city. For he thought that it would be impossible in a short time to restore such a circuit-wall to a safe condition. And they said that an old oracle had been uttered by the children in earlier times in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, to the effect that gamma shall pursue beta, and again beta itself shall pursue gamma. And at that time it had been spoken by the children in play and had been left as an unexplained riddle, but now it was perfectly clear to all. For formerly <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> had driven out Boniface and now <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was doing the same to <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>. This, then, whether it was a rumour or an oracle, came out as I have stated. <br />At that time a dream also came to light, which had been seen often before this by many persons, but without being clear as to how it would turn out. And the dream was as follows. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a>, a holy man, is reverenced above all others by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>. And they have founded a very noteworthy temple in his honour before the city on the sea-shore, in which they conduct all other customary services, and also celebrate there a festival which they call the Cypriana; and the sailors are accustomed to name after <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a> the storm, which I mentioned lately, giving it the same name as the festival, since it is wont to come on at the time at which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> have always been accustomed to celebrate the festival. This temple the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> took from the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> by violence in the reign of Honoric. And they straightway drove out their priests from the temple in great dishonour, and themselves thereafter attended to the sacred festival which, they said, now belonged to the Arians. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a>, indeed, were angry on this account and altogether at a loss, but <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a>, they say, often sent them a dream saying that there was not the least need for the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> to be concerned about him; for he himself as time went on would be his own avenger. And when the report of this was passed around and came to all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a>, they were expecting that some vengeance would come upon the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> at some time because of this sacred festival, but were unable to conjecture how in the world the vision would be realized for them. Now, therefore, when the emperor's expedition had come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, since the time had already come round and would bring the celebration of the festival on the succeeding day, the priests of the Arians, in spite of the fact that Ammatas had led the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> to <a href=/people/7581 target=_blank>Decimum</a>, cleansed the whole sanctuary and were engaged in hanging up the most beautiful of the votive offerings there, and making ready the lamps and bringing out the treasures from the store-houses and preparing all things with exactness, arranging everything according to its appropriate use. But the events in <a href=/people/7581 target=_blank>Decimum</a> turned out in the manner already described. And the priests of the Arians were off in flight, while the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> who conform to the orthodox faith came to the temple of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a>, and they burned all the lamps and attended to the sacred festival just as is customary for them to perform this service, and thus it was known to all what the vision of the dream was foretelling. This, then, came about in this way.</p>                        </div>

And what this saying was and in what manner it was spoken I shall explain. When the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> originally, pressed by hunger, were about to remove from their ancestral abodes, a certain part of them was left behind who were reluctant to go and not desirous of following Godigisclus. And as time went on it seemed to those who had remained that they were well off as regards abundance of provisions, and <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> with his followers gained possession of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. And when this was heard by those who had not followed Godigisclus, they rejoiced, since thenceforth the country was altogether sufficient for them to live upon. But fearing lest at some time much later either the very ones who had conquered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, or their descendants, should in some way or other be driven out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> and return to their ancestral homes (for they never supposed that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> would let <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> be held for ever), they sent ambassadors to them. And these men, upon coming before <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, said that they rejoiced with their compatriots who had met with such success, but that they were no longer able to guard the land of which he and his men had thought so little that they had settled in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. They prayed therefore that, if they laid no claim to their fatherland, they would bestow it as an unprofitable possession upon themselves, so that their title to the land might be made as secure as possible, and if anyone should come to do it harm, they might by no means disdain to die in behalf of it. <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, accordingly, and all the other <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> thought that they spoke fairly and justly, and they were in the act of granting everything which the envoys desired of them. But a certain old man who was esteemed among them and had a great reputation for discretion said that he would by no means permit such a thing. For in human affairs, he said, not one thing stands secure; nay, nothing which now exists is stable for all time for men, while as regards that which does not yet exist, there is nothing which may not come to pass. When <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> heard this, he expressed approval and decided to send the envoys away with nothing accomplished. Now at that time both he himself and the man who had given the advice were judged worthy of ridicule by all the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, as foreseeing the impossible. But when these things which have been told took place, the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> learned to take a different view of the nature of human affairs and realized that the saying was that of a wise man. <br />Now as for those <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> who remained in their native land, neither remembrance nor any name of them has been preserved to my time. For since, I suppose, they were a small number, they were either overpowered by the neighbouring barbarians or they were mingled with them not at all unwillingly and their name gave way to that of their conquerors. Indeed, when the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> were conquered at that time by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, no thought occurred to them to go from there to their ancestral homes. For they were not able to convey themselves suddenly from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> to Europe, especially as they had no ships at hand, but paid the penalty there for all the wrongs they had done the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and especially the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378209PZak class=ethnic long=20.8921 lat=37.7872>Zacynthians</a>. For at one time <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, falling suddenly upon the towns in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a>, undertook to assault <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364225STai class=place long=22.4867 lat=36.4018>Taenarum</a>. And being repulsed from there and losing many of his followers he retired in complete disorder. And while he was still filled with anger on account of this, he touched at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378209PZak class=place long=20.8921 lat=37.7872>Zacynthus</a>, and having killed many of those he met and enslaved five hundred of the notables, he sailed away soon afterwards. And when he reached the middle of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421170WAdr class=place long=16.95 lat=42.09>Adriatic</a> Sea, as it is called, he cut into small pieces the bodies of the five hundred and threw them all about the sea without the least concern. But this happened in earlier times.</p>                        </div>

These he commanded to kill the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who went out into the country, proclaiming a fixed sum of gold for each man killed, to be paid to him who did the deed. And they killed many from the Roman army, not soldiers, however, but slaves and servants, who because of a desire for money went up into the villages stealthily and were caught. And the farmers brought their heads before <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> and departed receiving their pay, while he supposed that they had slain soldiers of the enemy. <br />At that time <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>, the aide of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, made a display of valorous deeds. For having been sent, together with twenty-two of the body-guards, to spy upon their opponents, he came to a place two days' journey distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. And the farmers of the place, being unable to kill these men, reported to <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> that they were there. And he chose out and sent against them three hundred horsemen of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, enjoining upon them to bring all the men alive before him. For it seemed to him a most remarkable achievement to make captive a personal aide of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> with twenty-two body-guards. Now <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> and his party had entered a certain house and were sleeping in the upper storey, having no thought of the enemy in mind, since, indeed, they had learned that their opponents were far away. But the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, coming there at early dawn, thought it would not be to their advantage to destroy the doors of the house or to enter it in the dark, fearing lest, being involved in a night encounter, they might themselves destroy one another, and at the same time, if that should happen, provide a way of escape for a large number of the enemy in the darkness. But they did this because cowardice had paralyzed their minds, though it would have been possible for them with no trouble, by carrying torches or even without these, to catch their enemies in their beds not only without weapons, but absolutely naked besides. But as it was, they made a phalanx in a circle about the whole house and especially at the doors, and all took their stand there. But in the meantime it so happened that one of the Roman soldiers was roused from sleep, and he, noticing the noise which the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> made as they talked stealthily among themselves and moved with their weapons, was able to comprehend what was being done, and rousing each one of his comrades silently, he told them what was going on. And they, following the opinion of <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>, all put on their clothes quietly and taking up their weapons went below. There they put the bridles on their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and leaped upon them unperceived by anyone. And after standing for a time by the court-yard entrance, they suddenly opened the door there, and straightway all came out. And then the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> immediately closed with them, but they accomplished nothing. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> rode hard, covering themselves with their shields and warding off their assailants with their spears. And in this way <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> escaped the enemy, losing two of his followers, but saving the rest. He himself, however, received three blows in this encounter on the neck and the face, from which indeed he came within a little of dying, and one blow also on the left hand, as a result of which he was thereafter unable to move his little finger. This, then, took place in this way. <br />And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> offered great sums of money to the artisans engaged in the building trade and to the general throng of workmen, and by this means he dug a trench deserving of great admiration about the circuit-wall, and setting stakes close together along it he made an excellent stockade about the fortifications. And not only this, but he built up in a short time the portions of the wall which had suffered, a thing which seemed worthy of wonder not only to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>, but also to <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> himself at a later time. For when he came as a captive to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, he marvelled when he saw the wall and said that his own negligence had proved the cause of all his present troubles. This, then, was accomplished by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> while in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>.</p>                        </div>

And when he heard that the emperor's expedition was in the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, having as yet learned nothing of what had been done there, he wrote to <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> as follows: Know, O King of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and <a href=/people/2232 target=_blank>Alani</a>, that the tyrant Godas has perished, having fallen into our hands, and that the island is again under thy kingdom, and celebrate the festival of triumph. And as for the enemy who have had the daring to march against our land, expect that their attempt will come to the same fate as that experienced by those who in former times marched against our ancestors. And those who took this letter sailed into the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> with no thought of the enemy in mind. And being brought by the guards before the general, they put the letter into his hands and gave him information on the matters about which he enquired, being thunderstruck at what they beheld and awed at the suddenness of the change; however, they suffered nothing unpleasant at the hand of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. <br />At this same time another event also occurred as follows. A short time before the emperor's expedition reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> had sent envoys into Spain, among whom were Gothaeus and Fuscias, in order to persuade Theudis, the ruler of the <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a>, to establish an alliance with the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. And these envoys, upon disembarking on the mainland after crossing the strait at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gadira</a>, found Theudis in a place situated far from the sea. And when they had come up to the place where he was, Theudis received them with friendliness and entertained them heartily, and during the feast he pretended to enquire how matters stood with <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> and the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. Now since these envoys had travelled to him rather slowly, it happened that he had heard from others everything which had befallen the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. For one merchant ship sailing for trade had put out from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> on the very same day as the army marched into the city, and finding a favouring wind, had come to Spain. From those on this ship Theudis learned all that had happened in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, but he forbade the merchants to reveal it to anyone, in order that this might not become generally known. And when Gothaeus and his followers replied that everything was as well as possible for them, he asked them for what purpose, then, they had come. And when they proposed the alliance, Theudis bade them go to the sea-coast; For from there, he said, you will learn of the affairs at home with certainty. And the envoys, supposing that the man was in his cups and his words were not sane, remained silent. But when on the following day they met him and made mention of the alliance, and Theudis used the same words a second time, then at length they understood that some change of fortune had befallen them in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, but never once thinking of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> they sailed for the city. And upon coming to land close by it and happening upon Roman soldiers, they put themselves in their hands to do with them as they wished. And from there they were led away to the general, and reporting the whole story, they suffered no harm at his hand. These things, then, happened thus. And <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a>, upon coming near to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a> and learning what had happened to Godas, sailed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, and there, finding the Roman army and <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> victorious, he remained at rest; and <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> was sent to the emperor in order to announce what had been accomplished.</p>                        </div>

Few Moors, however, joined his alliance, and these were altogether insubordinate. For all those who ruled over the Moors in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=place long=-5 lat=35>Mauretania</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a> sent envoys to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> saying that they were slaves of the emperor and promised to fight with him. There were some also who even furnished their children as hostages and requested that the symbols of office be sent them from him according to the ancient custom. For it was a law among the Moors that no one should be a ruler over them, even if he was hostile to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, until the emperor of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> should give him the tokens of the office. And though they had already received them from the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, they did not consider that the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> held the office securely. Now these symbols are a staff of silver covered with gold, and a silver cap, — not covering the whole head, but like a crown and held in place on all sides by bands of silver, — a kind of white cloak gathered by a golden brooch on the right shoulder in the form of a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> cape, and a white tunic with embroidery, and a gilded boot. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> sent these things to them, and presented each one of them with much money. However, they did not come to fight along with him, nor, on the other hand, did they dare give their support to the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, but standing out of the way of both contestants, they waited to see what would be the outcome of the war. Thus, then, matters stood with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. <br />But <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> sent one of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a> with a letter to his brother Tzazon. And he went quickly to the coast, and finding by chance a merchant-ship putting out to sea, he sailed into the harbour of Caranalis and put the letter into the hands of Tzazon. Now the message of the letter was as follows: <br />It was not, I venture to think, Godas who caused the island to revolt from us, but some curse of madness sent from <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a> which fell upon the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. For by depriving us of you and the notables of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, it has seized and carried off from the house of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> absolutely all the blessings which we enjoyed. For it was not to recover the island for us that you sailed from here, but in order that <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> might be master of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. For that which <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> had decided upon previously it is now possible to know from the outcome. <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, then, has come against us with a small army, but valour straightway departed and fled from the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, taking good fortune with her. For Ammatas and Gibamundus have fallen, because the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> lost their courage, and the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and shipyards and all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> and, not least of all, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> itself, are held already by the enemy. And the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> are sitting here, having paid with their children and wives and all their possessions for their failure to play the part of brave men in battle, and to us is left only the plain of Boulla, where our hope in you has set us down and still keeps us. But do you have done with such matters as rebel tyrants and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a> and the cares concerning these things, and come to us with your whole force as quickly as possible. For when men find the very heart and centre of all in danger, it is not advisable for them to consider minutely other matters. And struggling hereafter in common against the enemy, we shall either recover our previous fortune, or gain the advantage of not bearing apart from each other the hard fate sent by <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a>. <br />When this letter had been brought to Tzazon, and he had disclosed its contents to the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, they turned to wailing and lamentation, not openly, however, but concealing their feelings as much as possible and avoiding the notice of the islanders, silently among themselves they bewailed the fate which was upon them. And straightway setting in order matters in hand just as chance directed, they manned the ships. And sailing from there with the whole fleet, on the third day they came to land at the point of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> which marks the boundary between the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=ethnic long=-5 lat=35>Mauretanians</a>. And they reached the plain of Boulla travelling on foot, and there joined with the rest of the army. And in that place there were many most pitiable scenes among the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, which I, at least, could never relate as they deserve. For I think that even if one of the enemy themselves had happened to be a spectator at that time, he would probably have felt pity, in spite of himself, for the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and for human fortune. For <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> and Tzazon threw their arms about each other's necks, and could not let go, but they spoke not a word to each other, but kept wringing their hands and weeping, and each one of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> with <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> embraced one of those who had come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>, and did the same thing. And they stood for a long time as if grown together and found such comfort as they could in this, and neither did the men of <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> think fit to ask about Godas (for their present fortune had prostrated them and caused them to reckon such things as had previously seemed to them most important with those which were now utterly negligible), nor could those who came from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a> bring themselves to ask about what had happened in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. For the place was sufficient to permit them to judge of what had come to pass. And indeed they did not make any mention even of their own wives and children, knowing well that whoever of theirs was not there had either died or fallen into the hands of the enemy. Thus, then, did these things happen.</p>                        </div>

And when they came close to it, they tore down a portion of the aqueduct, — a structure well worth seeing — which conducted water into the city, and after encamping for a time they withdrew, since no one of the enemy came out against them. And going about the country there they kept the roads under guard and thought that in this way they were besieging <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>; however, they did not gather any booty, nor plunder the land, but took possession of it as their own. And at the same time they kept hoping that there would be some treason on the part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> themselves and such of the Roman soldiers as followed the doctrine of <a href=/people/1934 target=_blank>Arius</a>. They also sent to the leaders of the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a>, and promising that they would have many good things from the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, entreated them to become their friends and allies. Now the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> even before this had not been well-disposed toward the cause of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, since they had not indeed come to them willingly as allies (for they asserted that the Roman general Peter had given an oath and then, disregarding what had been sworn, had thus brought them to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>), and accordingly they received the words of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, and promised that when they should come to real fighting they would turn with them against the Roman army. But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had a suspicion of all this (for he had heard it from the deserters), and also the circuit-wall had not as yet been completed entirely, and for these reasons he did not think it possible for his men to go out against the enemy for the present, but he was making his preparations within as well as possible. And one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>, <a href=/people/7864 target=_blank>Laurus</a> by name, having been condemned on a charge of treason and proved guilty by his own secretary, was impaled by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> on a hill before the city, and as a result of this the others came to feel a sort of irresistible fear and refrained from attempts at treason. And he courted the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a> with gifts and banquets and every other manner of flattering attention every day, and thus persuaded them to disclose to him what <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> had promised them on condition of their turning traitors in the battle. And these barbarians said that they had no enthusiasm for fighting, for they feared that, if the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> were vanquished, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> would not send them back to their native land, but they would be compelled to grow old and die right there in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>; and besides they were also concerned, they said, about the booty, lest they be robbed of it. Then indeed <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> gave them pledges that, if the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> should be conquered decisively, they would be sent without the least delay to their homes with all their booty, and thus he bound them by oaths in very truth to assist the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> with all zeal in carrying through the war. <br />And when all things had been prepared by him in the best way possible, and the circuit-wall had been already completed, he called together the whole army and spoke as follows: As for exhortation, fellow <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, I do not know that it is necessary to make any to you, — men who have recently conquered the enemy so completely that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> here and the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> is a possession of your valour, and for this reason you will have no need of admonition that prompts to daring. For the spirits of those who have conquered are by no means wont to be overcome. But I think it not untimely to remind you of this one thing, that, if you on the present occasion but prove equal to your own selves in valour, straightway there will be an end for the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> of their hopes, and for you of the battle. Hence there is every reason why you should enter into this engagement with the greatest eagerness. For ever sweet to men is toil coming to an end and reaching its close. Now as for the host of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, let no one of you consider them. For not by numbers of men nor by measure of body, but by valour of soul, is war wont to be decided. And let the strongest motive which actuates men come to your minds, namely, pride in past achievement. For it is a shame, for those at least who have reason, to fall short of one's own self and to be found inferior to one's own standard of valour. For I know well that terror and the memory of misfortunes have laid hold upon the enemy and compel them to become less brave, for the one fills them with fear because of what has already happened, and the other brushes aside their hope of success. For <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, once seen to be bad, straightway enslaves the spirit of those who have fallen in her way. And I shall explain how the struggle involves for you at the present time a greater stake than formerly. For in the former battle the danger was, if things did not go well for us, that we should not take the land of others; but now, if we do not win the struggle, we shall lose the land which is our own. In proportion, then, as it is easier to possess nothing than to be deprived of what one has, just so now our fear touches our most vital concerns more than before. And yet formerly we had the fortune to win the victory with the infantry absent, but now, entering the battle with God propitious and with our whole army, I have hopes of capturing the camp of the enemy, men and all. Thus, then, having the end of the war ready at hand, do not by reason of any negligence put it off to another time, lest you be compelled to seek for the opportune moment after it has run past us. For when the fortune of war is postponed, its nature is not to proceed in the same manner as before, especially if the war be prolonged by the will of those who are carrying it on. For <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a> is accustomed to bring retribution always upon those who abandon the good fortune which is present. But if anyone considers that the enemy, seeing their children and wives and most precious possessions in our hands, will be daring beyond reason and will incur risks beyond the strength which they have, he does not think rightly. For an overpowering passion springing up in the heart in behalf of what is most precious is wont to diminish men's actual strength and does not allow them to make full use of their present opportunities. Considering, then, all these things, it behooves you to go with great contempt against the enemy.</p>                        </div>

And he himself on the following day followed with the infantry forces and the five hundred horsemen. And the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a>, deliberating among themselves, decided, in order to seem in friendly agreement with both <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> and <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, neither to begin fighting for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> nor to go over to the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> before the encounter, but whenever the situation of one or the other army should be bad, then to join the victors in their pursuit of the vanquished. Thus, then, had this matter been decided upon by the barbarians. And the Roman army came upon the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> encamped in Tricamarum, one hundred and fifty stades distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. So they both bivouacked there at a considerable distance from one another. And when it was well on in the night, a prodigy came to pass in the Roman camp as follows. The tips of their spears were lighted with a bright fire and the points of them seemed to be burning most vigorously. This was not seen by many, but it filled with consternation the few who did see it, not knowing how it would come out. And this happened to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> again at a much later time. And at that time, since they knew by experience, they believed it to be a sign of victory. But now, as I have said, since this was the first time it had happened, they were filled with consternation and passed the night in great fear. <br />And on the following day <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> commanded the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> to place the women and children and all their possessions in the middle of the stockade, although it had not the character of a fort, and calling all together, he spoke as follows: It is not to gain glory, or to retrieve the loss of empire alone, O fellow <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, that we are about to fight, so that even if we wilfully played the coward and sacrificed these our belongings we might possibly live, sitting at home and keeping our own possessions; but you see, surely, that our fortunes have come round to such a pass that, if we do not gain the mastery over the enemy, we shall, if we perish, leave them as masters of these our children and our wives and our land and all our possessions, while if we survive, there will be added our own enslavement and to behold all these enslaved; but if, indeed, we overcome our foes in the war, we shall, if we live, pass our lives among all good things, or, after the glorious ending of our lives, there will be left to our wives and children the blessings of prosperity, while the name of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> will survive and their empire be preserved. For if it has ever happened to any men to be engaged in a struggle for their all, we now more than all others realize that we are entering the battle-line with our hopes for all we have resting wholly upon ourselves. Not for our bodies, then, is our fear, nor in death is our danger, but in being defeated by the enemy. For if we lose the victory, death will be to our advantage. Since, therefore, the case stands so, let no one of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> weaken, but let him proudly expose his body, and from shame at the evils that follow defeat let him court the end of life. For when a man is ashamed of that which is shameful, there is always present with him a dauntless courage in the face of danger. And let no recollection of the earlier battle come into your minds. For it was not by cowardice on our part that we were defeated, but we tripped upon obstacles interposed by fortune and were overthrown. Now it is not the way of the tide of fortune to flow always in the same direction, but every day, as a rule, it is wont to change about. In manliness it is our boast that we surpass the enemy, and that in numbers we are much superior; for we believe that we surpass them no less than tenfold. And why shall I add that many and great are the incentives which, now especially, urge us on to valour, naming the glory of our ancestors and the empire which has been handed down to us by them? For in our case that glory is obscured by our unlikeness to our kindred, while the empire is bent upon fleeing from us as unworthy. And I pass over in silence the wails of these poor women and the tears of our children, by which, as you see, I am now so deeply moved that I am unable to prolong my discourse. But having said this one thing, I shall stop, — that there will be for us no returning to these most precious possessions if we do not gain the mastery over the enemy. Remembering these things, shew yourselves brave men and do not bring shame upon the fame of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>. <br />After speaking such words, <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> commanded his brother Tzazon to deliver an exhortation separately to the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> who had come with him from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>. And he gathered them together a little apart from the camp and spoke as follows: For all the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, fellow soldiers, the struggle is in behalf of those things which you have just heard the king recount, but for you, in addition to all the other considerations, it so happens that you are vying with yourselves. For you have recently been victorious in a struggle for the maintenance of our rule, and you have recovered the island for the empire of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>; there is every reason, therefore, for you to make still greater display of your valour. For those whose hazard involves the greatest things must needs display the greatest zeal for warfare also. Indeed, when men who struggle for the maintenance of their rule are defeated, should it so happen, they have not failed in the most vital part; but when men are engaged in battle for their all, surely their very lives are influenced by the outcome of the struggle. And for the rest, if you shew yourselves brave men at the present time, you will thereby prove with certainty that the destruction of the tyrant Godas was an achievement of valour on your part; but if you weaken now, you will be deprived of even the renown of those deeds, as of something which does not belong to you at all. And yet, even apart from this, it is reasonable to think that you will have an advantage over the rest of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> in this battle. For those who have failed are dismayed by their previous fortune, while those who have encountered no reverse enter the struggle with their courage unimpaired. And this too, I think, will not be spoken out of season, that if we conquer the enemy, it will be you who will win the credit for the greatest part of the victory, and all will call you saviours of the nation of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. For men who achieve renown in company with those who have previously met with misfortune naturally claim the better fortune as their own. Considering all these things, therefore, I say that you should bid the women and children who are lamenting their fate to take courage even now, should summon God to fight with us, should go with enthusiasm against the enemy, and lead the way for our compatriots into this battle.</p>                        </div>

Now the stream at that place is an ever-flowing one, to be sure, but its volume is so small that it is not even given a special name by the inhabitants of the place, but it is designated simply as a brook. So the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> came to the other bank of this river, after preparing themselves as well as they could under the circumstances, and arrayed themselves as follows. The left wing was held by <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> and <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>, John, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a>, Althias, and <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>, and as many others as were commanders of the foederati [3]; and the right was held by Pappas, Barbatus, and Aïgan, and the others who commanded the forces of cavalry. And in the centre John took his position, leading the guards and spearmen of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and carrying the general's standard. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> also came there at the opportune moment with his five hundred horsemen, leaving the infantry behind advancing at a walk. For all the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> had been arrayed in another place, it being customary for them even before this not to mingle with the Roman army if they could avoid so doing, and at that time especially, since they had in mind the purpose which has previously been explained, it was not their wish to be arrayed with the rest of the army. Such, then, was the formation of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. And on the side of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, either wing was held by the chiliarchs, and each one led the division under him, while in the centre was Tzazon, the brother of <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, and behind him were arrayed the Moors. But <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> himself was going about everywhere exhorting them and urging them on to daring. And the command had been previously given to all the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> to use neither spear nor any other weapon in this engagement except their swords. <br />After a considerable time had passed and no one began the battle, John chose out a few of those under him by the advice of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and crossing the river made an attack on the centre, where Tzazon crowded them back and gave chase. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in flight came into their own camp, while the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> in pursuit came as far as the stream, but did not cross it. And once more John, leading out more of the guardsmen of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, made a dash against the forces of Tzazon, and again being repulsed from there, withdrew to the Roman camp. And a third time with almost all the guards and spearmen of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> he took the general's standard and made his attack with much shouting and a great noise. But since the barbarians manfully withstood them and used only their swords, the battle became fierce, and many of the noblest of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> fell, and among them Tzazon himself, the brother of <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>. Then at last the whole Roman army was set in motion, and crossing the river they advanced upon the enemy, and the rout, beginning at the centre, became complete; for each of the Roman divisions turned to flight those before them with no trouble. And the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a>, seeing this, according to their agreement among themselves joined the Roman army in making the pursuit, but this pursuit was not continued for a great distance. For the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> entered their own camp quickly and remained quiet, while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, thinking that they would not be able to fight it out with them inside the stockade, stripped such of the corpses as had gold upon them and retired to their own camp. And there perished in this battle, of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> less than fifty, but of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> about eight hundred. <br />But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, when the infantry came up in the late afternoon, moved as quickly as he could with the whole army and went against the camp of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. And <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, realising that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> with his infantry and the rest of his army was coming against him straightway, without saying a word or giving a command leaped upon his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and was off in flight on the road leading to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a>. And his kinsmen and some few of his domestics followed him in utter consternation and guarding with silence what was taking place. And for some time it escaped the notice of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> that <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> had run away, but when they all perceived that he had fled, and the enemy were already plainly seen, then indeed the men began to shout and the children cried out and the women wailed. And they neither took with them the money they had nor did they heed the laments of those dearest to them, but every man fled in complete disorder just as he could. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, coming up, captured the camp, money and all, with not a man in it; and they pursued the fugitives throughout the whole night, killing all the men upon whom they happened, and making slaves of the women and children. And they found in this camp a quantity of wealth such as has never before been found, at least in one place. For the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> had plundered the Roman domain for a long time and had transferred great amounts of money to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, and since their land was an especially good one, nourishing abundantly with the most useful crops, it came about that the revenue collected from the commodities produced there was not paid out to any other country in the purchase of a food supply, but those who possessed the land always kept for themselves the income from it for the ninety-five years during which the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> ruled <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. And from this it resulted that their wealth, amounting to an extraordinary sum, returned once more on that day into the hands of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. So this battle and the pursuit and the capture of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>' camp happened three months after the Roman army came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, at about the middle of the last month, which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call December.

                        <div class="text-right bottommargin-sm">

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg4029.tlg001:4.4.1'><b>&sect; 4.4.1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, seeing the Roman army rushing about in confusion and great disorder, was disturbed, being fearful throughout the whole night lest the enemy, uniting by mutual agreement against him, should do him irreparable harm. And if this thing had happened at that time in any way at all, I believe that, not one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> would have escaped and enjoyed this booty. For the soldiers, being extremely poor men, upon becoming all of a sudden masters of very great wealth and of women both young and extremely comely, were no longer able to restrain their minds or to find any satiety in the things they had, but were so intoxicated, drenched as they were by their present good fortunes, that each one wished to take everything with him back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. And they were going about, not in companies but alone or by twos, wherever hope led them, searching out everything roundabout among the valleys and the rough country and wherever there chanced to be a cave or anything such as might bring them into danger or ambush. For neither did fear of the enemy nor their respect for <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> occur to them, nor indeed anything else at all except the desire for spoils, and being overmastered by this they came to think lightly of everything else. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, taking note of all this, was at a loss as to how he should handle the situation. But at daybreak he took his stand upon a certain hill near the road, appealing to the discipline which no longer existed and heaping reproaches upon all, soldiers and officers alike. Then indeed, those who chanced to be near, and especially those who were of the household of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, sent the money and slaves which they had to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> with their tentmates and messmates, and themselves came up beside the general and gave heed to the orders given them. <br />And he commanded John, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=person long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a>, with two hundred men to follow <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, and without slackening their speed either night or day to pursue him, until they should take him living or dead. And he sent word to his associates in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> to lead into the city all the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> who were sitting as suppliants in sanctuaries in the places about the city, giving them pledges and taking away their weapons, that they might not begin an uprising, and to keep them there until he himself should come. And with those who were left he went about everywhere and gathered the soldiers hastily, and to all the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> he came upon he gave pledges for their safety. For it was no longer possible to catch anyone of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> except as a suppliant in the sanctuaries. And from these he took away their weapons and sent them, with soldiers to guard them, to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, not giving them time to unite against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. And when everything was as well settled as possible, he himself with the greater part of the army moved against <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> with all speed. But John, after continuing the pursuit five days and nights, had already come not far from <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, and in fact he was about to engage with him on the following day. But since it was not fated that <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> should be captured by John, the following obstacle was contrived by fortune. Among those pursuing with John it happened that there was Uliaris, the aide of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. Now this man was a passionate fellow and well favoured in strength of heart and body, but not a very serious man, but one who generally took delight in wine and buffoonery. This Uliaris on the sixth day of the pursuit, being drunk, saw a bird sitting in a tree at about sunrise, and he quickly stretched his bow and despatched a missile at the bird. And he missed the bird, but John, who was behind it, he hit in the neck by no will of his own. And since the wound was mortal, John passed away a short time afterwards, leaving great sorrow at his loss to the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> and <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, the general, and to all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>. For in manliness and every sort of virtue he was well endowed, and he shewed himself, to those who associated with him, gentle and equitable to a degree quite unsurpassed. Thus, then, John fulfilled his destiny. As for Uliaris, when he came to himself, he fled to a certain village which was near by and sat as a suppliant in the sanctuary there. And the soldiers no longer pressed the pursuit of <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, but they cared for John as long as he survived, and when he had died they carried out all the customary rites in his burial, and reporting the whole matter to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> they remained where they were. And as soon as he heard of it, he came to John's burial, and bewailed his fate. And after weeping over him and grieving bitterly at the whole occurrence, he honoured the tomb of John with many gifts and especially by providing for it a regular income. However, he did nothing severe to Uliaris, since the soldiers said that John had enjoined upon them by the most dread oaths that no vengeance should come to him, since he had not performed the unholy deed with deliberate intent. <br />Thus, then, <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> escaped falling into the hands of the enemy on that day. And from that time on <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> pursued him, but upon reaching a strong city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a> situated on the sea, ten days distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, which they call <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369077UHip class=place long=7.7467 lat=36.8813>Hippo</a> Regius, he learned that <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> had ascended the mountain Papua and could no longer be captured by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. Now this mountain is situated at the extremity of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a> and is exceedingly precipitous and climbed only with the greatest difficulty (for lofty cliffs rise up toward it from every side), and on it dwell barbarian Moors, who were friends and allies to <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, and an ancient city named <a href=/people/6654 target=_blank>Medeus</a> lies on the outskirts of the mountain. There <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> rested with his followers. But as for <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, he was not able to make any attempt at all on the mountain, much less in the winter season, and since his affairs were still in an uncertain state, he did not think it advisable to be away from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>; and so he chose out soldiers, with Pharas as their leader, and set them to maintain the siege of the mountain. Now this Pharas was energetic and thoroughly serious and upright in every way, although he was an <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Erulian</a> by birth. And for an <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Erulian</a> not to give himself over to treachery and drunkenness, but to strive after uprightness, is no easy matter and merits abundant praise. But not only was it Pharas who maintained orderly conduct, but also all the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Erulians</a> who followed him. This Pharas, then, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> commanded to establish himself at the foot of the mountain during the winter season and to keep close guard, so that it would neither be possible for <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> to leave the mountain nor for any supplies to be brought in to him. And Pharas acted accordingly. Then <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> turned to the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> who were sitting as suppliants in the sanctuaries in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369077UHip class=place long=7.7467 lat=36.8813>Hippo</a> Regius, — and there were many of them and of the nobility — and he caused them all to accept pledges and arise, and then he sent them to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> with a guard. And there it came about that the following event happened to him. <br />In the house of <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> there was a certain scribe named Boniface, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=demonym long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyan</a>, and a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>, a man exceedingly faithful to <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>. At the beginning of this war <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> had put this Boniface on a very swift-sailing ship, and placing all the royal treasure in it commanded him to anchor in the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369077UHip class=place long=7.7467 lat=36.8813>Hippo</a> Regius, and if he should see that the situation was not favourable to their side, he was to sail with all speed to Spain with the money, and go to Theudis, the leader of the <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a>, where he was expecting to find safety for himself also, should the fortune of war prove adverse for the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. So Boniface, as long as he felt hope for the cause of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, remained there; but as soon as the battle in Tricamarum took place, with all the other events which have been related, he spread his canvas and sailed away just as <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> had directed him. But an opposing wind brought him back, much against his will, into the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369077UHip class=place long=7.7467 lat=36.8813>Hippo</a> Regius. And since he had already heard that the enemy were somewhere near, he entreated the sailors with many promises to row with all their might for some other continent or for an island. But they were unable to do so, since a very severe storm had fallen upon them and the waves of the sea were rising to a great height, seeing that it was the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscan</a> sea, and then it occurred to them and to Boniface that, after all, God wished to give the money to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and so was not allowing the ship to put out. However, though they had got outside the harbour, they encountered great danger in bringing their ship back to anchorage. And when <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369077UHip class=place long=7.7467 lat=36.8813>Hippo</a> Regius, Boniface sent some men to him. These he commanded to sit in a sanctuary, and they were to say that they had been sent by Boniface, who had the money of <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, but to conceal the place where he was, until they should receive the pledges of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> that upon giving <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>'s money he himself should escape free from harm, having all that was his own. These men, then, acted according to these instructions, and <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was pleased at the good news and did not decline to take an oath. And sending some of his associates he took the treasure of <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> and released Boniface in possession of his own money and also with an enormous sum which he plundered from <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>'s treasure.</p>                        </div>

So he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a> and displayed the head of Tzazon to the inhabitants of the place, and he won back both the islands and made them tributary to the Roman domain.

Another John, one of his own guardsmen, he sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gadira</a> on the strait and by one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361000LPHe class=place long=-5.3464 lat=36.123>Pillars of Heracles</a>, to take possession of the fort there which they call Septem. And to the islands which are near the strait where the ocean flows in, called Ebusa and Majorica and Minorica by the natives, he sent <a href=/people/943 target=_blank>Apollinarius</a>, who was a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, but had come while still a lad to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. And he had been rewarded with great sums of money by <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a>, who was then leader of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, and after <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a> had been removed from the office and was in confinement, as has been told in the previous narrative, he came to the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> with the other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> who were working in the interest of <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a>, in order to entreat his favour as a suppliant. And he joined the Roman expedition against <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> and the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, and proved himself a brave man in this war and most of all at Tricamarum. And as a result of his deeds there <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> entrusted to him these islands. And later <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> sent an army also into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329132UOea class=place long=13.1758 lat=32.8999>Tripolis</a> to Pudentius and Tattimuth, who were being pressed by the Moors there, and thus strengthened the Roman power in that quarter. <br />He also sent some men to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> in order to take the fortress in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378124ULil class=place long=12.4342 lat=37.7991>Lilybaeum</a>, as belonging to the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>' kingdom, but he was repulsed from there, since the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> by no means saw fit to yield any part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, on the ground that this fortress did not belong to the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> at all. And when <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> heard this, he wrote to the commanders who were there as follows: You are depriving us of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378124ULil class=place long=12.4342 lat=37.7991>Lilybaeum</a>, the fortress of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> who are the slaves of the emperor, and are not acting justly nor in a way to benefit yourselves, and you wish to bring upon your ruler, though he does not so will it and is far distant from the scene of these actions, the hostility of the great emperor, whose good-will he has, having won it with great labour. And yet how could you but seem to be acting contrary to the ways of men, it you recently allowed <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> to hold the fortress, but have decided to wrest from the emperor, <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>'s master, the possessions of the slave? You, at least, should not act thus, most excellent sirs. But reflect that, while it is the nature of friendship to cover over many faults, hostility does not brook even the smallest misdeeds, but searches the past for every offence, and allows not its enemy to grow rich on what does not in the least belong to them. Moreover, the enemy fights to avenge the wrongs which it says have been done to its ancestors; and whereas, if friendship thus turned to hostility fails in the struggle, it suffers no loss of its own possessions, yet if it succeeds, it teaches the vanquished to take a new view of the indulgence which has been shewn them in the past. See to it, then, that you neither do us further harm nor suffer harm yourselves, and do not make the great emperor an enemy to the Gothic nation, when it is your prayer that he be propitious toward you. For be well assured that, if you lay claim to this fortress, war will confront you immediately, and not for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378124ULil class=place long=12.4342 lat=37.7991>Lilybaeum</a> alone, but for all the possessions you claim as yours, though not one of them belongs to you. <br />Such was the message of the letter. And the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> reported these things to the mother of Antalaric, and at her direction made the following reply: The letter which you have written, most excellent <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, carries sound admonition, but pertinent to some other men, not to us the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. For there is nothing of the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>'s which we have taken and hold; may we never be so mad as to do such a thing! The whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> we claim because it is our own, and the fortress of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378124ULil class=place long=12.4342 lat=37.7991>Lilybaeum</a> is one of its promontories. And if <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> gave his sister, who was the consort of the king of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, one of the trading-ports of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> for her use, this is nothing. For this fact could not afford a basis for any claim on your part. But you, O General, would be acting justly toward us, if you should be willing to make the settlement of the matters in dispute between us, not as an enemy, but as a friend. And there is this difference, that friends are accustomed to settle their disagreements by arbitration, but enemies by battle. We, therefore, shall commit this matter to the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, to arbitrate in whatever manner seems to him lawful and just. And we desire that the decisions you make shall be as wise as possible, rather than as hasty as possible, and that you, therefore, await the decision of your emperor. Such was the message of the letter of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, reporting all to the emperor, remained quiet until the emperor should send him word what his wish was.</p>                        </div>

Accordingly he armed all his followers very carefully and began the ascent. But the Moors rushed to the defence, and since they were on ground which was steep and very hard to traverse, their efforts to hinder those making the ascent were easily accomplished. But Pharas fought hard to force the ascent, and one hundred and ten of his men perished in this struggle, and he himself with the remainder was beaten back and retired; and as a result of this he did not dare to attempt the ascent again, since the situation was against him, but he established as careful a guard as possible, in order that those on Papua, being pressed by hunger, might surrender themselves; and he neither permitted them to run away nor anything to be brought in to them from outside. Then, indeed, it came about that <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> and those about him, who were nephews and cousins of his and other persons of high birth, experienced a misery which no one could describe, however eloquent he might be, in a way which would equal the facts. For of all the nations which we know that of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> is the most luxurious, and that of the Moors the most hardy. For the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, since the time when they gained possession of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, used to indulge in baths, all of them, every day, and enjoyed a table abounding in all things, the sweetest and best that the earth and sea produce. And they wore gold very generally, and clothed themselves in the Medic garments, which now they call seric, and passed their time, thus dressed, in theatres and hippodromes and in other pleasureable pursuits, and above all else in hunting. And they had dancers and mimes and all other things to hear and see which are of a musical nature or otherwise merit attention among men. And the most of them dwelt in parks, which were well supplied with water and trees; and they had great numbers of banquets, and all manner of sexual pleasures were in great vogue among them. But the Moors live in stuffy huts both in winter and in summer and at every other time, never removing from them either because of snow or the heat of the sun or any other discomfort whatever due to nature. And they sleep on the ground, the prosperous among them, if it should so happen, spreading a fleece under themselves. Moreover, it is not customary among them to change their clothing with the seasons, but they wear a thick cloak and a rough shirt at all times. And they have neither bread nor wine nor any other good thing, but they take grain, either wheat or barley, and, without boiling it or grinding it to flour or barley-meal, they eat it in a manner not a whit different from that of animals. Since the Moors, then, were of a such a sort, the followers of <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, after living with them for a long time and changing their accustomed manner of life to such a miserable existence, when at last even the necessities of life had failed, held out no longer, but death was thought by them most sweet and slavery by no means disgraceful. <br />Now when this was learned by Pharas, he wrote to <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> as follows: I too am a barbarian and not accustomed to writing and speaking, nor am I skilful in these matters. But that which I am forced as a man to know, having learned from the nature of things, this I am writing you. What in the world has happened to you, my dear <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, that you have cast, not yourself alone, but your whole family besides, into this pit? Is it, forsooth, that you may avoid becoming a slave? But this is assuredly nothing but youthful folly, and making of 'liberty' a mere shibboleth, as though liberty were worth possessing at the price of all this misery! And, after all, do you not consider that you are, even now, a slave to the most wretched of the Moors, since your only hope of being saved, if the best happens, is in them? And yet why would it not be better in every way to be a slave among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and beggared, than to be monarch on Mount Papua with Moors as your subjects? But of course it seems to you the very height of disgrace even to be a fellow slave with <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>! Away with the thought, most excellent <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>. Are not we, who also are born of noble families, proud that we are now in the service of an emperor? And indeed they say that it is the wish of the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> to have you enrolled in the senate, thus sharing in the highest honour and being a patrician, as we term that rank, and to present you with lands both spacious and good and with great sums of money, and that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> is willing to make himself responsible for your having all these things, and to give you pledges. Now as for all the miseries which fortune has brought you, you are able to bear with fortitude whatever comes from her, knowing that you are but a man and that these things are inevitable; but if fortune has purposed to temper these adversities with some admixture of good, would you of yourself refuse to accept this gladly? Or should we consider that the good gifts of fortune are not just as inevitable as are her undesirable gifts? Yet such is not the opinion of even the utterly senseless; but you, it would seem, have now lost your good judgment, steeped as you are in misfortunes. Indeed, discouragement is wont to confound the mind and to be transformed to folly. If, however, you can bear your own thoughts and refrain from rebelling against fortune when she changes, it will be possible at this very moment for you to choose that which will be wholly to your advantage, and to escape from the evils which hang over you. <br />When <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> had read this letter and wept bitterly over it, he wrote in reply as follows: I am both deeply grateful to you for the advice which you have given me and I also think it unbearable to be a slave to an enemy who wrongs me, from whom I should pray God to exact justice, if He should be propitious to me, — an enemy who, though he had never experienced any harm from me either in deeds which he suffered or in words which he heard, provided a pretext for a war which was unprovoked, and reduced me to this state of misfortune, bringing <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> against me from I know not where. And yet it is not at all unlikely that he also, since he is but a man, though he be emperor too, may have something befall him which he would not choose. But as for me, I am not able to write further. For my present misfortune has robbed me of my thoughts. Farewell, then, dear Pharas, and send me a lyre and one loaf of bread and a sponge, I pray you. When this reply was read by Pharas, he was at a loss for some time, being unable to understand the final words of the letter, until he who had brought the letter explained that <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> desired one loaf because he was eager to enjoy the sight of it and to eat it, since from the time when he went up upon Papua he had not seen a single baked loaf. A sponge also was necessary for him; for one of his eyes, becoming irritated by lack of washing, was greatly swollen. And being a skilful harpist he had composed an ode relating to his present misfortune, which he was eager to chant to the accompaniment of a lyre while he wept out his soul. When Pharas heard this, he was deeply moved, and lamenting the fortune of men, he did as was written and sent all the things which <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> desired of him. However he relaxed the siege not a whit, but kept watch more closely than before.</p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> was afraid, suspecting that his besiegers would come up against him after no great time; and the bodies of most of the children who were related to him were discharging worms in this time of misery. And though in everything he was deeply distressed, and looked upon everything, — except, indeed, death, — with dissatisfaction, he nevertheless endured the suffering beyond all expectation, until it happened that he beheld a sight such as the following. A certain Moorish woman had managed somehow to crush a little corn, and making of it a very tiny cake, threw it into the hot ashes on the hearth. For thus it is the custom among the Moors to bake their loaves. And beside this hearth two children were sitting, in exceedingly great distress by reason of their hunger, the one being the son of the very woman who had thrown in the cake, and the other a nephew of <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>; and they were eager to seize the cake as soon as it should seem to them to be cooked. And of the two children the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandal</a> got ahead of the other and snatched the cake first, and, though it was still exceedingly hot and covered with ashes, hunger overpowered him, and he threw it into his mouth and was eating it, when the other seized him by the hair of the head and struck him over the temple and beat him again and thus compelled him with great violence to cast out the cake which was already in his throat. This sad experience <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> could not endure (for he had followed all from the beginning), and his spirit was weakened and he wrote as quickly as possible to Pharas as follows: If it has ever happened to any man, after manfully enduring terrible misfortunes, to take a course contrary to that which he had previously determined upon, consider me to be such a one, O most excellent Pharas. For there has come to my mind your advice, which I am far from wishing to disregard. For I cannot resist fortune further nor rebel against fate, but I shall follow straightway wherever it seems to her best to lead; but let me receive the pledges, that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> guarantees that the emperor will do everything which you recently promised me. For I, indeed, as soon as you give the pledges, shall put both myself into your hands and these kinsmen of mine and the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, as many as are here with us. <br />Such were the words written by <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> in this letter. And Pharas, having signified this to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, as well as what they had previously written to each other, begged him to declare as quickly as possible what his wish was. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> (since he was greatly desirous of leading <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> alive to the emperor), as soon as he had read the letter, became overjoyed and commanded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a>, a leader of foederati, to go to Papua with certain others, and directed them to give an oath concerning the safety of <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> and of those with him, and to swear that he would be honoured before the emperor and would lack nothing. And when these men had come to Pharas, they went with him to a certain place by the foot of the mountain, where <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> came at their summons, and after receiving the pledges just as he wished he came with them to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. And it happened that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was staying for a time in the suburb of the city which they call Aclas. Accordingly <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> came before him in that place, laughing with such laughter as was neither moderate nor the kind one could conceal, and some of those who were looking at him suspected that by reason of the extremity of his affliction he had changed entirely from his natural state and that, already beside himself, he was laughing for no reason. But his friends would have it that the man was in his sound mind, and that because he had been born in a royal family, and had ascended the throne, and had been clothed with great power and immense wealth from childhood even to old age, and then being driven to flight and plunged into great fear had undergone the sufferings on Papua, and now had come as a captive, having in this way had experience of all the gifts of fortune, both good and evil, for this reason, they believed, he thought that man's lot was worthy of nothing else than much laughter. Now concerning this laughter of <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>'s, let each one speak according to his judgment, both enemy and friend. But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, reporting to the emperor that <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> was a captive in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, asked permission to bring him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> with him. At the same time he guarded both him and all the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> in no dishonour and proceeded to put the fleet in readiness. <br />Now many other things too great to be hoped for have before now been experienced in the long course of time, and they will continue as long as the fortunes of men are the same as they now are; for those things which seem to reason impossible are actually accomplished, and many times those things which previously appeared impossible, when they have befallen, have seemed to be worthy of wonder; but whether such events as these ever took place before I am not able to say, wherein the fourth descendant of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a>, and his kingdom at the height of its wealth and military strength, were completely undone in so short a time by five thousand men coming in as invaders and having not a place to cast anchor. For such was the number of the horsemen who followed <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, and carried through the whole war against the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. For whether this happened by chance or because of some kind of valour, one would justly marvel at it. But I shall return to the point from which I have strayed.</p>                        </div>

But envy, as is wont to happen in cases of great good fortune, was already swelling against <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, although he provided no pretext for it. For some of the officers slandered him to the emperor, charging him, without any grounds whatever, with seeking to set up a kingdom for himself, a statement for which there was no basis whatever. But the emperor did not disclose these things to the world, either because he paid no heed to the slander, or because this course seemed better to him. But he sent <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> and gave <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> the opportunity to choose whichever of two things he desired, either to come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> with <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> and the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, or to remain there and send them. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, since it did not escape him that the officers were bringing against him the charge of seeking supreme power, was eager to get to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, in order that he might clear himself of the charge and be able to proceed against his slanderers. Now as to the manner in which he learned of the attempt of his accusers, I shall explain. When those who denounced him wished to present this slander, fearing lest the man who was to carry their letter to the emperor should be lost at sea and thus put a stop to their proceedings, they wrote the aforesaid accusation on two tablets, purposing to send two messengers to the emperor in two ships. And one of these two sailed away without being detected, but the second, on account of some suspicion or other, was captured in Mandracium, and putting the writing into the hands of his captors, he made known what was being done. So <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, having learned in this way, was eager to come before the emperor, as has been said. Such, then, was the course of these events at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. <br />But the Moors who dwelt in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a> and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a> turned to revolt for no good reason, and they decided to break the treaty and to rise suddenly against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. And this was not out of keeping with their peculiar character. For there is among the Moors neither fear of God nor respect for men. For they care not either for oaths or for hostages, even though the hostages chance to be the children or brothers of their leaders. Nor is peace maintained among the Moors by any other means than by fear of the enemies opposing them. Now I shall set forth in what manner the treaty was made by them with <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and how it was broken. When it came to be expected that the emperor's expedition would arrive in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, the Moors, fearing lest they should receive some harm from it, consulted the oracles of their women. For it is not lawful in this nation for a man to utter oracles, but the women among them as a result of some sacred rites become possessed and foretell the future, no less than any of the ancient oracles. So on that occasion, when they made enquiry, as has been said, the women gave the response: There shall be a host from the waters, the overthrow of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, destruction and defeat of the Moors, when the general of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> shall come unbearded. When the Moors heard this, since they saw that the emperor's army had come from the sea, they began to be in great fear and were quite unwilling to fight in alliance with the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, but they sent to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and established peace, as has been stated previously, and then remained quiet and waited for the future, to see how it would fall out. And when the power of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> had now come to an end, they sent to the Roman army, investigating whether there was anyone unbearded among them holding an office. And when they saw all wearing full beards, they thought that the oracle did not indicate the present time to them, but one many generations later, interpreting the saying in that way which they themselves wished. Immediately, therefore, they were eager to break the treaty, but their fear of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> prevented them. For they had no hope that they would ever overcome the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in war, at least with him present. But when they heard that he was making his departure together with his guards and spearmen, and that the ships were already being filled with them and the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, they suddenly rose in arms and displayed every manner of outrage upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a>. For the soldiers were both few in each place on the frontier and still unprepared, so that they would not have been able to stand against the barbarians as they made inroads at every point, nor to prevent their incursions, which took place frequently and not in an open manner. But men were being killed indiscriminately and women with their children were being made slaves, and the wealth was being plundered from every part of the frontier and the whole country was being filled with fugitives. These things were reported to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> when he was just about setting sail. And since it was now too late for him to return himself, he entrusted <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> with the administration of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> and he also chose out the greatest part of his own guards and spearmen, instructing them to follow <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> and as quickly as possible to punish with all zeal those of the Moors who had risen in revolt and to exact vengeance for the injury done the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. And the emperor sent another army also to <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> with <a href=/people/6987 target=_blank>Theodoras</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=person long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocian</a>, and Ildiger, who was the son-in-law of Antonina, the wife of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. And since it was no longer possible to find the revenues of the districts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> set down in order in documents, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had recorded them in former times, inasmuch as <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> had upset and destroyed everything in the beginning, <a href=/people/1120 target=_blank>Tryphon</a> and Eustratius were sent by the emperor, in order to assess the taxes for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> each according to his proportion. But these men seemed to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> neither moderate nor endurable.</p>                        </div>

And a period of about six hundred years had now passed since anyone had attained these honours, except, indeed, <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a> and <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>, and such other emperors as had led armies against some barbarian nation and had been victorious. For he displayed the spoils and slaves from the war in the midst of the city and led a procession which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call a triumph, not, however, in the ancient manner, but going on foot from his own house to the hippodrome and then again from the barriers until he reached the place where the imperial throne is. And there was booty, — first of all, whatever articles are wont to be set apart for the royal service, — thrones of gold and carriages in which it is customary for a king's consort to ride, and much jewelry made of precious stones, and golden drinking cups, and all the other things which are useful for the royal table. And there was also silver weighing many thousands of talents and all the royal treasure amounting to an exceedingly great sum (for <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> had despoiled the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LPal class=place long=12.4884 lat=41.8896>Palatium</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, as has been said in the preceding narrative), and among these were the treasures of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, which <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, together with certain others, had brought to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> after the capture of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>. And one of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, seeing these things, approached one of those known to the emperor and said: These treasures I think it inexpedient to carry into the palace in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. Indeed, it is not possible for them to be elsewhere than in the place where <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, the king of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, formerly placed them. For it is because of these that <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> captured the palace of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and that now the Roman army has captured that the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. When this had been brought to the ears of the Emperor, he became afraid and quickly sent everything to the sanctuaries of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>. And there were slaves in the triumph, among whom was <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> himself, wearing some sort of a purple garment upon his shoulders, and all his family, and as many of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> as were very tall and fair of body. And when <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> reached the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362BHiA class=place long=36.1717 lat=36.2269>hippodrome</a> and saw the emperor sitting upon a lofty seat and the people standing on either side and realized as he looked about in what an evil plight he was, he neither wept nor cried out, but ceased not saying over in the words of the Hebrew scripture: Vanity of vanities, all is vanity. And when he came before the emperor's seat, they stripped off the purple garment, and compelled him to fall prone on the ground and do obeisance to the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>. This also <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> did, as being a suppliant of the emperor along with him. And the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> and the Empress <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> presented the children of <a href=/people/12076 target=_blank>Ilderic</a> and his offspring and all those of the family of the Emperor <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a> with sufficient sums of money, and to <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> they gave lands not to be despised in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401330RGal class=place long=33 lat=40.1>Galatia</a> and permitted him to live there together with his family. However, <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> was by no means enrolled among the patricians, since he was unwilling to change from the faith of <a href=/people/1934 target=_blank>Arius</a>. <br />[Jan. 1, 535 A.D.] A little later the triumph was celebrated by, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> in the ancient manner also. For he had the fortune to be advanced to the office of consul, and therefore was borne aloft by the captives, and as he was thus carried in his curule chair, he threw to the populace those very spoils of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandalic</a> war. For the people carried off the silver plate and golden girdles and a vast amount of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>' wealth of other sorts as a result of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>' consulship, and it seemed that after a long interval of disuse an old custom was being revived. These things, then, took place in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> in the manner described.</p>                        </div>

For it was reported that the barbarians had destroyed the soldiers in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a> and that they were pillaging and plundering everything there. But what disturbed most of all both him and all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> was the fate which befell Aïgan, the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagete</a>, and <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a>, the Thracian, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>. For both were men of great repute both in the household of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and in the Roman army, one of them, Aïgan, being among the spearmen of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, while the other, as the most courageous of all, was accustomed to carry the standard of the general in battle; such an officer the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call bandifer. Now at the time referred to these two men were commanding detatchments of cavalry in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>, and when they saw the Moors plundering everything before them and making all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> captives, they watched in a narrow pass with their followers for those who were escorting the booty, and killed them and took away all the captives. And when a report of this came to the commanders of the barbarians, Coutzinas and Esdilasas and Iourphouthes and Medisinissas, who were not far away from this pass, they moved against them with their whole army in the late afternoon. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, being a very few men and shut off in a narrow place in the midst of many thousands, were not able to ward off their assailants. For wherever they might turn, they were always shot at from the rear. Then, indeed, <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a> and Aïgan with some few men ran to the top of a rock which was near by and from there defended themselves against the barbarians. Now as long as they were using their bows, the enemy did not dare come directly to a hand-to-hand struggle with them, but they kept hurling their javelins among them; but when all the arrows of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were now exhausted, the Moors closed with them, and they defended themselves with their swords as well as the circumstances permitted. But since they were overpowered by the multitude of the barbarians, Aïgan fell there with his whole body hacked to pieces, and <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a> was seized by the enemy and led away. But straightway one of the commanders, Medisinissas, fearing lest he should escape and again make trouble for them, cut off his head and taking it to his home shewed it to his wives, for it was a remarkable sight on account of the extraordinary size of the head and the abundance of hair. And now, since the narration of the history has brought me to this point, it is necessary to tell from the beginning whence the nations of the Moors came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> and how they settled there. <br />When the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a> had withdrawn from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and had come near the boundaries of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/320350RPal class=place long=35.0001 lat=32.0206>Palestine</a>, <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>, a wise man, who was their leader on the journey, died, and the leadership was passed on to <a href=/people/1703 target=_blank>Joshua</a>, the son of Nun, who led this people into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/320350RPal class=place long=35.0001 lat=32.0206>Palestine</a>, and, by displaying a valour in war greater than that natural to a man, gained possession of the land. And after overthrowing all the nations he easily won the cities, and he seemed to be altogether invincible. Now at that time the whole country along the sea from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/336354PSid class=place long=35.371 lat=33.56>Sidon</a> as far as the boundaries of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> was called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a>. And one king in ancient times held sway over it, as is agreed by all who have written the earliest accounts of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a>. In that country there dwelt very populous tribes, the Gergesites and the Jebusites and some others with other names by which they are called in the history of the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a>. Now when these nations saw that the invading general was an irresistible prodigy, they emigrated from their ancestral homes and made their way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, which adjoined their country. And finding there no place sufficient for them to dwell in, since there has been a great population in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Aegypt</a> from ancient times, they proceeded to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. And they established numerous cities and took possession of the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> as far as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361000LPHe class=place long=-5.3464 lat=36.123>Pillars of Heracles</a>, and there they have lived even up to my time, using the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> tongue. They also built a fortress in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a>, where now is the city called Tigisis. In that place are two columns made of white stone near by the great spring, having <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> letters cut in them which say in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> tongue: We are they who fled from before the face of <a href=/people/1703 target=_blank>Joshua</a>, the robber, the son of Nun. There were also other nations settled in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> before the Moors, who on account of having been established there from of old were said to be children of the soil. And because of this they said that <a href=/people/931 target=_blank>Antaeus</a>, their king, who wrestled with <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368111UAsp class=place long=11.1155 lat=36.8378>Clipea</a>, was a son of the earth. And in later times those who removed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a> with <a href=/people/433 target=_blank>Dido</a> came to the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> as to kinsmen. And they willingly allowed them to found and hold <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. But as time went on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> became a powerful and populous city. And a battle took place between them and their neighbours, who, as has been said, had come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/320350RPal class=place long=35.0001 lat=32.0206>Palestine</a> before them and are called Moors at the present time, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> defeated them and compelled them to live a very great distance away from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. Later on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> gained the supremacy over all of them in war, and settled the Moors at the extremity of the inhabited land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, and made the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> and the other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> subject and tributary to themselves. And after this the Moors won many victories over the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and gained possession of the land now called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=place long=-5 lat=35>Mauretania</a>, extending from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gadira</a> as far as the boundaries of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/366022UIol class=place long=2.1904 lat=36.6054>Caesarea</a>, as well as the most of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> which remained. Such, then, is the story of the settlement of the Moors in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>.</p>                        </div>

Therefore it is more fitting that you should be called faithless than that the Moors should be. For the men who break treaties are not those who, when manifestly wronged, bring accusation against their neighbours and turn away from them, but those who expect to keep others in faithful alliance with them and then do them violence. And men make God their enemy, not when they march against others in order to recover their own possessions, but when they get themselves into danger of war by encroaching upon the possessions of others.

So after arranging matters in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, he proceeded with all his troops to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>. And when he reached the place which is called Mammes, where the four Moorish commanders, whom I have mentioned a little before, were encamped, he made a stockade for himself. Now there are lofty mountains there, and a level space near the foothills of the mountains, where the barbarians had made preparations for the battle and arranged their fighting order as follows. They formed a circle of their <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a>, just as, in the previous narrative, I have said Cabaon did, making the front about twelve deep. And they placed the women with the children within the circle; (for among the Moors it is customary to take also a few women, with their children, to battle, and these make the stockades and huts for them and tend the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> skilfully, and have charge of the <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a> and the food; they also sharpen the iron weapons and take upon themselves many of the tasks in connection with the preparation for battle); and the men themselves took their stand on foot in between the legs of the <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a>, having shields and swords and small spears which they are accustomed to hurl like javelins. And some of them with their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> remained quietly among the mountains. But <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> disregarded one half of the circle of the Moors, which was towards the mountain, placing no one there. For he feared lest the enemy on the mountain should come down and those in the circle should turn about and thus make the men drawn up there exposed to attack on both sides in the battle. But against the remainder of the circle he drew up his whole army, and since he saw the most of them frightened and without courage, on account of what had befallen Aïgan and <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a>, and wishing to admonish them to be of good cheer, he spoke as follows: Men who have campaigned with <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, let no fear of these men enter your minds, and, if Moors gathered to the number of fifty thousand have already defeated five hundred <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, let not this stand for you as an example. But call to mind your own valour, and consider that while the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> defeated the Moors, you have become masters of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> in war without any effort, and that it is not right that those who have conquered the greater should be terrified before those who are inferior. And indeed of all men the Moorish nation seems to be the most poorly equipped for war's struggle. For the most of them have no armour at all, and those who have shields to hold before themselves have only small ones which are not well made and are not able to turn aside what strikes against them. And after they have thrown those two small spears, if they do not accomplish anything, they turn of their own accord to flight. So that it is possible for you, after guarding against the first attack of the barbarians, to win the victory with no trouble at all. But as to your equipment of arms, you see, of course, how great is the difference between it and that of your opponents. And apart from this, both valour of heart and strength of body and experience in war and confidence because you have already conquered all your enemies, — all these advantages you have; but the Moors, being deprived of all these things, put their trust only in their own great throng. And it is easier for a few who are most excellently prepared to conquer a multitude of men not good at warfare than it is for the multitude to defeat them. For while the good soldier has his confidence in himself, the cowardly man generally finds that the very number of those arrayed with him produces a want of room that is full of peril. Furthermore, you are warranted in despising these <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a>, which cannot fight for the enemy, and when struck by our missiles will, in all probability, become the cause of considerable confusion and disorder among them. And the eagerness for battle which the enemy have acquired on account of their former success will be your ally in the fight. For daring, when it is kept commensurate with one's power, will perhaps be of some benefit even to those who make use of it, but when it exceeds one's power it lends into danger. Bearing these things in mind and despising the enemy, observe silence and order; for by taking thought for these things we shall win the victory over the disorder of the barbarians more easily and with less labour.

And not only is this so, but it is now possible to see also that we boast great superiority over them in numbers. And, furthermore, the struggle for us involves the very greatest things, either to be masters of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> or to be slaves to these braggarts. It is therefore necessary for us to be in the highest degree brave men at the present time. For it is not expedient that those whose all is at stake should be other than exceedingly courageous. And it behoves us to despise the equipment of arms which the enemy have. For if they come on foot against us, they will not be able to move rapidly, but will be worsted by the agility of the Moors, and their cavalry will be terrified both by the sight of the <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a>, and by the noise they make, which, rising above the general tumult of battle, will, in all likelihood, throw them into disorder. And if anyone by taking into consideration the victory of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> over the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> thinks them not to be withstood, he is mistaken in his judgment. For the scales of war are, in the nature of the case, turned by the valour of the commander or by fortune; and <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, who was responsible for their gaining the mastery over the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, has now, thanks to <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a>, been removed out of our way. And, besides, we too have many times conquered the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and stripped them of their power, and have thus made the victory over them a more feasible and an easier task for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>.

And at first there arose great disorder in the Roman army. For their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> were offended by the noise made by the <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a> and by the sight of them, and reared up and threw off their riders and the most of them fled in complete disorder. And in the meantime the Moors were making sallies and hurling all the small spears which they had in their hands, thus causing the Roman army to be filled with tumult, and they were hitting them with their missiles while they were unable either to defend themselves or to remain in position. But after this, <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, observing what was happening, leaped down from his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> himself first and caused all the others to do the same. And when they had dismounted, he commanded the others to stand still, and, holding their shields before them and receiving the missiles sent by the enemy, to remain in their position; but he himself, leading forward not less than five hundred men, made an attack upon the other portion of the circle. These men he commanded to draw their swords and kill the <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a> which stood at that point. Then the Moors who were stationed there beat a hasty retreat, and the men under <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> killed about two hundred <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a>, and straightway, when the <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a> fell, the circle became accessible to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. And they advanced on the run into the middle of the circle where the women of the Moors were sitting; meanwhile the barbarians in consternation withdrew to the mountain which was close by, and as they fled in complete disorder the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> followed behind and killed them.

And when <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> had just marched into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> it was reported that the barbarians with a great host had come into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a> and were plundering everything there. He therefore departed quickly with his whole army and marched against them. And when he reached Bourgaon, where the enemy were encamped, he remained some days in camp over against them, in order that, as soon as the Moors should get on level ground, he might begin the battle. But since they remained on the mountain, he marshalled his army and arrayed it for battle; the Moors, however, had no intention of ever again engaging in battle with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in level country (for already an irresistible fear had come over them), but on the mountain they hoped to overcome them more easily. Now Mt. Bourgaon is for the most part precipitous and on the side toward the east extremely difficult to ascend, but on the west it is easily accessible and rises in an even slope. And there are two lofty peaks which rise up, forming between them a sort of vale, very narrow, but of incredible depth. Now the barbarians left the peak of the mountain unoccupied, thinking that on this side no hostile movement would be made against them; and they left equally unprotected the space about the foot of the mountain where Bourgaon was easy of access. But at the middle of the ascent they made their camp and remained there, in order that, if the enemy should ascend and begin battle with them, they might at the outset, being on higher ground, shoot down upon their heads. They also had on the mountain many <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, prepared either for flight or for the pursuit, if they should win the battle. <br />Now when <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> saw that the Moors were unwilling to fight another battle on the level ground, and also that the Roman army was opposed to making a siege in a desert place, he was eager to come to an encounter with the enemy on Bourgaon. But inasmuch as he saw that the soldiers were stricken with terror because of the multitude of their opponents, which was many times greater than it had been in the previous battle, he called together the army and spoke as follows: The fear which the enemy feel toward you needs no other arraignment, but voluntarily pleads guilty, bringing forward, as it does, the testimony of its own witnesses. For you see, surely, our opponents gathered in so many tens and tens of thousands, but not daring to come down to the plain and engage with us, unable to feel confidence even in their own selves, but taking refuge in the difficulty of this place. It is therefore not even necessary to address any exhortation to you, at the present time at least. For those to whom both the circumstances and the weakness of the enemy give courage, need not, I think, the additional assistance of words. But of this one thing it will be needful to remind you, that if we fight out this engagement also with brave hearts, it will remain for us, having defeated the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and reduced the Moors to the same fortune, to enjoy all the good things of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, having no thought whatever of an enemy in our minds. But as to preventing the enemy from shooting down upon our heads, and providing that no harm come to us from the nature of the place, I myself shall make provision. <br />After making this exhortation <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> commanded <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a>, who led the excubitores [40] (for thus the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call their guards), to take with him a thousand infantrymen toward the end of the afternoon and with some of the standards to go up secretly on the east side of Bourgaon, where the mountain is most difficult of ascent and, one might say, impracticable, commanding him that, when they arrived near the crest of the mountain, they should remain quietly there and pass the rest of the night, and that at sunrise they should appear above the enemy and displaying the standards commence to shoot. And <a href=/people/6987 target=_blank>Theodoras</a> did as directed. And when it was well on in the night, they climbed up the precipitous slope and reached a point near the peak without being noticed either by the Moors or even by any of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>; for they were being sent out, it was said, as an advance guard, to prevent anyone from coming to the camp from the outside to do mischief. And at early dawn <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> with the whole army went up against the enemy to the outskirts of Bourgaon. And when morning had come and the enemy were seen near at hand, the soldiers were completely at a loss, seeing the summit of the mountain no longer unoccupied, as formerly, but covered with men who were displaying Roman standards; for already some daylight was beginning to shew. But when those on the peak began their attack, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> perceived that the army was their own and the barbarians that they had been placed between their enemy's forces, and being shot at from both sides and having no opportunity to ward off the enemy, they thought no more of resistance but turned, all of them, to a hasty flight. And since they could neither run up to the top of Bourgaon, which was held by the enemy, nor go to the plain anywhere over the lower slopes of the mountain, since their opponents were pressing upon them from that side, they went with a great rush to the vale and the unoccupied peak, some even with their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, others on foot. But since they were a numerous throng fleeing in great fear and confusion, they kept killing each other, and as they rushed into the vale, which was exceedingly deep, those who were first were being killed constantly, but their plight could not be perceived by those who were coming up behind. And when the vale became full of dead <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and men, and the bodies made a passage from Bourgaon to the other mountain, then the remainder were saved by making the crossing over the bodies. And there perished in this struggle, among the Moors fifty thousand, as was declared by those of them who survived, but among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> no one at all, nor indeed did anyone receive even a wound, either at the hand of the enemy or by any accident happening to him, but they all enjoyed this victory unscathed. All of the leaders of the barbarians also made their escape, except Esdilasas, who received pledges and surrendered himself to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. So great, however, was the multitude of women and children whom the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> seized as booty, that they would sell a Moorish boy for the price of a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> to any who wished to buy. And then the remainder of the Moors recalled the saying of their women, to the effect that their nation would be destroyed by a beardless man. <br />So the Roman army, together with its booty and with Esdilasas, marched into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>; and those of the barbarians who had not perished decided that it was impossible to settle in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>, lest they, being few, should be treated with violence by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> who were their neighbours, and with their leaders they went into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a> and made themselves suppliants of Iaudas, who ruled the Moors in Aurasium. And the only Moors who remained in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a> were those led by Antalas, who during this time had kept faith with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and together with his subjects had remained unharmed.</p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg4029.tlg001:4.13.1'><b>&sect; 4.13.1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;But during the time when these things were happening in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>, Iaudas, who ruled the Moors in Aurasium, bringing more than thirty thousand fighting men, was plundering the country of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a> and enslaving many of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a>. Now it so happened that Althias in Centuriae was keeping guard over the forts there; and he, being eager to take from the enemy some of their captives, went outside the fort with the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> who were under his command, to the number of about seventy. And reasoning that he was not able to cope with such a great multitude of Moors with only seventy men, he wished to occupy some narrow pass, so that, while the enemy were marching through it, he might be able to snatch up some of the captives. And since there are no such roads there, because flat plains extend in every direction, he devised the following plan. <br />There is a city not far distant, named Tigisis, then an unwalled place, but having a great spring at a place which was very closely shut in. Althias therefore decided to take possession of this spring, reasoning that the enemy, compelled by thirst, would surely come there; for there is no other water at all close by. Now it seemed to all upon considering the disparity of the armies that his plan was insane. But the Moors came up feeling very much wearied and greatly oppressed by the heat in the summer weather, and naturally almost overcome by an intense thirst, and they made for the spring with a great rush, having no thought of meeting any obstacle. But when they found the water held by the enemy, they all halted, at a loss what to do, the greatest part of their strength having been already expended because of their desire for water. Iaudas therefore had a parley with Althias and agreed to give him the third part of the booty, on condition that the Moors should all drink. But Althias was by no means willing to accept the proposal, but demanded that he fight with him in single combat for the booty. And this challenge being accepted by Iaudas, it was agreed that if it so fell out that Althias was overcame, the Moors should drink. And the whole Moorish army was rejoiced, being in good hope, since Althias was lean and not tall of body, while Iaudas was the finest and most warlike of all the Moors. Now both of them were, as it happened, mounted. And Iaudas hurled his spear first, but as it was coming toward him Althias succeeded with amazing skill in catching it with his right hand, thus filling Iaudas and the enemy with consternation. And with his left hand he drew his bow instantly, for he was ambidextrous, and hit and killed the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> of Iaudas. And as he fell, the Moors brought another <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> for their commander, upon which Iaudas leaped and straightway fled; and the Moorish army followed him in complete disorder. And Althias, by thus taking from them the captives and the whole of the booty, won a great name in consequence of this deed throughout all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. Such, then, was the course of these events. <br />And <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, after delaying a short time in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, led his army toward Mt. Aurasium and Iaudas, alleging against him that, while the Roman army was occupied in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>, he had plundered many of the places in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a>. And this was true. <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> was also urged on against Iaudas by the other commanders of the Moors, Massonas and Ortaïas, because of their personal enmity; Massonas, because his father Mephanias, who was the father-in-law of Iaudas, had been treacherously slain by him, and Ortaïas, because Iaudas, together with Mastinas, who ruled over the barbarians in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=place long=-5 lat=35>Mauretania</a>, had purposed to drive him and all the Moors whom he ruled from the land where they had dwelt from of old. So the Roman army, under the leadership of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, and those of the Moors who came into alliance with them, made their camp on the river Abigas, which flows along by Aurasium and waters the land there. But to Iaudas it seemed inexpedient to array himself against the enemy in the plain, but he made his preparations on Aurasium in such a way as seemed to him would offer most difficulty to his assailants. This mountain is about thirteen days' journey distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, and the largest of all known to us. For its circuit is a three days' journey for an unencumbered traveller. And for one wishing to go upon it the mountain is difficult of access and extremely wild, but as one ascends and reaches the level ground, plains are seen and many springs which form rivers and a great number of altogether wonderful parks. And the grain which grows here, and every kind of fruit, is double the size of that produced in all the rest of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. And there are fortresses also on this mountain, which are neglected, by reason of the fact that they do not seem necessary to the inhabitants. For since the time when the Moors wrested Aurasium from the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, not a single enemy had until now ever come there or so much as caused the barbarians to be afraid that they would come, but even the populous city of Tamougadis, situated against the mountain on the east at the beginning of the plain, was emptied of its population by the Moors and razed to the ground, in order that the enemy should not only not be able to encamp there, but should not even have the city as an excuse for coming near the mountain. And the Moors of that place held also the land to the west of Aurasium, a tract both extensive and fertile. And beyond these dwelt other nations of the Moors, who were ruled by Ortaïas, who had come, as was stated above, as an ally to <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. And I have heard this man say that beyond the country which he ruled there was no habitation of men, but desert land extending to a great distance, and that beyond that there are men, not black-skinned like the Moors, but very white in body and fair-haired. So much, then, for these things. <br />And <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, after bribing the Moorish allies with great sums of money and earnestly exhorting them, began the ascent of Mt. Aurasium with the whole army arrayed as for battle, thinking that on that day he would do battle with the enemy and just as he was have the matter out with them according as fortune should wish. Accordingly the soldiers did not even take with them any food, except a little, for themselves and their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. And after proceeding over very rough ground for about fifty stades, they made a bivouac. And covering a similar distance each day they came on the seventh day to a place where there was an ancient fortress and an ever-flowing stream. The place is called Shield Mountain by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in their own tongue. Now it was reported to them that the enemy were encamped there, and when they reached this place and encountered no enemy, they made camp and, preparing themselves for battle, remained there; and three days' time was spent by them in that place. And since the enemy kept altogether out of their way, and their provisions had failed, the thought came to <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> and to the whole army that there had been some plot against them on the part of the Moors who were their allies; for these Moors were not unacquainted with the conditions of travel on Aurasium, and understood, probably, what had been decided upon by the enemy; they were stealthily going out to meet them each day, it was said, and had also frequently been sent to their country by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> to reconnoitre, and had decided to make nothing but false reports, in order, no doubt, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, with no prior knowledge of conditions, might make the ascent of Mt. Aurasium without supplies for a longer time or without preparing themselves otherwise in the way which would be best. And, all things considered, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were suspicious that an ambush had been set for them by men who were their allies and began to be afraid, reasoning that the Moors are said to be by nature untrustworthy at all times and especially whenever they march as allies with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> or any others against Moors. So, remembering these things, and at the same time being pinched by hunger, they withdrew from there with all speed without accomplishing anything, and, upon reaching the plain, constructed a stockade. <br />After this <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> established a part of the army in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a> to serve as a guard and with the remainder went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, since it was already winter. There he arranged and set everything in order, so that at the beginning of spring he might again march against Aurasium with a larger equipment and, if possible, without Moors as allies. At the same time he prepared generals and another army and a fleet of ships for an expedition against the Moors who dwell in the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>; for this island is a large one and flourishing besides, being about two thirds as large as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> (for the perimeter of the island makes a journey of twenty days for an unencumbered traveller); and lying, as it does, between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, it was oppressed by the Moors who dwelt there. For the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> in ancient times, being enraged against these barbarians, sent some few of them with their wives to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a> and confined them there. But as time went on they seized the mountains which are near Caranalis, at first making plundering expeditions secretly upon those who dwelt round about, but when they became no less than three thousand, they even made their raids openly, and with no desire for concealment plundered all the country there, being called Barbaricini by the natives. It was against these barbarians, therefore, that <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> was preparing the fleet during that winter. Such, then, was the course of events in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>.</p>                        </div>

And it came about during this year that a most dread portent took place.

And from the time when this thing happened men were free neither from war nor pestilence nor any other thing leading to death.

And each one of these women kept urging her husband to lay claim to the possession of the lands which she had owned previously, saying that it was not right or fitting if, while living with the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, they had enjoyed these lands, but after entering into marriage with the conquerors of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> they were then to be deprived of their possessions. And having these things in mind, the soldiers did not think that they were bound to yield the lands of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> to <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, who wished to register them as belonging to the commonwealth and to the emperor's house and said that while it was not unreasonable that the slaves and all other things of value should go as booty to the soldiers, the land itself belonged to the emperor and the empire of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, which had nourished them and caused them to be called soldiers and to be such, not in order to win for themselves such land as they should wrest from the barbarians who were trespassing on the Roman empire, but that this land might come to the commonwealth, from which both they and all others secured their maintenance. This was one cause of the mutiny. And there was a second, concurrent, cause also, which was no less, perhaps even more, effective in throwing all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> into confusion. It was as follows: In the Roman army there were, as it happened, not less than one thousand soldiers of the Arian faith; and the most of these were barbarians, some of these being of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Erulian</a> nation. Now these men were urged on to the mutiny by the priests of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> with the greatest zeal. For it was not possible for them to worship God in their accustomed way, but they were excluded both from all sacraments and from all sacred rites. For the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> did not allow any <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> who did not espouse the orthodox faith to receive baptism or any other sacrament. But most of all they were agitated by the feast of Easter, during which they found themselves unable to baptize their own children with the sacred water, or do anything else pertaining to this feast.

Now the majority of these <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandal</a> soldiers reached the East, and, filling up the squadrons to which they had been assigned, they have been fighting against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> up to the present time; but the remainder, about four hundred in number, after reaching <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=place long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbos</a>, waiting until the sails were bellied with the wind, forced the sailors to submission and sailed on till they reached the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a>.

And those who had decided to kill the man went in, and, urging one another with nods, they put their hands to their swords, but they did nothing nevertheless, either because they were filled with awe of the rites then being performed in the sanctuary, or because the fame of the general caused them to be ashamed, or perhaps also some divine power prevented them. <br />And when the rites on that day had been completely performed and all were betaking themselves homeward, the conspirators began to blame one another with having turned soft-hearted at no fitting time, and they postponed the plot for a second attempt on the following day. And on the next day they acted in the same manner and departed from the sanctuary without doing anything, and entering the market place, they reviled each other openly, and every single man of them called the next one soft-hearted and a demoralizer of the band, not hesitating to censure strongly the respect felt for <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>.

For we have now come to a combat in which even the winning of the victory will not be without tears for us, since we are fighting against kinsmen and men who have been reared with us. But we have this comfort in our misfortune, that we are not ourselves beginning the battle, but have been brought into the conflict in our own defence. For he who has framed the plot against his dearest friends and by his own act has dissolved the ties of kinship, dies not, if he perishes, by the hands of his friends, but having become an enemy is but making atonement to those who have suffered wrong. And that our opponents are public enemies and barbarians and whatever worse name one might call them, is shewn not alone by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, which has become plunder under their hands, nor by the inhabitants of this land, who have been wrongfully slain, but also by the multitude of Roman soldiers whom these enemies have dared to kill, though they have had but one fault to charge them with — loyalty to their government. And it is to avenge these their victims that we have now come against them, having with good reason become enemies to those who were once most dear. For nature has made no men in the world either friends or opponents to one another, but it is the actions of men in every case which, either by the similarity of the motives which actuate them unite them in alliance, or by the difference set them in hostility to each other, making them friends or enemies as the case may be. That, therefore, we are fighting against men who are outlaws and enemies of the state, you must now be convinced; and now I shall make it plain that they deserve to be despised by us. For a throng of men united by no law, but brought together by motives of injustice, is utterly unable by nature to play the part of brave men, since valour is unable to dwell with lawlessness, but always shuns those who are unholy. Nor, indeed, will they preserve discipline or give heed to the commands given by Stotzas. For when a tyranny is newly organized and has not yet won that authority which self-confidence gives, it is, of necessity, looked upon by its subjects with contempt. Nor is it honoured through any sentiment of loyalty, for a tyranny is, in the nature of the case, hated; nor does it lead its subjects by fear, for timidity deprives it of the power to speak out openly. And when the enemy is handicapped in point of valour and of discipline, their defeat is ready at hand. With great contempt, therefore, as I said, we should go against this enemy of ours. For it is not by the numbers of the combatants, but by their orderly array and their bravery, that prowess in war is wont to be measured. </p>                        </div>

For it is not so terrible a thing to grow old and die in the midst of ills, as to return again to it after having gained freedom from oppressive conditions. For the interval which has given one a taste of deliverance makes the misfortune, naturally enough, harder to bear. And this being so, it is necessary for you to call to mind that after conquering the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and the Moors you yourselves have enjoyed the labours of war, while others have become masters of all the spoils. And consider that, as soldiers, you will be compelled all your lives to be acquainted with the dangers of war, either in behalf of the emperor's cause, if, indeed, you are again his slaves, or in behalf of your own selves, if you preserve this present liberty. And whichever of the two is preferable, this it is in your power to choose, either by becoming faint-hearted at this time, or by preferring to play the part of brave men. Furthermore, this thought also should come to your minds, — that if, having taken up arms against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, you come under their power, you will have experience of no moderate or indulgent masters, but you will suffer the extreme of punishment, and, what is more, your death will not have been unmerited. To whomsoever of you, therefore, death comes in this battle, it is plain that it will be a glorious death; and life, if you conquer the enemy, will be independent and in all other respects happy; but if you are defeated, — I need mention no other bitterness than this, that all your hope will depend upon the mercy of those men yonder. And the conflict will not be evenly matched in regard to strength. For not only are the enemy greatly surpassed by us in numbers, but they will come against us without the least enthusiasm, for I think that they are praying for a share of this our freedom. Such was the speech of Stotzas. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, upon seeing that they had left their position and in complete disorder were moving to his flank, gave orders immediately to open the attack. And the troops of Stotzas were thrown into confusion by the unexpected move, and in great disorder, as each one could, they fled precipitately, and only when they reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a> did they collect themselves again. Few of them, however, perished in this action, and most of them were <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. For <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> did not pursue them at all, for the reason that it seemed to him sufficient, since his army was very small, if the enemy, having been defeated for the present, should get out of his way. And he gave the soldiers the enemy's stockade to plunder, and they took it with not a man inside. But much money was found there and many women, the very women because of whom this war took place. After accomplishing this, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> marched back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. And someone coming from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> reported to him that a mutiny had broken out in the army and was about to throw everything into confusion, unless he himself should return to them with all speed and take measures to prevent it. He there therefore arranged matters in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> as well as he could and, entrusting <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> to Ildiger and <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a>, went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. </p>                        </div>

Now the commanders were as follows: of foederati, <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> and <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a>, of the cavalry forces, Barbatus, and of infantry <a href=/people/217 target=_blank>Terentius</a> and <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Sarapis</a>. All, however, took their commands from <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>, as holding the authority in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a>.

And when the two armies were near together and the battle was about to commence, Stotzas came alone into the midst of his opponents and spoke as follows: <br />Fellow-soldiers, you are not acting justly in taking the field against kinsmen and those who have been reared with you, and in raising arms against men who in vexation at your misfortunes and the wrongs you have suffered have decided to make war upon the emperor and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. Or do you not remember that you have been deprived of the pay which has been owing you for a long time back, and that you have been robbed of the enemy's spoil, which the law of war has set as prizes for the dangers of battle? And that the others have claimed the right to live sumptuously all their lives upon the good things of victory, while you have followed as if their servants? If, now, you are angry with me, it is within your power to vent your wrath upon this body, and to escape the pollution of killing the others; but if you have no charge to bring against me, it is time for you to take up your weapons in your own behalf. So spoke Stotzas; and the soldiers listened to his words and greeted him with great favour. And when the commanders saw what was happening, they withdrew in silence and took refuge in a sanctuary which was in Gazophyla. And Stotzas combined both armies into one and then went to the commanders. And finding them in the sanctuary, he gave pledges and then killed them all.</p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/1720 target=_blank>Symmachus</a> also and Domnicus, men of the senate, followed him, the former to be prefect and charged with the maintenance of the army, while Domnicus was to command the infantry forces. For John, who had held the office of prefect, had already died of disease. And when they had sailed into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, Germanus counted the soldiers whom they had, and upon looking over the books of the scribes where the names of all the soldiers were registered, he found that the third part of the army was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> and the other cities, while all the rest were arrayed with the tyrant against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. He did not, therefore, begin any fighting, but bestowed the greatest care upon his army. And considering that those left in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> were the kinsmen or tentmates of the enemy, he kept addressing many winning words to all, and in particular said that he had himself been sent by the emperor to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> in order to defend the soldiers who had been wronged and to punish those who had unprovoked done them any injury. And when this was found out by the mutineers, they began to come over to him a few at a time. And Germanus both received them into the city in a friendly manner and, giving pledges, held them in honour, and he gave them their pay for the time during which they had been in arms against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. And when the report of these acts was circulated and came to all, they began now to detach themselves in large numbers from the tyrant and to march to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. Then at last Germanus, hoping that in the battle he would be evenly matched in strength with his opponents, began to make preparations for the conflict. <br />But in the meantime Stotzas, already perceiving the trouble, and fearing lest by the defection of still others of his soldiers the army should be reduced still more, was pressing for a decisive encounter immediately and trying to take hold of the war with more vigour. And since he had some hope regarding the soldiers in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, that they would come over to him, and thought that they would readily desert if he came near them, he held out the hope to all his men; and after encouraging them exceedingly in this way, he advanced swiftly with his whole army against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. And when he had come within thirty-five stades of the city, he made camp not far from the sea, and Germanus, after arming his whole army and arraying them for battle, marched forth. And when they were all outside the city, since he had heard what Stotzas was hoping for, he called together the whole army and spoke as follows: <br />That there is nothing, fellow-soldiers, with which you can justly reproach the emperor, and no fault which you can find with what he has done to you, this, I think, no one of you all could deny; for it was he who took you as you came from the fields with your wallets and one small frock apiece and brought you together in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, and has caused you to be so powerful that the Roman state now depends upon you. And that he has not only been treated with wanton insult, but has also suffered the most dreadful of all things at your hands, you yourselves, doubtless, know full well. And desiring that you should preserve the memory of these things for ever, he has dismissed the accusations brought against you for your crimes, asking that this debt alone be due to him from you — shame for what you have done. It is reasonable, therefore, that you, being thus regarded by him, should learn anew the lesson of good faith and correct your former folly. For when repentance comes at the fitting time upon those who have done wrong, it is accustomed to make those who have been injured indulgent; and service which comes in season is wont to bring another name to those who have been called ungrateful. <br />And it will be needful for you to know well this also, that if at the present time you shew yourselves completely loyal to the emperor, no remembrance will remain of what has gone before. For in the nature of things every course of action is characterized by men in accordance with its final outcome; and while a wrong which has once been committed can never be undone in all time, still, when it has been corrected by better deeds on the part of those who committed it, it receives the fitting reward of silence and generally comes to be forgotten. Moreover, if you act with any disregard of duty toward these accursed rascals at the present time, even though afterwards you fight through many wars in behalf of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and often win the victory over the enemy, you will never again be regarded as having requited the emperor as you can requite him to-day. For those who win applause in the very matter of their former wrong-doing always gain for themselves a fairer apology. As regards the emperor, then, let each one of you reason in some such way. But as for me, I have not voluntarily done you any injustice, and I have displayed my good-will to you by all possible means, and now, facing this danger, I have decided to ask this much of you all: let no man advance with us against the enemy contrary to his judgement. But if anyone of you is already desirous of arraying himself with them, without delay let him go with his weapons to the enemy's camp, granting us this one favour, that it be not stealthily, but openly, that he has decided to do us wrong. Indeed, it is for this reason that I am making my speech, not in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, but after coming on the battle-field, in order that I might not be an obstacle to anyone who desires to desert to our opponents, since it is possible for all without danger to shew their disposition toward the state. Thus spoke Germanus. And a great uproar ensued in the Roman army, for each one demanded the right to be the first to display to the general his loyalty to the emperor and to swear the most dread oaths in confirmation.</p>                        </div>

But when the mutineers saw that nothing of what Stotzas had foretold was coming to pass, they began to be afraid as having been unexpectedly cheated of their hope, and they broke their ranks and withdrew, and marched off to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a>, where were their women and the money from their booty. And Germanus too came there with the whole army not long afterwards, having made all preparations in the best way possible and also bringing along many wagons for the army. And overtaking his opponents in a place which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call Scalae <a href=/people/10482 target=_blank>Veteres</a>, he made his preparations for battle in the following manner. Placing the wagons in line facing the front, he arrayed all the infantry along them under the leadership of Domnicus, so that by reason of having their rear in security they might fight with the greater courage. And the best of the horsemen and those who had come with him from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> he himself had on the left of the infantry, while all the others he placed on the right wing, not marshalled in one body but in three divisions. And Ildiger led one of them, <a href=/people/6987 target=_blank>Theodoras</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=person long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocian</a> another, while the remaining one, which was larger, was commanded by John, the brother of Pappus, with three others. Thus did the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> array themselves. <br />And the mutineers took their stand opposite them, not in order, however, but scattered, more in the manner of barbarians. And at no great distance many thousands of Moors followed them, who were commanded by a number of leaders, and especially by Iaudas and Ortaïas. But not all of them, as it happened, were faithful to Stotzas and his men, for many had sent previously to Germanus and agreed that, when they came into the fight, they would array themselves with the emperor's army against the enemy. However, Germanus could not trust them altogether, for the Moorish nation is by nature faithless to all men. It was for this reason also that they did not array themselves with the mutineers, but remained behind, waiting for what would come to pass, in order that with those who should be victorious they might join in the pursuit of the vanquished. Such was the purpose, then, of the Moors, in following behind and not mingling with the mutineers. <br />And when Stotzas came close to the enemy and saw the standard of Germanus, he exhorted his men and began to charge against him. But the mutinous <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> who were arrayed about him did not follow and even tried with all their might to prevent him, saying that they did not know the character of the forces of Germanus, but that they did know that those arrayed on the enemy's right would by no means withstand them. If, therefore, they should advance against these, they would not only give way themselves and turn to flight, but would also, in all probability, throw the rest of the Roman army into confusion; but if they should attack Germanus and be driven back and put to rout, their whole cause would be ruined on the spot. And Stotzas was persuaded by these words, and permitted the others to fight with the men of Germanus, while he himself with the best men went against John and those arrayed with him. And they failed to withstand the attack and hastened to flee in complete disorder. And the mutineers took all their standards immediately, and pursued them as they fled at top speed, while some too charged upon the infantry, who had already begun to abandon their ranks. But at this juncture Germanus himself, drawing his sword and urging the whole of that part of the army to do the same, with great difficulty routed the mutineers opposed to him and advanced on the run against Stotzas. And then, since he was joined in this effort by the men of Ildiger and <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a>, the two armies mingled with each other in such a way that, while the mutineers were pursuing some of their enemy, they were being overtaken and killed by others. And as the confusion became greater and greater, the troops of Germanus, who were in the rear, pressed on still more, and the mutineers, falling into great fear, thought no longer of resistance. But neither side could be distinguished either by their own comrades or by their opponents. For all used one language and the same equipment of arms, and they differed neither in figure nor in dress nor in any other thing whatever. For this reason the soldiers of the emperor by the advice of Germanus, whenever they captured anyone, asked who he was; and then, if he said that he was a soldier of Germanus, they bade him give the watchword of Germanus, and if he was not at all able to give this, they killed him instantly. In this struggle one of the enemy got by unnoticed and killed the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> of Germanus, and Germanus himself fell to the ground and came into danger, and would have been lost had not his guards quickly saved him by forming an enclosure around him and mounting him on another <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. <br />As for Stotzas, he succeeded in this tumult in escaping with a few men. But Germanus, urging on his men, went straight for the enemy's camp. There he was encountered by those of the mutineers who had been stationed to guard the stockade. A stubborn fight took place around its entrance, and the mutineers came within a little of forcing back their opponents, but Germanus sent some of his followers and bade them make trial of the camp at another point. These men, since no one was defending the camp at this place, got inside the stockade with little trouble. And the mutineers, upon seeing them, rushed off in flight, and Germanus with all the rest of the army dashed into the enemy's camp. There the soldiers, finding it easy to plunder the goods of the camp, neither took any account of the enemy nor paid any further heed to the exhortations of their general, since booty was at hand. For this reason Germanus, fearing lest the enemy should get together and come upon them, himself with some few men took his stand at the entrance of the stockade, uttering many laments and urging his unheeding men to return to good order. And many of the Moors, when the rout had taken place in this way, were now pursuing the mutineers, and, arraying themselves with the emperor's troops, were plundering the camp of the vanquished. But Stotzas, at first having confidence in the Moorish army, rode to them in order to renew the battle. But perceiving what was being done, he fled with a hundred men, and succeeded with difficulty in making his escape. And once more many gathered about him and attempted to engage with the enemy, but being repulsed no less decisively than before, if not even more so, they all came over to Germanus. And Stotzas alone with some few <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> withdrew to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=place long=-5 lat=35>Mauretania</a>, and taking to wife the daughter of one of the rulers, remained there. And this was the conclusion of that mutiny.</p>                        </div>

This <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> had first got a very large number of the soldiers to join with him in a conspiracy against the government, and was now purposing to attempt a tyranny. And being eager to associate with himself still more men, he explained the project to others and especially to <a href=/people/625 target=_blank>Asclepiades</a>, a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/320350RPal class=place long=35.0001 lat=32.0206>Palestine</a>, who was a man of good birth and the first of the personal friends of <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a>. Now <a href=/people/625 target=_blank>Asclepiades</a>, after conversing with <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a>, straightway reported the whole matter to Germanus. And he, not wishing as yet, while affairs were still unsettled, to begin any other disturbance, decided to get the best of the man by cajoling and flattering him rather than by punishment, and to bind him by oaths to loyalty toward the government. Accordingly, since it was an old custom among all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> that no one should become a body-guard of one of the commanders, unless he had previously taken the most dread oaths and given pledges of his loyalty both toward his own commander and toward the Roman emperor, he summoned <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>, and praising him for his daring, directed him to be one of his body-guards from that time forth. And he, being overjoyed at the extraordinary honour, and conjecturing that his project would in this way get on more easily, took the oath, and though from that time forth he was counted among the body-guards of Germanus, he did not hesitate to disregard his oaths immediately and to strengthen much more than ever his plans to achieve the tyranny. <br />Now the whole city was celebrating some general festival, and many of the conspirators of <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> at about the time of lunch came according to their agreement to the palace, where Germanus was entertaining his friends at a feast, and <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> took his stand beside the couches with the other body-guards. And as the drinking proceeded, someone entered and announced to Germanus that many soldiers were standing in great disorder before the door of the court, putting forward the charge that the government owed them their pay for a long period. And he commanded the most trusty of the guards secretly to keep close watch over <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>, allowing him in no way to perceive what was being done. Then the conspirators with threats and tumult proceeded on the run to the hippodrome, and those who shared their plan with them gathered gradually from the houses and were assembling there. And if it had so chanced that all of them had come together, no one, I think, would have been able easily to destroy their power; but, as it was, Germanus anticipated this, and, before the greater part had yet arrived, he straightway sent against them all who were well-disposed to himself and to the emperor. And they attacked the conspirators before they expected them. And then, since <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>, for whom they were waiting to begin the battle for them, was not with them, and they did not see the crowd gathered to help them, as they had thought it would be, but instead even beheld their fellow-soldiers unexpectedly fighting against them, they consequently lost heart and were easily overcome in the struggle and rushed off in flight and in complete disorder. And their opponents slew many of them, and they also captured many alive and brought them to Germanus. Those, however, who had not already come to the hippodrome gave no indication of their sentiment toward <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>. And Germanus did not see fit to go on and seek them out, but he enquired whether <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>, since he had sworn the oath, had taken part in the plot. And since it was proved that, though numbered among his own body-guards he had carried on his designs still more than before, Germanus impaled him close by the fortifications of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, and in this way succeeded completely in putting down the sedition. As for <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>, then, such was the end of his plot.</p>                        </div>

For <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> and <a href=/people/5309 target=_blank>Valerianus</a> had already before this gone under summons to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. And <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> sailed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, and having rid himself of the sedition of Stotzas, he ruled with moderation and guarded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> securely, setting the army in order, and sending to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> whatever suspicious elements he found in it, and enrolling new soldiers to equal their number, and removing those of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> who were left and especially all their women from the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. And he surrounded each city with a wall, and guarding the laws with great strictness, he restored the government completely. And <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> became under his rule powerful as to its revenues and prosperous in other respects. <br />And when everything had been arranged by him in the best way possible, he again made an expedition against Iaudas and the Moors on Aurasium. And first he sent forward <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, one of his own body-guards and an able warrior, with an army. Now <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> came to the Abigas River and made camp near Bagaïs, a deserted city. And there he engaged with the enemy, but was defeated in battle, and retiring to his stockade was already being hard pressed by the siege of the Moors. But afterwards <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> himself arrived with his whole army, and when he was sixty stades away from the camp which <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> was commanding, he made a stockade and remained there; and hearing all that had befallen the force of <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, he sent them a part of his army and bade them keep up the fight against the enemy with courage. But the Moors, having gained the upper hand in the engagement, as I have said, did as follows. The Abigas River flows from Aurasium, and descending into a plain, waters the land just as the men there desire. For the natives conduct this stream to whatever place they think it will best serve them at the moment, for in this plain there are many channels, into which the Abigas is divided, and entering all of them, it passes underground, and reappears again above the ground and gathers its stream together. This takes place over the greatest part of the plain and makes it possible for the inhabitants of the region, by stopping up the waterways with earth, or by again opening them, to make use of the waters of this river as they wish. So at that time the Moors shut off all the channels there and thus allowed the whole stream to flow about the camp of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. As a result of this, a deep, muddy marsh formed there through which it was impossible to go; this terrified them exceedingly and reduced them to a state of helplessness. When this was heard by <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, he came quickly. But the barbarians, becoming afraid, withdrew to the foot of Aurasium. And in a place which they call Babosis they made camp and remained there. So <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> moved with his whole army and came to that place. And upon engaging with the enemy, he defeated them decisively and turned them to flight. Now after this the Moors did not think it advisable for them to fight a pitched battle with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>; for they did not hope to overcome them in this kind of contest; but they did have hope, based on the difficult character of the country around Aurasium, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> would in a short time give up by reason of the sufferings they would have to endure and would withdraw from there, just as they formerly had done. The most of them, therefore, went off to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=place long=-5 lat=35>Mauretania</a> and the barbarians to the south of Aurasium, but Iaudas with twenty thousand of the Moors remained there. And it happened that he had built a fortress on Aurasium, Zerboule by name. Into this he entered with all the Moors and remained quiet. But <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> was by no means willing that time should be wasted in the siege, and learning that the plains about the city of Tamougade were full of grain just becoming ripe, he led his army into them, and settling himself there, began to plunder the land. Then, after firing everything, he returned again to the fortress of Zerboule. <br />But during this time, while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were plundering the land, Iaudas, leaving behind some of the Moors, about as many as he thought would be sufficient for the defence of the fortress, himself ascended to the summit of Aurasium with the rest of the army, not wishing to stand siege in the fort and have provisions fail his forces. And finding a high place with cliff's on all sides of it and concealed by perpendicular rocks, Toumar by name, he remained quietly there. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> besieged the fortress of Zerboule for three days. And using their bows, since the wall was not high, they hit many of the barbarians upon the parapets. And by some chance it happened that all the leaders of the Moors were hit by these missiles and died. And when the three days' time had passed and night came on, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, having learned nothing of the death of the leaders among the Moors, were planning to break up the siege. For it seemed better to <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> to go against Iaudas and the multitude of the Moors, thinking that, if he should be able to capture that force by siege, the barbarians in Zerboule would with less trouble and difficulty yield to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. But the barbarians, thinking that they could no longer hold out against the siege, since all their leaders had now been destroyed, decided to flee with all speed and abandon the fortress. Accordingly they fled immediately in silence and without allowing the enemy in any way to perceive it, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> also at daybreak began to prepare for departure. And since no one appeared on the wall, although the besieging army was withdrawing, they began to wonder and fell into the greatest perplexity among themselves. And in this state of uncertainty they went around the fortress and found the gate open from which the Moors had departed in flight. And entering the fortress they treated everything as plunder, but they had no thought of pursuing the enemy, for they had set out with light equipment and were familiar with the country round about. And when they had plundered everything, they set guards over the fortress, and all moved forward on foot.</p>                        </div>

And after much time had been spent and the barbarians did not come out against them at all, they themselves, no less than the enemy, if not even more, were hard pressed by the siege and began to be impatient. And more than anything else, they were distressed by the lack of water; this <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> himself guarded, giving each day no more than a single cupful to each man. And since he saw that they were openly discontented and no longer able to bear their present hardships, he planned to make trial of the place, although it was difficult of access, and called all together and exhorted them as follows: Since God has granted to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> to besiege the Moors on Aurasium, a thing which hitherto has been beyond hope and now, to such as do not see what is actually being done, is altogether incredible, it is necessary that we too should lend our aid to the help that has come from above, and not prove false to this favour, but undergoing the danger with enthusiasm, should reach after the good fortune which is to come from success. For in every case the turning of the scales of human affairs depends upon the moment of opportunity; but if a man, by wilful cowardice, is traitor to his fortune, he cannot justly blame it, having by his own action brought the guilt upon himself. Now as for the Moors, you see their weakness surely and the place in which they have shut themselves up and are keeping guard, deprived of all the necessities of life. And as for you, one of two things is necessary, either without feeling any vexation at the siege to await the surrender of the enemy, or, if you shrink from this, to accept the victory which goes with the danger. And fighting against these barbarians will be the more free from danger for us, inasmuch as they are already fighting with hunger and I think they will never even come to an engagement with us. Having these things in mind at the present time, it behooves you to execute all your orders with eagerness. <br />After <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> had made this exhortation, he looked about to see from what point it would be best for his men to make an attempt on the place, and for a long time he seemed to be in perplexity. For the difficult nature of the ground seemed to him quite too much to contend with. But while <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> was considering this, chance provided a way for the enterprise as follows. There was a certain Gezon in the army, a foot-soldier, optio of the detachment to which <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> belonged; for thus the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call the paymaster. This Gezon, either in play or in anger, or perhaps even moved by some divine impulse, began to make the ascent alone, apparently going against the enemy, and not far from him went some of his fellow-soldiers, marvelling greatly at what he was doing. And three of the Moors, who had been stationed to guard the approach, suspecting that the man was coming against them, went on the run to confront him. But since they were in a narrow way, they did not proceed in orderly array, but each one went separately. And Gezon struck the first one who came upon him and killed him, and in this way he despatched each of the others. And when those in the rear perceived this, they advanced with much shouting and tumult against the enemy. And when the whole Roman army both heard and saw what was being done, without waiting either for the general to lead the way for them or for the trumpets to give the signal for battle, as was customary, nor indeed even keeping their order, but making a great uproar and urging one another on, they ran against the enemy's camp. There <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a> and <a href=/people/972 target=_blank>Leontius</a>, the sons of Zaunas the son of Pharesmanes, made a splendid display of valorous deeds against the enemy. And by this the Moors were terror-stricken, and when they learned that their guards also had been destroyed, they straightway turned to flight where each one could, and the most of them were overtaken in the difficult ground and killed. And Iaudas himself, though struck by a javelin in the thigh, still made his escape and withdrew to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=place long=-5 lat=35>Mauretania</a>. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, after plundering the enemy's camp, decided not to abandon Aurasium again, but to guard fortresses which <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> was to build there, so that this mountain might not be again accessible to the Moors. <br />Now there is on Aurasium a perpendicular rock which rises in the midst of precipices; the natives call it the Rock of Geminianus; there the men of ancient times had built a tower, making it very small as a place of refuge, strong and unassailable, since the nature of the position assisted them. Here, as it happened, Iaudas had a few days previously deposited his money and his women, setting one old Moor in charge as guardian of the money. For he could never have suspected that the enemy would either reach this place, or that they could in all time capture the tower by force. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> at that time, searching through the rough country of Aurasium, came there, and one of them, with a laugh, attempted to climb up to the tower; but the women began to taunt him, ridiculing him as attempting the impossible; and the old man, peering out from the tower, did the same thing. But when the Roman soldier, climbing with both hands and feet, had come near them, he drew his sword quietly and leaped forward as quickly as he could, and struck the old man a fair blow on the neck, and succeeded in cutting it through. And the head fell down to the ground, and the soldiers, now emboldened and holding to one another, ascended to the tower, and took out from there both the women and the money, of which there was an exceedingly great quantity. And by means of it <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> surrounded many of the cities in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> with walls. <br />And after the Moors had retired from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a>, defeated in the manner described, the land of Zabe, which is beyond Mt. Aurasium and is called First <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=place long=-5 lat=35>Mauretania</a>, whose metropolis is Sitiphis, was added to the Roman empire by <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> as a tributary province; for of the other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=place long=-5 lat=35>Mauretania</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/366022UIol class=place long=2.1904 lat=36.6054>Caesarea</a> is the first city, where was settled Mastigas with his Moors, having the whole country there subject and tributary to him, except, indeed, the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/366022UIol class=place long=2.1904 lat=36.6054>Caesarea</a>. For this city <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had previously recovered for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, as has been set forth in the previous narrative; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> always journey to this city in ships, but they are not able to go by land, since Moors dwell in that country.

And the Moors who are called Leuathae came to <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> with a great army at the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/326143ULep class=place long=14.2905 lat=32.6383>Leptimagna</a>, spreading the report that the reason they had come was this, that <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> might give them the gifts and insignia of office which were customary and so make the peace secure. But <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a>, persuaded by Pudentius, a man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329132UOea class=place long=13.1758 lat=32.8999>Tripolis</a>, of whom I made mention in the preceding narrative as having served the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> against the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> at the beginning of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandalic</a> War, received eighty of the barbarians, their most notable men, into the city, promising to fulfil all their demands; but he commanded the rest to remain in the suburb. Then after giving these eighty men pledges concerning the peace, he invited them to a banquet. But they say that these barbarians had come into the city with treacherous intent, that they might lay a trap for <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> and kill him. And when they came into conference with him, they called up many charges against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and in particular said that their crops had been plundered wrongfully. And <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a>, paying no heed to these things, rose from the seat on which he was sitting, with intent to go away. And one of the barbarians, laying hold upon his shoulder, attempted to prevent him from going. Then the others began to shout in confusion, and were already rushing together about him. But one of the body-guards of <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a>, drawing his sword, despatched that Moor. And as a result of this a great tumult, as was natural, arose in the room, and the guards of <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> killed all the barbarians. But one of them, upon seeing the others being slain, rushed out of the house where these things were taking place, unnoticed by anyone, and coming to his tribemates, revealed what had befallen their fellows. And when they heard this, they betook themselves on the run to their own camp and together with all the others arrayed themselves in arms against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. Now when they came near the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/326143ULep class=place long=14.2905 lat=32.6383>Leptimagna</a>, <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> and Pudentius confronted them with their whole army. And the battle becoming a hand-to-hand fight, at first the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were victorious and slew many of the enemy, and, plundering their camp, secured their goods and enslaved an exceedingly great number of women and children. But afterwards Pudentius, being possessed by a spirit of reckless daring, was killed; and <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> with the Roman army, since it was already growing dark, marched into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/326143ULep class=place long=14.2905 lat=32.6383>Leptimagna</a>. <br />At a later time the barbarians took the field against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> with a greater array. And <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> went to join his uncle <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, in order that he too might go to meet the enemy with a larger army; and he found there his brother <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> also. And the barbarians, coming into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>, made raids and plundered a great part of the country there; and Antalas (whom I mentioned in the preceding narrative as having remained faithful to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and as being for this reason sole ruler of the Moors in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>) had by now, as it happened, become hostile to <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, because <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> had deprived him of the maintenance with which the emperor had honoured him and had killed his brother, charging him with responsibility for an uprising against the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>. So at that time Antalas was pleased to see these barbarians, and making an offensive and defensive alliance with them, led them against <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. <br />And <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, as soon as he heard about this, put his whole army in motion and marched against them, and coming upon them at the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/354081UThe class=place long=8.1238 lat=35.4011>Tebesta</a>, distant six days' journey from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, he established his camp in company with the sons of his brother <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a>, <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> and <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> and <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> the younger. And fearing the multitude of the barbarians, he sent to the leaders of the Leuathae, reproaching them because, while at peace with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, they had taken up arms and come against them, and demanding that they should confirm the peace existing between the two peoples, and he promised to swear the most dread oaths, that he would hold no remembrance of what they had done. But the barbarians, mocking his words, said that he would of course swear by the sacred writings of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, which they are accustomed to call Gospels. Now since <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> had once taken these oaths and then had slain those who trusted in them, it was their desire to go into battle and make a test of these same sacred writings, to see what sort of power they had against the perjurers, in order that they might first have absolute confidence in them before they finally entered into the agreement. When <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> heard this, he made his preparations for the combat. <br />And on the following day he engaged with a portion of the enemy as they were bringing in a very large booty, conquered them in battle, seized all their booty and kept it under guard. And when the soldiers were dissatisfied and counted it an outrage that he did not give them the plunder, he said that he was awaiting the outcome of the war, in order that they might distribute everything then, according to the share that should seem to suit the merit of each. But when the barbarians advanced a second time, with their whole army, to give battle, this time some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> stayed behind and the others entered the encounter with no enthusiasm. At first, then, the battle was evenly contested, but later, since the Moors were vastly superior by reason of their great numbers, the most of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> fled, and though <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> and a few men about him held out for a time against the missiles of the barbarians, afterwards they were overpowered by the enemy, and fleeing in haste, reached a ravine made by a brook which flowed in that region. And there <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>'s <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> stumbled and threw him to the ground, and his body-guards lifted him quickly in their arms and set him upon his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. But overcome by great pain and unable to hold the reins longer, he was overtaken and killed by the barbarians, and many of his guards besides. Such was the end of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>'s life.</p>                        </div>

And this man became the chief cause of great ruin to the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, and all were dissatisfied with his rule — the officers because, being exceedingly stupid and young both in character and in years, he proved to be the greatest braggart of all men, and he insulted them for no just cause and disregarded them, always using the power of his wealth and the authority of his office to this end; and the soldiers disliked him because he was altogether unmanly and weak; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a>, not only for these reasons, but also because he had shown himself strangely fond of the wives and the possessions of others. But most of all John, the son of Sisiniolus, was hostile to the power of <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a>; for, though he was an able warrior and was a man of unusually fair repute, he found <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> absolutely ungrateful. For this reason neither he nor anyone else at all was willing to take up arms against the enemy. But almost all the Moors were following Antalas, and Stotzas came at his summons from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=place long=-5 lat=35>Mauretania</a>. And since not one of the enemy came out against them, they began to sack the country, making plunder of everything without fear. At that time Antalas sent to the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> a letter, which set forth the following: <br />That I am a slave of thy empire not even I myself would deny, but the Moors, having suffered unholy treatment at the hands of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> in time of peace, have taken up arms under the most severe constraint, not lifting them against thee, but warding off our personal enemy; and this is especially true of me. For he not only decided to deprive me of the maintenance, which <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> long before specified and thou didst grant, but he also killed my own brother, although he had no wrongdoing to charge against him. We have therefore taken vengeance upon him who wronged us. And if it is thy will that the Moors be in subjection to thy empire and serve it in all things as they are accustomed to do, command <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a>, the nephew of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, to depart from here and return to thee, and send another general to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. For thou wilt not be lacking in men of discretion and more worthy than <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> in every way; for as long as this man commands thy army, it is impossible for peace to be established between the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and the Moors. <br />Such was the letter written by Antalas. But the emperor, even after reading these things and learning the common enmity of all toward <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a>, was still unwilling to remove him from his office, out of respect for the virtues of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> and especially the manner of his death. Such, then, was the course of these events. <br />But <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, the brother of <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a>, who was supposed to have disappeared from the world together with his uncle <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, was forgotten by his brother and by the rest as well; for no one had learned that he was alive. But the Moors, as it happened, had taken him alive, since he was very young; and they enquired of him who he was. And he said that he was a <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandal</a> by birth, and a slave of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>. He said, moreover, that he had a friend, a physician, Pegasius by name, in the city of Laribus near by, who would purchase him by giving ransom. So the Moors came up close to the fortifications of the city and called Pegasius and displayed <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> to him, and asked whether it was his pleasure to purchase the man. And since he agreed to purchase him, they sold <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> to him for fifty pieces of gold. But upon getting inside the fortifications, <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> taunted the Moors as having been deceived by him, a mere lad; for he said that he was no other than <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, the son of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a> and nephew of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>. And the Moors, being deeply stung by what had happened, and counting it a terrible thing that, while having a strong security for the conduct of <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, they had relinquished it so carelessly, came to Laribus and laid siege to the place, in order to capture <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> with the city. And the besieged, in terror at being shut in by the barbarians, for they had not even carried in provisions, as it happened, opened negotiations with the Moors, proposing that upon receiving a great sum of money they should straightway abandon the siege. Whereupon the barbarians, thinking that they could never take the city by force — for the Moors are not at all practised in the storming of walls — and at the same time not knowing that provisions were scarce for the besieged, welcomed their words, and when they had received three thousand pieces of gold, they abandoned the siege, and all the Leuathae retired homeward.</p>                        </div>

And John, the son of Sisiniolus, being earnestly entreated by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a>, gathered an army and marched against them. Now <a href=/people/7767 target=_blank>Himerius</a>, the Thracian, was commander of the troops in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>, and at that time he was ordered by John to bring with him all the troops there, together with the commanders of each detachment, and come to a place called Menephesse, which is in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>, and join his force there. But later, upon hearing that the enemy were encamped there, John wrote to <a href=/people/7767 target=_blank>Himerius</a> telling what had happened and directing him to unite with his forces at another place, that they might not go separately, but all together, to encounter the enemy. But by some chance those who had this letter, making use of another road, were quite unable to find <a href=/people/7767 target=_blank>Himerius</a>, and he together with his army, coming upon the camp of the enemy, fell into their hands. Now there was in this Roman army a certain youth, <a href=/people/3960 target=_blank>Severianus</a>, son of Asiaticus, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> and a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347367UEme class=place long=36.7143 lat=34.7239>Emesa</a>, commanding a detachment of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. This man alone, together with the soldiers under him, fifty in number, engaged with the enemy. And for some time they held out, but later, being overpowered by the great multitude, they ran to the top of a hill in the neighbourhood on which there was also a fort, but one which offered no security. For this reason they surrendered themselves to their opponents when they ascended the hill to attack them. And the Moors killed neither him nor any of the soldiers, but they made prisoners of the whole force; and <a href=/people/7767 target=_blank>Himerius</a> they kept under guard, and handed over his soldiers to Stotzas, since they agreed with great readiness to march with the rebels against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>; <a href=/people/7767 target=_blank>Himerius</a>, however, they threatened with death, if he should not carry out their commands. And they commanded him to put into their hands by some device the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358106UHad class=place long=10.6387 lat=35.8258>Hadrumetum</a> on the sea. And since he declared that he was willing, they went with him against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358106UHad class=place long=10.6387 lat=35.8258>Hadrumetum</a>. And upon coming near the city, they sent <a href=/people/7767 target=_blank>Himerius</a> a little in advance with some of the soldiers of Stotzas, dragging along, as it seemed, some Moors in chains, and they themselves followed behind. And they directed <a href=/people/7767 target=_blank>Himerius</a> to say to those in command of the gates of the city that the emperor's army had won a decisive victory, and that John would come very soon, bringing an innumerable multitude of Moorish captives; and when in this manner the gates had been opened to them, he was to get inside the fortifications together with those who went with him. And he carried out these instructions. And the citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358106UHad class=place long=10.6387 lat=35.8258>Hadrumetum</a>, being deceived in this way (for they could not distrust the commander of all the troops in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>), opened wide the gates and received the enemy. Then, indeed, those who had entered with <a href=/people/7767 target=_blank>Himerius</a> drew their swords and would not allow the guards there to shut the gates again, but straightway received the whole army of the Moors into the city. And the barbarians, after plundering it and establishing there some few guards, departed. And of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who had been captured some few escaped and came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, among whom were <a href=/people/3960 target=_blank>Severianus</a> and <a href=/people/7767 target=_blank>Himerius</a>. For it was not difficult for those who wished it to make their escape from Moors. And many also, not at all unwillingly, remained with Stotzas. <br />Not long after this one of the priests, <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> by name, who had been appointed to take charge of the sick, in conferring with some of the nobles, said: I myself shall journey to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> and I am hopeful that I shall return quickly with an army, and it will be your care to receive the emperor's forces into the city. So they attached some ropes to him and let him down by night from the fortifications, and he, coming to the sea-shore and happening upon a fishing-vessel which was thereabouts, won over the masters of this boat by great sums of money and sailed off to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. And when he had landed there and come into the presence of <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a>, he told the whole story and asked him to give him a considerable army in order to recover <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358106UHad class=place long=10.6387 lat=35.8258>Hadrumetum</a>. And since this by no means pleased <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a>, inasmuch as the army in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> was not great, the priest begged him to give him some few soldiers, and receiving not more than eighty men, he formed the following plan. He collected a large number of boats and skiffs and embarked on them many sailors and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> also, clad in the garments which the Roman soldiers are accustomed to wear. And setting off with the whole fleet, he sailed at full speed straight for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358106UHad class=place long=10.6387 lat=35.8258>Hadrumetum</a>. And when he had come close to it, he sent some men stealthily and declared to the notables of the city that Germanus, the emperor's nephew, had recently come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, and had sent a very considerable army to the citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358106UHad class=place long=10.6387 lat=35.8258>Hadrumetum</a>. And he bade them take courage at this and open for them one small gate that night. And they carried out his orders. Thus <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> with his followers got inside the fortifications, and he slew all the enemy and recovered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358106UHad class=place long=10.6387 lat=35.8258>Hadrumetum</a> for the emperor; and the rumour about Germanus, beginning there, went even to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. And the Moors, as well as Stotzas and his followers, upon hearing this, at first became terrified and went off in flight to the extremities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, but later, upon learning the truth, they counted it a terrible thing that they, after sparing all the citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358106UHad class=place long=10.6387 lat=35.8258>Hadrumetum</a>, had suffered such things at their hands. For this reason they made raids everywhere and wrought unholy deeds upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a>, sparing no one whatever his age, and the land became at that time for the most part depopulated. For of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> who had been left some fled into the cities and some to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and the other islands. But almost all the notables came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, among whom was <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> also, who had recovered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358106UHad class=place long=10.6387 lat=35.8258>Hadrumetum</a> for the emperor. And the Moors with still less fear, since no one came out against them, were plundering everything, and with them Stotzas, who was now powerful. For many Roman soldiers were following him, some who had come as deserters, and others who had been in the beginning captives but now remained with him of their own free will. And John, who was indeed a man of some reputation among the Moors, was remaining quiet because of the extreme hostility he had conceived against <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a>.</p>                        </div>

And when this expedition lauded at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> departed forthwith for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a> with his own army, and <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a>, upon learning that Antalas and Stotzas were encamped near the city of Siccaveneria, which is three days' journey distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, commanded John, the son of Sisiniolus, to go against them, choosing out whatever was best of the army; and he wrote to <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> to unite with the forces of John, in order that they might all with one common force engage with the enemy. Now <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> decided to pay no heed to the message and have nothing to do with this affair, and John with a small army was compelled to engage with an innumerable host of the enemy. And there had always been great enmity between him and Stotzas, and each one used to pray that he might become the slayer of the other before departing from the world. At that time, accordingly, as soon as the fighting was about to come to close quarters, both rode out from their armies and came against each other. And John drew his bow, and, as Stotzas was still advancing, made a successful shot and hit him in the right groin, and Stotzas, mortally wounded, fell there, not yet dead, but destined to survive this wound only a little time. And all came up immediately, both the Moorish army and those who followed Stotzas, and placing Stotzas with little life in him against a tree, they advanced upon their enemy with great fury; and since they were far superior in numbers, they routed John and all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> with no difficulty. Then, indeed, they say, John remarked that death had now a certain sweetness for him, since his prayer regarding Stotzas had reached fulfilment. And there was a steep place near by, where his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> stumbled and threw him off. And as he was trying to leap upon the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> again, the enemy caught and killed him, a man who had shown himself great both in reputation and in valour. And Stotzas learned this and then died, remarking only that now it was most sweet to die. In this battle John, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=person long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a>, brother of <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a>, also died, after making a display of valorous deeds against the enemy. And the emperor, upon hearing this, was very deeply grieved because of the valour of John; and thinking it inexpedient for the two generals to administer the province, he immediately recalled <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> and sent him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> with an army, and gave over the whole power of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> to <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a>.</p>                        </div>

He himself, as it happened, was commanding the troops in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a> and spending his time there for that reason, but he was secretly treating with the Moors that they might march against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. Forthwith, therefore, an army of the enemy, having been gathered into one place from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>, went with great zeal against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a> were commanded by Coutzinas and Iaudas, and the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a> by Antalas. And with him was also John, the tyrant, and his followers; for the mutineers, after the death of Stotzas, had set him up as ruler over themselves. And when <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> learned of their attack, he summoned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> a number of the officers with their men, and among them <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>. And he was joined also by <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a>. <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a>, accordingly, bade <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> lead the whole army against the enemy. And <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, though he had promised to serve him zealously in the war, proceeded to act as follows. One of his servants, a Moor by birth and a cook by trade, he commanded to go to the enemy's camp, and to make it appear to all others that he had run away from his master, but to tell Antalas secretly that <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> wished to share with him the rule of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. So the cook carried out these directions, and Antalas heard the word gladly, but made no further reply than to say that worthy enterprises are not properly brought to pass among men by cooks. When this was heard by <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, he immediately sent to Antalas one of his body-guards, Ulitheus by name, whom he had found especially trustworthy in his service, inviting him to come as close as possible to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. For, if this were done, he promised him to put <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> out of the way. So Ulitheus without the knowledge of the rest of the barbarians made an agreement with Antalas that he, Antalas, should rule <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>, having half the possessions of <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> and taking with him fifteen hundred Roman soldiers, while <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> should assume the dignity of king, holding the power over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> and the rest of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. And after settling these matters he returned to the Roman camp, which they had made entirely in front of the circuit-wall, distributing among themselves the guarding of each gate. And the barbarians not long afterwards proceeded straight for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> in great haste, and they made camp and remained in the place called <a href=/people/7581 target=_blank>Decimum</a>. And departing from there on the following day, they were moving forward. But some of the Roman army encountered them, and engaging with them unexpectedly, slew a small number of the Moors. But these were straightway called back by <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, who rebuked them for acting with reckless daring and for being willing to give the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> foreknowledge of the danger into which they were thrown. <br />But in the meantime <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> sent to Coutzinas secretly and began to treat with him with regard to turning traitor. And Coutzinas promised him that, as soon as they should begin the action, he would turn against Antalas and the Moors of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>. For the Moors keep faith neither with any other men nor with each other. This <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> reported to <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>. And he, wishing to frustrate the enterprise by having it postponed, advised <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> by no means to have faith in Coutzinas, unless he should receive from him his children as hostages. So <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> and Coutzinas, constantly sending secret messages to each other, were busying themselves with the plot against Antalas. And <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> sent Ulitheus once more and made known to Antalas what was being done. And he decided not to make any charges against Coutzinas nor did he allow him to know that he had discovered the plot, nor indeed did he disclose anything of what had been agreed upon by himself and <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>. But though enemies and hostile at heart to one another, they were arrayed together with treacherous intent, and each of them was marching with the other against his own particular friend. With such purposes Coutzinas and Antalas were leading the Moorish army against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. And <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> was intending to kill <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a>, but, in order to avoid the appearance of aiming at sole power, he wished to do this secretly in battle, in order that it might seem that the plot had been made by others against the general, and that he had been compelled by the Roman army to assume command over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. Accordingly he circumvented <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> by deceit, and persuaded him to go out against the enemy and engage with them, now that they had already come close to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. He decided, therefore, that on the following day he would lead the whole army against the enemy at sunrise. But <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a>, being very inexperienced in this matter and reluctant besides, kept holding back for no good reason. For while considering how he should put on his equipment of arms and armour, and making the other preparations for the sally, he wasted the greatest part of the day. He accordingly put off the engagement to the following day and remained quiet. But <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, suspecting that he had hesitated purposely, as being aware of what was being done, decided openly to accomplish the murder of the general and make his attempt at the tyranny.</p>                        </div>

Opening wide the gates where he himself kept guard, he placed huge rocks under them, that no one might be able easily to shut them, and he placed armoured men with bows in their hands about the parapet in great numbers, and he himself, having put on his breastplate, took his stand between the gates. And his purpose in doing this was not that he might receive the Moors into the city; for the Moors, being altogether fickle, are suspicious of all men. And it is not unnatural that they are so; for whoever is by nature treacherous toward his neighbours is himself unable to trust anyone at all, but he is compelled to be suspicious of all men, since he estimates the character of his neighbour by his own mind. For this reason, then, <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> did not hope that even the Moors would trust him and come inside the circuit-wall, but he made this move in order that <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a>, falling into great fear, might straightway rush off in flight, and, abandoning <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> as quickly as he could, might betake himself to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. And he would have been right in his expectation had not winter come on just then and frustrated his plan. [544-545 A.D.] And <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a>, learning what was being done, summoned <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a> and some of the notables. And <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> also came to him from the camp with two others and he urged <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> neither to lose heart nor to give way to the daring of <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, but to go against him instantly with all his men and engage him in battle, before any further trouble arose. At first, then, <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> sent to <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> one of his friends, Phredas by name, and commanded him to test the other's purpose. And when Phredas returned and reported that <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> by no means denied his intention of seizing the supreme power, he purposed immediately to go against him arrayed for battle. <br />But in the meantime <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> slandered <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> to the soldiers, saying that he was a coward and not only possessed with fear of the enemy, but at the same time quite unwilling to give them, his soldiers, their pay, and that he was planning to run away with <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a> and that they were about to sail very soon from Mandracium [68], in order that the soldiers, fighting both with hunger and with the Moors, might be destroyed; and he enquired whether it was their wish to arrest both and keep them under guard. For thus he hoped either that <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a>, perceiving the tumult, would turn to flight, or that he would be captured by the soldiers and ruthlessly put to death. Moreover he promised that he himself would advance to the soldiers money of his own, as much as the government owed them. And they were approving his words and were possessed with great wrath against <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a>, but while this was going on <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> together with <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> and his followers came there. And a battle took place on the parapet and below about the gate where <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> had taken his stand, and neither side was worsted. And all were about to gather from the camps, as many as were well disposed to the emperor, and capture the mutineers by force. For <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> had not as yet deceived all, but the majority remained still uncorrupted in mind. But <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a>, seeing then for the first time the killing of men (for he had not yet, as it happened, become acquainted with this sight), was terror-stricken and, turning coward, fled, unable to endure what he saw. <br />Now there is a temple inside the fortifications of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> hard by the sea-shore, the abode of men who are very exact in their practice of religion, whom we have always been accustomed to call monks; this temple had been built by <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> not long before, and he had surrounded it with a wall and rendered it a very strong fortress. And <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a>, fleeing for refuge, rushed into the monastery, where he had already sent his wife and sister. Then <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> too ran away, and all the rest withdrew from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> as each one could. And <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, having taken the city by assault, with the mutineers took possession of the palace, and was already guarding both the gates and the harbour most carefully. First, then, he summoned <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a>, who came to him without delay, and by using much flattery <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a> made it appear that what had been done pleased him exceedingly. And after this <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> sent the priest of the city and commanded <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a>, after receiving pledges, to come to the palace, threatening that he would besiege him if he disobeyed and would not again give him pledges of safety, but would use every means to capture and put him to death. So the priest, Reparatus, stoutly declared to <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> that in accordance with the decision of <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> he would swear that no harm would come to him from <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, telling also what he had threatened in case he did not obey. But <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> became afraid and agreed that he would follow the priest immediately, if the priest, after performing the rite of the sacred bath in the usual manner, should swear to him by that rite and then give him pledges for his safety. So the priest did according to this. And <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> without delay followed him, clad in a garment which was suitable neither for a general nor for any one else in military service, but altogether appropriate to a slave or one of private station; this garment the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call casula in the Latin tongue. And when they came near the palace, he took in his hands the holy scriptures from the priest, and so went before <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>. And falling prone he lay there a long time, holding out to him the suppliant olive-branch and the holy scriptures, and with him was the child which had been counted worthy of the sacred bath by which the priest had given him the pledge, as has been told. And when, with difficulty, <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> had raised him to his feet, he enquired of <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> in the name of all things holy whether his safety was secure. And <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> now bade him most positively to be of good cheer, for he would suffer no harm at his hands, but on the following day would be gone from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> with his wife and his possessions. Then he dismissed the priest Reparatus, and bade <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> and <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a> dine with him in the palace. And during the dinner he honoured <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a>, inviting him to take his place first on the couch; but after the dinner he did not let him go, but compelled him to sleep in a chamber alone; and he sent there Ulitheus with certain others to assail him. And while he was wailing and crying aloud again and again and speaking many entreating words to them to move them to pity, they slew him. <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a>, however, they spared, passing him by, I suppose, on account of his advanced age.</p>                        </div>

Antalas, therefore, was outraged, because he was not carrying out anything of what had been agreed with him, and at the same time, upon considering what <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> had sworn and what he had done to <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a>, he was incensed. For it did not seem to him that one who had disregarded such oaths would ever be faithful either to him or to anyone else at all. So after considering the matter long with himself, he was desirous of submitting to the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>; for this reason, then, he marched back. And learning that Marcentius, who commanded the troops in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>, had fled to one of the islands which lie off the coast, he sent to him, and telling him the whole story and giving pledges, persuaded him by kind words to come to him. And Marcentius remained with Antalas in the camp, while the soldiers who were on duty in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>, being well disposed to the emperor, were guarding the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358106UHad class=place long=10.6387 lat=35.8258>Hadrumetum</a>. But the soldiers of Stotzas, being not less than a thousand, perceiving what was being done, went in great haste, with John leading them, to <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>; and he gladly received them into the city. Now there were five hundred <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and about eighty <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a>, while all the rest were <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. And <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a>, upon receiving pledges, went up to the palace with his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a>, and promised to serve the tyrant according to his orders. But secretly he was purposing to destroy <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, having previously communicated this purpose to Gregorius, his nephew, and to Artasires, his body-guard. And Gregorius, urging him on to the undertaking, spoke as follows: <br /><a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a>, the opportunity is now at hand for you, and you alone, to win the glory of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> — nay more, even to surpass that glory by far. For he came here, having received from the emperor a most formidable army and great sums of money, having officers accompanying him and advisers in great numbers, and a fleet of ships whose like we have never before heard tell of, and numerous cavalry, and arms, and everything else, to put it in a word, prepared for him in a manner worthy of the Roman empire. And thus equipped he won back <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> with much toil. But all these achievements have so completely come to naught, that they are, at this moment, as if they had never been — except indeed, that there is at present left to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> from the victory of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> the losses they have suffered in lives and in money, and, in addition, that they are no longer able even to guard the good things they won. But the winning back of all these things for the emperor now depends upon the courage and judgment and right hand of you alone. Therefore consider that you are of the house of the <a href=/people/2721 target=_blank>Arsacidae</a> by ancient descent, and remember that it is seemly for men of noble birth to play the part of brave men always and in all places. Now many remarkable deeds have been performed by you in behalf of freedom. For when you were still young, you slew <a href=/people/2703 target=_blank>Acacius</a>, the ruler of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a>, and Sittas, the general of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and as a result of this becoming known to the king <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>, you campaigned with him against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. And since you have reached so great a station that it devolves upon you not to allow the Roman power to lie subject to a drunken <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, show at this time that it was by reason of noble birth and a valorous heart that at the former time, good sir, you performed those deeds; and I as well as Artasires here will assist you in everything, so far as we have the power, in accordance with your commands. <br />So spoke Gregorius; and he excited the mind of <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> still more against the tyrant. But <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, bringing out the wife and the sister of <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> from the fortress, compelled them to remain at a certain house, showing them no insult by any word or deed whatsoever, nor did they have provisions in any less measure than they needed, nor were they compelled to say or to do anything except, indeed, that Prejecta was forced to write to her uncle that <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> was honouring them exceedingly and that he was altogether guiltless of the murder of her husband, and that the base deed had been done by Ulitheus, <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> by no means approving. And <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> was persuaded to do this by <a href=/people/4250 target=_blank>Pasiphilus</a>, a man who had been foremost among the mutineers in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>, and had assisted <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> very greatly in his effort to establish the tyranny. For <a href=/people/4250 target=_blank>Pasiphilus</a> maintained that, if he should do this, the emperor would marry the young woman to him, and in view of his kinship with her would give also a, dowry of a large sum of money. And <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> commanded <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> to lead the army against Antalas and the Moors in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358105RByz class=place long=10.5 lat=35.75>Byzacium</a>. For Coutzinas, having quarrelled with Antalas, had separated from him openly and allied himself with <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>; and he gave <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> his son and his mother as hostages. So the army, under the leadership of <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a>, proceeded immediately against Antalas. And with <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> was John also, the commander of the mutineers of Stotzas, and Ulitheus, the body-guard of <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>; and there were Moors also following him, led by Coutzinas. And after passing by the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358106UHad class=place long=10.6387 lat=35.8258>Hadrumetum</a>, they came upon their opponents somewhere near there, and making a camp a little apart from the enemy, they passed the night. And on the day after that John and Ulitheus, with a detachment of the army, remained there, while <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> and Coutzinas led their army against their opponents. And the Moors under Antalas did not withstand their attack and rushed off in flight. But <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> of a sudden wilfully played the coward, and turning his standard about marched off towards the rear. For this reason Ulitheus was purposing to kill him when he came into the camp. But <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a>, by way of excusing himself, said he feared lest Marcentius, coming to assist the enemy from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358106UHad class=place long=10.6387 lat=35.8258>Hadrumetum</a>, where he then happened to be, would do his forces irreparable harm; but <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, he said, ought to march against the enemy with the whole army. And at first he considered going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358106UHad class=place long=10.6387 lat=35.8258>Hadrumetum</a> with his followers and uniting with the emperor's forces. But after long deliberation it seemed to him better to put <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> out of the world and thus free both the emperor and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> from a difficult situation. Returning, accordingly, to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, he reported to the tyrant that he would need a larger army to meet the enemy. And <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, after conferring with <a href=/people/4250 target=_blank>Pasiphilus</a>, consented, indeed, to equip his whole army, but purposed to place a guard in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, and in person to lead the army against the enemy. Each day, therefore, he was destroying many men toward whom he felt any suspicion, even though groundless. And he gave orders to <a href=/people/4250 target=_blank>Pasiphilus</a>, whom he was intending to appoint in charge of the garrison of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, to kill all the Greeks without any consideration.</p>                        </div>

And in a room where there were in readiness three couches which had been there from ancient times, he made the banquet. So he himself reclined, as was natural, upon the first couch, where were also <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a> and <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a>, and some of those known to <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, and Peter, a Thracian by birth, who had previously been a body-guard of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>. And on both the other couches were the first and noblest of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. John, however, who commanded the mutineers of Stotzas; was entertained by <a href=/people/4250 target=_blank>Pasiphilus</a> in his own house, and each of the other leaders wherever it suited the several friends of <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> to entertain them. <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a>, accordingly, when he was bidden to this banquet, thinking that this occasion furnished him a suitable opportunity for the murder of the tyrant, was planning to carry out his purpose. He therefore disclosed the matter to Gregorius and to Artasires and three other body-guards, bidding the body-guards get inside the hall with their swords (for when commanders are entertained at a banquet it is customary for their body-guards to stand behind them), and after getting inside to make an attack suddenly, at whatever moment should seem to them most suitable; and Artasires was to strike the first blow. At the same time he directed Gregorius to pick out a large number of the most daring of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a> and bring them to the palace, carrying only their swords in their hands (for it is not lawful for the escort of officers in a city to be armed with anything else), and leaving these men in the vestibule, to come inside with the body-guards; and he was to tell the plan to no one of them, but to make only this explanation, that he was suspicious of <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, fearing that he had called <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> to this banquet to do him harm, and therefore wished that they should stand beside the soldiers of <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> who had been stationed there on guard, and giving the appearance of indulging in some play, they were to take hold of the shields which these guards carried, and waving them about and otherwise moving them keep constantly turning them up and down; and if any tumult or shouting took place within, they were to take up these very shields and come to the rescue on the run. Such were the orders which <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> gave, and Gregorius proceeded to put them into execution. And Artasires devised the following plan: he cut some arrows into two parts and placed them on the wrist of his left arm, the sections reaching to his elbow. And after binding them very carefully with straps, he laid over them the sleeve of his tunic. And he did this in order that, if anyone should raise his sword over him and attempt to strike him, he might avoid the chance of suffering serious injury; for he had only to thrust his left arm in front of him, and the steel would break off as it crashed upon the wood, and thus his body could not be reached at any point. </p>                        </div>

And to <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> he spoke as follows: As for me, I have hopes that I shall prove equal to the undertaking and shall not hesitate, and also that I shall touch the body of <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> with this sword; but as for what will follow, I am unable to say whether God in His anger against the tyrant will co-operate with me in this daring deed, or whether, avenging some sin of mine, He will stand against me there and be an obstacle in my way. If, therefore, you see that the tyrant is not wounded in a vital spot, do you kill me with my sword without the least hesitation, so that I may not be tortured by him into saying that it was by your will that I rushed into the undertaking, and thus not only perish myself most shamefully, but also be compelled against my will to destroy you as well. And after Artasires had spoken such words he too, together with Gregorius and one of the body-guards, entered the room where the couches were and took his stand behind <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a>. And the rest, remaining by the guards, did as they had been commanded. </p>                        </div>

But Gregorius prevented him by saying in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> tongue that <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> was still wholly himself, not having as yet drunk any great quantity of wine. Then Artasires groaned and said: My good fellow, how fine a heart I have for the deed, and now you have for the moment wrongfully hindered me! And as the drinking went on, <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, who by now was thoroughly saturated with wine, began to give portions of the food to the body-guards, yielding to a generous mood. And they, upon receiving these portions, went outside the building immediately and were about to eat them, leaving beside <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> only three body-guards, one of whom happened to be Ulitheus. And Artasires also started to go out in order to taste the morsels with the rest. But just then a kind of fear came over him lest, when he should wish to draw his sword, something might prevent him. Accordingly, as soon as he got outside, he secretly threw away the sheath of the sword, and taking it naked under his arm, hidden by his cloak, he rushed in to <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, as if to say something without the knowledge of the others. And <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a>, seeing this, was in a fever of excitement, and became exceedingly anxious by reason of the surpassing magnitude of the issue at stake; he began to move his head, the colour of his countenance changed repeatedly, and he seemed to have become altogether like one inspired, on account of the greatness of the undertaking. And Peter, upon seeing this, understood what was being done, but he did not disclose it to any of the others, because, being well disposed to the emperor, he was exceedingly pleased by what was going on. And Artasires, having come close to the tyrant, was pushed by one of the servants, and as he retreated a little to the rear, the servant observed that his sword was bared and cried out saying: What is this, my excellent fellow? And <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, putting his hand to his right ear, and turning his face, looked at him. And Artasires struck him with his sword as he did so, and cut off a piece of his scalp together with his fingers. And Peter cried out and exhorted Artasires to kill the most unholy of all men. And <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a>, seeing <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> leaping to his feet (for he reclined close to him), drew a two-edged dagger which hung by his thigh — a rather large one — and thrusting it into the tyrant's left side clean up to the hilt, left it there. And the tyrant none the less tried to leap up, but having received a mortal wound, he fell where he was. Ulitheus then brought his sword down upon Artasires as if to strike him over the head; but he held his left arm above his head, and thus profited by his own idea in the moment of greatest need. For since Ulitheus' sword had its edge turned when it struck the sections of arrows on his arm, he himself was unscathed, and he killed Ulitheus with no difficulty. And Peter and <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a>, the one seizing the sword of <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> and the other that of Ulitheus who had fallen, killed on the spot those of the body-guards who remained. Thus there arose, as was natural, an exceedingly great tumult and confusion. And when this was perceived by those of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a> who were standing by the tyrant's guards, they immediately picked up the shields according to the plan which had been arranged with them, and went on the run to the banquet-room. And they slew all the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and the friends of <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, no one resisting. </p>                        </div>

And in proportion as the barbarian element among them became strong, just so did the prestige of the Roman soldiers forthwith decline, and under the fair name of alliance they were more and more tyrannized over by the intruders and oppressed by them; so that the barbarians ruthlessly forced many other measures upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> much against their will and finally demanded that they should divide with them the entire land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. And indeed they commanded <a href=/people/10891 target=_blank>Orestes</a> to give them the third part of this, and when he would by no means agree to do so, they killed him immediately.[476 A.D.] Now there was a certain man among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> named <a href=/people/12063 target=_blank>Odoacer</a>, one of the bodyguards of the emperor, and he at that time agreed to carry out their commands, on condition that they should set him upon the throne. And when he had received the supreme power in this way, [D] he did the emperor no further harm, but allowed him to live thenceforth as a private citizen. And by giving the third part of the land to the barbarians, and in this way gaining their allegiance most firmly, he held the supreme power securely for ten years. </p>                        </div>

In that place a very wonderful thing takes place every day. For early in the morning the sea forms a kind of river and comes up over the land for the distance of a day's journey for an unencumbered traveller and becomes navigable in the midst of the mainland, and then in the late afternoon it turns back again, causing the inlet to disappear, and gathers the stream to itself. </p>                        </div>

For he was exceedingly careful to observe justice, he preserved the laws on a sure basis, he protected the land and kept it safe from the barbarians dwelling round about, and attained the highest possible degree of wisdom and manliness.

This <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> had gained possession of most of the lands in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscia</a>, and he was eager by violent methods to wrest the remainder from their owners.

Now <a href=/people/12065 target=_blank>Amalasuntha</a> was exerting herself to curb this desire of his, and consequently he was always vexed with her and resentful.

As for the points in dispute, although I know them well, I shall by no means make mention of them; for I consider it a sort of insane folly to investigate the nature of God, enquiring of what sort it is.

And the purport of the writing was as follows: The fortress of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378124ULil class=place long=12.4342 lat=37.7991>Lilybaeum</a>, which is ours, you have taken by force and are now holding, and barbarians, slaves of mine who have run away, you have received and have not even yet decided to restore them to me, and besides all this you have treated outrageously my city of Gratiana, though it belongs to you in no way whatever. Wherefore it is time for you to consider what the end of these things will some day be. And when this letter had been delivered to her and she had read it, she replied in the following words: One may reasonably expect an emperor who is great and lays claim to virtue to assist an orphan child who does not in the least comprehend what is being done, rather than for no cause at all to quarrel with him. For unless a struggle be waged on even terms, even the victory it gains brings no honour. But thou dost threaten Atalaric on account of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378124ULil class=place long=12.4342 lat=37.7991>Lilybaeum</a>, and ten runaways, and a mistake, made by soldiers in going against their enemies, which through some misapprehension chanced to affect a friendly city. Nay! do not thus; do not thou thus, O Emperor, but call to mind that when them wast making war upon the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, we not only refrained from hindering thee, but quite zealously even gave thee free passage against the enemy and provided a market in which to buy the indispensable supplies, furnishing especially the multitude of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> to which thy final mastery over the enemy was chiefly due. And yet it is not merely the man who offers an alliance of arms to his neighbours that would in justice be called their ally and friend, but also the man who actually is found assisting another in war in regard to his every need. And consider that at that time thy fleet had no other place at which to put in from the sea except <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, and that without the supplies bought there it could not go on to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. Therefore thou art indebted to us for the chief cause of thy victory; for the one who provides a solution for a difficult situation is justly entitled also to the credit for the results which flow from his help. And what could be sweeter for a man, O Emperor, than gaining the mastery over his enemies? And yet in our case the outcome is that we suffer no slight disadvantage, in that we do not, in accordance with the custom of war, enjoy our share of the spoils. </p>                        </div>

And since she saw that both <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a> had an unfavourable opinion regarding <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a>, who had now come to represent the race of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>, she had conceived the desire to clear him of this evil name, in order that it might not stand in his way if he were called to the throne. But at the same time, she explained, the question of justice disturbed her, at the thought that those who claimed to have been wronged by him already should find that they had no one to whom they might report what had befallen them, but that they now had their enemy as their master. For these reasons, then, although she invited him to the throne after his name should have been cleared in this way, yet it was necessary, she said, that he should be bound by the most solemn oaths that while the title of the office should be conferred upon <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a>, she herself should in fact hold the power no less than before. When <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> heard this, although he swore to all the conditions which <a href=/people/12065 target=_blank>Amalasuntha</a> wished, he entered into the agreement with treacherous intent, remembering all that she had previously done to him. Thus <a href=/people/12065 target=_blank>Amalasuntha</a>, being deceived by her own judgment and the oaths of <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a>, established him in the office. And sending some <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> as envoys to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, she made this known to the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>. </p>                        </div>

But he, turning coward and reduced to speechlessness no less than if he himself had become a captive with <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, entered into negotiations with Peter without the knowledge of any others, and between them they formed an agreement, providing that <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> should retire from all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> in favour of the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, and should send him also a golden crown every year weighing three hundred litrae, and Gothic warriors to the number of three thousand whenever he should wish; and that <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> himself should have no authority to kill any priest or senator, or to confiscate his property for the public treasury except by the decision of the emperor; and that if <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> wished to advance any of his subjects to the patrician or some other senatorial rank this honour should not be bestowed by him, but he should ask the emperor to bestow it; and that the Roman populace, in acclaiming their sovereign, should always shout the name of the emperor first, and afterward that of <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a>, both in the theatres and in the hippodromes and wherever else it should be necessary for such a thing to be done; furthermore, that no statue of bronze nor of any other material should ever be set up to <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> alone, but statues must always be made for both, and they must stand thus: on the right that of the emperor, and on the other side that of <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a>.

Once more, therefore, he summoned Peter, who had already reached Albani, for a secret conference, and enquired of the man whether he thought that the agreement would be pleasing to the emperor. And he replied that he supposed it would. But if, said <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a>, these things do not please the man at all, what will happen then? And Peter replied After that you will have to wage war, most noble Sir. But what is this, he said; is it just, my dear ambassador? And Peter, immediately taking him up, said And how is it not just, my good Sir, that the pursuits appropriate to each man's nature should be preserved? What, pray, may this mean? asked <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a>. It means, was the reply, that your great interest is to philosophize, while <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>'s is to be a worthy emperor of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. And there is this difference, that for one who has practised philosophy it would never be seemly to bring about the death of men, especially in such great numbers, and it should be added that this view accords with the teachings of <a href=/people/2345 target=_blank>Plato</a>, which you have evidently espoused, and hence it is unholy for you not to be free from all bloodshed; but for him it is not at all inappropriate to seek to acquire a land which has belonged from of old to the realm which is his own. Thereupon <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a>, being convinced by this advice, agreed to retire from the kingship in favour of the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, and both he and his wife took an oath to this effect. He then bound Peter by oaths that he would not divulge this agreement until he should see that the emperor would not accept the former convention. And he sent with him <a href=/people/3955 target=_blank>Rusticus</a>, a priest who was especially devoted to him and a Roman citizen, to negotiate on the basis of this agreement. And he also entrusted a letter to these men. </p>                        </div>

But when the emperor was quite unwilling to accept the proposal, they revealed the plan which had been committed to writing afterwards. This was to the following effect: I am no stranger to royal courts, but it was my fortune to have been born in the house of my uncle while he was king and to have been reared in a manner worthy of my race; and yet I have had little experience of wars and of the turmoils which wars entail. For since from my earliest years I have been passionately addicted to scholarly disputations and have always devoted my time to this sort of thing, I have consequently been up to the present time very far removed from the confusion of battles. Therefore it is utterly absurd that I should aspire to the honours which royalty confers and thus lead a life fraught with danger, when it is possible for me to avoid them both. For neither one of these is a pleasure to me; the first, because it is liable to satiety, for it is a surfeit of all sweet things, and the second, because lack of familiarity with such a life throws one into confusion. But as for me, if estates should be provided me which yielded an annual income of no less than twelve centenaria, I should regard the kingdom as of less account than them, and I shall hand over to thee forthwith the power of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>.

For certain men who in the past have followed such a course have been completely undone. And you will never repent having made us friends instead of enemies.

And when <a href=/people/12180 target=_blank>Mundus</a> heard of this, being overcome with grief at the misfortune and by this time dominated by a mighty fury, he went against the enemy without the least delay and regardless of order. The battle which took place was stubbornly contested, and the result was a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=demonym long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Cadmean</a> victory for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. For although the most of the enemy fell there and their rout had been decisive, <a href=/people/12180 target=_blank>Mundus</a>, who went on killing and following up the enemy wherever he chanced to find them and was quite unable to restrain his mind because of the misfortune of his son, was wounded by some fugitive or other and fell.

And at that time the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> recalled the verse of the <a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibyl</a>, which had been pronounced in earlier times and seemed to them a portent. For the words of the saying were that when Africa should be held, the world would perish together with its offspring. This, however, was not the real meaning of the oracle, but after intimating that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> would be once more subject to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, it added this statement also, that when that time came <a href=/people/12180 target=_blank>Mundus</a> would perish together with his son. For it runs as follows: Africa capta <a href=/people/12180 target=_blank>Mundus</a> cum nato peribit.

For he was by nature much given to distrust, and he by no means kept his mind steadfast, but the present fortune always reduced him now to a state of terror which knew no measure, and this contrary to reason and the proper understanding of the situation, and again brought him to the opposite extreme of unspeakable boldness. And so at that time, when he heard of the death of <a href=/people/12180 target=_blank>Mundus</a> and Mauricius, he was lifted up exceedingly and in a manner altogether unjustified by what had happened, and he saw fit to taunt the envoys when they at length appeared before him. And when Peter on one occasion remonstrated with him because he had transgressed his agreement with the emperor, <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> called both of them publicly and spoke as follows: The position of envoys is a proud one and in general has come to be held in honour among all men; but envoys preserve for themselves these their prerogatives only so long as they guard the dignity of their embassy by the propriety of their own conduct. For men have sanctioned as just the killing of an envoy whenever he is either found to have insulted a sovereign or has had knowledge of a woman who is the wife of another. Such were the words with which <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> inveighed against Peter, not because he had approached a woman, but, apparently, in order to make good his claim that there were charges which might lead to the death of an ambassador. But the envoys replied as follows: The facts are not, O Ruler of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, as thou hast stated them, nor canst thou, under cover of flimsy pretexts, wantonly perpetrate unholy deeds upon men who are envoys. For it is not possible for an ambassador, even if he wishes it, to become an adulterer, since it is not easy for him even to partake of water except by the will of those who guard him. And as for the proposals which he has received from the lips of him who has sent him and then delivers, he himself cannot reasonably incur the blame which arises from them, in case they be not good, but he who has given the command would justly bear this charge, while the sole responsibility of the ambassador is to have discharged his mission. </p>                        </div>

For those who, in order to rid themselves of slavery or any other shameful thing, go into war, such men, if they fare well in the struggle, have double good fortune, because along with their victory they have also acquired freedom from their troubles, and if defeated they gain some consolation for themselves, in that, they have not of their own free will chosen to follow the worse fortune. But as for those who have the opportunity to be free without fighting, but yet enter into a struggle in order to make their condition of slavery permanent, such men, even if it so happens that they conquer, have failed in the most vital point, and if in the battle they fare less happily than they wished, they will have, along with their general ill-fortune, also the calamity of defeat.

Because, if both you and they, disregarding all these considerations, dare to raise arms against us, it will be necessary for us also, if God so wills, to treat whomever we meet as an enemy.

These two men, planning how they might block the negotiations, induced the multitude to demand many serious concessions, and to try to force <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> to promise on oath that they should forthwith obtain what they asked for. And after writing down in a document such demands as nobody would have supposed that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> would accept, they gave it to <a href=/people/309 target=_blank>Stephanus</a>. And he, returning to the emperor's army, shewed the writing to the general, and enquired of him whether he was willing to carry out all the proposals which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=ethnic long=14.24 lat=40.843>Neapolitans</a> made and to take an oath concerning them.

And swayed by great excitement they were about to go to the gates with the purpose of throwing them open.

But it is necessary for us, who are on the very point of perishing together with you, to offer as a last contribution to the fatherland this advice. We see, then, fellow citizens, that you are intent upon betraying both yourselves and the city to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, who promises to confer many benefits upon you and to swear the most solemn oaths in confirmation of his promises. Now if he is able to promise you this also, that to him will come the victory in the war, no one could deny that the course you are taking is to your advantage. For it is great folly not to gratify every whim of him who is to become master. But if this outcome lies in uncertainty, and no man in the world is competent to guarantee the decision of fortune, consider what sort of misfortunes your haste is seeking to attain. For if the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> overcome their adversaries in the war, they will punish you as enemies and as having done them the foulest wrong. For you are resorting to this act of treason, not under constraint of necessity, but out of deliberate cowardice. So that even to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, if he wins the victory over his enemies, we shall perhaps appear faithless and betrayers of our rulers, and having proved ourselves deserters, we shall in all probability have a guard set over us permanently by the emperor. For though he who has found a traitor is pleased at the moment of victory by the service rendered, yet afterwards, moved by suspicion based upon the traitor's past, he hates and fears his benefactor, since he himself has in his own possession the evidences of the other's faithlessness. If, however, we shew ourselves faithful to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> at the present time, manfully submitting to the danger, they will give us great rewards in case they win the mastery over the enemy, and <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, if it should so happen that he is the victor, will be prone to forgive. For loyalty which fails is punished by no man unless he be lacking in understanding. But what has happened to you that you are in terror of being besieged by the enemy, you who have no lack of provisions, have not been deprived by blockade of any of the necessities of life, and hence may sit at home, confident in the fortifications and in your garrison here? And in our opinion even <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> would not have consented to this agreement with us if he had any hope of capturing the city by force. And yet if what he desired were that which is just and that which will be to our advantage, he ought not to be trying to frighten the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=ethnic long=14.24 lat=40.843>Neapolitans</a> or to establish his own power by means of an act of injustice on our part toward the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>; but he should do battle with <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, so that without danger to us or treason on our part the city might come into the power of the victors. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> was not making the least preparation for war, being by nature unmanly, as has been said before. And they say that something else happened to him, which terrified him exceedingly and reduced him to still greater anxiety. I, for my part, do not credit this report, but even so it shall be told. <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> even before this time had been prone to make enquiries of those who professed to foretell the future, and on the present occasion he was at a loss what to do in the situation which confronted him — a state which more than anything else is accustomed to drive men to seek prophecies; so he enquired of one of the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a>, who had a great reputation for prophecy, what sort of an outcome the present war would have. The Hebrew commanded him to confine three groups of ten <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a> each in three huts, and after giving them respectively the names of <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and the soldiers of the emperor, to wait quietly for a certain number of days. And <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> did as he was told. And when the appointed day had come, they both went into the huts and looked at the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>; and they found that of those which had been given the name of <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> all save two were dead, whereas all except a few were living of those which had received the name of the emperor's soldiers; and as for those which had been called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, it so happened that, although the hair of all of them had fallen out, yet about half of them survived. When <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> beheld this and divined the outcome of the war, a great fear, they say, came upon him, since he knew well that it would certainly be the fate of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> to die to half their number and be deprived of their possessions, but that the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> would be defeated and their race reduced to a few, and that to the emperor would come, with the loss of but a few of his soldiers, the victory in the war. And for this reason, they say, <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> felt no impulse to enter into a struggle with <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. As for this story, then, let each one express his views according to the belief or disbelief which he feels regarding it. </p>                        </div>

For he was coming to think that they would never yield to him, and, furthermore, he could not hope that the city would be captured, since he was finding that the difficulty of its position was proving to be a very serious obstacle. And the loss of the time which was being spent there distressed him, for he was making his calculations so as to avoid being compelled to go against <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> in the winter season. Indeed he had already even given orders to the army to pack up, his intention being to depart from there as quickly as possible. But while he was in the greatest perplexity, it came to pass that he met with the following good fortune. One of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> was seized with the desire to observe the construction of the aqueduct, and to discover in what manner it provided the supply of water to the city. So he entered it at a place far distant from the city, where <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had broken it open, and proceeded to walk along it, finding no difficulty, since the water had stopped running because the aqueduct had been broken open. But when he reached a point near the circuit-wall, he came upon a large rock, not placed there by the hand of man, but a part of the natural formation of the place. And those who had built the aqueduct many years before, after they had attached the masonry to this rock, proceeded to make a tunnel from that point on, not sufficiently large, however, for a man to pass through, but large enough to furnish a passage for the water. And for this reason it came about that the channel of the aqueduct was not everywhere of the same breadth, but one was confronted by a narrow place at that rock, impassable for a man, especially if he wore armour or carried a shield. And when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=demonym long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurian</a> observed this, it seemed to him not impossible for the army to penetrate into the city, if they should make the tunnel at that point broader by a little. But since he himself was a humble person, and never had come into conversation with any of the commanders, he brought the matter before Paucaris, an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=demonym long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurian</a>, who had distinguished himself among the guards of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. So Paucaris immediately reported the whole matter to the general. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, being pleased by the report, took new courage, and by promising to reward the man with great sums of money induced him to attempt the undertaking, and commanded him to associate with himself some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> and cut out a passage in the rock as quickly as possible, taking care to allow no one to become aware of what they were doing. Paucaris then selected some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> who were thoroughly suitable for the work, and secretly got inside the aqueduct with them. And coming to the place where the rock caused the passage to be narrow, they began their work, not cutting the rock with picks or mattocks, lest by their blows they should reveal to the enemy what they were doing, but scraping it very persistently with sharp instruments of iron. And in a short time the work was done, so that a man wearing a corselet and carrying a shield was able to go through at that point. </p>                        </div>

And straightway summoning <a href=/people/309 target=_blank>Stephanus</a>, he spoke as follows: Many times have I witnessed the capture of cities and I am well acquainted with what takes place at such a time. For they slay all the men of every age, and as for the women, though they beg to die, they are not granted the boon of death, but are carried off for outrage and are made to suffer treatment that is abominable and most pitiable. And the children, who are thus deprived of their proper maintenance and education, are forced to be slaves, and that, too, of the men who are the most odious of all — those on whose hands they see the blood of their fathers. And this is not all, my dear <a href=/people/309 target=_blank>Stephanus</a>, for I make no mention of the conflagration which destroys all the property and blots out the beauty of the city. When I see, as in the mirror of the cities which have been captured in times past, this city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> falling victim to such a fate, I am moved to pity both it and you its inhabitants. For such means have now been perfected by me against the city that its capture is inevitable. But I pray that an ancient city, which has for ages been inhabited by both <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, may not meet with such a fortune, especially at my hands as commander of Roman troops, not least because in my army are a multitude of barbarians, who have lost brothers or relatives before the wall of this town; for the fury of these men I should be unable to control, if they should capture the city by act of war. While, therefore, it is still within your power to choose and to put into effect that which will be to your advantage, adopt the better course and escape misfortune; for when it falls upon you, as it probably will, you will not justly blame fortune but your own judgment. With these words <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> dismissed <a href=/people/309 target=_blank>Stephanus</a>. And he went before the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> weeping and reporting with bitter lamentations all that he had heard <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> say. But they, since it was not fated that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=ethnic long=14.24 lat=40.843>Neapolitans</a> should become subjects of the emperor without chastisement, neither became afraid nor did they decide to yield to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>.</p>                        </div>

And he also sent to the camp, commanding the men to remain awake and to keep their arms in their hands. At the same time he kept near him a large force — men whom he considered most courageous. Now of the men who were on their way to the city above half became terrified at the danger and turned back. And since <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a> could not persuade them to follow him, although he urged them again and again, he returned with them to the general. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, after reviling these men, selected two hundred of the troops at hand, and ordered them to go with <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a>. And <a href=/people/6809 target=_blank>Photius</a> also, wishing to lead them, leaped into the channel of the aqueduct, but <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> prevented him.

Consequently, when the men under the command of <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a> and Ennes had got inside the fortifications, they were one and all unable even to conjecture where in the world they were. Furthermore, they could not leave the aqueduct at any point until the foremost of them came to a place where the aqueduct chanced to be without a roof and where stood a building which had entirely fallen into neglect. Inside this building a certain woman had her dwelling, living alone with utter poverty as her only companion; and an olive tree had grown out over the aqueduct. So when these men saw the sky and perceived that they were in the midst of the city, they began to plan how they might get out, but they had no means of leaving the aqueduct either with or without their arms. For the structure happened to be very high at that point and, besides, offered no means of climbing to the top. But as the soldiers were in a state of great perplexity and were beginning to crowd each other greatly as they collected there (for already, as the men in the rear kept coming up, a great throng was beginning to gather), the thought occurred to one of them to make trial of the ascent. He immediately therefore laid down his arms, and forcing his way up with hands and feet, reached the woman's house. And seeing her there, he threatened to kill her unless she should remain silent. And she was terror-stricken and remained speechless. He then fastened to the trunk of the olive tree a strong strap, and threw the other end of it into the aqueduct. So the soldiers, laying hold of it one at a time, managed with difficulty to make the ascent. And after all had come up and a fourth part of the night still remained, they proceeded toward the wall; and they slew the garrison of two of the towers before the men in them had an inkling of the trouble. These towers were on the northern portion of the circuit-wall, where <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was stationed with <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> and <a href=/people/6809 target=_blank>Photius</a>, anxiously awaiting the progress of events. So while the trumpeters were summoning the army to the wall, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was placing the ladders against the fortifications and commanding the soldiers to mount them. But it so happened that not one of the ladders reached as far as the parapet. For since the workmen had not made them in sight of the wall, they had not been able to arrive at the proper measure. For this reason they bound two together, and it was only by using both of them for the ascent that the soldiers got above the level of the parapet. Such was the progress of these events where <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was engaged. </p>                        </div>

For the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> had already given offence to their enemy by having opposed their efforts to capture the city without a fight, and for this reason they had no hope if they should fall into their hands; so they kept fighting stubbornly, although they could see that the city had already been captured, and held out beyond all expectation against the assaults of their opponents. But when day came and some of those who had mounted the wall marched against them, then at last they also, now that they were being shot at from behind, took to flight, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> was captured by storm. By this time the gates were thrown open and the whole Roman army came in.

For those of them who happened to have gold or anything else of value had previously concealed it by burying it in the earth, and in this way they succeeded in hiding from the enemy the fact that in getting back their houses they were recovering their money also. And the siege, which had lasted about twenty days, ended thus. As for the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> who were captured in the city, not less than eight hundred in number, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> put them under guard and kept them from all harm, holding them in no less honour than his own soldiers. </p>                        </div>

For no one could ever be loyal to his masters when they are in danger, except it be by firm conviction. As for me, then, the victors will have in me as true a guardian of the state as they lately found in me an enemy, since he whom nature has endowed with the quality of fidelity does not change his conviction when he changes his fortune.

Accordingly, when they heard that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> had been captured, they began immediately to make all these charges against him openly and gathered at a place two hundred and eighty stades distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call Regata.

For many a time a policy of delay adopted at the opportune moment has brought more benefit than the opposite course, and haste displayed at an unseasonable time has upset for many men their hope of success. For in most cases those who are unprepared, though they fight on equal terms so far as their forces are concerned, are more easily conquered than those who, with less strength, enter the struggle with the best possible preparation. Let us not, therefore, be so lifted up by the desire to win momentary honour as to do ourselves irreparable harm; for it is better to suffer shame for a short time and by so doing gain an undying glory, than to escape insult for the moment and thereby, as would probably be the case, be left in obscurity for all after time. And yet you doubtless know as well as I that the great body of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and practically our whole equipment of arms is in Gaul and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/457120REne class=place long=12.01 lat=45.7>Venetia</a> and the most distant lands. Furthermore, we are carrying on against the nations of the Franks a war which is no less important than this one, and it is great folly for us to proceed to another war without first settling that one satisfactorily. For it is natural that those who become exposed to attack on two sides and do not confine their attention to a single enemy should be worsted by their opponents. But I say that we must now go straight from here to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, and after bringing the war against the Franks to an end and settling all our other affairs as well as possible, then with the whole army of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> we must fight it out with <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. And let no one of you, I say, try to dissemble regarding this withdrawal, nor hesitate to call it flight. For the title of coward, fittingly applied, has saved many, while the reputation for bravery which some men have gained at the wrong time, has afterward led them to defeat. For it is not the names of things, but the advantage which comes from what is done, that is worth seeking after. For a man's worth is revealed by his deeds, not at their commencement, but at their end. And those do not flee before the enemy who, when they have increased their preparation, forthwith go against them, but those who are so anxious to save their own lives for ever that they deliberately stand aside. And regarding the capture of this city, let no fear come to any one of you. For if, on the one hand, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> are loyal to us, they will guard the city in security for the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, and they will not experience any hardship, for we shall return to them in a short time. And if, on the other hand, they harbour any suspicions toward us, they will harm us less by receiving the enemy into the city; for it is better to fight in the open against one's enemies. None the less I shall take care that nothing of this sort shall happen. For we shall leave behind many men and a most discreet leader, and they will be sufficient to guard <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> so effectively that not only will the situation here be favourable for us, but also that no harm may possibly come from this withdrawal of ours. </p>                        </div>

And in Gaul there flow numerous rivers, among which are the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437046WRho class=place long=4.5989 lat=43.6544>Rhone</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>. But the course of these two being in opposite directions, the one empties into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscan</a> Sea, while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> empties into the ocean. And there are many lakes in that region, and this is where the Germans lived of old, a barbarous nation, not of much consequence in the beginning, who are now called Franks. Next to these lived the Arborychi, who, together with all the rest of Gaul, and, indeed, Spain also, were subjects of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> from of old. And beyond them toward the east were settled the Thuringian barbarians, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, the first emperor, having given them this country. And the Burgundians lived not far from them toward the south, and the <a href=/people/11067 target=_blank>Suevi</a> also lived beyond the Thuringians, and the Alamani, powerful nations. All these were settled there as independent peoples in earlier times. <br />But as time went on, the <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a> forced their way into the Roman empire and seized all Spain and the portion of Gaul lying beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437046WRho class=place long=4.5989 lat=43.6544>Rhone</a> River and made them subject and tributary to themselves. By that time it so happened that the Arborychi had become soldiers of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. And the Germans, wishing to make this people subject to themselves, since their territory adjoined their own and they had changed the government under which they had lived from of old, began to plunder their land and, being eager to make war, marched against them with their whole people. But the Arborychi proved their valour and loyalty to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and shewed themselves brave men in this war, and since the Germans were not able to overcome them by force, they wished to win them over and make the two peoples kin by intermarriage. This suggestion the Arborychi received not at all unwillingly; for both, as it happened, were <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>. And in this way they were united into one people, and came to have great power. <br />Now other Roman soldiers, also, had been stationed at the frontiers of Gaul to serve as guards. And these soldiers, having no means of returning to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and at the same time being unwilling to yield to their enemy who were Arians, gave themselves, together with their military standards and the land which they had long been guarding for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, to the Arborychi and Germans; and they handed down to their offspring all the customs of their fathers, which were thus preserved, and this people has held them in sufficient reverence to guard them even up to my time. For even at the present day they are clearly recognized as belonging to the legions to which they were assigned when they served in ancient times, and they always carry their own standards when they enter battle, and always follow the customs of their fathers. And they preserve the dress of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in every particular, even as regards their shoes. <br />Now as long as the Roman polity remained unchanged, the emperor held all Gaul as far as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437046WRho class=place long=4.5989 lat=43.6544>Rhone</a> River; but when <a href=/people/12063 target=_blank>Odoacer</a> changed the government into a tyranny, [476 A.D.] then, since the tyrant yielded to them, the <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a> took possession of all Gaul as far as the alps which mark the boundary between Gaul and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=place long=8.3 lat=44.3>Liguria</a>. [493 A.D.]But after the fall of <a href=/people/12063 target=_blank>Odoacer</a>, the Thuringians and the <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a> began to fear the power of the Germans, which was now growing greater (for their country had become exceedingly populous and they were forcing into subjection without any concealment those who from time to time came in their way), and so they were eager to win the alliance of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>. And since <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> wished to attach these peoples to himself, he did not refuse to intermarry with them. Accordingly he betrothed to <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> the younger, who was then leader of the <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a>, his own unmarried daughter Theodichusa, and to Hermenefridus, the ruler of the Thuringians, Amalaberga, the daughter of his sister Amalafrida. As a result of this the Franks refrained from violence against these peoples through fear of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>, but they began a war against the Burgundians. But later on the Franks and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> entered into an offensive alliance against the Burgundians, agreeing that each of the two should send an army against them; and it was further agreed that if either army should be absent when the other took the field against the nation of the Burgundians and overthrew them and gained the land which they had, then the victors should receive as a penalty from those who had not joined in the expedition a fixed sum of gold, and that only on these terms should the conquered land belong to both peoples in common. So the Germans went against the Burgundians with a great army according to the agreement between themselves and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>; but <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> was still engaged with his preparations, as he said, and purposely kept putting off the departure of the army to the following day, and waiting for what would come to pass. Finally, however, he sent the army, but commanded the generals to march in a leisurely fashion, and if they should hear that the Franks had been victorious, they were thenceforth to go quickly, but if they should learn that any adversity had befallen them, they were to proceed no farther, but remain where they were. So they proceeded to carry out the commands of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>, but meanwhile the Germans joined battle alone with the Burgundians.[534 A.D.] The battle was stubbornly contested and a great slaughter took place on both sides, for the struggle was very evenly matched; but finally the Franks routed their enemy and drove them to the borders of the land which they inhabited at that time, where they had many strongholds, while the Franks took possession of all the rest. And the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, upon hearing this, were quickly at hand. And when they were bitterly reproached by their allies, they blamed the difficulty of the country, and laying down the amount of the penalty, they divided the land with the victors according to the agreement made. And thus the foresight of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> was revealed more clearly than ever, because, without losing a single one of his subjects, he had with a little gold acquired half of the land of his enemy. Thus it was that the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and Germans in the beginning got possession of a certain part of Gaul. <br />But later on, when the power of the Germans was growing greater, they began to think slightingly of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> and the fear he inspired, and took the field against <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> and the <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a>. And when <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> learned this, he summoned <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> as quickly as possible. And he set out to his assistance with a great army. In the meantime, the <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a>, upon learning that the Germans were in camp near the city of Carcasiana, went to meet them, and making a camp remained quiet. But since much time was being spent by them in blocking the enemy in this way, they began to be vexed, and seeing that their land was being plundered by the enemy, they became indignant. And at length they began to heap many insults upon <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a>, reviling him on account of his fear of the enemy and taunting him with the delay of his father-in-law. For they declared that they by themselves were a match for the enemy in battle and that even though unaided they would easily overcome the Germans in the war. For this reason <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> was compelled to do battle with the enemy before the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had as yet arrived. And the Germans, gaining the upper hand in this engagement, killed the most of the <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a> and their ruler <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a>. [507 A.D.] Then they took possession of the greater part of Gaul and held it; and they laid siege to Carcasiana with great enthusiasm, because they had learned that the royal treasure was there, which <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> the elder in earlier times had taken as booty when he captured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. Among these were also the treasures of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, the king of the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a>, a most noteworthy sight. [410 A.D.] For the most of them were adorned with emeralds; and they had been taken from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in ancient times. Then the survivors of the <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a> declared Giselic, an illegitimate son of <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a>, ruler over them, Amalaric, the son of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>'s daughter, being still a very young child. And afterwards, when <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> had come with the army of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, the Germans became afraid and broke up the siege. So they retired from there and took possession of the part of Gaul beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437046WRho class=place long=4.5989 lat=43.6544>Rhone</a> River as far as the ocean. And <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>, being unable to drive them out from there, allowed them to hold this territory, but he himself recovered the rest of Gaul. Then, after Giselic had been put out of the way, he conferred the rule of the <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a> upon his grandson Amalaric, for whom, since he was still a child, he himself acted as regent. And taking all the money which lay in the city of Carcasiana, he marched quickly back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>; furthermore, he continued to send commanders and armies into Gaul and Spain, thus holding the real power of the government himself, and by way of providing that he should hold it securely and permanently, he ordained that the rulers of those countries should bring tribute to him. And though he received this every year, in order not to give the appearance of being greedy for money he sent it as an annual gift to the army of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a>. And as a result of this, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a>, as time went on, ruled as they were by one man and holding the same land, betrothed their children to one another and thus joined the two races in kinship. <br />But afterwards, Theudis, a <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goth</a>, whom <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> had sent as commander of the army, took to wife a woman from Spain; she was not, however, of the race of the <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a>, but belonged to the house of one of the wealthy inhabitants of that land, and not only possessed great wealth but also owned a large estate in Spain. From this estate he gathered about two thousand soldiers and surrounded himself with a force of bodyguards, and while in name he was a ruler over the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> by the gift of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>, he was in fact an out and out tyrant. And <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>, who was wise and experienced in the highest degree, was afraid to carry on a war against his own slave, lest the Franks meanwhile should take the field against him, as they naturally would, or the <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a> on their part should begin a revolution against him; accordingly he did not remove Theudis from his office, but even continued to command him, whenever the army went to war, to lead it forth. However, he directed the first men of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> to write to Theudis that he would be acting justly and in a manner worthy of his wisdom, if he should come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> and salute <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>. Theudis, however, although he carried out all the commands of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> and never failed to send in the annual tribute, would not consent to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, nor would he promise those who had written to him that he would do so.</p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg4029.tlg001:5.13.1'><b>&sect; 5.13.1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;After <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> had departed from the world, [526 A.D.] the Franks, now that there was no longer anyone to oppose them, took the field against the Thuringians, and not only killed their leader Hermenefridus but also reduced to subjection the entire people. But the wife of Hermenefridus took her children and secretly made her escape, coming to <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a>, her brother, who was at that time ruling over the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. After this the Germans made an attack upon the Burgundians who had survived the former war, and defeating them in battle confined their leader in one of the fortresses of the country and kept him under guard, while they reduced the people to subjection and compelled them, as prisoners of war, to march with them from that time forth against their enemies, and the whole land which the Burgundians had previously inhabited they made subject and tributary to themselves. And Amalaric, who was ruling over the <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a>, upon coming to man's estate, became thoroughly frightened at the power of the Germans and so took to wife the sister of Theudibert, ruler of the Germans, and divided Gaul with the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and his cousin Atalaric. The <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, namely, received as their portion the land to the east of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437046WRho class=place long=4.5989 lat=43.6544>Rhone</a> River, while that to the west fell under the control of the <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a>. And it was agreed that the tribute which <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> had imposed should no longer be paid to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, and Atalaric honestly and justly restored to Amalaric all the money which he had taken from the city of Carcasiana. Then, since these two nations had united with one another by intermarriage, they allowed each man who had espoused a wife of the other people to choose whether he wished to follow his wife, or bring her among his own people. And there were many who led their wives to the people they preferred and many also who were led by their wives. But later on Amalaric, having given offence to his wife's brother, suffered a great calamity. For while his wife was of the orthodox faith, he himself followed the heresy of <a href=/people/1934 target=_blank>Arius</a>, and he would not allow her to hold to her customary beliefs or to perform the rites of religion according to the tradition of her fathers, and, furthermore, because she was unwilling to conform to his customs, he held her in great dishonour. And since the woman was unable to bear this, she disclosed the whole matter to her brother. For this reason, then, the Germans and <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a> entered into war with each other. [531 A.D.] And the battle which took place was for a long time very stoutly contested, but finally Amalaric was defeated, losing many of his men, and was himself slain. And Theudibert took his sister with all the money, and as much of Gaul as the <a href=/people/12071 target=_blank>Visigoths</a> held as their portion. And the survivors of the vanquished emigrated from Gaul with their wives and children and went to Theudis in Spain, who was already acting the tyrant openly. Thus did the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and Germans gain possession of Gaul. <br />But at a later time <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a>, the ruler of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, upon learning that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, made a compact with the Germans, in which it was agreed that the Germans should have that portion of Gaul which fell to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, and should receive twenty centenaria of gold, and that in return they should assist the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> in this war. But before he had as yet carried out the agreement he fulfilled his destiny.[526 A.D.] It was for this reason, then, that many of the noblest of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, with Marcias as their leader, were keeping guard in Gaul. It was these men whom <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> was unable to recall from Gaul, and indeed he did not think them numerous enough even to oppose the Franks, who would, in all probability, overrun both Gaul and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, if he should march with his whole army against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. He therefore called together all who were loyal among the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and spoke as follows: <br />The advice which I have wished to give you, fellow-countrymen, in bringing you together here at the present time, is not pleasant, but it is necessary; and do you hear me kindly, and deliberate in a manner befitting the situation which is upon us. For when affairs do not go as men wish, it is inexpedient for them to go on with their present arrangements in disregard of necessity or fortune. Now in all other respects our preparations for war are in the best possible state. But the Franks are an obstacle to us; against them, our ancient enemies, we have indeed been spending both our lives and our money, but nevertheless we have succeeded in holding our own up to the present time, since no other hostile force has confronted us. But now that we are compelled to go against another foe, it will be necessary to put an end to the war against them, in the first place because, if they remain hostile to us, they will certainly array themselves with <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> against us; for those who have the same enemy are by the very nature of things induced to enter into friendship and alliance with each other. In the second place, even if we carry on the war separately against each army, we shall in the end be defeated by both of them. It is better, therefore, for us to accept a little loss and thus preserve the greatest part of our kingdom, than in our eagerness to hold everything to be destroyed by the enemy and lose at the same time the whole power of our supremacy. So my opinion is that if we give the Germans the provinces of Gaul which adjoin them, and together with this land all the money which <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> agreed to give them, they will not only be turned from their enmity against us, but will even lend us assistance in this war. But as to how at a later time, when matters are going well for us, we may regain possession of Gaul, let no one of you consider this question. For an ancient saying comes to my mind, which bids us 'settle well the affairs of the present.' <br />Upon hearing this speech the notables of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, considering the plan advantageous, wished it to be put into effect. Accordingly envoys were immediately sent to the nation of the Germans, in order to give them the lands of Gaul together with the gold, and to make an offensive and defensive alliance. Now at that time the rulers of the Franks were Ildibert, Theudibert, and Cloadarius, and they received Gaul and the money, and divided the land among them according to the territory ruled by each one, and they agreed to be exceedingly friendly to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, and secretly to send them auxiliary troops, not Franks, however, but soldiers drawn from the nations subject to them. For they were unable to make an alliance with them openly against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, because they had a little before agreed to assist the emperor in this war. So the envoys, having accomplished the mission on which they had been sent, returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>. At that time also <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> summoned Marcias with his followers.</p>                        </div>

And more than any other Silverius, the chief priest of the city, urged them to adopt this course. So they sent Fidelius, a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Milan</a>, which is situated in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=place long=8.3 lat=44.3>Liguria</a>, a man who had been previously an adviser of Atalaric (such an official is called quaestor by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>), and invited <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> to come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, promising to put the city into his hands without a battle. So <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> led his army from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPLa class=place long=12.5023 lat=41.8766>Via Latina</a>, leaving on the left the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPAp class=place long=12.5016 lat=41.8734>Appian Way</a>, which <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, the consul of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, had made nine hundred years before and to which he had given his name. <br />Now the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPAp class=place long=12.5016 lat=41.8734>Appian Way</a> is in length a journey of five days for an unencumbered traveller; for it extends from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>. And the breadth of this road is such that two waggons going in opposite directions can pass one another, and it is one of the noteworthy sights of the world. For all the stone, which is mill-stone and hard by nature, <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> quarried in another place far away and brought there; for it is not found anywhere in this district. And after working these stones until they were smooth and flat, and cutting them to a polygonal shape, he fastened them together without putting concrete or anything else between them. And they were fastened together so securely and the joints were so firmly closed, that they give the appearance, when one looks at them, not of being fitted together, but of having grown together. And after the passage of so long a time, and after being traversed by many waggons and all kinds of animals every day, they have neither separated at all at the joints, nor has any one of the stones been worn out or reduced in thickness, — nay, they have not even lost any of their polish. Such, then, is the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPAp class=place long=12.5016 lat=41.8734>Appian Way</a>. <br />But as for the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> who were keeping guard in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, it was not until they learned that the enemy were very near and became aware of the decision of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, that they began to be concerned for the city, and, being unable to meet the attacking army in battle, they were at a loss; but later, with the permission of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, they all departed thence and proceeded to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, except that Leuderis, who commanded them, being ashamed, I suppose, because of the situation in which he found himself, remained there. And it so happened on that day that at the very same time when <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and the emperor's army were entering <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> through the gate which they call the Asinarian Gate, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were withdrawing from the city through another gate which bears the name <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPFl class=place long=12.4759 lat=41.9115>Flaminian</a>; and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> became subject to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> again after a space of sixty years, on the ninth day of the last month, which is called December by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, in the eleventh year of the reign of the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>. [536 A.D.] Now <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> sent Leuderis, the commander of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, and the keys of the gates to the emperor, but he himself turned his attention to the circuit-wall, which had fallen into ruin in many places; and he constructed each merlon of the battlement with a wing, adding a sort of flanking wall on the left side, in order that those fighting from the battlement against their assailants might never be hit by missiles thrown by those storming the wall on their left; and he also dug a moat about the wall of sufficient depth to form a very important part of the defences. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> applauded the forethought of the general and especially the experience displayed in the matter of the battlement; but they marvelled greatly and were vexed that he should have thought it possible for him to enter <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> if he had any idea that he would be besieged, for it cannot possibly endure a siege because it cannot be supplied with provisions, since it is not on the sea, is enclosed by a wall of so huge a circumference, and, above all, lying as it does in a very level plain, is naturally exceedingly easy of access for its assailants. But although <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> heard all these criticisms, he nevertheless continued to make all his preparations for a siege, and the grain which he had in his ships when he came from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> he stored in public granaries and kept under guard, and he compelled all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, indignant though they were, to bring all their provisions in from the country.</p>                        </div>

For the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> who were settled on the other side of the river were neither willing to follow Pitzas nor to be subjects of the emperor. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> gave him a small number of soldiers to help him guard that territory. And before this the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=ethnic long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabrians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=41>Apulians</a>, since no <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were present in their land, had willingly submitted themselves to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, both those on the coast and those who held the interior. <br />Among the interior towns is Beneventus, which in ancient times the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had named Maleventus, but now they call it Beneventus, avoiding the evil omen of the former name, ventus having the meaning wind in the Latin tongue. For in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a>, which lies across from this city on the opposite mainland, a wind of great violence and exceedingly wild is wont to fall upon the country, and when this begins to blow, it is impossible to find a man there who continues to travel on the road, but all shut themselves up at home and wait. Such, indeed, is the force of the wind that it seizes a man on horseback together with his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and carries him through the air, and then, after whirling him about in the air to a great distance, it throws him down wherever he may chance to be and kills him. And it so happens that Beneventus, being opposite to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a>, as I have said, and situated on rather high ground, gets some of the disadvantage of this same wind. This city was built of old by <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a>, the son of <a href=/people/183 target=_blank>Tydeus</a>, when after the capture of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> he was repulsed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>. And he left to the city as a token the tusks of the <a href=/people/12346 target=_blank>Calydonian Boar</a>, which his uncle <a href=/people/315 target=_blank>Meleager</a> had received as a prize of the hunt, and they are there even up to my time, a noteworthy sight and well worth seeing, measuring not less than three spans around and having the form of a crescent. There, too, they say that <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> met <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, the son of <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a>, when he was coming from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a>, and in obedience to the oracle gave him the statue of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> which he had seized as plunder in company with <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, when the two went into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> as spies before the city was captured by the Greeks. For they tell the story that when he fell sick at a later time, and made enquiry concerning the disease, the oracle responded that he would never be freed from his malady unless he should give this statue to a man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. And as to where in the world the statue itself is, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> say they do not know, but even up to my time they shew a copy of it chiselled on a certain stone in the temple of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, where it lies before the bronze statue of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, which is set up under the open sky in the eastern part of the temple. And this copy on the stone represents a female figure in the pose of a warrior and extending her spear as if for combat; but in spite of this she has a chiton reaching to the feet. But the face does not resemble the Greek statues of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, but is altogether like the work of the ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Aegyptians</a>. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=ethnic long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantines</a>, however, say that the Emperor <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a> dug up this statue in the forum which bears his name and set it there. So much, then, for this. <br />In this way <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> won over the whole of that part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> which is south of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a>, as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413148RSam class=place long=14.8 lat=41.3>Samnium</a>, and the territory north of the gulf, as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440154RLib class=place long=15.4 lat=44>Liburnia</a>, had been gained by <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantianus</a>, as has been said. But I shall now explain how <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> is divided among the inhabitants of the land. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421170WAdr class=place long=16.95 lat=42.09>Adriatic</a> Sea sends out a kind of outlet far into the continent and thus forms the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a>, but it does not, as in other places where the sea enters the mainland, form an isthmus at its end. For example, the so-called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384224WKri class=place long=22.44 lat=38.39>Crisaean Gulf</a>, ending at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229HLec class=place long=22.8788 lat=37.931>Lechaeum</a>, where the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a> is, forms the isthmus of that city, about forty stades in breadth; and the gulf off the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>, which they call the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406265WMel class=place long=26.46 lat=40.55>Black Gulf</a>, makes the isthmus at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403265LChe class=place long=26.5 lat=40.3333>Chersonese</a> no broader than the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a>, but of about the same size. But from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, where the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a> ends, to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscan</a> Sea is not less than eight days' journey for an unencumbered traveller. And the reason is that the arm of the sea, as it advances, always inclines very far to the right. And below this gulf the first town is <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a>, which is now called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Hydrus</a>. And on the right of this are the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=ethnic long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabrians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=41>Apulians</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413148RSam class=ethnic long=14.8 lat=41.3>Samnites</a>, and next to them dwell the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=ethnic long=13.5 lat=43>Piceni</a>, whose territory extends as far as the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>. And on the other side are the remainder of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=ethnic long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabrians</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392165RBre class=ethnic long=16.5 lat=39.2>Bruttii</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=ethnic long=16 lat=40.4>Lucani</a>, beyond whom dwell the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=ethnic long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campani</a> as far as the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413133UTar class=place long=13.2486 lat=41.292>Taracina</a>, and their territory is adjoined by that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. These peoples hold the shores of the two seas, and all the interior of that part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. And this is the country called <a href=/people/12078 target=_blank>Magna Graecia</a> in former times. For among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392165RBre class=ethnic long=16.5 lat=39.2>Bruttii</a> are the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382162PLoc class=ethnic long=16.229 lat=38.216>Epizephyrian Locrians</a> and the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391171PCro class=place long=17.129 lat=39.081>Croton</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397164PTho class=place long=16.49 lat=39.716>Thurii</a>. But north of the gulf the first inhabitants are Greeks, called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=ethnic long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirotes</a>, as far as the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413194PEpi class=place long=19.4449 lat=41.3164>Epidamnus</a>, which is situated on the sea. And adjoining this is the land of Precalis, beyond which is the territory called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a>, all of which is counted as part of the western empire. And beyond that point is <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440154RLib class=place long=15.4 lat=44>Liburnia</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450139RHis class=place long=13.9 lat=45>Istria</a>, and the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/457120REne class=ethnic long=12.01 lat=45.7>Veneti</a> extending to the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>. These countries are situated on the sea in that region. But above them are the Siscii and <a href=/people/11067 target=_blank>Suevi</a> (not those who are subjects of the Franks, but another group), who inhabit the interior. And beyond these are settled the Carnii and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/470150RNor class=ethnic long=15 lat=47>Norici</a>. On the right of these dwell the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=ethnic long=25 lat=44.5>Dacians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=ethnic long=19 lat=45>Pannonians</a>, who hold a number of towns, including <a about=https://topostext.org/place/448205USin class=place long=20.4504 lat=44.8235>Singidunum</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450196USir class=place long=19.6102 lat=44.9666>Sirmium</a>, and extend as far as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> River. Now these peoples north of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a> were ruled by the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> at the beginning of this war, but beyond the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> on the left of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450120WEri class=place long=12.0293 lat=44.9753>Padus</a> the country was inhabited by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=ethnic long=8.3 lat=44.3>Ligurians</a>. And to the north of them live the Albani in an exceedingly good land called Langovilla, and beyond these are the nations subject to the Franks, while the country to the west is held by the Gauls and after them the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390000RIbe class=ethnic long=-4 lat=39>Spaniards</a>. On the right of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450120WEri class=place long=12.0293 lat=44.9753>Padus</a> are <a href=/people/2704 target=_blank>Aemilia</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscan</a> peoples, which extend as far as the boundaries of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>.

And when all had been settled by him in the best possible manner, he gave to Constantinus a large number of his own guards together with many spearmen, including the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a> Zarter, Chorsomanus, and Aeschmanus, and an army besides, commanding him to go into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscia</a>, in order to win over the towns of that region. And he gave orders to <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> to take possession of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425125UNeq class=place long=12.5156 lat=42.5176>Narnia</a>, a very strong city in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscia</a>. Now this <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> was a <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goth</a> by birth, one of those who had dwelt in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> from of old and had not followed <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> when he led the Gothic nation thence into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and he was an energetic man and a capable warrior. For he was both a general of the first rank, and a skilful man in action. And <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> took <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425125UNeq class=place long=12.5156 lat=42.5176>Narnia</a> not at all against the will of the inhabitants, and Constantinus won over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a> and certain other towns without any trouble. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscans</a> received him into their cities willingly. So after establishing a garrison in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a>, he himself remained quietly with his army in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a>, the first city in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscia</a>. <br />Now when <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> heard this, he sent against them an army with Unilas and Pissas as its commanders. And Constantinus confronted these troops in the outskirts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a> and engaged with them. The battle was at first evenly disputed, since the barbarians were superior in numbers, but afterwards the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> by their valour gained the upper hand and routed the enemy, and while they were fleeing in complete disorder the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> killed almost all of them; and they captured alive the commanders of the enemy and sent them to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. Now when <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> heard this, he was no longer willing to remain quietly in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, where he was embarrassed by the absence of Marcias and his men, who had not yet come from Gaul. So he sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a> a great army with Asinarius and Uligisalus as its commanders, in order to recover <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a> for the Gothic rule. And he directed them to add to their own troops an army from the land of the <a href=/people/11067 target=_blank>Suevi</a>, composed of the barbarians there, and then to proceed directly to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435165USal class=place long=16.4834 lat=43.5397>Salones</a>. And he also sent with them many ships of war, in order that they might be able to besiege <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435165USal class=place long=16.4834 lat=43.5397>Salones</a> both by land and by sea. But he himself was hastening to go with his whole army against <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, leading against him horsemen and infantry to the number of not less than one hundred and fifty thousand, and the most of them as well as their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> were clad in armour. <br />So Asinarius, upon reaching the country of the <a href=/people/11067 target=_blank>Suevi</a>, began to gather the army of the barbarians, while Uligisalus alone led the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440154RLib class=place long=15.4 lat=44>Liburnia</a>. And when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> engaged with them at a place called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/438159USca class=place long=15.923 lat=43.8179>Scardon</a>, they were defeated in the battle and retired to the city of <a href=/people/9040 target=_blank>Burnus</a>; and there Uligisalus awaited his colleague. But <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantianus</a>, upon hearing of the preparations of Asinarius, became afraid for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435165USal class=place long=16.4834 lat=43.5397>Salones</a>, and summoned the soldiers who were holding all the fortresses in that region. He then dug a moat around the whole circuit-wall and made all the other preparations for the siege in the best manner possible. And Asinarius, after gathering an exceedingly large army of barbarians, came to the city of <a href=/people/9040 target=_blank>Burnus</a>. There he joined Uligisalus and the Gothic army and proceeded to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435165USal class=place long=16.4834 lat=43.5397>Salones</a>. And they made a stockade about the circuit-wall, and also, filling their ships with soldiers, kept guard over the side of the fortifications which faced the sea. In this manner they proceeded to besiege <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435165USal class=place long=16.4834 lat=43.5397>Salones</a> both by land and by sea; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> suddenly made an attack upon the ships of the enemy and turned them to flight, and many of them they sunk, men and all, and also captured many without their crews. However, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> did not raise the siege, but maintained it vigorously and kept the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> still more closely confined to the city than before. Such, then, were the fortunes of the Roman and Gothic armies in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a>. <br />But <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, upon hearing from the natives who came from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> that the army which <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had was very small, began to repent of his withdrawal from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and was no longer able to endure the situation, but was now so carried away by fury that he advanced against them. And on his way thither he fell in with a priest who was coming from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. Whereupon they say that <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> in great excitement enquired of this man whether <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was still in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, shewing that he was afraid he would not be able to catch him, but that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> would forestall him by running away. But the priest, they say, replied that he need not be at all concerned about that; for he, the priest, was able to guarantee that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> would never resort to flight, but was remaining where he was. But <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, they say, kept hastening still more than before, praying that he might see with his own eyes the walls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> before <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> made his escape from the city.</p>                        </div>

For he was unwilling, on the one hand, to dispense with the troops of Constantinus and <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a>, especially since his army was exceedingly small, and, on the other, it seemed to him inexpedient to abandon the strongholds in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscia</a>, lest the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> should hold these as fortresses against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. So after considering the matter he sent word to Constantinus and <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> to leave garrisons in the positions which absolutely required them, large enough to guard them, while they themselves with the rest of the army should come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> with all speed. And Constantinus acted accordingly. For he established garrisons in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a>, and with all the rest of his troops marched off to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. But while <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a>, in a more leisurely manner, was making his dispositions in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425125UNeq class=place long=12.5156 lat=42.5176>Narnia</a>, it so happened that, since the enemy were passing that way, the plains in the outskirts of the city were filled with <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. These were an advance guard preceding the rest of the army; and <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> engaged with them and unexpectedly routed those whom he encountered and killed many; but then, since he was overpowered by their superior numbers, he retired into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425125UNeq class=place long=12.5156 lat=42.5176>Narnia</a>. And leaving a garrison there according to the instructions of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, he went with all speed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and reported that the enemy would be at hand almost instantly. For <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425125UNeq class=place long=12.5156 lat=42.5176>Narnia</a> is only three hundred and fifty stades distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. But <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> made no attempt at all to capture <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a>; for these places are exceedingly strong and he was quite unwilling that his time should be wasted there, his one desire having come to be to find <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> not yet fled from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. Moreover, even when he learned that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425125UNeq class=place long=12.5156 lat=42.5176>Narnia</a> also was held by the enemy, he was unwilling to attempt anything there, knowing that the place was difficult of access and on steep ground besides; for it is situated on a lofty hill. And the river Narnus flows by the foot of the hill, and it is this which has given the city its name. There are two roads leading up to the city, the one on the east, and the other on the west. One of these is very narrow and difficult by reason of precipitous rocks, while the other cannot be reached except by way of the bridge which spans the river and provides a passage over it at that point. This bridge was built by Caesar <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> in early times, and is a very noteworthy sight; for its arches are the highest of any known to us. <br />So <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, not enduring to have his time wasted there, departed thence with all speed and went with the whole army against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, making the journey through <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabine</a> territory. [537 A.D.] And when he drew near to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and was not more than fourteen stades away from it, he came upon a bridge over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> River. There a little while before <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had built a tower, furnished it with gates, and stationed in it a guard of soldiers, not because this is the only point at which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> could be crossed by the enemy (for there are both boats and bridges at many places along the river), but because he wished the enemy to have to spend more time in the journey, since he was expecting another army from the emperor, and also in order that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> might bring in still more provisions. For if the barbarians, repulsed at that point, should try to cross on a bridge somewhere else, he thought that not less than twenty days would be consumed by them, and if they wished to launch boats in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> to the necessary number, a still longer time would probably be wasted by them. These, then, were the considerations which led him to establish the garrison at that point; and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> bivouacked there that day, being at a loss and supposing that they would be obliged to storm the tower on the following day; but twenty-two deserters came to them, men who were barbarians by race but Roman soldiers, from the cavalry troop commanded by <a href=/people/9574 target=_blank>Innocentius</a>. Just at that time it occurred to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> to establish a camp near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> River, in order that they might hinder still more the crossing of the enemy and make some kind of a display of their own daring to their opponents. But all the soldiers who, as has been stated, were keeping guard at the bridge, being overcome with terror at the throng of <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and quailing at the magnitude of their danger, abandoned by night the tower they were guarding and rushed off in flight. But thinking that they could not enter <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, they stealthily marched off toward <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>, either because they were afraid of the punishment the general would inflict or because they were ashamed to appear before their comrades.</p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, who had not as yet learned what had happened to the garrison, was bringing up a thousand horsemen to the bridge over the river, in order to look over the ground and decide where it would be best for his forces to make camp. But when they had come rather close, they met the enemy already across the river, and not at all willingly they engaged with some of them. And the battle was carried on by horsemen on both sides. Then <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, though he was safe before, would no longer keep the general's post, but began to fight in the front ranks like a soldier; and consequently the cause of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> was thrown into great danger, for the whole decision of the war rested with him. But it happened that the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> he was riding at that time was unusually experienced in warfare and knew well how to save his rider; and his whole body was dark grey, except that his face from the top of his head to the nostrils was the purest white. Such a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> the Greeks call phalius and the barbarians balan. And it so happened that the most of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> threw their javelins and other missiles at him and at <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> for the following reason. Those deserters who on the previous day had come to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, when they saw <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> fighting in the front ranks, knowing well that, if he should fall, the cause of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> would be ruined instantly, cried aloud urging them to shoot at the white-faced <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. Consequently this saying was passed around and reached the whole Gothic army, and they did not question it at all, since they were in a great tumult of fighting, nor did they know clearly that it referred to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. But conjecturing that it was not by mere accident that the saying had gained such currency as to reach all, the most of them, neglecting all others, began to shoot at <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. And every man among them who laid any claim to valour was immediately possessed with a great eagerness to win honour, and getting as close as possible they kept trying to lay hold of him and in a great fury kept striking with their spears and swords. But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> himself, turning from side to side, kept killing as they came those who encountered him, and he also profited very greatly by the loyalty of his own spearmen and guards in this moment of danger. For they all surrounded him and made a display of valour such, I imagine, as has never been shewn by any man in the world to this day; for, holding out their shields in defence of both the general and his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, they not only received all the missiles, but also forced back and beat off those who from time to time assailed him. And thus the whole engagement was centred about the body of one man. In this struggle there fell among the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> no fewer than a thousand, and they were men who fought in the front ranks; and of the household of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> many of the noblest were slain, and <a href=/people/2896 target=_blank>Maxentius</a>, the spearman, after making a display of great exploits against the enemy. But by some chance <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was neither wounded nor hit by a missile on that day, although the battle was waged around him alone. <br />Finally by their valour the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> turned the enemy to flight, and an exceedingly great multitude of barbarians fled until they reached their main army. For there the Gothic infantry, being entirely fresh, withstood their enemy and forced them back without any trouble. And when another body of cavalry in turn reinforced the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> fled at top speed until they reached a certain hill, which they climbed, and there held their position. But the enemy's horsemen were upon them directly, and a second cavalry battle took place. There <a href=/people/3712 target=_blank>Valentinus</a>, the groom of <a href=/people/6809 target=_blank>Photius</a>, the son of Antonina, made a remarkable exhibition of valour. For by leaping alone into the throng of the enemy he opposed himself to the onrush of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and thus saved his companions. In this way the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> escaped, and arrived at the fortifications of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and the barbarians in pursuit pressed upon them as far as the wall by the gate which has been named the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPSa class=place long=12.4985 lat=41.9107>Salarian</a> Gate. But the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, fearing lest the enemy should rush in together with the fugitives and thus get inside the fortifications, were quite unwilling to open the gates, although <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> urged them again and again and called upon them with threats to do so. For, on the one hand, those who peered out of the tower were unable to recognise the man, for his face and his whole head were covered with gore and dust, and at the same time no one was able to see very clearly, either; for it was late in the day, about sunset. Moreover, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had no reason to suppose that the general survived; for those who had come in flight from the rout which had taken place earlier reported that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had died fighting bravely in the front ranks. So the throng of the enemy, which had rushed up in strength and possessed with great fury, were purposing to cross the moat straightway and attack the fugitives there; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, finding themselves massed along the wall, after they had come inside the moat, and so close together that they touched one another, were being crowded into a small space. Those inside the fortifications, however, since they were without a general and altogether unprepared, and being in a panic of fear for themselves and for the city, were quite unable to defend their own men, although these were now in so perilous a situation. <br />Then a daring thought came to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, which unexpectedly saved the day for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. For urging on all his men he suddenly fell upon the enemy. And they, even before this, had been in great disorder because of the darkness and the fact that they were making a pursuit, and now when, much to their surprise, they saw the fugitives attacking them, they supposed that another army also had come to their assistance from the city, and so were thrown into a great panic and all fled immediately at top speed. But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> by no means rushed out to pursue them, but returned straightway to the wall. And at this the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> took courage and received him and all his men into the city. So narrowly did <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and the emperor's cause escape peril; and the battle which had begun early in the morning did not end until night. And those who distinguished themselves above all others by their valour in this battle were, among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, and among the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, Visandus <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandalarius</a>, who had fallen upon <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> at the first when the battle took place about him, and did not desist until he had received thirteen wounds on his body and fell. And since he was supposed to have died immediately, he was not cared for by his companions, although they were victorious, and he lay there with the dead. But on the third day, when the barbarians had made camp hard by the circuit-wall of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and had sent some men in order to bury their dead and to perform the customary rites of burial, those who were searching out the bodies of the fallen found Visandus <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandalarius</a> with life still in him, and one of his companions entreated him to speak some word to him. But he could not do even this, for the inside of his body was on fire because of the lack of food and the thirst caused by his suffering, and so he nodded to him to put water into his mouth. Then when he had drunk and become himself again, they lifted and carried him to the camp. And Visandus <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandalarius</a> won a great name for this deed among the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, and he lived on a very considerable time, enjoying the greatest renown. This, then, took place on the third day after the battle. <br />But at that time <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, after reaching safety with his followers, gathered the soldiers and almost the whole Roman populace to the wall, and commanded them to burn many fires and keep watch throughout the whole night. And going about the circuit of the fortifications, he set everything in order and put one of his commanders in charge of each gate. But <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a>, who took command of the guard at the gate called the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPPn class=place long=12.5152 lat=41.8914>Praenestine</a>, sent a messenger to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> with orders to say that the city was held by the enemy, who had broken in through another gate which is across the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> River and bears the name of Pancratius, a holy man. And all those who were in the company of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, upon hearing this, urged him to save himself as quickly as possible through some other gate. He, however, neither became panic-stricken, nor did he hesitate to declare that the report was false. And he also sent some of his horsemen across the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> with all speed, and they, after looking over the ground there, brought back word that no hostile attack had been made on the city in that quarter. He therefore sent immediately to each gate and instructed the commanders everywhere that, whenever they heard that the enemy had broken in at any other part of the fortifications, they should not try to assist in the defence nor abandon their post, but should remain quiet; for he himself would take care of such matters. And he did this in order that they might not be thrown into disorder a second time by a rumour which was not true. <br />But <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were still in great confusion, sent to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPSa class=place long=12.4985 lat=41.9107>Salarian Gate</a> one of his commanders, Vacis by name, a man of no mean station. And when he had arrived there, he began to reproach the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> for their faithlessness to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and upbraided them for the treason which he said they had committed against both their fatherland and themselves, for they had exchanged the power of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> for Greeks who were not able to defend them, although they had never before seen any men of the Greek race come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> except actors of tragedy and mimes and thieving sailors. Such words and many like them were spoken by Vacis, but since no one replied to him, he returned to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>. As for <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, he brought upon himself much ridicule on the part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, for though he had barely escaped from the enemy, he bade them take courage thenceforth and look with contempt upon the barbarians; for he knew well, he said, that he would conquer them decisively. Now the manner in which he had come to know this with certainty will be told in the following narrative. At length, when it was well on in the night, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, who had been fasting up to this time, was with difficulty compelled by his wife and those of his friends who were present to taste a very little bread. Thus, then, the two armies passed this night.</p>                        </div>

Now the wall of the city has fourteen large gates and several smaller ones. And the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, being unable with their entire army to envelop the wall on every side, made six fortified camps from which they harassed the portion of the wall containing five gates, from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPFl class=place long=12.4759 lat=41.9115>Flaminian</a> as far as the one called the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPPn class=place long=12.5152 lat=41.8914>Praenestine Gate</a>; and all these camps were made by them on the left bank of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> River. Wherefore the barbarians feared lest their enemy, by destroying the bridge which bears the name of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BBMi class=place long=12.4671 lat=41.9352>Mulvius</a>, should render inaccessible to them all the land on the right bank of the river as far as the sea, and in this way have not the slightest experience of the evils of a siege, and so they fixed a seventh camp across the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> in the Plain of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, in order that the bridge might be between their two armies. So in this way two other gates came to be exposed to the attacks of the enemy, the <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> (which is now named after Peter, the chief of the Apostles of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, since he lies not far from there) and the Transtiburtine Gate. Thus the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> surrounded only about one-half of the wall with their army, but since they were in no direction wholly shut off from the wall by the river, they made attacks upon it throughout its whole extent whenever they wished. <br />Now the way the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> came to build the city-wall on both sides of the river I shall now proceed to tell. In ancient times the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> used to flow alongside the circuit-wall for a considerable distance, even at the place where it is now enclosed. But this ground, on which the wall rises along the stream of the river, is flat and very accessible. And opposite this flat ground, across the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, it happens that there is a great <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LJan class=place long=12.4608 lat=41.8913>hill</a> where all the mills of the city have been built from of old, because much water is brought by an aqueduct to the crest of the hill, and rushes thence down the incline with great force. For this reason the ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> determined to surround the hill and the river bank near it with a wall, so that it might never be possible for an enemy to destroy the mills, and crossing the river, to carry on operations with ease against the circuit-wall of the city. So they decided to span the river at this point with a bridge, and to attach it to the wall; and by building many houses in the district across the river they caused the stream of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> to be in the middle of the city. So much then for this. <br />And the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> dug deep trenches about all their camps, and heaped up the earth, which they took out from them, on the inner side of the trenches, making this bank exceedingly high, and they planted great numbers of sharp stakes on the top, thus making all their camps in no way inferior to fortified strongholds. And the camp in the Plain of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> was commanded by Marcias (for he had by now arrived from Gaul with his followers, with whom he was encamped there), and the rest of the camps were commanded by <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> with five others; for there was one commander for each camp. So the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, having taken their positions in this way, tore open all the aqueducts, so that no water at all might enter the city from them. Now the aqueducts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> are fourteen in number, and were made of baked brick by the men of old, being of such breadth and height that it is possible for a man on horseback to ride in them. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> arranged for the defence of the city in the following manner. He himself held the small <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPPi class=place long=12.4883 lat=41.9094>Pincian Gate</a> and the gate next to this on the right, which is named the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPSa class=place long=12.4985 lat=41.9107>Salarian</a>. For at these gates the circuit-wall was assailable, and at the same time it was possible for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> to go out from them against the enemy. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPPn class=place long=12.5152 lat=41.8914>Praenestine Gate</a> he gave to <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a>. And at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPFl class=place long=12.4759 lat=41.9115>Flaminian</a>, which is on the other side of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPPi class=place long=12.4883 lat=41.9094>Pincian</a>, he put Constantinus in command, having previously closed the gates and blocked them up most securely by building a wall of great stones on the inside, so that it might be impossible for anyone to open them. For since one of the camps was very near, he feared least some secret plot against the city should be made there by the enemy. And the remaining gates he ordered the commanders of the infantry forces to keep under guard. And he closed each of the aqueducts as securely as possible by filling their channels with masonry for a considerable distance, to prevent anyone from entering through them from the outside to do mischief. <br />But after the aqueducts had been broken open, as I have stated, the water no longer worked the mills, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were quite unable to operate them with any kind of animals owing to the scarcity of all food in time of siege; indeed they were scarcely able to provide for the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> which were indispensable to them. And so <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> hit upon the following device. Just below the bridge which I lately mentioned as being connected with the circuit-wall, he fastened ropes from the two banks of the river and stretched them as tight as he could, and then attached to them two boats side by side and two feet apart, where the flow of the water comes down from the arch of the bridge with the greatest force, and placing two mills on either boat, he hung between them the mechanism by which mills are customarily turned. And below these he fastened other boats, each attached to the one next behind in order, and he set the water-wheels between them in the same manner for a great distance. So by the force of the flowing water all the wheels, one after the other, were made to revolve independently, and thus they worked the mills with which they were connected and ground sufficient flour for the city. Now when the enemy learned this from the deserters, they destroyed the wheels in the following manner. They gathered large trees and bodies of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> newly slain and kept throwing them into the river; and the most of these were carried with the current between the boats and broke off the mill-wheels. But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, observing what was being done, contrived the following device against it. He fastened above the bridge long iron chains, which reached completely across the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>. All the objects which the river brought down struck upon these chains, and gathered there and went no farther. And those to whom this work was assigned kept pulling out these objects as they came and bore them to the land. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> did this, not so much on account of the mills, as because he began to think with alarm that the enemy might get inside the bridge at this point with many boats and be in the middle of the city before their presence became known. Thus the barbarians abandoned the attempt, since they met with no success in it. And thereafter the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> continued to use these mills; but they were entirely excluded from the baths because of the scarcity of water. However, they had sufficient water to drink, since even for those who lived very far from the river it was possible to draw water from wells. But as for the sewers, which carry out from the city whatever is unclean, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was not forced to devise any plan of safety, for they all discharge into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> River, and therefore it was impossible for any plot to be made against the city by the enemy in connection with them.</p>                        </div>

And among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413148RSam class=ethnic long=14.8 lat=41.3>Samnites</a> a large company of children, who were pasturing flocks in their own country, chose out two among them who were well favoured in strength of body, and calling one of them by the name of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, and naming the other <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, bade them wrestle. And they entered into the struggle with the greatest vehemence and it so fell out that the one who impersonated <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> was thrown. Then the crowd of boys in play hung him to a tree. But a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> by some chance appeared there, whereupon the boys all fled, and the one called <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, who was suspended from the tree, remained for some time suffering this punishment and then died. And when this became known to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413148RSam class=ethnic long=14.8 lat=41.3>Samnites</a>, they did not inflict any punishment upon these children, but divining the meaning of the incident declared that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> would conquer decisively. So much for this. <br />But the populace of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> were entirely unacquainted with the evils of war and siege. When, therefore, they began to be distressed by their inability to bathe and the scarcity of provisions, and found themselves obliged to forgo sleep in guarding the circuit-wall, and suspected that the city would be captured at no distant date; and when, at the same time, they saw the enemy plundering their fields and other possessions, they began to be dissatisfied and indignant that they, who had done no wrong, should suffer siege and be brought into peril of such magnitude. And gathering in groups by themselves, they railed openly against <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, on the ground that he had dared to take the field against the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> before he had received an adequate force from the emperor. And these reproaches against <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> were secretly indulged in also by the members of the council which they call the senate. And <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, hearing all this from the deserters and desiring to embroil them with one another still more, and thinking that in this way the affairs of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> would be thrown into great confusion, sent to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> some envoys, among whom was <a about=https://topostext.org/place/535100WAlb class=place long=10 lat=53.4726>Albis</a>. And when these men came before <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, they spoke as follows in the presence of the Roman senators and all the commanders of the army: <br />From of old, general, mankind has made true and proper distinctions in the names they give to things; and one of these distinctions is this — rashness is different from bravery. For rashness, when it takes possession of a man, brings him into danger with discredit, but bravery bestows upon him an adequate prize in reputation for valour. Now one of these two has brought you against us, but which it is you will straightway make clear. For if, on the one hand, you placed your confidence in bravery when you took the field against the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, there is ample opportunity, noble sir, for you to do the deeds of a brave man, since you have only to look down from your wall to see the army of the enemy; but if, on the other hand, it was because you were possessed by rashness that you came to attack us, certainly you now repent you of the reckless undertaking. For the opinions of those who have made a desperate venture are wont to undergo a change whenever they find themselves in serious straits. Now, therefore, do not cause the sufferings of these <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> to be prolonged any further, men whom <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> fostered in a life not only of soft luxury but also of freedom, and cease your resistance to him who is the master both of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>. Is it not monstrous that you should sit in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> hemmed in as you are and in abject terror of the enemy, while the king of this city passes his time in a fortified camp and inflicts the evils of war upon his own subjects? But we shall give both you and your followers an opportunity to take your departure forthwith in security, retaining all your possessions. For to trample upon those who have learned to take a new view of prudence we consider neither holy nor worthy of the ways of men. And, further, we should gladly ask these <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> what complaints they could have had against the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> that they betrayed both us and themselves, seeing that up to this time they have enjoyed our kindness, and now are acquainted by experience with the assistance to be expected from you. <br />Thus spoke the envoys. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> replied as follows: It is not to rest with you to choose the moment for conference. For men are by no means wont to wage war according to the judgment of their enemies, but it is customary for each one to arrange his own affairs for himself, in whatever manner seems to him best. But I say to you that there will come a time when you will want to hide your heads under the thistles but will find no shelter anywhere. As for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, moreover, which we have captured, in holding it we hold nothing which belongs to others, but it was you who trespassed upon this city in former times, though it did not belong to you at all, and now you have given it back, however unwillingly, to its ancient possessors. And whoever of you has hopes of setting foot in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> without a fight is mistaken in his judgment. For as long as <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> lives, it is impossible for him to relinquish this city. Such were the words of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, being overcome by a great fear, sat in silence, and, even though they were abused by the envoys at length for their treason to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, dared make no reply to them, except, indeed, that Fidelius saw fit to taunt them. This man was then praetorian prefect, having been appointed to the office by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, and for this reason he seemed above all others to be well disposed toward the emperor.</p>                        </div>

And when <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> enquired of them what manner of man <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was and how his purpose stood with regard to the question of withdrawing from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, they replied that the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were hoping for vain things if they supposed that they would frighten <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> in any way whatsoever. And when <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> heard this, he began in great earnest to plan an assault upon the wall, and the preparations he made for the attempt upon the fortifications were as follows. He constructed wooden towers equal in height to the enemy's wall, and he discovered its true measure by making many calculations based upon the courses of stone. And wheels were attached to the floor of these towers under each corner, which were intended, as they turned, to move the towers to any point the attacking army might wish at a given time, and the towers were drawn by <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> yoked together. After this he made ready a great number of ladders, that would reach as far as the parapet, and four engines which are called rams. Now this engine is of the following sort. Four upright wooden beams, equal in length, are set up opposite one another. To these beams they fit eight horizontal timbers, four above and an equal number at the base, thus binding them together. After they have thus made the frame of a four-sided building, they surround it on all sides, not with walls of wood or stone, but with a covering of hides, in order that the engine may be light for those who draw it and that those within may still be in the least possible danger of being shot by their opponents. And on the inside they hang another horizontal beam from the top by means of chains which swing free, and they keep it at about the middle of the interior. They then sharpen the end of this beam and cover it with a large iron head, precisely as they cover the round point of a missile, or they sometimes make the iron head square like an anvil. And the whole structure is raised upon four wheels, one being attached to each upright beam, and men to the number of no fewer than fifty to each ram move it from the inside. Then when they apply it to the wall, they draw back the beam which I have just mentioned by turning a certain mechanism, and then they let it swing forward with great force against the wall. And this beam by frequent blows is able quite easily to batter down and tear open a wall wherever it strikes, and it is for this reason that the engine has the name it bears, because the striking end of the beam, projecting as it does, is accustomed to butt against whatever it may encounter, precisely as do the males among <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>. Such, then, are the rams used by the assailants of a wall. And the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were holding in readiness an exceedingly great number of bundles of faggots, which they had made of pieces of wood and reeds, in order that by throwing them into the moat they might make the ground level, and that their engines might not be prevented from crossing it. Now after the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had made their preparations in this manner, they were eager to make an assault upon the wall. <br />But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> placed upon the towers engines which they call ballistae. Now these engines have the form of a bow, but on the under side of them a grooved wooden shaft projects; this shaft is so fitted to the bow that it is free to move, and rests upon a straight iron bed. So when men wish to shoot at the enemy with this, they make the parts of the bow which form the ends bend toward one another by means of a short rope fastened to them, and they place in the grooved shaft the arrow, which is about one half the length of the ordinary missiles which they shoot from bows, but about four times as wide. However, it does not have feathers of the usual sort attached to it, but by inserting thin pieces of wood in place of feathers, they give it in all respects the form of an arrow, making the point which they put on very large and in keeping with its thickness. And the men who stand on either side wind it up tight by means of certain appliances, and then the grooved shaft shoots forward and stops, but the missile is discharged from the shaft, and with such force that it attains the distance of not less than two bow-shots, and that, when it hits a tree or a rock, it pierces it easily. Such is the engine which bears this name, being so called because it shoots with very great force. And they fixed other engines along the parapet of the wall adapted for throwing stones. Now these resemble slings and are called wild <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a>. And outside the gates they placed <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a>, which they make in the following manner. They set up two timbers which reach from the ground to the battlements; then they fit together beams which have been mortised to one another, placing some upright and others crosswise, so that the spaces between the intersections appear as a succession of holes. And from every joint there projects a kind of beak, which resembles very closely a thick goad. Then they fasten the cross-beams to the two upright timbers, beginning at the top and letting them extend half way down, and then lean the timbers back against the gates. And whenever the enemy come up near them, those above lay hold of the ends of the timbers and push, and these, falling suddenly upon the assailants, easily kill with the projecting beaks as many as they may catch. So <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was thus engaged.</p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, seeing the ranks of the enemy as they advanced with the engines, began to laugh, and commanded the soldiers to remain quiet and under no circumstances to begin fighting until he himself should give the signal. Now the reason why he laughed he did not reveal at the moment, but later it became known. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, however, supposing him to be hiding his real feelings by a jest, abused him and called him shameless, and were indignant that he did not try to check the enemy as they came forward. But when the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> came near the moat, the general first of all stretched his bow and with a lucky aim hit in the neck and killed one of the men in armour who were leading the army on. And he fell on his back mortally wounded, while the whole Roman army raised an extraordinary shout such as was never heard before, thinking that they had received an excellent omen. And twice did <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> send forth his bolt, and the very same thing happened again a second time, and the shouting rose still louder from the circuit-wall, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> thought that the enemy were conquered already. Then <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> gave the signal for the whole army to put their bows into action, but those near himself he commanded to shoot only at the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>. And all the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> fell immediately, so that the enemy could neither move the towers further nor in their perplexity do anything to meet the emergency while the fighting was in progress. In this way the forethought of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> in not trying to check the enemy while still at a great distance came to be understood, as well as the reason why he had laughed at the simplicity of the barbarians, who had been so thoughtless as to hope to bring <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> up to the enemy's wall. Now all this took place at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPSa class=place long=12.4985 lat=41.9107>Salarian</a> Gate. But <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, repulsed at this point, left there a large force of <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, making of them a very deep phalanx and instructing the commanders on no condition to make an assault upon the fortifications, but remaining in position to shoot rapidly at the parapet, and give <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> no opportunity whatever to take reinforcements to any other part of the wall which he himself might propose to attack with a superior force; he then went to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPPn class=place long=12.5152 lat=41.8914>Praenestine Gate</a> with a great force, to a part of the fortifications which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call the Vivarium, where the wall was most assailable. Now it so happened that engines of war were already there, including towers and rams and a great number of ladders. <br />But in the meantime another Gothic assault was being made at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPAu class=place long=12.4614 lat=41.8884>Aurelian Gate</a> in the following manner. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125GHad class=place long=12.4664 lat=41.9026>tomb</a> of the Roman Emperor <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> stands outside the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPAu class=place long=12.4614 lat=41.8884>Aurelian Gate</a>, removed about a stone's throw from the fortifications, a very noteworthy sight. For it is made of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371252PPar class=demonym long=25.1483 lat=37.0844>Parian</a> marble, and the stones fit closely one upon the other, having nothing at all between them. And it has four sides which are all equal, each being about a stone's throw in length, while their height exceeds that of the city wall; and above there are statues of the same marble, representing men and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, of wonderful workmanship. But since this tomb seemed to the men of ancient times a fortress threatening the city, they enclosed it by two walls, which extend to it from the circuit-wall, and thus made it a part of the wall. And, indeed, it gives the appearance of a high tower built as a bulwark before the gate there. So the fortifications at that point were most adequate. Now Constantinus, as it happened, had been appointed by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> to have charge of the garrison at this tomb. And he had instructed him also to attend to the guarding of the adjoining wall, which had a small and inconsiderable garrison. For, since that part of the circuit-wall was the least assailable of all, because the river flows along it, he supposed that no assault would be made there, and so stationed an insignificant garrison at that place, and, since the soldiers he had were few, he assigned the great majority to the positions where there was most need of them. For the emperor's army gathered in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> at the beginning of this siege amounted at most to only five thousand men. But since it was reported to Constantinus that the enemy were attempting the crossing of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, he became fearful for that part of the fortifications and went thither himself with all speed, accompanied by some few men to lend assistance, commanding the greater part of his men to attend to the guarding of the gate and the tomb. But meanwhile the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> began an assault upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPAu class=place long=12.4614 lat=41.8884>Aurelian Gate</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125GHad class=place long=12.4664 lat=41.9026>tower</a> of <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>, and though they had no engines of war, they brought up a great quantity of ladders, and thought that by shooting a vast number of arrows they would very easily reduce the enemy to a state of helplessness and overpower the garrison there without any trouble on account of its small numbers. And as they advanced, they held before them shields no smaller than the long shields used by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, and they succeeded in getting very close to their opponents without being perceived by them. For they came hidden under the colonnade which extends to the church of the Apostle Peter. From that shelter they suddenly appeared and began the attack, so that the guards were neither able to use the engine called the ballista (for these engines do not send their missiles except straight out), nor, indeed, could they ward off their assailants with their arrows, since the situation was against them on account of the large shields. But the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> kept pressing vigorously upon them, shooting many missiles at the battlements, and they were already about to set their ladders against the wall, having practically surrounded those who were fighting from the tomb; for whenever the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> advanced they always got in the rear of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> on both flanks [115]; and for a short time consternation fell upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, who knew not what means of defence they should employ to save themselves, but afterwards by common agreement they broke in pieces the most of the statues, which were very large, and taking up great numbers of stones thus secured, threw them with both hands down upon the heads of the enemy, who gave way before this shower of missiles. And as they retreated a little way, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, having by now the advantage, plucked up courage, and with a mighty shout began to drive back their assailants by using their bows and hurling stones at them. And putting their hands to the engines, they reduced their opponents to great fear, and their assault was quickly ended. And by this time Constantinus also was present, having frightened back those who had tried the river and easily driven them off, because they did not find the wall there entirely unguarded, as they had supposed they would. And thus safety was restored at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPAu class=place long=12.4614 lat=41.8884>Aurelian Gate</a>.</p>                        </div>

In like manner they made no attempt on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPFl class=place long=12.4759 lat=41.9115>Flaminian</a> Gate, because it is situated on a precipitous slope and is not very easy of access. The Reges, an infantry detachment, were keeping guard there with <a href=/people/1408 target=_blank>Ursicinus</a>, who commanded them. And between this gate and the small gate next on the right, which is called the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPPi class=place long=12.4883 lat=41.9094>Pincian</a>, a certain portion of the wall had split open of its own accord in ancient times, not clear to the ground, however, but about half way down, but still it had not fallen or been otherwise destroyed, though it leaned so to either side that one part of it appeared outside the rest of the wall and the other inside. And from this circumstance the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> from ancient times have called the place Broken Wall in their own tongue. But when <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> in the beginning undertook to tear down this portion and rebuild it, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> prevented him, declaring that the Apostle Peter had promised them that he would care for the guarding of the wall there. This Apostle is reverenced by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and held in awe above all others. And the outcome of events at this place was in all respects what the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> contemplated and expected. For neither on that day nor throughout the whole time during which the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were besieging <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> did any hostile force come to that place, nor did any disturbance occur there. And we marvelled indeed that it never occurred to us nor to the enemy to remember this portion of the fortifications during the whole time, either while they were making their assaults or carrying out their designs against the wall by night; and yet many such attempts were made. It was for this reason, in fact, that at a later time also no one ventured to rebuild this part of the defences, but up to the present day the wall there is split open in this way. So much, then, for this. <br />And at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPSa class=place long=12.4985 lat=41.9107>Salarian</a> Gate a <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goth</a> of goodly stature and a capable warrior, wearing a corselet and having a helmet on his head, a man who was of no mean station in the Gothic nation, refused to remain in the ranks with his comrades, but stood by a tree and kept shooting many missiles at the parapet. But this man by some chance was hit by a missile from an engine which was on a tower at his left. And passing through the corselet and the body of the man, the missile sank more than half its length into the tree, and pinning him to the spot where it entered the tree, it suspended him there a corpse. And when this was seen by the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> they fell into great fear, and getting outside the range of missiles, they still remained in line, but no longer harassed those on the wall. <br />But <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> and Peranius summoned <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, since <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> was pressing most vigorously upon them at the Vivarium. And he was fearful concerning the wall there (for it was most assailable at that point, as has been said), and so came to the rescue himself with all speed, leaving one of his friends at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPSa class=place long=12.4985 lat=41.9107>Salarian</a> Gate. And finding that the soldiers in the Vivarium dreaded the attack of the enemy, which was being pressed with great vigour and by very large numbers, he bade them look with contempt upon the enemy and thus restored their confidence. Now the ground there was very level, and consequently the place lay open to the attacks of any assailant. And for some reason the wall at that point had crumbled a great deal, and to such an extent that the binding of the bricks did not hold together very well. Consequently the ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had built another wall of short length outside of it and encircling it, not for the sake of safety (for it was neither strengthened with towers, nor indeed was there any battlement built upon it, nor any other means by which it would have been possible to repulse an enemy's assault upon the fortifications), but in order to provide for an unseemly kind of luxury, namely, that they might confine and keep there <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> and other wild animals. And it is for this reason that this place has been named the Vivarium; for thus the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call a place where untamed animals are regularly cared for. So <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> began to make ready various engines at different places along the wall and commanded the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> to mine the outside wall, thinking that, if they should get inside that, they would have no trouble in capturing the main wall, which he knew to be by no means strong. But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, seeing that the enemy was undermining the Vivarium and assaulting the fortifications at many places, neither allowed the soldiers to defend the wall nor to remain at the battlement, except a very few, although he had with him whatever men of distinction the army contained. But he held them all in readiness below about the gates, with their corselets on and carrying only swords in their hands. And when the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, after making a breach in the wall, got inside the Vivarium, he quickly sent <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a> with some others into the enclosure against them, commanding them to set to work. And they slew all who had broken in, for these made no defence and at the same time were being destroyed by one another in the cramped space about the exit. And since the enemy were thrown into dismay by the sudden turn of events and were not drawn up in order, but were rushing one in one direction and one in another, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> suddenly opened the gates of the circuit-wall and sent out his entire army against his opponents. And the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had not the least thought of resistance, but rushed off in flight in any and every direction, while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, following them up, found no difficulty in killing all whom they fell in with, and the pursuit proved a long one, since the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, in assaulting the wall at that place, were far away from their own camps. Then <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> gave the order to burn the enemy's engines, and the flames, rising to a great height, naturally increased the consternation of the fugitives. <br />Meanwhile it chanced that the same thing happened at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPSa class=place long=12.4985 lat=41.9107>Salarian</a> Gate also. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> suddenly opened the gates and fell unexpectedly upon the barbarians, and, as these made no resistance but turned their backs, slew them; and they burned the engines of war which were within their reach. And the flames at many parts of the wall rose to a great height, and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were already being forced to retire from the whole circuit-wall; and the shouting on both sides was exceedingly loud, as the men on the wall urged on the pursuers, and those in the camps bewailed the overwhelming calamity they had suffered. Among the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> there perished on that day thirty thousand, as their leaders declared, and a larger number were wounded; for since they were massed in great numbers, those fighting from the battlement generally hit somebody when they shot at them, and at the same time those who made the sallies destroyed an extraordinary number of terrified and fleeing men. And the fighting at the wall, which had commenced early in the morning, did not end until late in the afternoon. During that night, then, both armies bivouacked where they were, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> singing the song of victory on the fortifications and lauding <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> to the skies, having with them the spoils stripped from the fallen, while the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> cared for their wounded and bewailed their dead.</p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg4029.tlg001:5.24.1'><b>&sect; 5.24.1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> wrote a letter to the emperor of the following purport: We have arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, as thou didst command, and we have made ourselves masters of much territory in it and have taken possession of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> also, after driving out the barbarians who were here, whose leader, Leuderis, I have recently sent to you. But since we have stationed a great number of soldiers both in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> to guard the strongholds which we have proved able to capture, our army has in consequence been reduced to only five thousand men. But the enemy have come against us, gathered together to the number of one hundred and fifty thousand. And first of all, when we went out to spy upon their forces along the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> River and were compelled, contrary to our intention, to engage with them, we lacked only a little of being buried under a multitude of spears. And after this, when the barbarians attacked the wall with their whole army and assaulted the fortifications at every point with sundry engines of war, they came within a little of capturing both us and the city at the first onset, and they would have succeeded had not some chance snatched us from ruin. For achievements which transcend the nature of things may not properly and fittingly be ascribed to man's valour, but to a stronger power. Now all that has been achieved by us hitherto, whether it has been due to some kind fortune or to valour, is for the best; but as to our prospects from now on, I could wish better things for thy cause. However, I shall never hide from you anything that it is my duty to say and yours to do, knowing that while human affairs follow whatever course may be in accordance with God's will, yet those who are in charge of any enterprise always win praise or blame according to their own deeds. Therefore let both arms and soldiers be sent to us in such numbers that from now on we may engage with the enemy in this war with an equality of strength. For one ought not to trust everything to fortune, since fortune, on its part, is not given to following the same course forever. But do thou, O Emperor, take this thought to heart, that if at this time the barbarians win the victory over us, we shall be cast out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> which is thine and shall lose the army in addition, and besides all this we shall have to bear the shame, however great it may be, that attaches to our conduct. For I refrain from saying that we should also be regarded as having ruined the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, men who have held their safety more lightly than their loyalty to thy kingdom. Consequently, if this should happen, the result for us will be that the successes we have won thus far will in the end prove to have been but a prelude to calamities. For if it had so happened that we had been repulsed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a> and, at a much earlier time, from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, we should only be feeling the sting of the lightest of all misfortunes, that of having found ourselves unable to grow wealthy on the possessions of others. And again, this too is worthy of consideration by you, that it has never been possible even for many times ten thousand men to guard <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> for any considerable length of time, since the city embraces a large territory, and, because it is not on the sea, is shut off from all supplies. And although at the present time the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> are well disposed toward us, yet when their troubles are prolonged, they will probably not hesitate to choose the course which is better for their own interests. For when men have entered into friendship with others on the spur of the moment, it is not while they are in evil fortune, but while they prosper, that they are accustomed to keep faith with them. Furthermore, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> will be compelled by hunger to do many things they would prefer not to do. Now as for me, I know I am bound even to die for thy kingdom, and for this reason no man will ever be able to remove me from this city while I live; but I beg thee to consider what kind of a fame such an end of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> would bring thee. <br />Such was the letter written by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. And the emperor, greatly distressed, began in haste to gather an army and ships, and sent orders to the troops of <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> and <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> to proceed with all speed. For they had been sent, as it happened, with another army at about the winter solstice, with instructions to sail to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. But they had sailed as far as Greece, and since they were unable to force their way any farther, they were passing the winter in the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=place long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aetolia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388210RAka class=place long=21 lat=38.8>Acarnania</a>. And the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> sent word of all this to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, and thus filled him and all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> with still greater courage and confirmed their zeal. <br />At this time it so happened that the following event took place in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>. There was in the market-place a picture of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>, the ruler of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, made by means of sundry stones which were exceedingly small and tinted with nearly every colour. At one time during the life of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> it had come to pass that the head of this picture fell apart, the stones as they had been set having become disarranged without having been touched by anyone, and by a coincidence <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> finished his life forthwith. And eight years later the stones which formed the body of the picture fell apart suddenly, and Atalaric, the grandson of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>, immediately died. And after the passage of a short time, the stones about the groin fell to the ground, and <a href=/people/12065 target=_blank>Amalasuntha</a>, the child of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>, passed from the world. Now these things had already happened as described. But when the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> began the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, as chance would have it, the portion of the picture from the thighs to the tips of the feet fell into ruin, and thus the whole picture disappeared from the wall. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, divining the meaning of the incident, maintained that the emperor's army would be victorious in the war, thinking that the feet of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> were nothing else than the Gothic people whom he ruled, and, in consequence, they became still more hopeful. <br />In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, moreover, some of the patricians brought out the <a href=/people/12187 target=_blank>Sibylline oracles</a>, declaring that the danger which had come to the city would continue only up till the month of July. For it was fated that at that time someone should be appointed king over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and thenceforth <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> should have no longer any <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435268RGet class=demonym long=26.8 lat=43.5>Getic</a> peril to fear; for they say that the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> are of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435268RGet class=demonym long=26.8 lat=43.5>Getic</a> race. And the oracle was as follows: In the fifth (<a href=/people/4286 target=_blank>Quintilis</a>) month . . . under . . . as king nothing <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435268RGet class=demonym long=26.8 lat=43.5>Getic</a> longer. . . . And they declared that the fifth month was July, some because the siege began on the first day of March, from which July is the fifth month, others because March was considered the first month until the reign of <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a>, the full year before that time containing ten months and our July for this reason having its name <a href=/people/4286 target=_blank>Quintilis</a>. But after all, none of these predictions came true. For neither was a king appointed over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> at that time, nor was the siege destined to be broken up until a year later, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was again to come into similar perils in the reign of <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, ruler of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, as will be told by me in the subsequent narrative. For it seems to me that the oracle does not indicate this present attack of the barbarians, but some other attack which has either happened already or will come at some later time. Indeed, in my opinion, it is impossible for a mortal man to discover the meaning of the <a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibyl</a>'s oracles before the actual event. The reason for this I shall now set forth, having read all the oracles in question. The <a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibyl</a> does not invariably mention events in their order, much less construct a well-arranged narrative, but after uttering some verse or other concerning the troubles in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> she leaps straightway to the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, thence proceeds to mention the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and then transfers the narrative to the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>. And again, while uttering prophecies about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, she foretells the misfortunes of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=ethnic long=-1.5 lat=53>Britons</a>. For this reason it is impossible for any man soever to comprehend the oracles of the <a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibyl</a> before the event, and it is only time itself, after the event has already come to pass and the words can be tested by experience, that can shew itself an accurate interpreter of her sayings. But as for these things, let each one reason as he desires. But I shall return to the point from which I have strayed.</p>                        </div>

But on the following day <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> commanded all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> to remove their women and children to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>, and also such of their domestics as they thought would not be needed by them for the guarding of the wall, his purpose being, naturally, to forestall a scarcity of provisions. And he issued orders to the soldiers to do the same thing, in case anyone had a male or female attendant. For, he went on to say, he was no longer able while besieged to provide them with food to the customary amount, but they would have to accept one half their daily ration in actual supplies, taking the remainder in silver. So they proceeded to carry out his instructions. And immediately a great throng set out for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>. Now some, who had the good fortune to secure such boats as were lying at anchor in the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, secured passage, but the rest went on foot by the road which is called the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPAp class=place long=12.5016 lat=41.8734>Appian Way</a>. And no danger or fear, as far as the besiegers were concerned, arose to disturb either those who travelled this way on foot or those who set out from the harbour. For, on the one hand, the enemy were unable to surround the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> with their camps on account of the great size of the city, and, on the other, they did not dare to be found far from the camps in small companies, fearing the sallies of their opponents. And on this account abundant opportunity was afforded for some time to the besieged both to move out of the city and to bring provisions into it from outside. And especially at night the barbarians were always in great fear, and so they merely posted guards and remained quietly in their camps. For parties were continually issuing from the city, and especially Moors in great numbers, and whenever they found their enemies either asleep or walking about in small companies (as is accustomed to happen often in a large army, the men going out not only to attend to the needs of nature, but also to pasture <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and mules and such animals as are suitable for food), they would kill them and speedily strip them, and if perchance a larger number of the enemy should fall upon them, they would retire on the run, being men swift of foot by nature and lightly equipped, and always distancing their pursuers in the flight. Consequently, the great majority were able to withdraw from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and some went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>, some to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, and others wherever they thought it was easier or better to go. But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> saw that the number of soldiers at his command was by no means sufficient for the whole circuit of the wall, for they were few, as I have previously stated, and the same men could not keep guard constantly without sleeping, but some would naturally be taking their sleep while others were stationed on guard. At the same time he saw that the greatest part of the populace were hard pressed by poverty and in want of the necessities of life; for since they were men who worked with their hands, and all they had was what they got from day to day, and since they had been compelled to be idle on account of the siege, they had no means of procuring provisions. For these reasons <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> mingled soldiers and citizens together and distributed them to each post, appointing a certain fixed wage for an unenlisted man for each day. In this way companies were made up which were sufficient for the guarding of the wall, and the duty of keeping guard on the fortifications during a stated night was assigned to each company, and the members of the companies all took turns in standing guard. In this manner, then, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> did away with the distress of both soldiers and citizens. <br />But a suspicion arose against Silverius, the chief priest of the city, that he was engaged in treasonable negotiations with the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, and <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> sent him immediately to Greece, and a little later appointed another man, Vigilius by name, to the office of chief priest. And he banished from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the same charge some of the senators, but later, when the enemy had abandoned the siege and retired, he restored them again to their homes. Among these was <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, whose ancestor <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a> had committed the crime against the Emperor <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a>. And fearing lest the guards at the gates should become involved in a plot, and lest someone should gain access from the outside with intent to corrupt them with money, twice in each month he destroyed all the keys and had new ones made, each time of a different design, and he also changed the guards to other posts which were far removed from those they had formerly occupied, and every night he set different men in charge of those who were doing guard-duty on the fortifications. And it was the duty of these officers to make the rounds of a section of the wall, taking turns in this work, and to write down the names of the guards, and if anyone was missing from that section, they put another man on duty in his stead for the moment, and on the morrow reported the missing man to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> himself, whoever he might be, in order that the fitting punishment might be given him. And he ordered musicians to play their instruments on the fortifications at night, and he continually sent detachments of soldiers, especially Moors, outside the walls, whose duty it was always to pass the night about the moat, and he sent <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> with them in order that no one might approach the fortifications, even at a distance, without being detected. <br />At that time some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> attempted secretly to force open the doors of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SJan class=place long=12.4851 lat=41.8933>temple</a> of <a href=/people/983 target=_blank>Janus</a>. This <a href=/people/983 target=_blank>Janus</a> was the first of the ancient gods whom the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call in their own tongue <a href=/people/12190 target=_blank>Penates</a>. And he has his temple in that part of the forum in front of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate-house</a> which lies a little above the Tria Fata[129]; for thus the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> are accustomed to call the Moirai. And the temple is entirely of bronze and was erected in the form of a square, but it is only large enough to cover the statue of <a href=/people/983 target=_blank>Janus</a>. Now this statue, is of bronze, and not less than five cubits high; in all other respects it resembles a man, but its head has two faces, one of which is turned toward the east and the other toward the west. And there are brazen doors fronting each face, which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in olden times were accustomed to close in time of peace and prosperity, but when they had war they opened them. But when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> came to honour, as truly as any others, the teachings of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, they gave up the custom of opening these doors, even when they were at war. During this siege, however, some, I suppose, who had in mind the old belief, attempted secretly to open them, but they did not succeed entirely, and moved the doors only so far that they did not close tightly against one another as formerly. And those who had attempted to do this escaped detection; and no investigation of the act was made, as was natural in a time of great confusion, since it did not become known to the commanders, nor did it reach the ears of the multitude, except of a very few.</p>                        </div>

And some of them, learning of this beforehand, succeeded in making their escape, among them being Vergentinus and Reparatus, the brother of Vigilius, the chief priest of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, both of whom betook themselves into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=place long=8.3 lat=44.3>Liguria</a> and remained there; but all the rest were destroyed. After this <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, seeing that the enemy were enjoying a large degree of freedom, not only in taking out of the city whatever they wished, but also in bringing in provisions both by land and by sea, decided to seize the harbour, which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a>. <br />This harbour is distant from the city one hundred and twenty-six stades; for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> lacks only so much of being on the sea; and it is situated where the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> River has its mouth. Now as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> flows down from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and reaches a point rather near the sea, about fifteen stades from it, the stream divides into two parts and makes there the Sacred Island, as it is called. As the river flows on the island becomes wider, so that the measure of its breadth corresponds to its length, for the two streams have between them a distance of fifteen stades; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> remains navigable on both sides. Now the portion of the river on the right empties into the harbour, and beyond the mouth the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in ancient times built on the shore a city, which is surrounded by an exceedingly strong wall; and it is called, like the harbour, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a>. But on the left at the point where the other part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> empties into the sea is situated the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Ostia</a>, lying beyond the place where the river-bank ends, a place of great consequence in olden times, but now entirely without walls. Moreover, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> at the very beginning made a road leading from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, which was smooth and presented no difficulty of any kind. And many barges are always anchored in the harbour ready for service, and no small number of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> stand in readiness close by. Now when the merchants reach the harbour with their ships, they unload their cargoes and place them in the barges, and sail by way of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; but they do not use sails or oars at all, for the boats cannot be propelled in the stream by any wind since the river winds about exceedingly and does not follow a straight course, nor can oars be employed, either, since the force of the current is always against them. Instead of using such means, therefore, they fasten ropes from the barges to the necks of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, and so draw them just like waggons up to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. But on the other side of the river, as one goes from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Ostia</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, the road is shut in by woods and in general lies neglected, and is not even near the bank of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, since there is no towing of barges on that road. <br />So the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, finding the city at the harbour unguarded, captured it at the first onset and slew many of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who lived there, and so took possession of the harbour as well as the city. And they established a thousand of their number there as guards, while the remainder returned to the camps. In consequence of this move it was impossible for the besieged to bring in the goods which came by sea, except by way of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Ostia</a>, a route which naturally involved great labour and danger besides. For the Roman ships were not even able to put in there any longer, but they anchored at <a href=/people/8824 target=_blank>Anthium</a>, a day's journey distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Ostia</a>. And they found great difficulty in carrying the cargoes thence to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, the reason for this being the scarcity of men. For <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, fearing for the fortifications of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, had been unable to strengthen the harbour with any garrison at all, though I think that if even three hundred men had been on guard there, the barbarians would never have made an attempt on the place, which is exceedingly strong.</p>                        </div>

But twenty days after the city and harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a> were captured, <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> and <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> arrived, bringing with them sixteen hundred horsemen, the most of whom were <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> and <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a> and Antae, who are settled above the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> River not far from its banks. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was pleased by their coming and thought that thenceforth his army ought to carry the war against the enemy. On the following day, accordingly, he commanded one of his own bodyguards, <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> by name, an impetuous and active fighter, to take two hundred horsemen of the guards and go straight towards the enemy, and as soon as they came near the camps to go up on a high hill (which he pointed out to him) and remain quietly there. And if the enemy should come against them, he was not to allow the battle to come to close quarters, nor to touch sword or spear in any case, but to use bows only, and as soon as he should find that his quiver had no more arrows in it, he was to flee as hard as he could with no thought of shame and retire to the fortifications on the run. Having given these instructions, he held in readiness both the engines for shooting arrows and the men skilled in their use. Then <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> with the two hundred men went out from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPSa class=place long=12.4985 lat=41.9107>Salarian</a> Gate against the camp of the enemy. And they, being filled with amazement at the suddenness of the thing, rushed out from the camps, each man equipping himself as well as he could. But the men under <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> galloped to the top of the hill which <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had shewn them, and from there began to ward off the barbarians with missiles. And since their shafts fell among a dense throng, they were for the most part successful in hitting a man or a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. But when all their missiles had at last failed them, they rode off to the rear with all speed, and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> kept pressing upon them in pursuit. But when they came near the fortifications, the operators of the engines began to shoot arrows from them, and the barbarians became terrified and abandoned the pursuit. And it is said that not less than one thousand <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> perished in this action. A few days later <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> sent Mundilas, another of his own bodyguard, and <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>, both exceptionally capable warriors, with three hundred guardsmen, commanding them to do the same thing as the others had done before. And they acted according to his instructions. Then, when the enemy confronted them, the result of the encounter was that no fewer than in the former action, perhaps even more, perished in the same way. And sending even a third time the guardsman Oilas with three hundred horsemen, with instructions to handle the enemy in the same way, he accomplished the same result. So in making these three sallies, in the manner told by me, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> destroyed about four thousand of his antagonists. <br />But <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, failing to take into account the difference between the two armies in point of equipment of arms and of practice in warlike deeds, thought that he too would most easily inflict grave losses upon the enemy, if only he should make his attack upon them with a small force. He therefore sent five hundred horsemen, commanding them to go close to the fortifications, and to make a demonstration against the whole army of the enemy of the very same tactics as had time and again been used against them, to their sorrow, by small bands of the foe. And so, when they came to a high place not far from the city, but just beyond the range of missiles, they took their stand there. But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> selected a thousand men, putting <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> in command, and ordered them to engage with the enemy. And this force, by forming a circle around the enemy and always shooting at them from behind, killed a large number, and by pressing hard upon the rest compelled them to descend into the plain. There a hand-to-hand battle took place between forces not evenly matched in strength, and most of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were destroyed, though some few with difficulty made their escape and returned to their own camp. And <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> reviled these men, insisting that cowardice had been the cause of their defeat, and undertaking to find another set of men to retrieve the loss after no long time, he remained quiet for the present; but three days later he selected men from all the camps, five hundred in number, and bade them make a display of valorous deeds against the enemy. Now as soon as <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> saw that these men had come rather near, he sent out against them fifteen hundred men under the commanders <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> and <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>. And a cavalry battle taking place immediately, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, being greatly superior to the enemy in numbers, routed them without any trouble and destroyed practically all of them. <br />And to the enemy it seemed in every way a dreadful thing and a proof that fortune stood against them, if, when they were many and the enemy who came against them were few, they were defeated, and when, on the other hand, they in turn went in small numbers against their enemy, they were likewise destroyed. <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, however, received a public vote of praise from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> for his wisdom, at which they not unnaturally marvelled greatly, but in private his friends asked him on what he had based his judgment on that day when he had escaped from the enemy after being so completely defeated, and why he had been confident that he would overcome them decisively in the war. And he said that in engaging with them at the first with only a few men he had noticed just what the difference was between the two armies, so that if he should fight his battles with them with a force which was in strength proportionate to theirs, the multitudes of the enemy could inflict no injury upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> by reason of the smallness of their numbers. And the difference was this, that practically all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and their allies, the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a>, are good mounted bowmen, but not a man among the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> has had practice in this branch, for their horsemen are accustomed to use only spears and swords, while their bowmen enter battle on foot and under cover of the heavy-armed men. So the horsemen, unless the engagement is at close quarters, have no means of defending themselves against opponents who use the bow, and therefore can easily be reached by the arrows and destroyed; and as for the foot-soldiers, they can never be strong enough to make sallies against men on horseback. It was for these reasons, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> declared, that the barbarians had been defeated by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in these last engagements. And the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, remembering the unexpected outcome of their own experiences, desisted thereafter from assaulting the fortifications of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> in small numbers and also from pursuing the enemy when harassed by them, except only so far as to drive them back from their own camps.</p>                        </div>

But when at last he yielded his point because of the abuse heaped upon him by the army and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in general, though he was willing to fight with the whole army, yet nevertheless he wished to open the engagement by a sudden sally. And many times he was frustrated when he was on the point of doing this, and was compelled to put off the attack to the following day, because he found to his surprise that the enemy had been previously informed by deserters as to what was to be done and were unexpectedly ready for him. For this reason, then, he was now willing to fight a decisive battle even in the open field, and the barbarians gladly came forth for the encounter. And when both sides had been made ready for the conflict as well as might be, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> gathered his whole army and exhorted them as follows: <br />It is not because I detected any cowardice on your part, fellow-soldiers, nor because I was terrified at the strength of the enemy, that I have shrunk from the engagement with them, but I saw that while we were carrying on the war by making sudden sallies matters stood well with us, and consequently I thought that we ought to adhere permanently to the tactics which were responsible for our success. For I think that when one's present affairs are going to one's satisfaction, it is inexpedient to change to another course of action. But since I see that you are eager for this danger, I am filled with confidence and shall never oppose your ardour. For I know that the greatest factor in the decision of war is always the attitude of the fighting men, and it is generally by their enthusiasm that successes are won. Now, therefore, the fact that a few men drawn up for battle with valour on their side are able to overcome a multitude of the enemy, is well known by every man of you, not by hearsay, but by daily experience of fighting. And it will rest with you not to bring shame upon the former glories of my career as general, nor upon the hope which this enthusiasm of yours inspires. For the whole of what has already been accomplished by us in this war must of necessity be judged in accordance with the issue of the present day. And I see that the present moment is also in our favour, for it will, in all probability, make it easier for us to gain the mastery over the enemy, because their spirit has been enslaved by what has gone before. For when men have often met with misfortune, their hearts are no longer wont to thrill even slightly with manly valour. And let no one of you spare <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> or bow or any weapon. For I will immediately provide you with others in place of all that are destroyed in the battle. <br />After speaking these words of exhortation, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> led out his army through the small <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPPi class=place long=12.4883 lat=41.9094>Pincian Gate</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPSa class=place long=12.4985 lat=41.9107>Salarian</a> Gate, and commanded some few men to go through the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPAu class=place long=12.4614 lat=41.8884>Aurelian Gate</a> into the Plain of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>. These he put under the command of <a href=/people/3712 target=_blank>Valentinus</a>, a commander of a cavalry detachment, and he directed him not to begin any fighting, or to go too close to the camp of the enemy, but constantly to give the appearance of being about to attack immediately, so that none of the enemy in that quarter might be able to cross the neighbouring bridge and come to the assistance of the soldiers from the other camps. For since, as I have previously stated, the barbarians encamped in the Plain of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> were many, it seemed to him sufficient if these should all be prevented from taking part in the engagement and be kept separated from the rest of the army. And when some of the Roman populace took up arms and followed as volunteers, he would not allow them to be drawn up for battle along with the regular troops, fearing lest, when they came to actual fighting, they should become terrified at the danger and throw the entire army into confusion, since they were labouring men and altogether unpractised in war. But outside the Pancratian Gate, which is beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> River, he ordered them to form a phalanx and remain quiet until he himself should give the signal, reasoning, as actually proved to be the case, that if the enemy in the Plain of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> should see both them and the men under <a href=/people/3712 target=_blank>Valentinus</a>, they would never dare leave their camp and enter battle with the rest of the Gothic army against his own forces. And he considered it a stroke of good luck and a very important advantage that such a large number of men should be kept apart from the army of his opponents. <br />Such being the situation, he wished on that day to engage in a cavalry battle only; and indeed most of the regular infantry were now unwilling to remain in their accustomed condition, but, since they had captured <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> as booty from the enemy and had become not unpractised in horsemanship, they were now mounted. And since the infantry were few in number and unable even to make a phalanx of any consequence, and had never had the courage to engage with the barbarians, but always turned to flight at the first onset, he considered it unsafe to draw them up at a distance from the fortifications, but thought it best that they should remain in position where they were, close by the moat, his purpose being that, if it should so happen that the Roman horsemen were routed, they should be able to receive the fugitives and, as a fresh body of men, help them to ward off the enemy. <br />But there were two men among his bodyguards, a certain Principius, who was a man of note and a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=demonym long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidian</a> by birth, and Tarmutus, an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=demonym long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurian</a>, brother of Ennes who was commander of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a>. These men came before <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and spoke as follows: Most excellent of generals, we beg you neither to decide that your army, small as it is and about to fight with many tens of thousands of barbarians, be cut off from the phalanx of the infantry, nor to think that one ought to treat with contumely the infantry of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, by means of which, as we hear, the power of the ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> was brought to its present greatness. For if it so happens that they have done nothing of consequence in this war, this is no evidence of the cowardice of the soldiers, but it is the commanders of the infantry who would justly bear the blame, for they alone ride on horseback in the battle-line and are not willing to consider the fortunes of war as shared by all, but as a general thing each one of them by himself takes to flight before the struggle begins. But do you keep all the commanders of infantry, since you see that they have become cavalry and that they are quite unwilling to take their stand beside their subordinates, and include them with the rest of the cavalry and so enter this battle, but permit us to lead the infantry into the combat. For since we also are unmounted, as are these troops, we shall do our part in helping them to support the attack of the multitude of barbarians, full of hope that we shall inflict upon the enemy whatever chastisement God shall permit. <br />When <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> heard this request, at first he did not assent to it; for he was exceedingly fond of these two men, who were fighters of marked excellence, and he was unwilling to have a small body of infantry take such a risk. But finally, overborne by the eagerness of the men, he consented to leave only a small number of their soldiers, in company with the Roman populace, to man the gates and the battlement along the top of the wall where the engines of war were, and to put the rest under command of Principius and Tarmutus, ordering them to take position in the rear in regular formation. His purpose in this was, in the first place, to keep these troops from throwing the rest of the army into confusion if they themselves should become panic-stricken at the danger, and, in the second place, in case any division of the cavalry should be routed at any time, to prevent the retreat from extending to an indefinite distance, but to allow the cavalry simply to fall back upon the infantry and make it possible for them, with the infantry's help, to ward off the pursuers.</p>                        </div>

As for <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, he had armed all the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, leaving not a man behind in the camps, except those unfit for fighting. And he commanded the men under Marcias to remain in the Plain of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, and to attend to the guarding of the bridge, that the enemy might not attack his men from that direction. He himself then called together the rest of the army and spoke as follows: <br />It may perhaps seem to some of you that I am fearful about my sovereignty, and that this is the motive which has led me, in the past, to shew a friendly spirit toward you and, on the present occasion, to address you with seductive words in order to inspire you with courage. And such reasoning is not out of accord with the ways of men. For unenlightened men are accustomed to shew gentleness toward those whom they want to make use of, even though these happen to be in a much humbler station than they, but to be difficult of access to others whose assistance they do not desire. As for me, however, I care neither for the end of life nor for the loss of power. Nay, I should even pray that I might put off this purple to-day, if a <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goth</a> were to put it on. And I have always regarded the end of <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> as one of the most fortunate, in that he was privileged to lose both his sovereignty and his life at the hands of men of his own nation. For a calamity which falls upon an individual without involving his nation also in destruction does not lack an element of consolation, in the view, at least, of men who are not wanting in wisdom. But when I reflect upon the fate of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and the end of <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>, the thoughts which come to my mind are of no ordinary kind; nay, I seem to see the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and their children reduced to slavery, your wives ministering in the most shameful of all ways to the most hateful of men, and myself and the granddaughter of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> led wherever it suits the pleasure of those who are now our enemies; and I would have you also enter this battle fearing lest this fate befall us. For if you do this, on the field of battle you will count the end of life as more to be desired than safety after defeat. For noble men consider that there is only one misfortune — to survive defeat at the hands of their enemy. But as for death, and especially death which comes quickly, it always brings happiness to those who were before not blest by fortune. It is very clear that if you keep these thoughts in mind as you go through the present engagement, you will not only conquer your opponents most easily, few as they are and Greeks, but will also punish them forthwith for the injustice and insolence with which they, without provocation, have treated us. For although we boast that we are their superiors in valour, in numbers, and in every other respect, the boldness which they feel in confronting us is due merely to elation at our misfortunes; and the only asset they have is the indifference we have shewn. For their self-confidence is fed by their undeserved good fortune. <br />With these words of exhortation <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> proceeded to array his army for battle, stationing the infantry in the centre and the cavalry on the two wings. He did not, however, draw up his phalanx far from the camps, but very near them, in order that, as soon as the rout should take place, the enemy might easily be overtaken and killed, there being abundance of room for the pursuit. For he expected that if the struggle should become a pitched battle in the plain, they would not withstand him even a short time; since he judged by the great disparity of numbers that the army of the enemy was no match for his own. <br />So the soldiers on both sides, beginning in the early morning, opened battle; and <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> and <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> were in the rear urging on both armies and inciting them to fortitude. And at first the Roman arms prevailed, and the barbarians kept falling in great numbers before their archery, but no pursuit of them was made. For since the Gothic cavalry stood in dense masses, other men very easily stepped into the places of those who were killed, and so the loss of those who fell among them was in no way apparent. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> evidently were satisfied, in view of their very small number, that the struggle should have such a result for them. So after they had by midday carried the battle as far as the camps of their opponents, and had already slain many of the enemy, they were anxious to return to the city if any pretext should present itself to them. In this part of the action three among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> proved themselves brave men above all others, <a href=/people/692 target=_blank>Athenodorus</a>, an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=demonym long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurian</a>, a man of fair fame among the guards of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, and Theodoriscus and <a href=/people/4538 target=_blank>George</a>, spearmen of <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=ethnic long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocians</a> by birth. For they constantly kept going out beyond the front of the phalanx, and there despatched many of the barbarians with their spears. Such was the course of events here. <br />But in the Plain of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> the two armies remained for a long time facing one another, and the Moors, by making constant sallies and hurling their javelins among the enemy, kept harrying the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. For the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were quite unwilling to go out against them through fear of the forces of the Roman populace which were not far away, thinking, of course, that they were soldiers and were remaining quiet because they had in mind some sort of an ambush against themselves with the object of getting in their rear, exposing them to attack on both sides, and thus destroying them. But when it was now the middle of the day, the Roman army suddenly made a rush against the enemy, and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were unexpectedly routed, being paralyzed by the suddenness of the attack. And they did not succeed even in fleeing to their camp, but climbed the hills near by and remained quiet. Now the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, though many in number, were not all soldiers, but were for the most part a throng of men without defensive armour. For inasmuch as the general was elsewhere, many sailors and servants in the Roman camp, in their eagerness to have a share in the war, mingled with that part of the army. And although by their mere numbers they did fill the barbarians with consternation and turn them to flight, as has been said, yet by reason of their lack of order they lost the day for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. For the intermixture of the above-mentioned men caused the soldiers to be thrown into great disorder, and although <a href=/people/3712 target=_blank>Valentinus</a> kept constantly shouting orders to them, they could not hear his commands at all. For this reason they did not even follow up the fugitives or kill a man, but allowed them to stand at rest on the hills and in security to view what was going on. Nor did they take thought to destroy the bridge there, and thus prevent the city from being afterwards besieged on both sides; for, had they done so, the barbarians would have been unable to encamp any longer on the farther side of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> River. Furthermore, they did not even cross the bridge and get in the rear of their opponents who were fighting there with the troops of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. And if this had been done, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, I think, would no longer have thought of resistance, but they would have turned instantly to flight, each man as he could. But as it was, they took possession of the enemy's camp and turned to plundering his goods, and they set to work carrying thence many vessels of silver and many other valuables. Meanwhile the barbarians for some time remained quietly where they were and observed what was going on, but finally by common consent they advanced against their opponents with great fury and shouting. And finding men in complete disorder engaged in plundering their property, they slew many and quickly drove out the rest. For all who were caught inside the camp and escaped slaughter were glad to cast their plunder from their shoulders and take to flight. <br />While these things were taking place in the Plain of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, meantime the rest of the barbarian army stayed very near their camps and, protecting themselves with their shields, vigorously warded off their opponents, destroying many men and a much larger number of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. But on the Roman side, when those who had been wounded and those whose <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> had been killed left the ranks, then, in an army which had been small even before, the smallness of their numbers was still more evident, and the difference between them and the Gothic host was manifestly great. Finally the horsemen of the barbarians who were on the right wing, taking note of this, advanced at a gallop against the enemy opposite them. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> there, unable to withstand their spears, rushed off in flight and came to the infantry phalanx. However, the infantry also were unable to hold their ground against the oncoming horsemen, and most of them began to join the cavalry in flight. And immediately the rest of the Roman army also began to retire, the enemy pressing upon their heels, and the rout became decisive. But Principius and Tarmutus with some few of the infantry of their command made a display of valorous deeds against the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. For as they continued to fight and disdained to turn to flight with the others, most of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were so amazed that they halted. And consequently the rest of the infantry and most of the horsemen made their escape in greater security. Now Principius fell where he stood, his whole body hacked to pieces, and around him fell forty-two foot-soldiers. But Tarmutus, holding two <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=demonym long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurian</a> javelins, one in each hand, continued to thrust them into his assailants as he turned from side to side, until, finally, he desisted because his body was covered with wounds; but when his brother Ennes came to the rescue with a detachment of cavalry, he revived, and running swiftly, covered as he was with gore and wounds, he made for the fortifications without throwing down either of his javelins. And being fleet of foot by nature, he succeeded in making his escape, in spite of the plight of his body, and did not fall until he had just reached the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPPi class=place long=12.4883 lat=41.9094>Pincian Gate</a>. And some of his comrades, supposing him to be dead, lifted him on a shield and carried him. But he lived on two days before he died, leaving a high reputation both among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> and in the rest of the army. <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, meanwhile, being by now thoroughly frightened, attended to the guarding of the wall, and shutting the gates they refused, in their great excitement, to receive the fugitives into the city, fearing that the enemy would rush in with them. And such of the fugitives as had not already got inside the fortifications, crossed the moat, and standing with their backs braced against the wall were trembling with fear, and stood there forgetful of all valour and utterly unable to ward off the barbarians, although they were pressing upon them and were about to cross the moat to attack them. And the reason was that most of them had lost their spears, which had been broken in the engagement and during the flight, and they were not able to use their bows because they were huddled so closely together. Now so long as not many defenders were seen at the battlement, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> kept pressing on, having hopes of destroying all those who had been shut out and of overpowering the men who held the circuit-wall. But when they saw a very great number both of soldiers and of the Roman populace at the battlements defending the wall, they immediately abandoned their purpose and rode off thence to the rear, heaping much abuse upon their opponents. And the battle, having begun at the camps of the barbarians, ended at the moat and the wall of the city.</p>                        </div>

Foot-soldiers also went out from both sides, not, however, arrayed in a phalanx, but accompanying the horsemen. And once <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> in the first rush dashed in among the enemy carrying his spear and killed three of their best horsemen and turned the rest to flight. And another time, when Constantinus had led out the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> in the Plain of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> in the late afternoon, and saw that they were being overpowered by the superior numbers of their opponents, he took the following measures. There has been in that place from of old a great stadium where the gladiators of the city used to fight in former times, and the men of old built many other buildings round about this stadium; consequently there are, as one would expect, narrow passages all about this place. Now on the occasion in question, since Constantinus could neither overcome the throng of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> nor flee without great danger, he caused all the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> to dismount from their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and on foot, in company with them, took his stand in one of the narrow passages there. Then by shooting from that safe position they slew large numbers of the enemy. And for some time the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> withstood their missiles. For they hoped, as soon as the supply of missiles in the quivers of the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> should be exhausted, to be able to surround them without any trouble, take them prisoners, and lead them back to their camp. But since the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a>, who were not only good bowmen but also had a dense throng to shoot into, hit an enemy with practically every shot, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> perceived that above half their number had perished, and since the sun was about to set, they knew not what to do and so rushed off in flight. Then indeed many of them fell; for the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a> followed them up, and since they know how to shoot the bow with the greatest accuracy even when running at great speed, they continued to discharge their arrows no less than before, shooting at their backs, and kept up the slaughter. And thus Constantinus with his <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> came back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> at night. <br />And when Peranius, not many days later, led some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> through the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPSa class=place long=12.4985 lat=41.9107>Salarian</a> Gate against the enemy, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, indeed, fled as hard as they could, but about sunset a counter-pursuit was made suddenly, and a Roman foot-soldier, becoming greatly confused, fell into a deep hole, many of which were made there by the men of old, for the storage of grain, I suppose. And he did not dare to cry out, supposing that the enemy were encamped near by, and was not able in any way whatever to get out of the pit, for it afforded no means of climbing up; he was therefore compelled to pass the night there. Now on the next day, when the barbarians had again been put to flight, one of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> fell into the same hole. And there the two men were reconciled to mutual friendship and good-will, brought together as they were by their necessity, and they exchanged solemn pledges, each that he would work earnestly for the salvation of the other; and then both of them began shouting with loud and frantic cries. Now the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, following the sound, came and peered over the edge of the hole, and enquired who it was who shouted. At this, the Roman, in accordance with the plan decided upon by the two men, kept silence, and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goth</a> in his native tongue said that he had just recently fallen in there during the rout which had taken place, and asked them to let down a rope that he might come up. And they as quickly as possible threw down the ends of ropes, and, as they thought, were pulling up the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goth</a>, but the Roman laid hold of the ropes and was pulled up, saying only that if he should go up first the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> would never abandon their comrade, but if they should learn that merely one of the enemy was there they would take no account of him. So saying, he went up. And when the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> saw him, they wondered and were in great perplexity, but upon hearing the whole story from him they drew up his comrade next, and he told them of the agreement they had made and of the pledges both had given. So he went off with his companions, and the Roman was released unharmed and permitted to return to the city. After this horsemen in no great numbers armed themselves many times for battle, but the struggles always ended in single combats, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were victorious in all of them. Such, then, was the course of these events. <br />A little after this an engagement took place in the Plain of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, wherein various small groups of horsemen were engaged in pursuing their opponents in various directions; in one group was Chorsamantis, a man of note among the guards of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, by birth a <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagete</a>, who with some others was pursuing seventy of the enemy. And when he had got well out in the plain the other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> rode back, but Chorsamantis went on with the pursuit alone. As soon as the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> perceived this, they turned their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> about and came against him. And he advanced into their midst, killed one of the best of them with his spear, and then went after the others, but they again turned and rushed off in flight. But they were ashamed before their comrades in the camp, who, they suspected, could already see them, and wished to attack him again. They had, however, precisely the same experience as before and lost one of their best men, and so turned to flight in spite of their shame, and after Chorsamantis had pursued them as far as their stockade he returned alone. And a little later, in another battle, this man was wounded in the left shin, and it was his opinion that the weapon had merely grazed the bone. However, he was rendered unfit for fighting for a certain number of days by reason of this wound, and since he was a barbarian he did not endure this patiently, but threatened that he would right speedily have vengeance upon the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> for this insult to his leg. So when not long afterwards he had recovered and was drunk at lunch time, as was his custom, he purposed to go alone against the enemy and avenge the insult to his leg; and when he had come to the small <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPPi class=place long=12.4883 lat=41.9094>Pincian Gate</a> he stated that he was sent by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> to the enemy's camp. And the guards at the gate, who could not doubt the word of a man who was the best of the guards of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, opened the gates and allowed him to go wherever he would. And when the enemy spied him, they thought at first that some deserter was coming over to them, but when he came near and put his hand to his bow, twenty men, not knowing who he might be, went out against him. These he easily drove off, and then began to ride back at a walk, and when more <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> came against him he did not flee. But when a great throng gathered about him and he still insisted upon fighting them, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, watching the sight from the towers, suspected that the man was crazy, but they did not yet know that it was Chorsamantis. At length, after making a display of great and very noteworthy deeds, he found himself surrounded by the army of the enemy, and paid the penalty for his unreasonable daring. And when <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and the Roman army learned this, they mourned greatly, lamenting that the hope which all placed in the man had come to naught.</p>                        </div>

And fearing lest the enemy should come upon him on the road and both rob him of the money and kill him, he wrote to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> requesting him to make the journey to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> safe for him. <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> accordingly selected one hundred men of note from among his own bodyguards and sent them with two spearmen to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413133UTar class=place long=13.2486 lat=41.292>Taracina</a> to assist him in bringing the money. And at the same time he kept trying to make the barbarians believe that he was about to fight with his whole army, his purpose being to prevent any of the enemy from leaving the vicinity, either to bring in provisions or for any other purpose. But when he found out that Euthalius and his men would arrive on the morrow, he arrayed his army and set it in order for battle, and the barbarians were in readiness. Now throughout the whole forenoon he merely held his soldiers near the gates; for he knew that Euthalius and those who accompanied him would arrive at night. Then, at midday, he commanded the army to take their lunch, and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> did the same thing, supposing that he was putting off the engagement to the following day. A little later, however, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> sent <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> and <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> to the Plain of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> with the troops under their command, directing them to throw the enemy's camp into the greatest possible confusion. And from the small <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPPi class=place long=12.4883 lat=41.9094>Pincian Gate</a> he sent out six hundred horsemen against the camps of the barbarians, placing them under command of three of his own spearmen, Artasires, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, and Bochas, of the race of the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a>, and Cutilas, a Thracian. And many of the enemy came out to meet them. For a long time, however, the battle did not come to close quarters, but each side kept retreating when the other advanced and making pursuits in which they quickly turned back, until it looked as if they intended to spend the rest of the day at this sort of thing. But as they continued, they began at last to be filled with rage against each other. The battle then settled down to a fierce struggle in which many of the best men on both sides fell, and support came up for each of the two armies, both from the city and from the camps. And when these fresh troops were mingled with the fighters the struggle became still greater. And the shouting which filled the city and the camps terrified the combatants. But finally the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> by their valour forced back the enemy and routed them. <br />In this action Cutilas was struck in the middle of the head by a javelin, and he kept on pursuing with the javelin still embedded in his head. And after the rout had taken place, he rode into the city at about sunset together with the other survivors, the javelin in his head waving about, a most extraordinary sight. During the same encounter Arzes, one of the guards of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, was hit by one of the Gothic archers between the nose and the right eye. And the point of the arrow penetrated as far as the neck behind, but it did not shew through, and the rest of the shaft projected from his face and shook as the man rode. And when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> saw him and Cutilas they marvelled greatly that both men continued to ride, paying no heed to their hurt. Such, then, was the course of events in that quarter. <br />But in the Plain of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> the barbarians had the upper hand. For the men of <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> and <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a>, fighting with a great multitude of the enemy, withstood them stoutly, to be sure, but suffered most terribly, and came into exceedingly great danger. And then <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> commanded Bochas to take his troops, which had returned from the engagement unwearied, men as well as <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and go to the Plain of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>. Now it was already late in the day. And when the men under Bochas had come to the assistance of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, suddenly the barbarians were turned to flight, and Bochas, who had impetuously followed the pursuit to a great distance, came to be surrounded by twelve of the enemy, who carried spears. And they all struck him at once with their spears. But his corselet withstood the other blows, which therefore did not hurt him much; but one of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> succeeded in hitting him from behind, at a place where his body was uncovered, above the right armpit, very close to the shoulder, and smote the youth, though not with a mortal stroke, nor even one which brought him into danger of death. But another <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goth</a> struck him in front and pierced his left thigh, and cut the muscles there; it was not a straight blow, however, but only a slanting cut. But <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> and <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> saw what was happening, and coming to his rescue as quickly as possible, they routed the enemy, and both took hold of the bridle of Bochas' <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and so came into the city. Then night came on and Euthalius entered the city with the money. <br />And when all had returned to the city, they attended to the wounded men. Now in the case of Arzes, though the physicians wished to draw the weapon from his face, they were for some time reluctant to do so, not so much on account of the eye, which they supposed could not possibly be saved, but for fear lest, by the cutting of membranes and tissues such as are very numerous in that region, they should cause the death of a man who was one of the best of the household of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. But afterwards one of the physicians, Theoctistus by name, pressed on the back of his neck and asked whether he felt much pain. And when the man said that he did feel pain, he said, Then both you yourself will be saved and your sight will not be injured. And he made this declaration because he inferred that the barb of the weapon had penetrated to a point not far from the skin. Accordingly he cut off that part of the shaft which shewed outside and threw it away, and cutting open the skin at the back of the head, at the place where the man felt the most pain, he easily drew toward him the barb, which with its three sharp points now stuck out behind and brought with it the remaining portion of the weapon. Thus Arzes remained entirely free from serious harm, and not even a trace of his wound was left on his face. But as for Cutilas, when the javelin was drawn rather violently from his head (for it was very deeply embedded), he fell into a swoon. And since the membranes about the wound began to be inflamed, he fell a victim to phrenitis and died not long afterwards. Bochas, however, immediately had a very severe hemorrhage in the thigh, and seemed like one who was presently to die. And the reason for the hemorrhage, according to what the physicians said, was that the blow had severed the muscle, not directly from the front, but by a slanting cut. In any event he died three days later. Because of these things, then, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> spent that whole night in deep grief; while from the Gothic camps were heard many sounds of wailing and loud lamentation. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> indeed wondered, because they thought that no calamity of any consequence had befallen the enemy on the previous day, except, to be sure, that no small number of them had perished in the encounters. This had happened to them before in no less degree, perhaps even to a greater degree, but it had not greatly distressed them, so great were their numbers. However, it was learned on the following day that men of the greatest note from the camp in the Plain of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> were being bewailed by the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, men whom Bochas had killed in his first charge. <br />And other encounters also, though of no great importance, took place, which it has seemed to me unnecessary to chronicle. This, however, I will state, that altogether sixty-seven encounters occurred during this siege, besides two final ones which will be described in the following narrative. And at that time the winter drew to its close, and thus ended the second year of this war, the history of which <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> has written.</p>                        </div>

There was still, it is true, some grain for the soldiers, though no other kind of provisions, but the grain-supply of the rest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had been exhausted, and actual famine as well as pestilence was pressing hard upon them. And the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, perceiving this, no longer cared to risk a decisive battle with their enemy, but they kept guard that nothing in future should be brought in to them. Now there are two aqueducts between the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPAp class=place long=12.5016 lat=41.8734>Appian Way</a>s, exceedingly high and carried on arches for a great distance. These two aqueducts meet at a place fifty stades distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and cross each other, so that for a little space they reverse their relative position. For the one which previously lay to the right from then on continues on the left side. And again coming together, they resume their former places, and thereafter remain apart. Consequently the space between them, enclosed, as it is, by the aqueducts, comes to be a fortress. And the barbarians walled up the lower arches of the aqueducts here with stones and mud and in this way gave it the form of a fort, and encamping there to the number of no fewer than seven thousand men, they kept guard that no provisions should thereafter be brought into the city by the enemy. <br />Then indeed every hope of better things abandoned the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and every form of evil encompassed them round about. As long as there was ripe grain, however, the most daring of the soldiers, led on by lust of money, went by night to the grain-fields not far from the city mounted on <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and leading other <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> after them. Then they cut off the heads of grain, and putting them on the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> which they led, would carry them into the city without being seen by the enemy and sell them at a great price to such of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> as were wealthy. But the other inhabitants lived on various herbs such as grow in abundance not only in the outskirts but also inside the fortifications. For the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> is never lacking in herbs either in winter or at any other season, but they always flourish and grow luxuriantly at all times. Wherefore the besieged also pastured their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> in those places. And some too made sausages of the mules that died in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and secretly sold them. But when the corn-lands had no more grain and all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had come into an exceedingly evil plight, they surrounded <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and tried to compel him to stake everything on a single battle with the enemy, promising that not one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> would be absent from the engagement. And when he was at a loss what to do in that situation and greatly distressed, some of the populace spoke to him as follows: <br />General, we were not prepared for the fortune which has overtaken us at the present time; on the contrary, what has happened has been altogether the opposite of our expectations. For after achieving what we had formerly set our hearts upon, we have now come into the present misfortune, and we realize at length that our previous opinion that we did well to crave the emperor's watchful care was but folly and the beginning of the greatest evils. Indeed, this course has brought us to such straits that at the present time we have taken courage to use force once more and to arm ourselves against the barbarians. And while we may claim forgiveness if we boldly come into the presence of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> — for the belly knows not shame when it lacks its necessities — our plight must be the apology for our rashness; for it will be readily agreed that there is no plight more intolerable for men than a life prolonged amid the adversities of fortune. And as to the fortune which has fallen upon us, you cannot fail to see our distress. These fields and the whole country have fallen under the hand of the enemy; and this city has been shut off from all good things for we know not how long a time. And as for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, some already lie in death, and it has not been their portion to be hidden in the earth, and we who survive, to put all our terrible misfortunes in a word, only pray to be placed beside those who lie thus. For starvation shews to those upon whom it comes that all other evils can be endured, and wherever it appears it is attended by oblivion of all other sufferings, and causes all other forms of death, except that which proceeds from itself, to seem pleasant to men. Now, therefore, before the evil has yet mastered us, grant us leave on our own behalf to take up the struggle, which will result either in our overcoming the enemy or in deliverance from our troubles. For when delay brings men hope of safety, it would be great folly for them prematurely to enter into a danger which involves their all, but when tarrying makes the struggle more difficult, to put off action even for a little time is more reprehensible than immediate and precipitate haste. <br />So spoke the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> replied as follows: Well, as for me, I have been quite prepared for your conduct in every respect, and nothing that has happened has been contrary to my expectation. For long have I known that a populace is a most unreasoning thing, and that by its very nature it cannot endure the present or provide for the future, but only knows how rashly in every case to attempt the impossible and recklessly to destroy itself. But as for me, I shall never, willingly at least, be led by your carelessness either to destroy you or to involve the emperor's cause in ruin with you. For war is wont to be brought to a successful issue, not by unreasoning haste, but by the use of good counsel and forethought in estimating the turn of the scale at decisive moments. You, however, act as though you were playing at dice, and want to risk all on a single cast; but it is not my custom to choose the short course in preference to the advantageous one. In the second place, you promise that you will help us do battle against the enemy; but when have you ever taken training in war? Or who that has learned such things by the use of arms does not know that battle affords no room for experiment? Nor does the enemy, on his part, give opportunity, while the struggle is on, to practise on him. This time, indeed, I admire your zeal and forgive you for making this disturbance; but that you have taken this action at an unseasonable time and that the policy of waiting which we are following is prudent, I shall now make clear. The emperor has gathered for us from the whole earth and despatched an army too great to number, and a fleet such as was never brought together by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> now covers the shore of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a> and the greater part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a>. And within a few days these reinforcements will come to us and bring with them all kinds of provisions, to put an end to our destitution and to bury the camps of the barbarians under a multitude of missiles. I have therefore reasoned that it was better to put off the time of conflict until they are present, and thus gain the victory in the war with safety, than to make a show of daring in unreasoning haste and thus throw away the salvation of our whole cause. To secure their immediate arrival and to prevent their loitering longer shall be my concern.</p>                        </div>

For a rumour was going about that the emperor had sent an army there. And he commissioned him to load as many ships as possible with grain, to gather all the soldiers who at the moment had arrived from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, or had been left about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> in charge of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> or for any other purpose whatever — for he had heard that many such were coming to the various places in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a> — and to withdraw some of the men from the garrisons there, and then to come back with them, convoying the grain to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Ostia</a>, where the harbour of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> was. And <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a>, accompanied by Mundilas the guardsman and a few horsemen, passed out by night through the gate which bears the name of the Apostle Paul, eluding the enemy's camp which had been established very close to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPAp class=place long=12.5016 lat=41.8734>Appian Way</a> to keep guard over it. And when Mundilas and his men, returning to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, announced that <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> had already arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a> without meeting any of the barbarians, — for at night, they said, the enemy never went outside their camp, — everybody became hopeful, and <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, now emboldened, devised the following plan. He sent out many of his horsemen to the neighbouring strongholds, directing them, in case any of the enemy should come that way in order to bring provisions into their camps, that they should constantly make sallies upon them from their positions and lay ambushes everywhere about this region, and thus keep them from succeeding; on the contrary, they should with all their might hedge them in, so that the city might be in less distress than formerly through lack of provisions, and also that the barbarians might seem to be besieged rather than to be themselves besieging the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. So he commanded <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> and <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> with a thousand men to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413133UTar class=place long=13.2486 lat=41.292>Taracina</a>. And with them he sent also his wife Antonina, commanding that she be sent with a few men to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>, there to await in safety the fortune which would befall the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. And he sent <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a> and Sinthues the guardsman, who took with them about five hundred men, to the fortress of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a>, one hundred and forty stades distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. But to the town of Albani, which was situated on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPAp class=place long=12.5016 lat=41.8734>Appian Way</a> at the same distance from the city, he had already, as it happened, sent <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> with a number of <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>, and these the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had driven out from there by force not long afterward. <br />Now there is a certain church of the Apostle Paul, fourteen stades distant from the fortifications of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> River flows beside it. In that place there is no fortification, but a colonnade extends all the way from the city to the church, and many other buildings which are round about it render the place not easy of access. But the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> shew a certain degree of actual respect for sanctuaries such as this. And indeed during the whole time of the war no harm came to either church of the two Apostles at their hands, but all the rites were performed in them by the priests in the usual manner. At this spot, then, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> commanded <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> to take all the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> and make a stockade by the bank of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, in order that their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> might be kept in greater security and that the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> might be still further checked from going at their pleasure to great distances from their camps. And <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> acted accordingly. Then, after the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> had made their camp in the place where the general directed, he rode back to the city. <br />So <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, having accomplished this, remained quiet, not offering battle, but eager to carry on the defence from the wall, if anyone should advance against it from outside with evil intent. And he also furnished grain to some of the Roman populace. But <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> and <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> passed by night between the camps of the enemy, and after reaching <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413133UTar class=place long=13.2486 lat=41.292>Taracina</a> sent Antonina with a few men into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>; and they themselves took possession of the fortified places in that district, and using them as their bases of operations and making thence their sudden attacks, they checked such of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> as were moving about in that region. As for <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a> and Sinthues, in a short time they rebuilt such parts of the fortress as had fallen into ruin, and as soon as they had put themselves in safety, they began immediately to make more trouble for the enemy, whose fortress was not far away, not only by making frequent raids upon them, but also by keeping such of the barbarians as were escorting provision-trains in a constant state of terror by the unexpectedness of their movements; but finally Sinthues was wounded in his right hand by a spear in a certain battle, and since the sinews were severed, he became thereafter unfit for fighting. And the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> likewise, after they had made their camp near by, as I have said, were on their part causing the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> no less trouble, so that these as well as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were now feeling the pressure of famine, since they no longer had freedom to bring in their food-supplies as formerly. And pestilence too fell upon them and was destroying many, and especially in the camp which they had last made, close by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPAp class=place long=12.5016 lat=41.8734>Appian Way</a>, as I have previously stated. And the few of their number who had not perished withdrew from that camp to the other camps. The <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> also suffered in the same way, and so returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. Such was the course of events here. But as for <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a>, when he reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>, he collected not fewer than five hundred soldiers there, loaded a great number of ships with grain, and held them in readiness. And he was joined not long afterwards by Antonina, who immediately assisted him in making arrangements for the fleet. <br />At that time the mountain of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408144LVes class=place long=14.425 lat=40.8216>Vesuvius</a> rumbled, and though it did not break forth in eruption, still because of the rumbling it led people to expect with great certainty that there would be an eruption. And for this reason it came to pass that the inhabitants fell into great terror. Now this mountain is seventy stades distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> and lies to the north of it — an exceedingly steep mountain, whose lower parts spread out wide on all sides, while its upper portion is precipitous and exceedingly difficult of ascent. But on the summit of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408144LVes class=place long=14.425 lat=40.8216>Vesuvius</a> and at about the centre of it appears a cavern of such depth that one would judge that it extends all the way to the bottom of the mountain. And it is possible to see fire there, if one should dare to peer over the edge, and although the flames as a rule merely twist and turn upon one another, occasioning no trouble to the inhabitants of that region, yet, when the mountain gives forth a rumbling sound which resembles bellowing, it generally sends up not long afterward a great quantity of ashes. And if anyone travelling on the road is caught by this terrible shower, he cannot possibly survive, and if it falls upon houses, they too fall under the weight of the great quantity of ashes. But whenever it so happens that a strong wind comes on, the ashes rise to a great height, so that they are no longer visible to the eye, and are borne wherever the wind which drives them goes, falling on lands exceedingly far away. And once, they say, they fell in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and so terrified the people there, that from that time up to the present the whole city has seen fit to propitiate God with prayers every year; and at another time they fell on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329132UOea class=place long=13.1758 lat=32.8999>Tripolis</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. Formerly this rumbling took place, they say, once in a hundred years or even more, but in later times it has happened much more frequently. This, however, they declare emphatically, that whenever <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408144LVes class=place long=14.425 lat=40.8216>Vesuvius</a> belches forth these ashes, the country round about is bound to flourish with an abundance of all crops. Furthermore, the air on this mountain is very light and by its nature the most favourable to health in the world. And indeed those who are attacked by consumption have been sent to this place by physicians from remote times. So much, then, may be said regarding <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408144LVes class=place long=14.425 lat=40.8216>Vesuvius</a>.</p>                        </div>

And it happened that <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> with three hundred horsemen had already reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> by way of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413148RSam class=place long=14.8 lat=41.3>Samnium</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPLa class=place long=12.5023 lat=41.8766>Via Latina</a>. And when John with all the others came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>, provided with many waggons by the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=place long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabria</a>, his troops were joined by five hundred men who, as I have said, had been collected in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>. These set out by the coast road with the waggons, having in mind, if any hostile force should confront them, to make a circle of the waggons in the form of a stockade and thus to ward off the enemy; and they commanded the men under <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> and <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a> to sail with all speed and join them at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Ostia</a>, the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> [153]; and they put sufficient grain in the waggons and loaded all the ships, not only with grain, but also with wine and all kinds of provisions. And they, indeed, expected to find the forces of <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> and <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> in the neighbourhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413133UTar class=place long=13.2486 lat=41.292>Taracina</a> and to have their company from that point on, but when they approached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413133UTar class=place long=13.2486 lat=41.292>Taracina</a>, they learned that these forces had recently been recalled and had retired to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. <br />But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, learning that the forces of John were approaching and fearing that the enemy might confront them in greatly superior numbers and destroy them, took the following measures. It so happened that the enemy had encamped very close to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPFl class=place long=12.4759 lat=41.9115>Flaminian</a> Gate; this gate <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> himself had blocked up at the beginning of this war by a structure of stone, as has been told by me in the previous narrative, his purpose of course being to make it difficult for the enemy either to force their way in or to make any attempt upon the city at that point. Consequently no engagement had taken place at this gate, and the barbarians had no suspicion that there would be any attack upon them from there. Now <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> tore down by night the masonry which blocked this gate, without giving notice to anyone at all, and made ready the greatest part of the army there. And at daybreak he sent <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> and <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> with a thousand horsemen through the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPPi class=place long=12.4883 lat=41.9094>Pincian Gate</a>, commanding them to shoot missiles into the camps, and as soon as their opponents came against them, to flee without the least shame and to ride up to the fortifications at full speed. And he also stationed some men inside this gate. So the men under <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> began to harass the barbarians, as <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had directed them to do, and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, gathering from all the camps, began to defend themselves. And both armies began to move as fast as they could toward the fortifications of the city, the one giving the appearance of fleeing, and the other supposing that they were pursuing the enemy. <br />But as soon as <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> saw the enemy take up the pursuit, he opened the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPFl class=place long=12.4759 lat=41.9115>Flaminian Gate</a> and sent his army out against the barbarians, who were thus taken unawares. Now it so happened that one of the Gothic camps was on the road near this gate, and in front of it there was a narrow passage between steep banks which was exceedingly difficult of access. And one of the barbarians, a man of splendid physique and clad in a corselet, when he saw the enemy advancing, reached this place before them and took his stand there, at the same time calling his comrades and urging them to help in guarding the narrow passage. But before any move could be made Mundilas slew him and thereafter allowed none of the barbarians to go into this passage. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> therefore passed through it without encountering opposition, and some of them, arriving at the Gothic camp near by, for a short time tried to take it, but were unable to do so because of the strength of the stockade, although not many barbarians had been left behind in it. For the trench had been dug to an extraordinary depth, and since the earth taken from it had invariably been placed along its inner side, this reached a great height and so served as a wall [155]; and it was abundantly supplied with stakes, which were very sharp and close together, thus making a palisade. These defences so emboldened the barbarians that they began to repel the enemy vigorously. But one of the guards of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, Aquilinus by name, an exceedingly active man, seized a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> by the bridle and, bestriding it, leaped from the trench into the middle of the camp, where he slew some of the enemy. And when his opponents gathered about him and hurled great numbers of missiles, the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> was wounded and fell, but he himself unexpectedly made his escape through the midst of the enemy. So he went on foot with his companions toward the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPPi class=place long=12.4883 lat=41.9094>Pincian Gate</a>. And overtaking the barbarians, who were still engaged in pursuing Roman horsemen, they began to shoot at them from behind and killed some of them. <br />Now when <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> and his men perceived this, since they had meanwhile been reinforced by the horsemen who had been standing near by in readiness, they charged at full speed against their pursuers. Then at length the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, being now outgeneraled and unexpectedly caught between the forces of their enemy, began to be killed indiscriminately. And there was great slaughter of them, and very few escaped to their camps, and that with difficulty; meanwhile the others, fearing for the safety of all their strongholds, shut themselves in and remained in them thereafter, thinking that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> would come against them without the least delay. In this action one of the barbarians shot <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> in the face, above the right eye and not far from the nose. And the whole of the iron point, penetrated the head and disappeared entirely, although the barb on it was large and exceedingly long, but the remainder of the arrow immediately fell to the ground without the application of force by anyone, in my opinion because the iron point had never been securely fastened to the shaft. <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>, however, paid no heed to this at all, but continued none the less killing and pursuing the enemy. But in the fifth year afterward the tip of the iron of its own accord began to project visibly from his face. And this is now the third year since it has been slowly but steadily coming out. It is to be expected, therefore, that the whole barb will eventually come out, though not for a long time. But it has not been an impediment to the man in any way. So much then for these matters.</p>                        </div>

And when they learned that still another army had come to their enemy from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> both by land and by sea — not being informed as to its actual size, but supposing it to be as large as the free play of rumour was able to make it, — they became terrified at the danger and began to plan for their departure. They accordingly sent three envoys to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, one of whom was a Roman of note among the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, and he, coming before <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, spoke as follows: <br />That the war has not turned out to the advantage of either side each of us knows well, since we both have had actual experience of its hardships. For why should anyone in either army deny facts of which neither now remains in ignorance. And no one, I think, could deny, at least no one who does not lack understanding, that it is only senseless men who choose to go on suffering indefinitely merely to satisfy the contentious spirit which moves them for the moment, and refuse to find a solution of the troubles which harass them. And whenever this situation arises, it is the duty of the commanders on both sides not to sacrifice the lives of their subjects to their own glory, but to choose the course which is just and expedient, not for themselves alone, but also for their opponents, and thus to put an end to present hardships. For moderation in one's demands affords a way out of all difficulties, but it is the very nature of contentiousness that it cannot accomplish any of the objects which are essential. Now we, on our part, have deliberated concerning the conclusion of this war and have come before you with proposals which are of advantage to both sides, wherein we waive, as we think, some portion even of our rights. And see to it that you likewise in your deliberations do not yield to a spirit of contentiousness respecting us and thus destroy yourselves as well as us, in preference to choosing the course which will be of advantage to yourselves. And it is fitting that both sides should state their case, not in continuous speech, but each interrupting the other on the spur of the moment, if anything that is said shall seem inappropriate. For in this way each side will be able to say briefly whatever it is minded to say, and at the same time the essential things will be accomplished. <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> replied: There will be nothing to prevent the debate from proceeding in the manner you suggest, only let the words spoken by you be words of peace and of justice. <br />So the ambassadors of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> in their turn said: You have done us an injustice, O Romans, in taking up arms wrongfully against us, your friends and allies. And what we shall say is, we think, well known to each one of you as well as to ourselves. For the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> did not obtain the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> by wresting it from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> by force, but <a href=/people/12063 target=_blank>Odoacer</a> in former times dethroned the emperor, changed the government of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> to a tyranny, and so held it. And <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>, who then held the power of the East, though he wished to avenge his partner in the imperial office and to free this land from the usurper, was unable to destroy the authority of <a href=/people/12063 target=_blank>Odoacer</a>. Accordingly he persuaded <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>, our ruler, although he was on the point of besieging him and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, not only to put an end to his hostility towards himself, in recollection of the honour which <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> had already received at his hands in having been made a patrician and consul of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, but also to punish <a href=/people/12063 target=_blank>Odoacer</a> for his unjust treatment of Augustulus, and thereafter, in company with the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, to hold sway over the land as its legitimate and rightful rulers. It was in this way, therefore, that we took over the dominion of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and we have preserved both the laws and the form of government as strictly as any who have ever been Roman emperors, and there is absolutely no law, either written or unwritten, introduced by <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> or by any of his successors on the throne of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. And we have so scrupulously guarded for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> their practices pertaining to the worship of God and faith in Him, that not one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a> has changed his belief, either willingly or unwillingly, up to the present day, and when <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> have changed, we have taken no notice of the matter. And indeed the sanctuaries of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> have received from us the highest honour; for no one who has taken refuge in any of them has ever been treated with violence by any man; nay, more, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> themselves have continued to hold all the offices of the state, and not a single <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goth</a> has had a share in them. Let someone come forward and refute us, if he thinks that this statement of ours is not true. And one might add that the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> have conceded that the dignity of the consulship should be conferred upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> each year by the emperor of the East. Such has been the course followed by us; but you, on your side, did not take the part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> while it was suffering at the hands of the barbarians and <a href=/people/12063 target=_blank>Odoacer</a>, although it was not for a short time, but for ten years, that he treated the land outrageously; but now you do violence to us who have acquired it legitimately, though you have no business here. Do you therefore depart hence out of our way, keeping both that which is your own and whatever you have gained by plunder. <br />And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> said: Although your promise gave us to understand that your words would be brief and temperate, yet your discourse has been both long and not far from fraudulent in its pretensions. For <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> was sent by the Emperor <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> in order to make war on <a href=/people/12063 target=_blank>Odoacer</a>, not in order to hold the dominion of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> for himself. For why should the emperor have been concerned to exchange one tyrant for another? But he sent him in order that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> might be free and obedient to the emperor. And though <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> disposed of the tyrant in a satisfactory manner, in everything else he shewed an extraordinary lack of proper feeling; for he never thought of restoring the land to its rightful owner. But I, for my part, think that he who robs another by violence and he who of his own will does not restore his neighbour's goods are equal. Now, as for me, I shall never surrender the emperor's country to any other. But if there is anything you wish to receive in place of it, I give you leave to speak. <br />And the barbarians said: That everything which we have said is true no one of you can be unaware. But in order that we may not seem to be contentious, we give up to you <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, great as it is and of such wealth, seeing that without it you cannot possess <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> in security. <br />And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> replied: And we on our side permit the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> to have the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>, which is much larger than <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and was subject to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in early times. For it is only fair to make an equal return to those who first do a good deed or perform a kindness. <br />The barbarians: Well, then, if we should make you a proposal concerning <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a> also, or about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> itself, will you listen to it? <br /><a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>: No, for we are not empowered to administer the emperor's affairs in a way which is not in accord with his wish. <br />The barbarians: Not even if we impose upon ourselves the payment of a fixed sum of money every year? <br /><a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>: No, indeed. For we are not empowered to do anything else than guard the land for its owner. <br />The barbarians: Come now, we must send envoys to the emperor and make with him our treaty concerning the whole matter. And a definite time must also be appointed during which the armies will be bound to observe an armistice. <br /><a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>: Very well; let this be done. For never shall I stand in your way when you are making plans for peace. <br />After saying these things they each left the conference, and the envoys of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> withdrew to their own camp. And during the ensuing days they visited each other frequently and made the arrangements for the armistice, and they agreed that each side should put into the hands of the other some of its notable men as hostages to ensure the keeping of the armistice.</p>                        </div>

And when night came on <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Ostia</a> with a hundred horsemen, and after telling what had taken place in the engagement and the agreement which had been made between the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and otherwise encouraging them, he bade them bring their cargoes and come with all zeal to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. For, he said, I shall take care that the journey is free from danger. So he himself at early dawn rode back to the city, and Antonina together with the commanders began at daybreak to consider means of transporting the cargoes. But it seemed to them that the task was a hard one and beset with the greatest difficulties. For the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> could hold out no longer, but all lay half-dead, and, furthermore, it was dangerous to travel over a rather narrow road with the waggons, and impossible to tow the barges on the river, as had formerly been the custom. For the road which is on the left of the river was held by the enemy, as stated by me in the previous narrative, and not available for the use of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> at that time, while the road on the other side of it is altogether unused, at least that part of it which follows the river-bank. They therefore selected the small boats belonging to the larger ships, put a fence of high planks around them on all sides, in order that the men on board might not be exposed to the enemy's shots, and embarked archers and sailors on them in numbers suitable for each boat. And after they had loaded the boats with all the freight they could carry, they waited for a favouring wind and set sail toward <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, and a portion of the army followed them along the right bank of the river to support them. But they left a large number of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> to guard the ships. Now where the course of the river was straight, they found no trouble in sailing, simply raising the sails of the boats; but where the stream wound about and took a course athwart the wind, and the sails received no impulse from it, the sailors had no slight toil in rowing and forcing the boats against the current. As for the barbarians, they sat in their camps and had no wish to hinder their enemy, either because they were terrified at the danger, or because they thought that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> would never by such means succeed in bringing in any provisions, and considered it contrary to their own interest, when a matter of no consequence was involved, to frustrate their hope of the armistice which <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had already promised. Moreover, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> who were in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a>, though they could see their enemy constantly sailing by almost near enough to touch, made no move against them, but sat there wondering in amazement at the plan they had hit upon. And when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had made the voyage up the river many times in the same way, and had thus conveyed all the cargoes into the city without interference, the sailors took the ships and withdrew with all speed, for it was already about the time of the winter solstice; and the rest of the army entered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, except, indeed, that <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> remained in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Ostia</a> with some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a>. <br />And afterwards they gave hostages to one another to secure the keeping of the armistice, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> giving <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>, and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> Ulias, a man of no mean station, with the understanding that during three months they should make no attack upon one another, until the envoys should return from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and report the will of the emperor. And even if the one side or the other should initiate offences against their opponents, the envoys were nevertheless to be returned to their own nation. So the envoys of the barbarians went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> escorted by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and Ildiger, the son-in-law of Antonina, came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> with not a few horsemen. And the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> who were holding the stronghold at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a> abandoned the place by the order of <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> because their supplies were exhausted, and came to the camp in obedience to his summons. Whereupon <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> with his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> came from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Ostia</a> and took possession of it and held it. Now the chief reason why these barbarians were without provisions was that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> commanded the sea and did not allow any of the necessary supplies to be brought in to them. And it was for this reason that they also abandoned at about the same time a sea-coast city of great importance, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421118UCCe class=place long=11.7921 lat=42.091>Centumcellae</a> by name, that is, because they were short of provisions. This city is large and populous, lying to the west of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscia</a>, distant from it about two hundred and eighty stades. And after taking possession of it the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> went on and extended their power still more, for they took also the town of Albani, which lies to the east of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, the enemy having evacuated it at that time for the same reason, and they had already surrounded the barbarians on all sides and now held them between their forces. The <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, therefore, were in a mood to break the agreement and do some harm to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. So they sent envoys to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and asserted that they had been unjustly treated during a truce; for when <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> had summoned the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> who were in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a> to perform some service for him, <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> had seized and taken possession of the fort there for no good reason. And they made this same false charge regarding Albani and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421118UCCe class=place long=11.7921 lat=42.091>Centumcellae</a>, and threatened that, unless he should give these places back to them, they would resent it. But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> laughed and sent them away, saying that this charge was but a pretext, and that no one was ignorant of the reason why the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had abandoned these places. And thereafter the two sides were somewhat suspicious of one another. <br />But later, when <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> saw that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was abundantly supplied with soldiers, he sent many horsemen to places far distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and commanded John, the nephew of Vitalian, and the horsemen under his command, eight hundred in number, to pass the winter near the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=place long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alba</a>, which lies in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a>; and with him he sent four hundred of the men of <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>, whom <a href=/people/4137 target=_blank>Damianus</a>, the nephew of <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>, commanded, and eight hundred men of his own guards who were especially able warriors. And in command of these he put two spearmen, Suntas and Adegis, and ordered them to follow John wherever he should lead; and he gave John instructions that as long as he saw the enemy was keeping the agreement made between them, he should remain quiet; but whenever he found that the armistice had been violated by them, he should do as follows: With his whole force he was to make a sudden raid and overrun the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a>, visiting all the districts of that region and reaching each one before the report of his coming. For in this whole land there was virtually not a single man left, since all, as it appeared, had marched against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, but everywhere there were women and children of the enemy and money. He was instructed, therefore, to enslave or plunder whatever he found, taking care never to injure any of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> living there. And if he should happen upon any place which had men and defences, as he probably would, he was to make an attempt upon it with his whole force. And if he was able to capture it, he was to go forward, but if it should so happen that his attempt was unsuccessful, he was to march back or remain there. For if he should go forward and leave such a fortress in his rear, he would be involved in the greatest danger, since his men would never be able to defend themselves easily, if they should be harassed by their opponents. He was also to keep the whole booty intact, in order that it might be divided fairly and properly among the army. Then with a laugh he added this also: For it is not fair that the drones should be destroyed with great labour by one force, while others, without having endured any hardship at all, enjoy the honey. So after giving these instructions, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> sent John with his army. <br />And at about the same time Datius, the priest of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Milan</a>, and some notable men among the citizens came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and begged <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> to send them a few guards. For they declared that they were themselves able without any trouble to detach from the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> not only <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Milan</a>, but the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=place long=8.3 lat=44.3>Liguria</a> also, and to recover them for the emperor. Now this city is situated in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=place long=8.3 lat=44.3>Liguria</a>, and lies about half way between the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> on the borders of Gaul; for from either one it is a journey of eight days to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Milan</a> for an unencumbered traveller; and it is the first of the cities of the West, after <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> at least, both in size and in population and in general prosperity. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> promised to fulfil their request, but detained them there during the winter season.</p>                        </div>

But the envy of fortune was already swelling against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, when she saw their affairs progressing successfully and well, and wishing to mingle some evil with this good, she inspired a quarrel, on a trifling pretext, between <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and Constantinus; and how this grew and to what end it came I shall now go on to relate. There was a certain Presidius, a Roman living at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, and a man of no mean station. This Presidius had given offence to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> at the time when <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> was about to march against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and so he set out with some few of his domestics ostensibly on a hunting expedition, and went into exile; he had communicated his plan to no one and took none of his property with him, except indeed that he himself carried two daggers, the scabbards of which happened to be adorned with much gold and precious stones. And when he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a>, he lodged in a certain temple outside the fortifications. And when Constantinus, who happened to be still tarrying there, heard of this, he sent one of his guards, Maxentiolus, and took away from him both the daggers for no good reason. The man was deeply offended by what had taken place, and set out for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> with all speed and came to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, and Constantinus also arrived there not long afterward; for the Gothic army was already reported to be not far away. Now as long as the affairs of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were critical and in confusion, Presidius remained silent; but when he saw that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were gaining the upper hand and that the envoys of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had been sent to the emperor, as has been told by me above, he frequently approached <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> reporting the injustice and demanding that he assist him in obtaining his rights. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> reproached Constantinus many times himself, and many times through others, urging him to clear himself of the guilt of an unjust deed and of a dishonouring report. But Constantinus — for it must needs be that evil befall him — always lightly evaded the charge and taunted the wronged man. But on one occasion Presidius met <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> riding on horseback in the forum, and he laid hold of the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>'s bridle, and crying out with a loud voice asked whether the laws of the emperor said that, whenever anyone fleeing from the barbarians comes to them as a suppliant, they should rob him by violence of whatever he may chance to have in his hands. And though many men gathered about and commanded him with threats to let go his hold of the bridle, he did not let go until at last <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> promised to give him the daggers. On the following day, therefore, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> called Constantinus and many of the commanders to an apartment in the palace, and after going over what had happened on the previous day urged him even at that late time to restore the daggers. But Constantinus refused to do so; nay, he would more gladly throw them into the waters of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> than give them to Presidius. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, being by now mastered by anger, enquired whether Constantinus did not think that he was subject to his orders. And he agreed to obey him in all other things, for this was the emperor's will; this command, however, which at the present time he was laying upon him, he would never obey. <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> then commanded his guards to enter, whereupon Constantinus said: In order, plainly, to have them kill me. By no means, said <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, but to have them compel your bodyguard Maxentiolus, who forcibly carried away the daggers for you, to restore to the man what he took from him by violence. But Constantinus, thinking that he was to die that very instant, wished to do some great deed before he should suffer anything himself. He accordingly drew the dagger which hung by his thigh and suddenly thrust it at the belly of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. And he in consternation stepped back, and by throwing his arms around <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a>, who was standing near, succeeded in escaping the blow. Then Constantinus, still boiling with anger, made after him; but Ildiger and <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>, seeing what was being done, laid hold of his hands, one of the right and the other of the left, and dragged him back. And at this point the guards entered whom <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had summoned a moment before, snatched the dagger of Constantinus from his hand with great violence, and seized him amid a great uproar. At the moment they did him no harm, out of respect, I suppose, to the officers present, but led him away to another room at the command of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, and at a somewhat later time put him to death. This was the only unholy deed done by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, and it was in no way worthy of the character of the man; for he always shewed great gentleness in his treatment of all others. But it had to be, as I have said, that evil should befall Constantinus.</p>                        </div>

And first they sent some men by night into one of the aqueducts, from which they themselves had taken out the water at the beginning of this war. And with lamps and torches in their hands they explored the entrance into the city by this way. Now it happened that not far from the small <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPPi class=place long=12.4883 lat=41.9094>Pincian Gate</a> an arch of this aqueduct had a sort of crevice in it, and one of the guards saw the light through this and told his companions; but they said that he had seen a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> passing by his post. For at that point it so happened that the structure of the aqueduct did not rise high above the ground, and they thought that the guard had imagined the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>'s eyes to be fire. So those barbarians who explored the aqueduct, upon reaching the middle of the city, where there was an upward passage built in olden times leading to the palace itself, came upon some masonry there which allowed them neither to advance beyond that point nor to use the ascent at all. This masonry had been put in by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> as an act of precaution at the beginning of this siege, as has been set forth by me in the preceding narrative. So they decided first to remove one small stone from the wall and then to go back immediately, and when they returned to <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, they displayed the stone and reported the whole situation. And while he was considering his scheme with the best of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who were on guard at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPPi class=place long=12.4883 lat=41.9094>Pincian Gate</a> recalled among themselves on the following day the suspicion of the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>. But when the story was passed around and came to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, the general did not treat the matter carelessly, but immediately sent some of the notable men in the army, together with the guardsman <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>, down into the aqueduct and bade them investigate everything with all speed. And they found all along the aqueduct the lamps of the enemy and the ashes which had dropped from their torches, and after observing the masonry where the stone had been taken out by the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, they reported to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. For this reason he personally kept the aqueduct under close guard; and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, perceiving it, desisted from this attempt. <br />But later on the barbarians went so far as to plan an open attack against the fortifications. So they waited for the time of lunch, and bringing up ladders and fire, when their enemy were least expecting them, made an assault upon the small <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPPi class=place long=12.4883 lat=41.9094>Pincian Gate</a>, emboldened by the hope of capturing the city by a sudden attack, since not many soldiers had been left there. But it happened that Ildiger and his men were keeping guard at that time; for all were assigned by turns to guard-duty. So when he saw the enemy advancing in disorder, he went out against them before they were yet drawn up in line of battle and while they were advancing in great disarray, and routing those who were opposite him without any trouble he slew many. And a great outcry and commotion arose throughout the city, as was to be expected, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> gathered as quickly as possible to all parts of the fortifications; whereupon the barbarians after a short time retired to their camp baffled. <br />But <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> resorted again to a plot against the wall. Now there was a certain part of it that was especially vulnerable, where the bank of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> is, because at this place the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> of old, confident in the protection afforded by the stream, had built the wall carelessly, making it low and altogether without towers; <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> therefore hoped to capture the city rather easily from that quarter. For indeed there was not even any garrison there of any consequence, as it happened. He therefore bribed with money two <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who lived near the church of Peter the Apostle to pass along by the guards there at about nightfall carrying a skin full of wine, and in some way or other, by making a show of friendship, to give it to them, and then to sit drinking with them well on into the night; and they were to throw into the cup of each guard a sleep-producing drug which <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> had given them. And he stealthily got ready some skiffs, which he kept at the other bank; as soon as the guards should be overcome by sleep, some of the barbarians, acting in concert, were to cross the river in these, taking ladders with them, and make the assault on the wall. And he made ready the entire army with the intention of capturing the whole city by storm. After these arrangements were all complete, one of the two men who had been prepared by <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> for this service (for it was not fated that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> should be captured by this army of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>) came of his own accord to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and revealed everything, and told who the other man was. So this man under torture brought to light all that he was about to do and displayed the drug which <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> had given him. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> first mutilated his nose and ears and then sent him riding on an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> into the enemy's camp. And when the barbarians saw him, they realised that God would not allow their purposes to have free course, and that therefore the city could never be captured by them.</p>                        </div>

And he with his two thousand horsemen began to go about the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a> and to plunder everything before him, treating the women and children of the enemy as slaves. And when Ulitheus, the uncle of <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, confronted him with an army of <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, he defeated them in battle and killed Ulitheus himself and almost the whole army of the enemy. For this reason no one dared any longer to engage with him. But when he came to the city of Auximus, though he learned that it contained a Gothic garrison of inconsiderable size, yet in other respects he observed that the place was strong and impossible to capture. And for this reason he was quite unwilling to lay siege to it, but departing from there as quickly as he could, he moved forward. And he did this same thing at the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437126UUrb class=place long=12.6367 lat=43.7248>Urbinum</a>, but at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a>, which is one day's journey distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, he marched into the city at the invitation of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. Now all the barbarians who were keeping guard there were very suspicious of the Roman inhabitants, and as soon as they learned that this army was approaching, they withdrew and ran until they reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>. And thus John secured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a>; but he had meanwhile left in his rear a garrison of the enemy both at Auximus and at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437126UUrb class=place long=12.6367 lat=43.7248>Urbinum</a>, not because he had forgotten the commands of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, nor because he was carried away by unreasoning boldness, since he had wisdom as well as energy, but because he reasoned — correctly, as it turned out — that if the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> learned that the Roman army was close to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, they would instantly break up the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> because of their fears regarding this place. And in fact his reasoning proved to be true. For as soon as <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> and the army of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> heard that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a> was held by him, they were plunged into great fear regarding <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, and abandoning all other considerations, they straightway made their withdrawal, as will be told by me directly. And John won great fame from this deed, though he was renowned even before. For he was a daring and efficient man in the highest degree, unflinching before danger, and in his daily life shewing at all times a certain austerity and ability to endure hardship unsurpassed by any barbarian or common soldier. Such a man was John. And Matasuntha, the wife of <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, who was exceedingly hostile to her husband because he had taken her to wife by violence in the beginning, upon learning that John had come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a> was absolutely overcome by joy, and sending a messenger to him opened secret negotiations with him concerning marriage and the betrayal of the city. <br />So these two kept sending messengers to each other without the knowledge of the rest and arranging these matters. But when the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> learned what had happened at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a>, and when at the same time all their provisions had failed them, and the three months' time had already expired, they began to make their withdrawal, although they had not as yet received any information as far as the envoys were concerned. Now it was about the spring equinox, and one year had been spent in the siege and nine days in addition, when the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, having burned all their camps, set out at daybreak. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, seeing their opponents in flight, were at a loss how to deal with the situation. For it so happened that the majority of the horsemen were not present at that time, since they had been sent to various places, as has been stated by me above, and they did not think that by themselves they were a match for so great a multitude of the enemy. However, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> armed all the infantry and cavalry. And when he saw that more than half of the enemy had crossed the bridge, he led the army out through the small <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPPi class=place long=12.4883 lat=41.9094>Pincian Gate</a>, and the hand-to-hand battle which ensued proved to be equal to any that had preceded it. At the beginning the barbarians withstood their enemy vigorously, and many on both sides fell in the first encounter; but afterwards the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> turned to flight and brought upon themselves a great and overwhelming calamity; for each man for himself was rushing to cross the bridge first. As a result of this they became very much crowded and suffered most cruelly, for they were being killed both by each other and by the enemy. Many, too, fell off the bridge on either side into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, sank with all their arms, and perished. Finally, after losing in this way the most of their number, the remainder joined those who had crossed before. And <a href=/people/1477 target=_blank>Longinus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=person long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurian</a> and Mundilas, the guards of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, made themselves conspicuous for their valour in this battle. But while Mundilas, after engaging with four barbarians in turn and killing them all, was himself saved, <a href=/people/1477 target=_blank>Longinus</a>, having proved himself the chief cause of the rout of the enemy, fell where he fought, leaving the Roman army great regret for his loss.</p>                        </div>

And he left Uligisalus in Tudera with four hundred men. And in the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a> he left in the fortress of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418418FPet class=place long=41.7538 lat=41.7681>Petra</a> four hundred men who had lived there previously, and in Auximus, which is the largest of all the cities of that country, he left four thousand <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> selected for their valour and a very energetic commander, Visandus by name, and two thousand men with Moras in the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437126UUrb class=place long=12.6367 lat=43.7248>Urbinum</a>. There are also two other fortresses, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441122UCae class=place long=12.256 lat=44.137>Caesena</a> and Monteferetra, in each of which he established a garrison of not less than five hundred men. Then he himself with the rest of the army moved straight for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a> with the purpose of laying siege to it. <br />But it happened that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, as soon as the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had broken up the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, had sent Ildiger and <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> with a thousand horsemen, in order that by travelling more quickly by another road they might arrive at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a> first, and he directed them promptly to remove John from the city and all those with him, and to put in their place fully enough men to guard the city, taking them from the fortress which is on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a>, Ancon by name, two days' journey distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a>. For he had already taken possession of it not long before, having sent <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a> with no small force of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a>. It was his hope that if unsupported infantry under commanders of no great note should hold <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a>, the Gothic forces would never undertake its siege, but would regard it with contempt and so go at once to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, and that if they should decide to besiege <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a>, the provisions there would suffice for the infantry for a somewhat longer time; and he thought also that two thousand horsemen, attacking from outside with the rest of the army, would in all probability do the enemy great harm and drive them more easily to abandon the siege. It was with this purpose that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> gave such orders to <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> and Ildiger and their men. And they, by travelling over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPFl class=place long=12.4759 lat=41.9115>Flaminian Way</a>, arrived long before the barbarians. For since the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were moving in a great throng, they proceeded in a more leisurely manner, and they were compelled to make certain long detours, both because of the lack of provisions, and because they preferred not to pass close to the fortresses on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPFl class=place long=12.4759 lat=41.9115>Flaminian Way</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425125UNeq class=place long=12.5156 lat=42.5176>Narnia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a>, since these were in the hands of the enemy, as has been stated above. <br />When the Roman army arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418418FPet class=place long=41.7538 lat=41.7681>Petra</a>, they made an attack upon the fortress there, regarding it as an incident of their expedition. Now this fortress was not devised by man, but it was made by the nature of the place; for the road passes through an extremely mountainous country at that place. On the right of this road a river descends which no man can ford because of the swiftness of the current, and on the left not far away rises a sheer rock which reaches to such a height that men who might chance to be standing on its summit, as seen by those below, resemble in size the smallest birds. And in olden times there was no passage through as one went forward. For the end of the rock reaches to the very stream of the river, affording no room for those who travel that way to pass by. So the men of ancient times constructed a tunnel at that point, and made there a gate for the place. And they also closed up the greatest part of the other entrance, leaving only enough space for a small gate there also, and thus rendered the place a natural fortress, which they call by the fitting name of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418418FPet class=place long=41.7538 lat=41.7681>Petra</a>. So the men of <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> and Ildiger first made an attack upon one of the two gates, and shot many missiles, but they accomplished nothing, although the barbarians there made no defence at all; but afterwards they forced their way up the cliff behind the fortress and hurled stones from there upon the heads of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. And they, hurriedly and in great confusion, entered their houses and remained quiet. And then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, unable to hit any of the enemy with the stones they threw, devised the following plan. They broke off large pieces from the cliff and, many of them pushing together, hurled them down, aiming at the houses. And wherever these in their fall did no more than just graze the building, they yet gave the whole fortress a considerable shock and reduced the barbarians to great fear. Consequently the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> stretched out their hands to those who were still about the gate and surrendered themselves and the fort, with the condition that they themselves should remain free from harm, being slaves of the emperor and subject to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. And Ildiger and <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> removed the most of them and led them away, putting them on a basis of complete equality with themselves, but some few they left there, together with their wives and children. And they also left something of a garrison of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. Thence they proceeded to Ancon, and taking with them many of the infantry in that place on the third day reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a>, and announced the will of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. But John was not only unwilling himself to follow them, but also proposed to retain <a href=/people/4137 target=_blank>Damianus</a> with the four hundred. So they left there the infantry and retired thence with all speed, taking the spearmen and guards of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>.</p>                        </div>

And they immediately constructed a wooden tower higher than the circuit-wall of the city and resting on four wheels, and drew it toward that part of the wall which seemed to them most vulnerable. But in order that they might not have the same experience here which they had before the fortifications of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, they did not use <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> to draw the tower, but hid themselves within it and thus hauled it forward. And there was a stairway of great breadth inside the tower on which the barbarians in great numbers were to make the ascent easily, for they hoped that as soon as they should place the tower against the fortifications, they would have no trouble in stepping thence to the parapet of the wall; for they had made the tower high with this in view. So when they had come close to the fortifications with this engine of war, they remained quiet for the time, since it was already growing dark, and stationing guards about the tower they all went off to pass the night, supposing that they would meet with no obstacle whatever. And indeed there was nothing in their way, not even a trench between them and the wall, except an exceedingly small one. <br />As for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, they passed the night in great fear, supposing that on the morrow they would perish. But John, neither yielding to despair in face of the danger nor being greatly agitated by fear, devised the following plan. Leaving the others on guard at their posts, he himself took the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a>, who carried pickaxes and various other tools of this kind, and went outside the fortifications; it was late in the night and no word had been given beforehand to anyone in the city; and once outside the wall, he commanded his men in silence to dig the trench deeper. So they did as directed, and as they dug they kept putting the earth which they took out of the trench upon the side of it nearer the city-wall, and there it served them as an earthwork. And since they were unobserved for a long time by the enemy, who were sleeping, they soon made the trench both deep and sufficiently wide, at the place where the fortifications were especially vulnerable and where the barbarians were going to make the assault with their engine of war. But far on in the night the enemy, perceiving what was being done, charged at full speed against those who were digging, and John went inside the fortifications with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a>, since the trench was now in a most satisfactory condition. <br />But at daybreak <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> noted what had been accomplished and in his exceeding vexation at the occurrence executed some of the guards; however, he was as eager as before to bring his engine to bear, and so commanded the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> to throw a great number of faggots as quickly as possible into the trench, and then by drawing the tower over them to bring it into position. This they proceeded to do as <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> commanded, with all zeal, although their opponents kept fighting them back from the wall with the utmost vigour. But when the weight of the tower came upon the faggots they naturally yielded and sank down. For this reason the barbarians were quite unable to go forward with the engine, because the ground became still more steep before them, where the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had heaped up the earth as I have stated. Fearing, therefore, that when night came on the enemy would sally forth and set fire to the engine, they began to draw it back again. This was precisely what John was eager to prevent with all his power, and so he armed his soldiers, called them all together, and exhorted them as follows: <br />My men, who share this danger common to us all, if it would please any man among you to live and see those whom he has left at home, let him realize that the only hope he has of obtaining these things lies in nothing but his own hands. For when <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> sent us forth in the beginning, hope and desire for many things made us eager for the task. For we never suspected that we should be besieged in the country along the coast, since the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> command the sea so completely, nor would one have supposed that the emperor's army would so far neglect us. But apart from these considerations, at that time we were prompted to boldness by an opportunity to display our loyalty to the state and by the glory which we should acquire in the sight of all men as the result of our struggles. But as things now stand, we cannot possibly survive save by courage, and we are obliged to undergo this danger with no other end in view than the saving of our own lives. Therefore, if any of you perchance lay claim to valour, all such have the opportunity to prove themselves brave men, if any men in the world have, and thereby to cover themselves with glory. For they achieve a fair name, not who overpower those weaker than themselves, but who, though inferior in equipment, still win the victory by the greatness of their souls. And as for those in whom the love of life has been more deeply implanted, it will be of advantage to these especially to be bold, for it is true of all men, as a general thing, that when their fortunes stand on the razor's edge, as is now the case with us, they may be saved only by scorning the danger. <br />With these words John led his army out against the enemy, leaving some few men to guard the battlement. But the enemy withstood them bravely, and the battle became exceedingly fierce. And with great difficulty and late in the day the barbarians succeeded in bringing the tower back to their own camp. However, they lost so great a number of their fighting men that they decided thenceforth to make no further attacks upon the wall, but in despair of succeeding that way, they remained quiet, expecting that their enemy would yield to them under stress of famine. For all their provisions had already failed them completely, since they had not found any place from which they could bring in a sufficient supply. <br />Such was the course of events here. But as for <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, he sent to the representatives of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Milan</a> a thousand men, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a>. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> were commanded by Ennes, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> by <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a>, while Mundilas was set over them all and commanded in person, having as his guard some few of the guardsmen of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. And with them was also Fidelius, who had been made praetorian prefect. For since he was a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Milan</a>, he was regarded as a suitable person to go with this army, having as he did some influence in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=place long=8.3 lat=44.3>Liguria</a>. They set sail, accordingly, from the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and put in at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/44489UGen class=place long=8.9315 lat=44.4076>Genoa</a>, which is the last city in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscia</a> and well situated as a port of call for the voyage to Gaul and to Spain. There they left their ships and travelling by land moved forward, placing the boats of the ships on their waggons, in order that nothing might prevent their crossing the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450120WEri class=place long=12.0293 lat=44.9753>Padus</a>. It was by this means, in any event, that they made the crossing of the river. And when they reached the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/452092UTic class=place long=9.1529 lat=45.1846>Ticinum</a>, after crossing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450120WEri class=place long=12.0293 lat=44.9753>Padus</a>, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> came out against them and engaged them in battle. And they were not only numerous but also excellent troops, since all the barbarians who lived in that region had deposited the most valuable of their possessions in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/452092UTic class=place long=9.1529 lat=45.1846>Ticinum</a>, as being a place which had strong defences, and had left there a considerable garrison. So a fierce battle took place, but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were victorious, and routing their opponents, they slew a great number and came within a little of capturing the city in the pursuit. For it was only with difficulty that the barbarians succeeded in shutting the gates, so closely did their enemy press upon their heels. And as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were marching away, Fidelius went into a temple there to pray, and was the last to leave. But by some chance his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> stumbled and he fell. And since he had fallen very near the fortifications, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> seeing him came out and killed him without being observed by the enemy. Wherefore, when this was afterwards discovered by Mundilas and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, they were greatly distressed. <br />Then, leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/452092UTic class=place long=9.1529 lat=45.1846>Ticinum</a>, they arrived at the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Milan</a> and secured this city with the rest of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=place long=8.3 lat=44.3>Liguria</a> without a battle. When <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> learned about this, he sent a large army with all speed and Uraïas, his own nephew, as commander. And Theudibert, the leader of the Franks, sent him at his request ten thousand men as allies, not of the Franks themselves, but Burgundians, in order not to appear to be doing injury to the emperor's cause. For it was given out that the Burgundians made the expedition willingly and of their own choice, not as obeying the command of Theudibert. And the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, joined by these troops, came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Milan</a>, made camp and began a siege when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were least expecting them. At any rate the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, through this action, found it impossible to bring in any kind of provisions, but they were immediately in distress for want of necessities. Indeed, even the guarding of the walls was not being maintained by the regular soldiers, for it so happened that Mundilas had occupied all the cities near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Milan</a> which had defences, namely <a about=https://topostext.org/place/457097UBer class=place long=9.663 lat=45.704>Bergomum</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/45891UCom class=place long=9.0855 lat=45.812>Comum</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/45486UNov class=place long=8.6197 lat=45.4456>Novaria</a>, as well as some other strongholds, and in every place had established a considerable garrison, while he himself with about three hundred men remained in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Milan</a>, and with him Ennes and <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a>. Consequently and of necessity the inhabitants of the city were regularly keeping guard in turn. Such was the progress of events in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=place long=8.3 lat=44.3>Liguria</a>, and the winter drew to its close, and the third year came to an end in this war, the history of which <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> has written.</p>                        </div>

And he sent some men to Tudera and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430119UClu class=place long=11.9488 lat=43.0152>Clusium</a>, with orders to make fortified camps there, and he was intending to follow them and assist in besieging the barbarians at those places. But when the barbarians learned that the army was approaching, they did not wait to face the danger, but sent envoys to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, promising to surrender both themselves and the two cities, with the condition that they should remain free from harm. And when he came there, they fulfilled their promise. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> removed all the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> from these towns and sent them to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>, and after establishing a garrison in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430119UClu class=place long=11.9488 lat=43.0152>Clusium</a> and in Tudera, he led his army forward. <br />But meanwhile <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> had sent another army, under command of Vacimus, to Auximus, commanding it to join forces with the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> there, and with them to go against the enemy in Ancon and make an attempt upon that fortress. Now this Ancon is a sort of pointed rock, and indeed it is from this circumstance that it has taken its name; for it is exceedingly like an elbow. And it is about eighty stades distant from the city of Auximus, whose port it is. And the defences of the fortress lie upon the pointed rock in a position of security, but all the buildings outside, though they are many, have been from ancient times unprotected by a wall. Now as soon as <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a>, who was in command of the garrison of the place, heard that the forces of Vacimus were coming against him and were already not far away, he made an exhibition of thoughtless folly. For thinking it too small a thing to preserve free from harm merely the fortress and its inhabitants together with the soldiers, he left the fortifications entirely destitute of soldiers, and leading them all out to a distance of about five stades, arrayed them in line of battle, without, however, making the phalanx a deep one at all, but thin enough to surround the entire base of the mountain, as if for a hunt. But when these troops saw that the enemy were greatly superior to them in number, they turned their backs and straightway fled to the fortress. And the barbarians, following close upon them, slew on the spot most of their number — those who did not succeed in getting inside the circuit-wall in time — and then placed ladders against the wall and attempted the ascent. Some also began burning the houses outside the fortress. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who resided habitually in the fortress, being terror-stricken at what was taking place, at first opened the small gate and received the soldiers as they fled in complete disorder. But when they saw the barbarians close at hand and pressing upon the fugitives, fearing that they would charge in with them, they closed the gates as quickly as they could, and letting down ropes from the battlement, saved a number by drawing them up, and among them <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a> himself. But the barbarians scaled the wall by means of their ladders and came within a little of capturing the fortress by storm, and would have succeeded if two men had not made a display of remarkable deeds by valorously pushing off the battlements those who had already got upon the wall; one of these two was a bodyguard of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, a Thracian named Ulimuth, and the other a bodyguard of <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>, named Gouboulgoudou, a <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagete</a> by birth. These two men had happened by some chance to come by ship to Ancon a little before; and in this struggle, by warding off with their swords those who were scaling the wall, they saved the fortress contrary to expectation, but they themselves were carried from the battlement half dead, their whole bodies hacked with many wounds. <br />At that time it was reported to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> that <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a> had come with a great army from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a>. Now this <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a> was a eunuch and guardian of the royal treasures, but for the rest keen and more energetic than would be expected of a eunuch. And five thousand soldiers followed him, of whom the several detachments were commanded by different men, among whom were Justinus, the general of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, and another <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a>, who had previously come to the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> as a deserter from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a> who are subject to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>; with him had come his brother Aratius, who, as it happened, had joined <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> a little before this with another army. And about two thousand of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Erulian</a> nation also followed him, commanded by Visandus and Aluith and Phanitheus.</p>                        </div>

They used to dwell beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> River from of old, worshipping a great host of gods, whom it seemed to them holy to appease even by human sacrifices. And they observed many customs which were not in accord with those of other men. For they were not permitted to live either when they grew old or when they fell sick, but as soon as one of them was overtaken by old age or by sickness, it became necessary for him to ask his relatives to remove him from the world as quickly as possible. And these relatives would pile up a quantity of wood to a great height and lay the man on top of the wood, and then they would send one of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>, but not a relative of the man, to his side with a dagger; for it was not lawful for a kinsman to be his slayer. And when the slayer of their relative had returned, they would straightway burn the whole pile of wood, beginning at the edges. And after the lire had ceased, they would immediately collect the bones and bury them in the earth. And when a man of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> died, it was necessary for his wife, if she laid claim to virtue and wished to leave a fair name behind her, to die not long afterward beside the tomb of her husband by hanging herself with a rope. And if she did not do this, the result was that she was in ill repute thereafter and an offence to the relatives of her husband. Such were the customs observed by the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> in ancient times. <br />But as time went on they became superior to all the barbarians who dwelt about them both in power and in numbers, and, as was natural, they attacked and vanquished them severally and kept plundering their possessions by force. And finally they made the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a>, who were <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, together with several other nations, subject and tributary to themselves, though the barbarians of that region were not accustomed to that sort of thing; but the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> were led to take this course by love of money and a lawless spirit. [491 A.D.] When, however, <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a> took over the Roman empire, the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>, having no longer anyone in the world whom they could assail, laid down their arms and remained quiet, and they observed peace in this way for a space of three years. But the people themselves, being exceedingly vexed, began to abuse their leader Rodolphus without restraint, and going to him constantly they called him cowardly and effeminate, and railed at him in a most unruly manner, taunting him with certain other names besides. And Rodolphus, being quite unable to bear the insult, marched against the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a>, who were doing no wrong, without charging against them any fault or alleging any violation of their agreement, but bringing upon them a war which had no real cause. And when the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> got word of this, they sent to Rodolphus and made enquiry and demanded that he should state the charge on account of which the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> were coming against them in arms, agreeing that if they had deprived the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> of any of the tribute, then they would instantly pay it with large interest; and if their grievance was that only a moderate tribute had been imposed upon them, then the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> would never be reluctant to make it greater. Such were the offers which the envoys made, but Rodolphus with a threat sent them away and marched forward. And they again sent other envoys to him on the same mission and supplicated him with many entreaties. And when the second envoys had fared in the same way, a third embassy came to him and forbade the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> on any account to bring upon them a war without excuse. For if they should come against them with such a purpose, they too, not willingly, but under the direst necessity, would array themselves against their assailants, calling upon God as their witness, the slightest breath of whose favour, turning the scales, would be a match for all the strength of men; and He, in all likelihood, would be moved by the causes of the war and would determine the issue of the fight for both sides accordingly. So they spoke, thinking in this way to terrify their assailants, but the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>, shrinking from nothing whatever, decided to meet the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> in battle. And when the two armies came close to one another, it so happened that the sky above the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> was obscured by a sort of cloud, black and very thick, but above the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> it was exceedingly clear. And judging by this one would have supposed that the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> were entering the conflict to their own harm; for there ran be no more forbidding portent than this for barbarians as they go into battle. However, the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> gave no heed even to this, but in absolute disregard of it they advanced against their enemy with utter contempt, estimating the outcome of war by mere superiority of numbers. But when the battle came to close quarters, many of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> perished and Rodolphus himself also perished, and the rest fled at full speed, forgetting all their courage. And since their enemy followed them up, the most of them fell on the field of battle and only a few succeeded in saving themselves. <br />For this reason the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> were no longer able to tarry in their ancestral homes, but departing from there as quickly as possible they kept moving forward, traversing the whole country which is beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> River, together with their wives and children. But when they reached a land where the Rogi dwelt of old, a people who had joined the Gothic host and gone to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, they settled in that place. But since they were pressed by famine, because they were in a barren land, they removed from there not long afterward, and came to a place close to the country of the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a>. And at first the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> permitted them to dwell there and be neighbours to them, since they came as suppliants. But afterwards for no good reason the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> began to practise unholy deeds upon them. For they violated their women and seized their <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and other property, and abstained from no wickedness whatever, and finally began an unjust attack upon them. And the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>, unable to bear all this any longer, crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> River and decided to live as neighbours to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in that region; this was during the reign of the Emperor <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a>, who received them with great friendliness and allowed them to settle where they were. But a short time afterwards these barbarians gave him offence by their lawless treatment of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> there, and for this reason he sent an army against them. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, after defeating them in battle, slew most of their number, and had ample opportunity to destroy them all. But the remainder of them threw themselves upon the mercy of the generals and begged them to spare their lives and to have them as allies and servants of the emperor thereafter. And when <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a> learned this, he was pleased, and consequently a number of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> were left; however, they neither became allies of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, nor did they do them any good. <br />But when <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> took over the empire, [527 A.D.] he bestowed upon them good lands and other possessions, and thus completely succeeded in winning their friendship and persuaded them all to become <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>. As a result of this they adopted a gentler manner of life and decided to submit themselves wholly to the laws of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, and in keeping with the terms of their alliance they are generally arrayed with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> against their enemies. They are still, however, faithless toward them, and since they are given to avarice, they are eager to do violence to their neighbours, feeling no shame at such conduct. And they mate in an unholy manner, especially men with <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a>, and they are the basest of all men and utterly abandoned rascals. <br />Afterwards, although some few of them remained at peace with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, as will be told by me in the following narrative, all the rest revolted for the following reason. The <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>, displaying their beastly and fanatical character against their own rex, one <a href=/people/748 target=_blank>Ochus</a> by name, suddenly killed the man for no good reason at all, laying against him no other charge than that they wished to be without a king thereafter. And yet even before this, while their king did have the title, he had practically no advantage over any private citizen whomsoever. But all claimed the right to sit with him and eat with him, and whoever wished insulted him without restraint; for no men in the world are less bound by convention or more unstable than the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>. Now when the evil deed had been accomplished, they were immediately repentant. For they said that they were not able to live without a ruler and without a general; so after much deliberation it seemed to them best in every way to summon one of their royal family from the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000UThu class=place long=-1.257 lat=60.333>Thule</a>. And the reason for this I shall now explain.</p>                        </div>

After these they passed by the nations of the Dani, without suffering violence at the hands of the barbarians there. Coming thence to the ocean, they took to the sea, and putting in at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000UThu class=place long=-1.257 lat=60.333>Thule</a>, remained there on the island. <br />Now <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000UThu class=place long=-1.257 lat=60.333>Thule</a> is exceedingly large; for it is more than ten times greater than <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>. And it lies far distant from it toward the north. On this island the land is for the most part barren, but in the inhabited country thirteen very numerous nations are settled; and there are kings over each nation. In that place a very wonderful thing takes place each year. For the sun at the time of the summer solstice never sets for forty days, but appears constantly during this whole time above the earth. But not less than six months later, at about the time of the winter solstice, the sun is never seen on this island for forty days, but never-ending night envelops it; and as a result of this dejection holds the people there during this whole time, because they are unable by any means to mingle with one another during this interval. And although I was eager to go to this island and become an eye-witness of the things I have told, no opportunity ever presented itself. However, I made enquiry from those who come to us from the island as to how in the world they are able to reckon the length of the days, since the sun never rises nor sets there at the appointed times. And they gave me an account which is true and trustworthy. For they said that the sun during those forty days does not indeed set just as has been stated, but is visible to the people there at one time toward the east, and again toward the west. Whenever, therefore, on its return, it reaches the same place on the horizon where they had previously been accustomed to see it rise, they reckon in this way that one day and night have passed. When, however, the time of the nights arrives, they always take note of the courses of the moon and stars and thus reckon the measure of the days. And when a time amounting to thirty-five days has passed in this long night, certain men are sent to the summits of the mountains — for this is the custom among them — and when they are able from that point barely to see the sun, they bring back word to the people below that within five days the sun will shine upon them. And the whole population celebrates a festival at the good news, and that too in the darkness. And this is the greatest festival which the natives of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000UThu class=place long=-1.257 lat=60.333>Thule</a> have; for, I imagine, these islanders always become terrified, although they see the same thing happen every year, fearing that the sun may at some time fail them entirely. <br />But among the barbarians who are settled in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000UThu class=place long=-1.257 lat=60.333>Thule</a>, one nation only, who are called the Scrithiphini, live a kind of life akin to that of the beasts. For they neither wear garments of cloth nor do they walk with shoes on their feet, nor do they drink wine nor derive anything edible from the earth. For they neither till the land themselves, nor do their women work it for them, but the women regularly join the men in hunting, which is their only pursuit. For the forests, which are exceedingly large, produce for them a great abundance of wild beasts and other animals, as do also the mountains which rise there. And they feed exclusively upon the flesh of the wild beasts slain by them, and clothe themselves in their skins, and since they have neither flax nor any implement with which to sew, they fasten these skins together by the sinews of the animals, and in this way manage to cover the whole body. And indeed not even their infants are nursed in the same way as among the rest of mankind. For the children of the Scrithiphini do not feed upon the milk of women nor do they touch their mother's breast, but they are nourished upon the marrow of the animals killed in the hunt, and upon this alone. Now as soon as a woman gives birth to a child, she throws it into a skin and straightway hangs it to a tree, and after putting marrow into its mouth she immediately sets out with her husband for the customary hunt. For they do everything in common and likewise engage in this pursuit together. So much for the daily life of these barbarians. <br />But all the other inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000UThu class=place long=-1.257 lat=60.333>Thule</a>, practically speaking, do not differ very much from the rest of men, but they reverence in great numbers gods and demons both of the heavens and of the air, of the earth and of the sea, and sundry other demons which are said to be in the waters of springs and rivers. And they incessantly offer up all kinds of sacrifices, and make oblations to the dead, but the noblest of sacrifices, in their eyes, is the first human being whom they have taken captive in war; for they sacrifice him to <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>, whom they regard as the greatest god. And the manner in which they offer up the captive is not by sacrificing him on an altar only, but also by hanging him to a tree, or throwing him among thorns, or killing him by some of the other most cruel forms of death. Thus, then, do the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000UThu class=place long=-1.257 lat=60.333>Thule</a> live. And one of their most numerous nations is the Gauti, and it was next to them that the incoming <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> settled at the time in question. <br />On the present occasion, therefore, the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> who dwelt among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, after the murder of their king had been perpetrated by them, sent some of their notables to the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000UThu class=place long=-1.257 lat=60.333>Thule</a> to search out and bring back whomsoever they were able to find there of the royal blood. And when these men reached the island, they found many there of the royal blood, but they selected the one man who pleased them most and set out with him on the return journey. But this man fell sick and died when he had come to the country of the Dani. These men therefore went a second time to the island and secured another man, Datius by name. And he was followed by his brother Aordus and two hundred youths of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000UThu class=place long=-1.257 lat=60.333>Thule</a>. But since much time passed while they were absent on this journey, it occurred to the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> in the neighbourhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/448205USin class=place long=20.4504 lat=44.8235>Singidunum</a> that they were not consulting their own interests in importing a leader from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000UThu class=place long=-1.257 lat=60.333>Thule</a> against the wishes of the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>. They therefore sent envoys to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, begging the emperor to send them a ruler of his own choice. And he straightway sent them one of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> who had long been sojourning in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, Suartuas by name. At first the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> welcomed him and did obeisance to him and rendered the customary obedience to his commands; but not many days later a messenger arrived with the tidings that the men from the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000UThu class=place long=-1.257 lat=60.333>Thule</a> were near at hand. And Suartuas commanded them to go out to meet those men, his intention being to destroy them, and the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>, approving his purpose, immediately went with him. But when the two forces were one day's journey distant from each other, the king's men all abandoned him at night and went over of their own accord to the newcomers, while he himself took to flight and set out unattended for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. Thereupon the emperor earnestly undertook with all his power to restore him to his office, and the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>, fearing the power of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, decided to submit themselves to the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a>. This, then, was the cause of the revolt of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>.</p>                        </div>

In that place they began to hold conferences with all the commanders of the army, considering at what particular point it would be most to their advantage to make the first attack upon the enemy. For if, on the one hand, they should proceed against the forces besieging <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a>, they suspected that the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435135UAux class=place long=13.4769 lat=43.4864>Auximum</a> would in all probability, taking them in the rear, inflict irreparable harm both upon them and upon the Romans who lived in that region; but, on the other hand, they were anxious concerning the besieged, dreading lest by reason of their lack of provisions they should suffer some great misfortune. Now the majority were hostile toward John, and made their speeches accordingly; and the charge they brought against him was that he had been moved by unreasoning daring and a desire to gain great sums of money to place himself in his present dangerous position, and that he would not allow the operations of the war to be carried out in due order nor in the manner prescribed by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. </p>                        </div>

For if it seems to be true that each of these two alternatives offers to those who fail an equal degree of danger and evenly balanced possibilities of mischief, it is altogether worthwhile to deliberate and to go most thoroughly into the arguments, and only then to make our decision regarding the situation before us. But if we should wish to put off the assault upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435135UAux class=place long=13.4769 lat=43.4864>Auximum</a> to some other time, the penalty we shall suffer will involve in no way any vital interest of ours; for what difference could arise during the interval? But if we fail at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a>, we shall in all probability, if it is not too bitter a thing to say, shatter the strength of the Romans. Now if John treated your commands with insolence, most excellent <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, the atonement you have already exacted from him is surely ample, since it is now in your power either to save him in his reverse or to abandon him to the enemy. But see that you do not exact from the emperor and from us the penalty for mistakes committed by John through ignorance. For if the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> capture <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a> at the present juncture it will be their good fortune to have made captive a capable Roman general as well as a whole army and a city subject to the emperor. And the calamity will not stop with this, Due it will also have such weight as to determine the fortune of the war in every field. For you should reason thus regarding the enemy, that they are still, even at the present time, far superior to us in the number of their soldiers, and they have lost their courage only because of the many reverses they have suffered. And this is natural; for the adversity of fortune has taken away all their confidence. If, therefore, they meet with success at the present time, they will at no distant date recover their spirit and thereafter they will carry on this war with a boldness, not merely equal to ours, but actually much greater. For it is a way with those who are freeing themselves from a difficult situation always to have a better heart than those who have not yet met with disaster.

Thus, then, did John write. But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, on his part, was sorely perplexed and plunged into the greatest uncertainty. For while he was fearful concerning the besieged, he suspected, at the same time, that the enemy in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435135UAux class=place long=13.4769 lat=43.4864>Auximum</a> would overrun the whole country round about and plunder it with never a fear, and also that they would ambush his own army from behind at every opportunity, and especially whenever he joined battle with his opponents, and would thus in all probability do the Romans great and irreparable harm. Finally, however, he did as follows. He left Aratius with a thousand men there, instructing them to make a camp by the sea, at a distance of two hundred stades from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435135UAux class=place long=13.4769 lat=43.4864>Auximum</a>. These troops he commanded neither to move away from that position nor to fight a decisive action with the enemy, except in so far as to drive them off from the camp, if they should ever make an attack upon it. For he hoped by this course to make it certain that the barbarians, seeing Romans encamped close by, would remain quietly in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435135UAux class=place long=13.4769 lat=43.4864>Auximum</a> and never follow his own army to do it harm.

Now a certain woman of this city had, as it happened, just given birth to a child, and had abandoned the infant, leaving it in its swaddling clothes lying upon the ground; and whether she sought safety in flight or was captured by someone or other, she did not succeed in getting back again to that place; for assuredly it fell out that she disappeared from the world or at least from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. So the infant, being thus abandoned, began to cry. But a lone she-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>, seeing it, felt pity and came near, and gave the infant her udder (for she too, as it happened, had recently brought forth young) and guarded it carefully, lest a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> or wild beast should injure it. And since the confusion was long continued, it came about that the infant partook of this food for a very long time. But later, when it became known to the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a> that the emperor's army had come there to injure the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, but that the Romans would suffer no harm from it, they all returned immediately to their homes. And when such of the women as were Romans by birth came to Urvisalia with the men, and saw the infant still alive in its swaddling clothes, they were utterly unable to comprehend what had happened and considered it very wonderful that the infant was living. And each of them who chanced to be at that time able to do so offered her breast. But neither would the infant now have anything to do with human milk, nor was the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> at all willing to let it go, but as it kept bleating unceasingly about the infant, it seemed to those present to be feeling the greatest resentment that the women came near it and disturbed it as they did, and, to put all in a word, she insisted upon claiming the babe as her own. Consequently the women no longer disturbed the infant, and the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> continued to nourish it free from fear and to guard it with every care. Wherefore the inhabitants of the place appropriately called this infant <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a>. And when I happened to be sojourning in that place, by way of making a display of the strange sight they took me near the infant and purposely hurt it so that it might cry out. And the infant, annoyed by those hurting it, began to cry; whereupon the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>, which was standing about a stone's throw away from it, hearing the cry, came running and bleating loudly to its side, and took her stand over it, so that no one might be able to hurt it again. Such then is the story of this <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a>. </p>                        </div>

For seeing that he was greatly inferior to his opponents in numbers, he did not wish to engage in an open battle with them, since he could see that the barbarians were actually paralyzed by their previous defeats; and he thought that, as soon as they learned that a hostile army was coming upon them from all sides, they would not once think of resistance, but would without the least hesitation turn to flight. And indeed he arrived at a correct opinion regarding the situation, and his suppositions were not at variance with what the future was to bring forth. For when they had reached a point in the mountains where they were about one day's journey distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a>, they happened upon a small company of <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> who were travelling on some necessary errand. And these <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, falling in unexpectedly with a hostile army, were quite unable to get away from the road before they were attacked by the missiles of those who marched in the van, and some fell on the spot, while others, after receiving wounds, succeeded in hiding themselves by scrambling up some of the high cliffs close by. From that position they watched the Roman army collecting over all the rough ground, and they supposed them to be many more than they really were. And seeing the standards of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> there also, they realized that he was leading this army in person. Then night came on and the Romans bivouacked where they were, while the wounded <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> went stealthily to the camp of <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>. </p>                        </div>

Then the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> began to prepare for battle to the north of the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a>, for they thought that the enemy would come from that direction, and they were all constantly looking toward the heights of the mountain. But when, as night came upon them, they had laid down their weapons and were resting, they saw many camp-fires to the east of the city, about sixty stades away — these were the fires which the troops of <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> were burning — and they fell into a state of helpless fear; for they suspected that they would be surrounded by the enemy at daybreak. So for that night they bivouacked in such a state of fear; but on the succeeding day at sunrise they saw a fleet of ships in overwhelming numbers bearing down upon them, and being plunged into speechless terror, they made a rush to flee. And while they were packing up their luggage as quickly as they could, there arose so much confusion and shouting among them that they neither paid heed to the commands given nor did they think of anything else than how each man for himself could get away first from the camp and place himself inside the fortifications of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>. And if the besieged had only had some strength or daring left in them, they could have killed great numbers of the enemy on the spot by making a sally from the city, and the whole war would have ended there. But, as it was, this was prevented by the great fear which had taken possession of them because of their past experiences, and by the weakness which had come upon many owing to the lack of provisions. So the barbarians, leaving there some of their possessions in the excess of their confusion, began to run as fast as they could go on the road to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>. </p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> with his whole army arrived at midday. And when he saw John and his men pale and dreadfully emaciated, he said to him, hinting at the rashness of his audacious deed, that he owed a debt of gratitude to Ildiger. But John said that he recognized his obligation, not to Ildiger, but to <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a>, the emperor's steward, implying, I suppose, that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had not come to his defence very willingly, but only after being persuaded by <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a>. And from that time both these men began to regard each other with great suspicion. It was for this reason that the friends of <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a> even tried to prevent him from marching with <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, and they sought to shew him how disgraceful it was for one who shared the secrets of the emperor not to be commander-in-chief of the army, but to take orders from a mere general. For they expressed the view that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> would never willingly share with him the command of the army on equal terms, but that, if he wished to take command of the Roman army for himself, he would be followed by the greater part of the soldiers, and much the best ones too, together with their commanders. For the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>, they said, and <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a>' own spearmen and guards, and the troops commanded by Justinus and John himself, together with the forces of Aratius and the other <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a>, amounted to not less than ten thousand men, brave soldiers and especially capable warriors, and they did not wish the subjugation of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> to be reckoned to the credit of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> alone, but desired that <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a> too should carry off his share of the honour. For they supposed that he had left the society of the emperor, not that by facing danger himself he might establish the glory of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, but presumably in order that by making a display of deeds of wisdom and bravery he might become famous among all men. Furthermore, they said, even <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> would thenceforth be unable to accomplish anything without these troops. For the greater part of the forces which he commanded had already been left behind in fortresses and cities which he had himself captured, and they enumerated them all, starting at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and naming them in order as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a>. </p>                        </div>

Often, therefore, when <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> thought proper to undertake some new enterprise, he would resort to different pretexts, now one and now another, and thus block the project he was urging. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, perceiving tins, called together all the commanders and spoke as follows: <br />It seems to me, fellow officers, that I do not have the same opinion regarding this war as you have. For you, I see, are contemptuous of the enemy as being completely vanquished. But my opinion is that by this confidence of yours we shall fall into a danger which can be foreseen, because I know that the barbarians have not been vanquished by us because of any lack of courage on their part or because of inferiority in numbers, but that it is by means of careful planning beforehand that they have been out-generalled, and consequently have turned to flight from this place. And I fear that you may be deceived in regard to these facts because of your false estimate of the situation, and may thus do irreparable harm both to yourselves and to the cause of the Romans. For those who, accounting themselves victorious, are lifted up by their achievements are more readily destroyed than those who have indeed suffered an unexpected reverse, but thereafter are actuated by fear and abundant respect of their enemy. For while indifference has sometimes ruined men who were in good case, energy coupled with solicitude has often relieved those who had been unfortunate. For, on the one hand, when men allow themselves to drift into an attitude of unconcern, the measure of their strength is wont, as a rule, to be lessened, but, on the other hand, careful study of a situation is naturally calculated to instil vigour. Accordingly, let each one of you remember that <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> is in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> with many tens of thousands of <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, that Uraias is besieging <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Mediolanum</a> and has brought the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=place long=8.3 lat=44.3>Liguria</a> under his power, that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435135UAux class=place long=13.4769 lat=43.4864>Auximum</a> is already filled with an array both numerous and formidable, and that many other places, as far as Urviventus, which is in the neighbourhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, are guarded by barbarian garrisons which are a match for us. Consequently the situation is more perilous for us at the present time than it formerly was, seeing that we have come to be, in a way, surrounded by the enemy. And this is not all, for I pass over the report that the Franks also have joined forces with them in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=place long=8.3 lat=44.3>Liguria</a>, a thing which cannot fail to be remembered by all Romans with great fear. 1 state, therefore, as my opinion that a part of the army ought to be sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=place long=8.3 lat=44.3>Liguria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Mediolanum</a>, but that the rest should instantly proceed against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435135UAux class=place long=13.4769 lat=43.4864>Auximum</a> and the enemy there, in order to accomplish whatever God permits; and afterwards we should also take in hand the other tasks of the war in whatever way seems best and most advantageous.

But it has one approach by level ground on the north. So the Romans were stationed for the siege as has been stated. Now <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was of the opinion that the barbarians would somewhat readily make terms with the Romans for a surrender, believing that they had become terrified by the danger, and so he sent envoys to them, promising that they would receive many benefits, and exhorting them to become subjects of the emperor. These envoys stood near the gates (for the enemy would not receive them into the city), and spoke at length, making a great effort to win them over, but the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, confident in the strength of their position and their abundance of provisions, would not listen to their proposals, and bade the Romans depart from the city with all speed.

For John, they said, had already made an attempt upon the place, and that too at a time when it was guarded by only a few men, and had perceived that it was altogether impregnable (and this was true), and they said that he ought to recover for the emperor the land of <a href=/people/2704 target=_blank>Aemilia</a>. And since he was won over by this suggestion, <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a> at night abandoned the siege, although <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> begged him earnestly to remain there and assist his own troops in capturing the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437126UUrb class=place long=12.6367 lat=43.7248>Urbinum</a>.

And as soon as Moras and his barbarians saw at daybreak that one-half of the enemy had withdrawn, they began to shout taunts and bantering words from the fortifications at those who had remained. <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, however, was purposing to storm the wall with his remaining force. And while he was laying plans for this attack, an altogether wonderful piece of good fortune befell him. There was only one spring in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437126UUrb class=place long=12.6367 lat=43.7248>Urbinum</a>, and from it all the inhabitants of the city were drawing water. This spring of its own accord little by little dried up and began to give out. And in three days the water had left it to such an extent that the barbarians drawing from it were drinking the water along with mud. Consequently they decided to capitulate to the Romans. </p>                        </div>

And he armed his entire force and placed it in a circle about the whole hill, and then commanded a few men to move forward the colonnade of poles (for such is the name by which this device is customarily called) where the ground was level. So these men went into it and began to walk and to draw the colonnade with them, hidden from the eyes of the enemy. Thereupon, the barbarians, stretching forth their right hands from the parapet, begged to receive peace. But the Romans, not knowing anything of what had taken place regarding the spring, supposed that it was the combat and the Roman device which they dreaded. Both sides, at any rate, gladly refrained from battle. And the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> surrendered both themselves and the city to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> with the condition that they should remain free from harm and that they should become subjects of the emperor on terms of complete equality with the Roman army. But <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a>, upon hearing of this success, was filled with both astonishment and dejection. And he himself still remained quietly in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a>, but he ordered John to lead his whole army against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441122UCae class=place long=12.256 lat=44.137>Caesena</a>.2 So they went, taking ladders with them. And when they came close to the fortress, they delivered an attack and made trial of the fortifications. But since the barbarians defended themselves manfully, many fell in the fight and among them Phanitheus, the leader of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>. So John, failing to capture the fortress of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441122UCae class=place long=12.256 lat=44.137>Caesena</a> at that time, saw fit to make no further attempt upon it, since it seemed to him impregnable, and he marched forward with Justinus and the rest of the army. And by a sudden move he succeeded in taking possession of an ancient city which is named Forocornelius; and since the barbarians constantly retired before him and never came to an engagement, he recovered the whole of <a href=/people/2704 target=_blank>Aemilia</a> for the emperor.

For it was impossible to take the place by storm because of the strength of its defences, and the barbarian garrison of the city was both numerous and composed of the best troops, as I have previously stated,- and since they had plundered a large tract of country, they had brought in for themselves a great store of provisions. But he commanded Aratius with a numerous army to pass the winter in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/432137UFir class=place long=13.7168 lat=43.1611>Firmum</a> and to be on his guard that the barbarians in future should not be at liberty to make their raids from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435135UAux class=place long=13.4769 lat=43.4864>Auximum</a> and fearlessly to carry on a campaign of violence in that region; he himself, however, led his army against Urviventus. For Peranius kept urging him to do this, since he had heard from the deserters that the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> in that city had a scarcity of provisions, and he hoped that if, in addition to their lack of supplies, they should see <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> also present with his whole army, as they would suppose, they would give in the more readily, as indeed actually happened. For <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, immediately upon reaching Urviventus, commanded the whole army to encamp in a place suitably situated, while he himself made a complete circuit of the city, looking carefully to see whether it was perhaps not impossible to capture it by storm.

And round this hill there stand rocks of equal height which form, as it were, a circle about it, not immediately at the base of the hill, but about a stone's throw away. Upon this hill, then, the men of old built the city, and they neither placed walls around it nor constructed defences of any other kind, since the place seemed to them impregnable by nature. For there is only one approach to the city through the rocks, and if the inhabitants of the city only keep this under guard, they have nothing to fear from hostile attacks at any other point. For apart from the place where nature, as has been stated, constructed the approach to the city, a river 2 which is always large and impassable occupies the space between the hill and the rocks which I have just mentioned. In view of this situation the Romans of old built a short piece of wall across this approach.

But finally, when all their provisions had been exhausted, they began to eat skins and hides which they had previously soaked in water for a long time; for their commander Albilas, a man of especial note among the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, was sustaining them with empty hopes. </p>                        </div>

And since after that no one reaped it, when it had become fully ripe it fell again to the ground and nothing grew from it thereafter. And this same thing had happened also in <a href=/people/2704 target=_blank>Aemilia</a>; and because of this situation the inhabitants of that region left their homes and went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a>, thinking that, since that country was on the sea, it could not be suffering from absolute lack of food supplies.

All of them first became lean and pale; for the flesh, being ill supplied with nourishment, according to the old saying laid hold upon itself, and the bile, having now the mastery of their bodies by reason of its excess, lent them almost its own appearance. And as the malady developed, all moisture left them, and the skin became very dry so that it resembled leather more than anything else, giving the appearance of having been fastened upon the bones. And as they changed from a livid to a black colour, they came to resemble torches thoroughly burned. And their faces always wore an expression of amazement, while they always had a dreadful sort of insane stare. And they died, some because of the lack of food, and others too by sating themselves too much with it. For since all the warmth which nature kindled within them had died away, whenever anyone fed them to satiety, and not little by little, just like infants newly born, the result was that, since they were as yet unable to digest the food, they died much more quickly. Some too, overcome by hunger, fed upon their comrades. And it is said that two women in a certain place in the country above the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a> ate seventeen men; for these women, as it happened, were the only inhabitants of the place who survived, and consequently it came about that strangers travelling that way lodged in the little house where these women lived; so they would kill these strangers while they slept and eat them. Now the story goes that the eighteenth stranger was roused from sleep, just when these women were about to lay hands upon him, and leaping up and learning from them the whole story, killed both of them. Such, then, is the story which they tell. And the most of the people were so overcome by their hunger that if they happened upon a bit of grass anywhere, they would rush to it with great eagerness, and kneeling down, would try to pull it from the ground. Then, finding themselves unable to do so because all strength had left them, they would fall upon the grass and their outstretched hand and die. And no one ever laid them in the earth, for there was in fact not a man to concern himself about burying them; and yet they remained untouched by any of those numerous birds which have the habit of feeding upon dead bodies, for they offered nothing which the birds craved. For all the flesh, as I have previously stated, had already been consumed by starvation. Such was the manner in which famine visited the land. </p>                        </div>

But when this force reached the River <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450120WEri class=place long=12.0293 lat=44.9753>Padus</a>, which is one day's journey distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Mediolanum</a>, they established a camp and remained there. And a long time was spent by them at that camp while they were deliberating about the crossing of the river. And when Mundilas heard this, he sent to them one of the Romans, <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> by name. He accordingly passed through the lines of the enemy without being detected, and reached the bank of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450120WEri class=place long=12.0293 lat=44.9753>Padus</a>. But he happened to find no ferry ready at the moment, and so he removed his clothing and, at great risk, made the crossing by swimming. So when he had betaken himself to the Roman camp and had come into the presence of the commanders, he spoke as follows: <br /><a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> and Uliaris, you are not acting justly nor in a manner worthy of your own fame, seeing that in appearance you have come for the saving of the emperor's cause, but in reality to magnify the power of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. For this city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Mediolanum</a>, which far surpasses practically all the other cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> in point of size and population and in every other sort of prosperity, and, apart from these advantages, is an outpost against the Germans and the other barbarians, and has been thrown out to protect the whole Roman empire, so to speak, — this city, I say, has now fallen into great danger together with Mundilas and the emperor's army, harassed as it is by the enemy, and neglected meanwhile by you. And how much the emperor has been wronged by you in the present case, I refrain from stating. For the urgency of the moment does not allow me to use many words, seeking as I do quick assistance for the city, while some hope is still left. But you, I say, must come to the defence of the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Mediolanum</a> in their peril with all possible speed. For if at the present crisis you act with any hesitation in coming to us, the result will be for us, on the one hand, to perish after suffering the most cruel fate possible, and for you, on the other, to have betrayed to the enemy the emperor's power. For those who may perchance open their gates to the enemy are not the only ones who are justly called traitors, but with equal, nay even greater, justice this name belongs to those who, though they have the power to defend those dearest to them when they are besieged, still choose the course of hesitation, which involves no danger, instead of engaging in the struggle, and thus probably give to their enemy the victory over them. Thus spoke <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a>, and <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> and Uliaris sent him back with the promise to follow him right speedily. And he once more succeeded in getting through the barbarians unnoticed, entered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Mediolanum</a> by night, and having roused the hopes of the soldiers and all the Romans, still more strengthened their purpose to be faithful to the emperor. </p>                        </div>

Therefore have done with <a href=/people/2704 target=_blank>Aemilia</a>, which neither contains any fortress nor has any decisive importance for the Romans, at least at the present moment.

And the besieged were already suffering extremely from the famine, and under the overwhelming necessity of their wretched situation the most of them had begun to eat <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> and <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mice</a> and other animals such as had never been eaten by man. So the barbarians sent envoys to Mundilas, bidding him surrender the city to them, with the condition that he himself and the soldiers should remain free from harm. But Mundilas agreed to do this only on condition that they not only give pledges for the safety of the Roman garrison, but also that they would do no harm to any one of the inhabitants.

For when men have once entered life, a single fate is advancing upon all of them — to die at the appointed time; but as to the manner of death men differ, for the most part, one from the other. And there is this difference, that cowards, as one might expect, in every case first bring upon themselves insult and ridicule from their enemies and then, at the exact time previously appointed, fulfil their destiny no whit the less; but it falls to the lot of noble men to suffer this with valour and an abundance of goodly fame. And apart from these considerations, if it had been possible to become slaves of the barbarians, and at the same time to save the people of the city, that at least might have brought us some forgiveness for saving ourselves so disgracefully. But if, in fact, we are bound to look on while such a great multitude of Romans is being destroyed by the hand of the enemy, this will be more bitter than any form of death of which a man could tell. For we should appear to be doing nothing more or less than helping the barbarians to perpetrate this dreadful deed. While, therefore, we are sufficiently our own masters to adorn necessity with valour, let us make glorious the fortune which has fallen upon us. And I say that we ought all to arm ourselves in the best possible manner, and advance upon the enemy when they are not expecting us. For the result for us will be one of two things: either fortune will have wrought for us in some way a success which transcends our present hope, or we, in achieving a happy end, shall have rid ourselves of our present troubles with the fairest fame. </p>                        </div>

And never after that time would he allow Uliaris to come into his presence; but he wrote to the emperor everything which had taken place. And the emperor treated no one with severity on account of these things, but upon hearing of the disagreement between <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a>, he recalled <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a> immediately and appointed <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> commander-in-chief for the whole war.

In carrying out this purpose, however, they avoided the Germans, having already had experience of their crafty and untrustworthy character, being well content if they too should not come against the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> with <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, but should stand aside for both. But they sent envoys to Vaces, the ruler of the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a>, offering great sums of money and inviting him to an offensive and defensive alliance. But these envoys, upon learning that Vaces was a friend and ally of the emperor, returned unsuccessful. It was natural, therefore, that <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> should be at a loss in these circumstances, and he was constantly calling together many of the elders. And from them he made many inquiries as to how he should form his plans and act in order that he might achieve the greatest success. Accordingly many opinions were expressed by those who gathered for the council, some of them in no way adapted to the situation, and some too which contained suggestions worthy of some consideration. And among these suggestions this idea also was advanced, that the emperor of the Romans had plainly never been able to make war upon the barbarians in the West before the time when the treaty had been made with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>. For it was only then that the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and Moors had been destroyed, and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had suffered their present misfortunes. Consequently, if someone should once more rouse the hostility of the king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> against the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, the Romans thereafter would never be able, when once that nation had been stirred up to war against them, to carry on another war against any people in the world.

And it is about eighty-four stades distant from the shore of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian</a> Gulf, and from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> a journey of three days and eighty stades. And it is situated upon a very high hill, having no approach at all upon the level ground, and for this reason it is entirely inaccessible for an enemy. In that city <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> had assembled all the most notable troops among the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and had established them there as a garrison, conjecturing that the Romans, unless they should first capture this city, would never dare to march against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>. </p>                        </div>

So they took their places by companies, and were setting up their huts at different points in the line; and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, observing that the enemy were rather far apart from one another, and were not able easily to bring assistance to each other, since they were in a great plain, suddenly advanced upon them in the late afternoon, on the side to the east of the city, where <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> happened to be still engaged in making camp with his spearmen and guards. And the Romans took up their arms and began to defend themselves against their assailants as well as the circumstances permitted, and by their valour they forced them back with the greatest ease and routed them; and in following up their flight they reached the middle of the hill. There the barbarian's turned upon them, and, confident in the strength of their position, made a stand against their pursuers; and since they were shooting from above, they slew many of them, until night coming on put a stop to the fighting. Thus the two armies separated and bivouacked that night. Now it happened that on the day before this encounter some of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had been sent out to the country close by at early dawn in order to gather provisions. These foraging parties, having learned nothing of the presence of the enemy, returned at night, and suddenly spying the fires of the Romans, they became greatly amazed and frightened.

For every time the Romans saw their opponents cutting this grass for the sake of their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, they would ascend the hill with a great rush, and, upon reaching the enemy, they would engage with them, and by making a display of valorous deeds, try to prevent them altogether from carrying off the grass; and they always slew many of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> in this place. Then the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, finding themselves no match for their enemy in valour devised the following plan. They removed the wheels along with the axles from their waggons and held them in readiness; then when they had commenced to cut the grass, as soon as they saw that the Romans, as they ascended, were at the middle of the hill, they released the wheels to rush down upon them from above. But by some chance it so happened that these wheels went all the way to the level ground without touching a single man. And since they had failed in this attempt, the barbarians on that occasion took to flight and got inside the fortifications, but after that they adopted the following plan. After filling the ravines which are close to the fortifications with ambuscades of the men of note among them, a few soldiers would shew themselves near the grass to the enemy, and when the fighting had come to close quarters, those in concealment would leap out from their ambuscades, and, being greatly superior to their opponents in number, and striking terror into them because they had not previously seen their assailants, they used to kill great numbers of them and always turned the rest to flight. And although those of the Romans who had kept their position in the camps did see the enemy rising from the ambuscades, and tried, with much shouting, to call their companions back, still they failed utterly to do so, since those fighting could not in the least hear their call, because, in the first place, they were separated from them by a great expanse of hillside, and, in the second place, the barbarians purposely always made a din to drown the voices by beating their weapons together. </p>                        </div>

And by such means the generals could always give the appropriate commands to the soldiers, and they on their part were able to execute the commands thus communicated to them. For during actual combat the human voice is in no way adapted to give any clear instructions, since it obviously has to contend with the clash of arms on every side, and fear paralyzes the senses of those fighting. But since at the present time such skill has become obsolete through ignorance and it is impossible to express both commands by one trumpet, do you adopt the following course hereafter. With the cavalry trumpets urge on the soldiers to continue fighting with the enemy, but with those of the infantry call the men back to the retreat. For it is impossible for them to fail to recognize the sound of either one, for in the one case the sound comes forth from leather and very thin wood, and in the other from rather thick brass.

For every good thing, when in excess, is wont to change for the worse. Do you, therefore, from this time forth, not allow your enthusiasm for battle to cause you to fail of success; for to flee from one who is inflicting loss upon you is, as you surely know, no disgrace. But he who without looking about him goes into trouble which is before his eyes and, should it so happen, escapes from it, still stands convicted of folly; but the man truly noble is he who plays the part of a brave man in dangers that cannot be avoided. Now the barbarians, since they are unable to fight a decisive battle with us in the open, are trying to destroy us by laying snares. But for us it is more blameworthy to face the danger than to escape from their ambush. For nothing is more shameful than to fall in with the plans of the enemy. </p>                        </div>

So spoke <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. And the soldiers, seeing the enemy near the grass, made a charge against them and killed a few of their number in the first onset. And one of the Moors saw among these fallen <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> one in particular whose person was adorned with gold, and laying hold of the hair of his head, he began to drag the corpse after him in order to strip it.

And since no one of them dared set out on this mission (for they thought that they would never elude their besiegers), they devised the following plan. They first put in readiness the men whom they were intending to send to <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, and then waited for a moonless night; when this came they put a letter into their hands, when it was well on in the night, and thereupon all raised a mighty shout at many parts of the circuit-wall. One would have supposed that they had been thrown into confusion owing to a violent attack of the enemy and an unexpected capture of the city. And the Romans, utterly unable to understand what was taking place, by the will of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> remained quietly in the camps, suspecting that some stratagem would be carried out from the city and that an army from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> bringing assistance to the enemy had come against them. And moved as they were by these fears, they thought it better for them to remain quietly in a secure position and thus save themselves than to go on a moonless night into a danger which could, in a way, be foreseen. By such means, therefore, the barbarians concealed their plan from the enemy and despatched the men on the way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>. And they, without being seen by a single one of the enemy, came before <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> on the third day and displayed the letter. And the writing was as follows: When you appointed us, O King, for the garrison of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435135UAux class=place long=13.4769 lat=43.4864>Auximum</a>, you said that you had placed in our keeping the keys of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> itself and of your kingdom. And for this very reason you enjoined upon us to be on guard with every fibre of our being, that we should not by any act of ours betray the power of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> to the enemy, and you declared that, if we craved your assistance, you would be at hand with the whole army even before any messenger could announce your coming. Now as for us, we have, up to the present time, though fighting both with famine and with <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, proved ourselves faithful guardians of your kingdom, but you have seen fit to aid us in no way whatsoever. You must consider, therefore, whether the Romans may not one day capture <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435135UAux class=place long=13.4769 lat=43.4864>Auximum</a> and take up the keys which you yourself are disregarding as they lie here, and thereby be excluded in future from none of your possessions.

But chief among the many causes of his concern was the famine, which disturbed him greatly, since he had no source from which to provide supplies for his army. For the Romans, on the one hand, being as they were masters of the sea and holding the fortress in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/436135PAnc class=place long=13.51 lat=43.61>Ancon</a>, brought all their supplies from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=place long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabria</a> and stored them in that place, and, at the proper time, easily got them from there.

But the barbarians made frequent sallies against them, wishing rather to reach a decision by battle with the Romans than to be hard pressed by lack of provisions; and the engagements at first, indeed, proved indecisive, but after a time the Romans, now having the advantage, shut the enemy up within their wall and continued to guard them securely, so that no one could leave the city. So the barbarians, seeing that their provisions were failing, and finding themselves helpless in their present situation, sent to <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> without the knowledge of their enemy, begging him to bring them assistance with all speed, on the ground that they would not hold out very much longer.

There they too made camp and established themselves over against their enemy, at a distance of about sixty stades from them. And neither side began an attack. For the Romans, on the one hand, deemed it sufficient if they should block the way for their enemy, so that they could not advance upon the besieging army, and the barbarians, on the other, were reluctant to fight a decisive battle with their enemy in that place, reasoning that, if they should fail in this engagement, they would ruin the whole cause of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. For, in that case, they would no longer be able to unite with the troops of <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> and with him to give assistance to the besieged.

But to violate oaths which are set down in writing and to disregard treaties — this would not be proper even for the most ignoble of men.

Do not thou, at least, my excellent friend, follow such a course, and that too when it involves an insult to the great emperor, who would surely not be likely to overlook the insult, or fail to exact atonement in the fullest measure. Now the best course is for each man to keep his own possessions in safety, and not, by laying claim to the possessions of others, to involve himself in any danger which concerns his most vital interests. When Theudibert had read this letter, perplexed as he was already by his present situation, and sharply reproached by the Germans, because, as they said, they were, for no good reason, dying in a deserted land, he broke camp with the survivors of the Franks and retired homeward with great speed. </p>                        </div>

For not a Goth can find a way to get outside the fortifications. And as for food, the most available supply we have is the grass which grows by the wall, and even this at the present time we cannot so much as touch, except by losing many men in the struggle for it.

But the inroad of the Franks, coming upon us unexpectedly as it did, has made havoc of all our preparations, a result for which I, at least, could not justly bear the blame. For things which are beyond human power confer even upon those who fail the boon of being free from blame, since fortune draws upon herself whatever charge springs from what has befallen. Now, however, since we hear that Theudibert has got out of our way, we shall at no distant time, if God wills, come to you with the whole Gothic army. And it is needful for you to bear whatever falls to your lot manfully and as befits the necessity which is upon you, calling to mind, first, your own valour, on account of which I chose you out from the whole army and established you in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435135UAux class=place long=13.4769 lat=43.4864>Auximum</a>, and respecting also the reputation which you hold among all the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, and which prompted them to put you forward as a bulwark for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> and for their own safety.

In view of this situation <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was eager to capture alive one of the men of note among the enemy, in order that he might learn what the reason might be why the barbarians were holding out in their desperate situation. And <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> promised readily to perform such a service for him. For there were some men in his command, he said, from the nation of the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a>, who are accustomed to conceal themselves behind a small rock or any bush which may happen to be near and pounce upon an enemy. In fact, they are constantly practising this in their native haunts along the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, both on the Romans and on the barbarians as well. <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was pleased by this suggestion and bade him see that the thing was done with all speed. So <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> chose out one of the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a> who was well suited as to size of body and especially active, and commanded him to bring a man of the enemy, assuring him that he would receive a generous reward from <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. And he added that he could do this easily in the place where the grass was, because for a long time past the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had been feeding upon this grass, since their provisions were exhausted. So this barbarian at early dawn went close to the fortifications, and hiding himself in a bush and drawing his body into small compass, he remained in concealment near the grass. And at daybreak a Goth came there and began hastily to gather the blades of grass, suspecting no harm from the bush, but looking about frequently toward the enemy's camp, lest anyone should attack him from there. Then the barbarian, falling unexpectedly upon the Goth from behind, made him captive, holding him tightly about the waist with both hands, and thus carried him to the camp and handed him over to <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>. And when he questioned the prisoner, asking what basis of confidence and what assurance the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> could possibly have that they were absolutely unwilling to yield to the Romans, but were voluntarily enduring the most dreadful suffering, the Goth told <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> the whole truth concerning Burcentius, and when he was brought before him he proved his guilt. As for Burcentius, when he perceived that he had been already found out, he concealed nothing of what he had done. Wherefore <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> handed him over to his comrades to do with him as they wished, and they not long afterwards burned him alive, the enemy looking on as they did so. Thus did Burcentius profit by his love for money. </p>                        </div>

Now there was a spring on a steep slope to the north of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435135UAux class=place long=13.4769 lat=43.4864>Auximum</a>, about a stone's throw distant from the circuit- wall, which discharged its water in a very small stream into a cistern which had been there from of old; and when the cistern became full from this small inflow, it was a matter of no difficulty for the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435135UAux class=place long=13.4769 lat=43.4864>Auximum</a> to draw the water. This situation suggested to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> that, if the water should not be collected there, the barbarians would never be able to fill their jars from the spring's flow, because they would be exposed to the missiles of their enemy for a long time. Wishing, therefore, to destroy the cistern, he devised the following plan. He armed his whole force and drew it up in a circle about the circuit-wall as if for battle, giving his opponents the impression that he was about to make an attack upon their defences from all sides without the least delay. The <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, consequently, fearing the attack, remained quietly at the battlements, with the intention of warding off their enemy from that position. But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> meanwhile chose out five <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> who were skilled in masonry and conducted them to the cistern with mattocks and other implements suitable for cutting stone, concealing them as they went under a great number of shields; then he commanded them to put forth all their strength to break up and tear down the walls of the cistern as quickly as possible. As for the barbarians, as long as they suspected that these men were coming against the wall, they remained quiet, in order that they might come as close as possible and thus form an easy mark for their missiles, never once thinking what their real object was; but when they saw that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> had got inside the cistern, they began to hurl stones and discharge all kinds of missiles at them. Then indeed all the other Romans retired on the run, but the five <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> alone, who had now reached safety, began their work; for a sort of vault had been built over the cistern by the men of old in order to shade the water. So when they had got under this vault, they paid not the least heed to the enemy, although they were discharging missiles with great frequency. </p>                        </div>

And the Romans, urged on by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, made a countercharge with great enthusiasm. So a fierce battle took place in which for a long time they engaged in a hand-to-hand struggle, and there was great slaughter on both sides. But the men were falling more thickly among the Romans. For since the barbarians were defending themselves from a higher position, a few men could overpower many, and gaining superiority in the hand-to-hand struggle, they were killing more men than those who were killed among themselves. However, the Romans were determined not to give in, feeling shame before <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, who was present and urging them on with shouts. While this battle was in progress, it also happened that a missile came flying with a shrill whiz toward the belly of the general, having been directed there by one of the enemy either by some chance or with deliberate intent. And this missile was not seen at all by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. At any rate, he failed either to guard against it or to step aside to avoid it. But a certain spearman named Unigastus, who was standing beside him, saw it when it was not far from the belly of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, and by putting forth his right hand saved the general unexpectedly; but he himself, owing to the wound inflicted by the arrow, withdrew immediately, suffering severe pain. And after that, since the sinews had been severed, he was never able to use his hand again.

Then the other Romans, seeing the enemy now giving way, began to pursue them and the rout became decisive, and the barbarians went back inside the fortifications. Now the Romans thought that the cistern had been destroyed and that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> had accomplished their whole task, but in fact they had been altogether unable to remove so much as one pebble from the masonry; for the artisans of old, who cared most of all for excellence in their work had built this masonry in such a way as to yield neither to time nor to the attempts of men to destroy it.

And the soldiers did accordingly, but the barbarians made use of a well inside the fortifications which had an exceedingly scant supply of water, and thus they supplied themselves during this time, but with a smaller quantity than they needed. Thereafter <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> no longer exerted himself either to capture the place by storm or to carry out any plot with regard to the water or anything else, hoping that by famine alone he would overcome the enemy.

For the Franks were causing him great concern, since he fully expected that they would come to the assistance of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> almost immediately.

The soldiers, furthermore, would not allow him to concede their property to the barbarians, displaying many wounds which they had received at their hands before the city and recounting all the struggles which had fallen to their lot during this siege; and they declared that the rewards for these sufferings were surely the spoils of the vanquished. But finally, since the Romans were compelled by the pressing need of the moment, and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were overcome by the famine, they came to an agreement with each other, stipulating that the Romans should divide among themselves one half of their wealth, while the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> should keep the rest and be subjects of the emperor.

It was here that the Romans met with a piece of good fortune which made it perfectly clear that <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> herself was determining the course of events for both sides. For the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had previously collected a large number of boats in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=place long=8.3 lat=44.3>Liguria</a> and brought them down to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450120WEri class=place long=12.0293 lat=44.9753>Padus</a>, and after filling them with grain and other provisions were purposing to set sail for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>. But the water in this river fell so low at that time that it was altogether impossible to navigate upon it, until the Romans came up and seized the boats with all their cargoes. Then the river not long afterward returned to its proper volume and became navigable thereafter. And as far as we know from tradition, this had never happened to the river before. By this time the barbarians had already begun to experience some lack of provisions. For they were both unable to bring anything in by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a>, since their enemy commanded the sea everywhere, and they were shut off from the river.

But to plunge into a disaster which can be foreseen, when the opportunity is offered to be saved without danger, is utter folly. Besides, the Roman nation has proved itself altogether untrustworthy toward all barbarians, since by its very nature it is hostile to them.

For we need not add that, in point of fact, the emperor surpasses all others in the ability to outstrip his enemies in regard to multitude of soldiers. But as touching the loyalty of these Franks, which they proudly claim to shew toward all barbarians, this has been well displayed by them, first to the Thuringians and the Burgundian nation, and then to you also, their allies I And indeed we, on our part, should take pleasure in asking the Franks by what god they can possibly intend to swear when they declare that they will give you surety for their loyalty. For you understand surely in what manner they have honoured the one by whom they have already sworn — they who have received from you vast sums of money, as you know, and also the entire territory of Gaul as the price of their alliance, and yet have decided not merely to render you no assistance at all in your peril, but have actually taken up arms thus wantonly against you, if any account of those things which happened on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450120WEri class=place long=12.0293 lat=44.9753>Padus</a> is preserved among you.

Now some few were led by the fact that the grain burned suddenly to believe that the thing had been carried out by a plot, but others suspected that the place had been struck by lightning. Still, whichever of the two views they took, both the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> were, more than ever, plunged into a state of helplessness, unable as they were even to trust their own compatriots thereafter, and thinking that war was being waged against them by God Himself. Such was the course of these events. </p>                        </div>

And when they reached the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a>, Sisigis, who commanded the garrisons of that district, received them in one of the fortresses, and not only submitted himself but also urged each of the other commanders to do likewise.

But when these men learned what had been done by Sisigis, they became fearful for their families and demanded that they should first go to them. Consequently Uraias entered the Cottian <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> with his whole army, and laid siege to Sisigis and the force of <a href=/people/6014 target=_blank>Thomas</a>.

For the most of the men under his command were natives of these very fortresses. And when these men learned that their own homes had been captured they detached themselves suddenly from the army of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> having decided to go over to the troops under John, and as a result of this Uraias was able neither to accomplish anything there nor to bring assistance to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> endangered in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, but he returned unsuccessful with a few men to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=place long=8.3 lat=44.3>Liguria</a> and remained quietly there.

And when the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> became aware of this, they began to feel that the Romans were offering them peace with treacherous intent, and became very suspicious of them; and they forthwith declared flatly that without both the signature and the oath of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> they would never make a compact with the Romans. </p>                        </div>

I am not alone in knowing that the fortune of war is by no means fixed and firm, but 1 think that each one of you shares this same view with me regarding it. For many men have been deceived by the hope of victory when it seemed certain that it would come to them, while men who, to all appearances, have met with disaster, have many a time had the fortune to triumph unexpectedly over their adversaries. Consequently 1 say that men deliberating with regard to peace should not put before them only the expectation of success, but reflecting that the result will be either way, they should make their choice of policy on this basis. In view of this, it has seemed best to me, at any rate, to bring to a conference you, my colleagues, and these envoys of the emperor, to the end that the present occasion may afford an opportunity to choose at our leisure whatever course may seem destined to be of advantage to the emperor, that after the event you may never bring any reproach against me. For it would be a thing most monstrous, first to be silent as long as it is possible to choose the better course, and later upon surveying the outcome decreed by fortune, to bring accusations. Now as to the emperor's decision with a view to the conclusion of the war, and as to the wishes of <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, you are of course well informed. And if you, too, think this course advantageous, let each man come forward and speak. If, however, you think that you are able to recover the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> for the Romans and to gain the mastery over the enemy, nothing will prevent you from speaking with complete frankness. When <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had thus spoken, all expressed the opinion with certainty that the emperor's decision was best, and that they would be unable to do the enemy any further harm. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was pleased with the expression of the commanders' opinion, and asked them to set it down in writing, in order that they might never deny it. They accordingly wrote a document stating that they were unable to achieve superiority over their opponents in the war. </p>                        </div>

So after deliberating among themselves, all the best of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> decided to declare <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> Emperor of the West.

But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was quite unwilling to assume the ruling power against the will of the emperor; for he had an extraordinary loathing for the name of tyrant, and furthermore he had, in fact, been bound by the emperor previously by most solemn oaths never during his lifetime to organize a revolution; still, in order to turn the situation before him to the best advantage, he let it appear that he received the proposals of the barbarians gladly. And <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, perceiving this, became fearful, and saying that the deliberations of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had arrived at the best possible result, he too secretly urged <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> to enter upon the royal power; for no one, he said, would stand in his way.

And indeed the famine would not permit them to put off the matter to any other time, but, by its increasing pressure, was driving them to this decision. Consequently they again sent envoys to the camp of the Romans, with instructions to make some vague statement openly, but in secret to receive pledges from <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, both that he would do no harm to anyone of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, and that thenceforth he himself would be king of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>; this accomplished, they were to come with him and the Roman army into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>. As for <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, he swore to everything else, just as the envoys required of him, but concerning the kingship he said that he would swear to <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> himself and the rulers of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. And the envoys, thinking that he would never reject the kingship, but that he would strive for it above all other things, made not the least hesitation in urging him to come with them into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>. Then <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> ordered <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> and John and <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a> and Aratius to go with their several commands to different places (for these were the men whom he suspected of being exceedingly hostile to him), and to provide provisions for themselves; for he alleged that it was no longer possible for him, in the place where he was, to bring in provisions for the whole army.

And the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> who commanded these towns, as soon as they received the pledges, came to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and remained with him — all except Ildibadus, a man of note, who commanded the garrison in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454110UVer class=place long=10.997 lat=45.4472>Verona</a>; for though he too sent envoys to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> on the same mission as the others, especially because <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had found his children in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> and taken possession of them, still he did not either come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> or submit himself to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>.

But when they learned that he was making preparations for his departure in real earnest, all the loyal <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> of that region who were still left formed a common purpose and went to Uraias, the nephew of <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/452092UTic class=place long=9.1529 lat=45.1846>Ticinum</a>; and after first lamenting long with him, they spoke as follows: The man who has proved to be chiefly responsible for the present misfortunes of the nation of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> is no other than you. For we, on our part, should have long ago removed that uncle of yours from the kingship, seeing that he has led us in such a cowardly manner and with such ill fortune, just as we removed <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a>, the nephew of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>, unless, out of respect for the natural vigour which you seemed to display, we had decided to concede to <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> merely the title of king, but in fact to entrust to you alone the rule of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. What, however, seemed then consideration, now stands out clearly as folly and the cause of these misfortunes of ours. For very many of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, as you know, dear Uraias, and our noblest, have perished in the war, and such nobles as are left among the survivors <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> will lead away along with <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> and all our wealth. And no one could deny that we too shall suffer this same fate a little later, seeing that we are reduced to a small and pitiable band. Since, therefore, such a dire fate has encompassed us, it will be preferable for us to die with glory rather than to see our wives and children led by the enemy to the extremities of the earth. And we shall, in all probability, accomplish something worthy of valorous men, if only we have you as leader of our struggles.

Then, after clothing him in the purple, they declared him king of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and entreated him to take the situation in hand and set matters right for them. Thus did Ildibadus come into the royal power. But a short time after this, he called all the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> together and spoke as follows: All of you, fellow-soldiers, as I am well aware, have had experience in many wars, so that we shall probably never proceed to make war on the spur of the moment. For experience brings a man sober judgment, so that he is not wont to act rashly in any case. Now you ought, in fairness to yourselves, to call to recollection all that has befallen us heretofore, and make plans to meet the present situation with this in mind. For when forgetfulness of past events comes upon men, it often, through folly, exalts their minds at the wrong moment, and then, when their all is at stake, utterly overthrows them. Now when <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> placed himself in the hands of the enemy, it was not against your will nor did you strive to prevent him, but at that time you bowed before the adversities of fortune and considered that we should best consult our own interests by sitting at home and obeying <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> rather than by risking our lives in endless dangers. But now, upon hearing that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> is setting out for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, you have decided to undertake a revolution. And yet each one of you ought to have taken into consideration that things do not always happen for men as they will them, but many times the outcome of events has unexpectedly gone contrary to what has been determined upon. For chance or a change of heart have a way of setting most things right when least expected; and even now it is by no means improbable that this is what will happen to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. It is better, therefore, to make enquiries of him first and to attempt to bring the man back to the earlier agreement, and only after this should you proceed to the next best step. </p>                        </div>

So these envoys, upon coming before <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, reminded him of the agreement made with them and reproached him as a breaker of his promises, calling him a slave by his own choice, and chiding him because, they said, he did not blush at choosing servitude in place of the kingship; and with many other speeches of a similar sort they kept urging him to accept the rule. For, should he do so, they declared that Ildibadus would come of his own accord in order to lay down the purple at his feet and do obeisance to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> as king of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>.

Now the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> did indeed take pleasure in seeing <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> and his wife, and marvelled at both the beauty and the great stature of the barbarian throng. But upon receiving the wealth of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>, a notable sight in itself, he merely set it forth for the members of the senate to view privately in the palace, being jealous because of the magnitude and splendour of the achievement; and neither did he bring it out before the people, nor did he accord to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> the customary triumph, as he had done when he returned from his victory over <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> and the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>. However, the name of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was on the lips of all: to him were ascribed two victories, such as had never before fallen to the lot of any one man to achieve; he had brought two kings captive to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, and unexpectedly had made both the race and the possessions of <a href=/people/12055 target=_blank>Gizeric</a> and of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> Roman spoil — two kings than whom none, among barbarians at least, has ever been more illustrious; and he had brought back their wealth from the enemy and restored it once more to the state, and recovered for the empire in a short space of time almost one half of its territory on land and sea. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=ethnic long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantines</a> took delight in watching <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> as he came forth from his house each day and proceeded toward the market-place or as he returned to his house, and none of them could get enough of this sight. For his progress resembled a crowded festival procession, since he was always escorted by a large number of <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, as well as <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and Moors. Furthermore, he had a fine figure and was tall and remarkably handsome. But his conduct was so meek and his attitude toward those who met him so affable that he seemed like a very poor man and one of no repute. <br />As a commander the love ever felt for him both by soldiers and peasants was irresistible, seeing that, in his treatment of his soldiers on the one hand, he was surpassed by none in generosity; (for when any had met with misfortune in battle, he used to console them by large presents of money for the wounds they had received, and to those who had distinguished themselves he presented bracelets and necklaces to wear as prizes, and when a soldier had lost in battle <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> or bow or anything else whatsoever, another was straightway provided in its place by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>); and in his treatment of the peasants, on the other hand, he won their affection because he shewed so much restraint and such consideration for them that it never fell to their lot to suffer any violence when <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was general — nay, rather, all those whose land was visited by a large body of troops under his command unexpectedly found that they were enriched; for they always set their own price upon everything sold to the soldiers. And whenever the crops were ripe, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> used to watch closely that the cavalry in passing should not damage any man's grain. Also, when the fruit was ripe on the trees, not a single man was permitted to touch it. Furthermore, he possessed the virtue of self-restraint in a marvellous degree; and hence it was that he never would touch any woman other than his wedded wife. And so, although he took captive such great numbers of women from both the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, and such beautiful women as no man in the world, I suppose, has ever seen, he refused to allow any of them to come into his presence or meet him in any other way. In addition to all his other qualities, he was also remarkably shrewd, and in difficult situations he was able with unerring judgment to decide upon the best course of action. Furthermore, in the dangers of war he was both courageous without incurring unnecessary risks and daring to a degree without losing his cool judgment, either striking quickly or holding back his attack upon the enemy according to the requirements of the situation. Nay more, in desperate situations, on the one hand he shewed a spirit which was both full of confidence and unruffled by excitement, and in the fulness of success, on the other hand, he neither gave way to vanity nor rushed into indulgence; at any rate no man ever saw <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> intoxicated. <br />Now as long as he was in command of the Roman army both in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, he was continually victorious and always acquired whatever lay before him. But when he had been brought back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> by imperial summons, his ability was recognized still more fully than in previous times and received most generous appreciation. For since by his own outstanding merit in every field he was prominent above all his fellows, and surpassed the generals of all time in the vastness of his wealth and the number of his bodyguards and spearmen, he was naturally looked upon by all officers and soldiers alike as a formidable person. For no one, I am sure, had the hardihood to resist his commands, and his men never refused to carry out whatever orders he gave, both respecting as they did his ability and fearing his power. For he used to equip seven thousand horsemen from his own household, and not one of these was an inferior man, but each of them could claim to stand first in the line of battle and to challenge the best of the enemy. Indeed, when <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was beleaguered by the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, and the Roman elders were watching the progress of the struggle through the various engagements, they marvelled greatly and cried out that one man's household was destroying the power of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>. <br />So <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, having become, as was noted above, a man of power, both because of the respect accorded him and because of his sound judgment, continued to advise such measures as would prove in the interest of the emperor's cause and to carry out with independent judgment the decisions reached. But the other commanders, being, unlike him, on an equality with one another, and having no single thought in mind except to make sure of their own personal gain, had already begun both to plunder the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and to put the civil population at the mercy of the soldiers, and neither were they themselves any longer giving heed to the requirements of the situation, nor could they secure obedience to their commands on the part of the soldiers. Consequently, many blunders were committed by them, and the entire fabric of the Roman power was utterly destroyed in a short space of time. And I shall now proceed to recount the story of these events as best I can. <br />When Ildibadus learned that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had departed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> and was on his way, he began to gather about him all the barbarians and as many of the Roman soldiers as were inclined to favour a revolution. And he sought by every means to strengthen his rule, and laboured diligently to recover for the Gothic nation the sovereignty of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. Now at the first not more than a thousand men followed him and they held only one city, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/452092UTic class=place long=9.1529 lat=45.1846>Ticinum</a>, but little by little all the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=place long=8.3 lat=44.3>Liguria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/457120REne class=place long=12.01 lat=45.7>Venetia</a> came over to his side. <br />Now there was a certain <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> who held the office of comptroller of the state treasury; this official the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call logothete, using a Greek name. This man was always making charges against the soldiers for the losses they caused to the treasury of the state. And by subjecting them to trial for offences of this sort, he on his part quickly rose from obscurity to fame and from poverty to immense wealth, and not only this, but he also succeeded in collecting great sums of money for the emperor, surpassing all predecessors in this; but it was he, more than any other man, who was chiefly responsible for the deterioration of the army, in that the soldiers were both few and poor and reluctant to face the perils of war. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=ethnic long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantines</a> indeed went so far as to call him by the name Snips, because it was an easy feat for him to cut off the edge all around a golden coin, and while thus making it as much smaller as he wished, still to preserve the circular shape it originally had. For they call the tool with which such work is done snips. This <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, then, it was whom the emperor sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> after summoning <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> to return. And directly upon his arrival at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, he published an altogether unreasonable financial reckoning. For though the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a> had neither laid hands upon the emperor's money nor committed any offence against the state, he summoned them, first of all, to face an investigation, laying to their charge the wrongs they had done <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> and the other Gothic rulers, and compelling them to pay whatever gains they had made, as he alleged, by deceiving the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. In the second place, he disappointed the soldiers by the niggardliness of the reckoning with which he repaid them for their wounds and dangers. Hence not only did the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a> become disaftected from the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, but not one of the soldiers was willing any longer to undergo the dangers of war, and by wilfully refusing to fight, they caused the strength of the enemy to grow continually greater. <br />While the other commanders were remaining quiet on account of this situation, Vitalius alone (for he happened to have in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/457120REne class=place long=12.01 lat=45.7>Venetia</a> a numerous army comprising with others a great throng of barbarian <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>) had the courage to do battle with Ildibadus, fearing, as actually happened, that at a later time when his power had grown greatly they would be no longer able to check him. But in the fierce battle which took place near the city of Tarbesium, Vitalius was badly defeated and fled, saving some few men, but losing the most of them there. In this battle many <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> fell and among them Visandus, the leader of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>, was killed. And Theudimund, the son of Mauricius and grandson of <a href=/people/12180 target=_blank>Mundus</a>, a mere lad at the time, came indeed into danger of death, but succeeded in making his escape in company with Vitalius. As a result of this achievement the name of Ildibadus reached the emperor and spread over the whole world. <br />But after a time it so fell out that enmity sprang up between Uraias and Ildibadus for the following reason. Uraias had a wife who in wealth and personal beauty was adjudged first among all the women of these barbarians. This woman once went down to the bath clad in great magnificence of ornament and taking with her a very notable company of attendants. And seeing the wife of Ildibadus there in plain garments, she not only did her no obeisance as the consort of the king but otherwise too ignored and did her insult. For Ildibadus was still in poverty, having by no means come into royal wealth. And the wife of Ildibadus, being very much offended by the uncalled-for insult, came to her husband in tears and demanded that he avenge her for the outrageous treatment she had received from the wife of Uraias. Accordingly Ildibadus first slandered Uraias to the barbarians, imputing to him that he was intending to desert to the enemy, but a little later he put him to death by treachery, and thereby incurred the enmity of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. For it was by no means in accordance with their wish that Uraias should be thus unceremoniously removed from the world. And forthwith a large number of them formed a party and began to denounce Ildibadus vehemently as having committed an unholy deed. However, no one was willing to exact vengeance from him for this murder. <br />But there was one among them, Velas by name, who, though a <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepid</a> by birth, had attained the dignity of serving among the king's guards. This man had wooed a woman fair to look upon, and he loved her with an extraordinary love; but while he was off on an expedition against the enemy, in order to make some attack upon them in company with certain others, Ildibadus, meantime, either through ignorance or prompted by some other motive, married his intended bride to someone else among the barbarians. And when Velas, returning from the army, heard this, being passionate by nature, he could not bear the insult thus done him, but decided immediately to kill Ildibadus, thinking that he would thereby render a welcome service to all the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. <br />And so, when the king on a certain occasion was entertaining the noblest of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> at a banquet, he watched for an opportunity and put his plot into execution. For while the king is dining, it is customary for many persons to stand about him and among them his bodyguards. So when he had stretched out his hand to the food as he lay reclining upon the couch, Velas suddenly smote his neck with his sword. And so, while the food was still grasped in the man's fingers, his head was severed and fell upon the tablew and filled all those present with great consternation and amazement. Such, then, was the vengeance which overtook Ildibadus for the murder of Uraias. And the winter drew to a close and the sixth year ended in this war, the history of [541 a.d.] which <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> has written.</p>                        </div>

Now these Rogi are indeed a Gothic nation, but in ancient times they used to live as an independent people. But <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> had early persuaded them, along with certain other nations, to form an alliance with him, and they were absorbed into the Gothic nation and acted in common with them in all things against their enemies. But since they had absolutely no intercourse with women other than their own, each successive generation of children was of unmixed blood, and thus they had preserved the name of their nation among themselves. This Eraric, in the midst of the turmoil consequent upon the murder of Ildibadus, was suddenly proclaimed king by the Rogi. This act pleased the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> not at all; however, the most of them had in fact fallen into great despondence because the hopes they had formerly placed in Ildibadus had been frustrated; for he, they felt, would have been able to recover the kingdom and the sovereignty of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> for the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. Eraric, however, did nothing at all worthy of note; for after living in office five months he died in the following manner. There was a certain <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, a nephew of Ildibadus, a man gifted with remarkable discretion, energetic in the extreme, and held in high esteem among the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. <br />This <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> happened at that time to be in command of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> in Tarbesium. But when he learned that Ildibadus had been removed from among men in the manner described, he sent to <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantianus</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> asking that pledges be given him for his safety, on condition that he hand over to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> both himself and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> whom he commanded along with Tarbesium. This proposal <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantianus</a> heard gladly and swore to everything just as <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> requested, and a fixed day for the transaction was agreed upon by both, on which <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> who were keeping guard in Tarbesium were to receive into the city some of the associates of <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantianus</a> and put themselves and the city into their hands. <br />But already the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were becoming dissatisfied with the rule of Eraric, seeing the man to be incompetent to carry on the war against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and the most of them were openly abusing him as one who had stood in their way to great achievements, alleging that he had done away with Ildibadus.w <br />And finally they made an agreement among themselves and sent to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> at Tarbesium, urging him to assume the royal power. For by now they were beginning to feel generally a keen sense of regret for the lost rule of Ildibadus, and so they began to turn their hope of victory toward his relative <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, having come to feel confidence in the man because his wish was the same as theirs. As for <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, when the messengers came before him, he, without any concealment, disclosed his agreement with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, but said that, if the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> should kill Eraric before the appointed day, he would both follow them and carry out every tiling in accordance with their desires. When the barbarians heard this, they set about forming a plot to compass the destruction of Eraric. Such was the progress of events in the Gothic camp. <br />But in the meantime the Roman armies, though enjoying security as a result of the preoccupation of the enemy, were neither moving to unite their forces, nor were they planning any action against the barbarians. As for Eraric, he called together all the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and persuaded them to send envoys to the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, who should beg him to make peace with them on the same terms on which he had been willing previously to conclude a treaty with <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, on the condition, namely, that the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, holding the territory north of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450120WEri class=place long=12.0293 lat=44.9753>Padus</a>, should withdraw from the rest of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. And since this was approved by the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, he chose out some of those especially intimate with him, including one Caballarius by name, and sent them as envoys. Now these envoys were ostensibly to treat of those matters which I have mentioned above, but secretly he instructed them to treat with the emperor of nothing else than how he might himself receive a great sum of money and be enrolled among the patricians in return for handing over the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and laying aside his official title. So the envoys, upon reaching <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, proceeded to treat of these matters. It was at this time that the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> killed Eraric by treachery. And after his death, <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> took over the rule in accordance with the agreement made with them.</p>                        </div>

The consequence of this was that John, the nephew of Vitalian, and <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> and Vitalius and all the others, after establishing garrisons in each city, gathered at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, where <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantianus</a> and <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, whom I have mentioned previously, were quartered. And when they were all gathered together, it was decided that the best procedure for them was to march first against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454110UVer class=place long=10.997 lat=45.4472>Verona</a>, which is in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/457120REne class=place long=12.01 lat=45.7>Venetia</a>, and then, after capturing that city and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> there, to move against <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/452092UTic class=place long=9.1529 lat=45.1846>Ticinum</a>. So this Roman army was assembled with a strength of twelve thousand men, and its commanders were eleven in number, the first of whom were, as it happened, <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantianus</a> and <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; and they marched straight toward the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454110UVer class=place long=10.997 lat=45.4472>Verona</a>. And when they had come to a place close to the city, about sixty stades away, they made camp in the plain there. For plains which are suitable for cavalry stretch out in every direction from this place and extend as far as the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/452108UMan class=place long=10.7975 lat=45.1608>Mantua</a>, which is one day's journey distant from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454110UVer class=place long=10.997 lat=45.4472>Verona</a>. <br />Now there was a man of note among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/457120REne class=ethnic long=12.01 lat=45.7>Veneti</a>, <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a> by name, who lived in a fortress not far distant from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454110UVer class=place long=10.997 lat=45.4472>Verona</a>, and being as he was a staunch adherent of the emperor, he eagerly undertook to band over the city to the Roman army. And since one of the guards had been known to him from childhood, he sent to him some of his intimates and persuaded the man by means of a bribe to receive the emperor's army into the city. Then, when the guard of the gate had agreed, <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a> sent those who had arranged the matter with the guard to the commanders of the Roman army, in order both to report to them the arrangements made and to join them in forcing an entrance into the city by night. <br />The commanders then decided that it was advisable for one of their number to go in advance with some few men; and if the guard should set the gates open for them, they were to hold them fast and receive the army in safety into the city. Now no one among them all was willing to undertake this perilous enterprise except <a href=/people/7305 target=_blank>Artabazes</a> alone, an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> by birth but a man of exceptional ability in war, who not at all unwillingly offered himself for the undertaking. This man commanded some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> whom <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had, as it happened, sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> territory along with Bleschames a little before this, after his capture of the fortress Sisauranon. So he on the present occasion selected one hundred men from the whole army and at a late hour of the night went up close to the fortifications. And when the guard, true to his agreement, opened the gate for them, some of them took their stand there and were urging the army to come, while the others mounted the wall and killed the men on guard there, assailing them as they did without warning. Then the whole Gothic force, upon perceiving their evil plight, rushed off in flight through another gate. <br />Now there is a certain rock which rises to a great height facing the fortifications of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454110UVer class=place long=10.997 lat=45.4472>Verona</a>, from which it is possible to observe everything which is taking place in the city and to count the people in it, and, besides, to see for a very great distance over the plain. Thither the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> retreated and remained quiet during the whole night. As for the Roman army, it advanced to a point within forty stades of the city, but proceeded no further, the generals being engaged in a dispute among themselves over the money in the city. And they still continued to wrangle over this plunder until day had now clearly dawned; but the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, after observing accurately from the height both the number of the enemy scattered through the city and the distance at which the rest of the army had halted from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454110UVer class=place long=10.997 lat=45.4472>Verona</a>, made a rush toward the city, and passed through the very gate through which, as it happened, they had previously departed; for those who had entered the city were unable even to hold this gate. So the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, taking counsel together, hastily sought safety on the parapet along the circuit-wall; and when the barbarians in great numbers assailed them at close quarters, they all, and <a href=/people/7305 target=_blank>Artabazes</a> especially, made a display of remarkable deeds and warded off their assailants most vigorously. <br />At that moment the commanders of the Roman army had at last reached an agreement with each other regarding the money in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454110UVer class=place long=10.997 lat=45.4472>Verona</a>, and decided to proceed against the city with all the rest of the army. But finding the gates closed to them and the enemy warding them off most vigorously, they quickly marched to the rear, although they saw the others fighting inside the fortifications and begging them not to abandon them, but to remain there until they should save themselves by fleeing to them. So <a href=/people/7305 target=_blank>Artabazes</a> and his men, being overcome by the numbers of the enemy and despairing of assistance from their own army, all leaped down outside the wall. <br />Now all those who had the fortune to fall on smooth ground betook themselves unscathed to the Roman army, among whom was <a href=/people/7305 target=_blank>Artabazes</a> also, but as many as fell on rough ground were all killed instantly. <br />And when <a href=/people/7305 target=_blank>Artabazes</a> had reached the Roman army, he proceeded with them, having heaped abuse and contumely upon them all; and after crossing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450120WEri class=place long=12.0293 lat=44.9753>Eridanus</a>, they entered the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443119UFav class=place long=11.8841 lat=44.2856>Faventia</a>, which is in the land of <a href=/people/2704 target=_blank>Aemilia</a>, one hundred and twenty stades distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>.</p>                        </div>

Now when the commanders of the Roman army learned this, they began to deliberate over their situation. And <a href=/people/7305 target=_blank>Artabazes</a> came forward and spoke as follows: ' Fellow-commanders, let no one of you think fit at the present time to despise the enemy because they are inferior to us in number, nor, because he is fighting against men enslaved by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, let him advance against them in a reckless frame of mind. For many a man, deceived by a false estimate of a situation, has brought about his own downfall, while others who have been filled with unjustified contempt of their foes have seen their whole power ruined thereby; and even apart from this, the very fact of their previous ill fortune lures these men on to attain a fairer lot. For when fortune has reduced a man to despair and robbed him of his fair hopes, it changes his nature and leads him to feel an extraordinary degree of daring. And it is not because I am moved by mere suspicion that I have made these statements before you, but because of the thorough acquaintance I have recently made with the daring of these men while engaged in mortal combat with them. And let no one think that I now marvel at their power because I was defeated along with a handful of men. For it is to those who shall come to blows with them that men's valour becomes revealed, whether those men are superior in number or inferior. My opinion then is that it will be more to our advantage to watch for the crossing of the river by the barbarians, and, while the crossing is in progress, and about half their men are across, to engage with them then, rather than after they have already assembled, all in one body. And let no man consider such a victory inglorious. For the outcome of events alone is wont to decide whether a deed shall be named glorious or inglorious, and it is the victors whom men are accustomed to praise without investigating the manner of the victory. So spoke <a href=/people/7305 target=_blank>Artabazes</a>. But the commanders, owing to the divergence of their opinions, did nothing that they should, but continued to remain where they were and lose their opportunity by delay. <br />And now the army of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had come very near, and when they were about to cross the river, <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> called them all together and exhorted them as follows: My kinsmen, all other battles give promise, as a general thing, of a contest that will be more or less even and thereby incite the contending armies to the struggle, but we are entering this combat, not on an equality with our enemy as regards the advantages of fortune, but facing a very different situation. For they, even in case of a possible defeat, will be able after no long time to renew the fight against us. For there is left behind for them a numerous army quartered in the strongholds throughout the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and, furthermore, it is not at all improbable that another army will at a very early date come to their assistance from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. But if we, on the other hand, suffer this same fate, there will be a final end of the name and hopes of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. For from an army of two hundred thousand we have been reduced in the course of events to five thousand men. Having made such a preface, I think it not inappropriate to recall to your minds this fact also, that when you decided to take up arms with Ildibadus against the emperor, the number of your band amounted to no more than one thousand men, while your entire territory consisted of the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/452092UTic class=place long=9.1529 lat=45.1846>Ticinum</a>. But since you came off victors in the engagement, both our army and our territory have increased. So that if you are willing in this battle to display the same spirit of manly courage, I am hopeful that, as the war goes on, following its natural course, we shall accomplish the complete defeat of our opponents. For it always proves true that the victors increase both in numbers and in power. Let each one of you, therefore, be eager to join battle with the enemy with all your strength, understanding clearly that if we do not succeed in the present battle, it will be impossible to renew the struggle against our opponents. It is reasonable, furthermore, for us to grapple with the enemy with high hopes, taking courage from the unjust acts committed by them. For such has been their conduct towards their subjects that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a> at the present time need no further punishment for the flagrant treason which they dared to commit against the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>; so true is it that every form of evil, to put all in a word, has fallen to their lot from the liands of those whom they cordially received. And what enemy could be more easy to overcome than men whose deeds, even those done in God's name, are utterly wicked? Nay more, the very fear we inspire in them should properly be a further cause for confidence on our part as we enter the struggle. <br />For those against whom we proceed are no other men than those who recently first penetrated into the middle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454110UVer class=place long=10.997 lat=45.4472>Verona</a>, then abandoned it for no good reason, and, although not a man pursued them, yet even so rushed off in a disgraceful flight. After delivering this exhortation <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> commanded three hundred of his troops to cross the river at a distance of about twenty stades from where he stood and get behind the enemy's camp, and when the battle should come to close quarters, to fall upon their rear, harassing them with their missiles and assailing them with all their strength, in order that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> might be thrown into confusion and abandon all thought of resistance. He himself, meanwhile, with the rest of the army straightway crossed the river and advanced directly upon his opponents; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> immediately came out to meet him. And when, as both armies advanced, they came nearer to each other, a <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goth</a>, Valaris by name, tall of stature and of most terrifying mien, an active man withal and a good fighter, rode his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> out before the rest of the army and took his stand in the open space between the armies, clad in a corselet and wearing a helmet on his head; and he challenged all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, if anyone was willing to do battle with him. Whereupon all remained quiet, being stricken with terror, save <a href=/people/7305 target=_blank>Artabazes</a> alone, who advanced to fight the man. <br />So they rode their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> toward each other, and when they came close, both thrust their spears, but <a href=/people/7305 target=_blank>Artabazes</a>, anticipating his opponent, delivered the first blow and pierced the right side of Valaris. And the barbarian, mortally wounded, was about to fall backward to the earth, but his spear, resting on the ground behind him and being braced against a rock, did not permit him to fall. As for <a href=/people/7305 target=_blank>Artabazes</a>, he continued to press forward still more vigorously, driving the spear into the man's vitals; for as yet he did not suppose that he had already suffered a mortal wound. Thus it came about that Valaris' spear stood practically upright and its iron point encountered the corselet of <a href=/people/7305 target=_blank>Artabazes</a>, and first, entering little by little, it went clear through the corselet, and then, slipping further, grazed the skin of <a href=/people/7305 target=_blank>Artabazes</a>' neck. And by some chance the iron, as it pushed forward, cut an artery which lies in that region, and there was immediately a great flow of blood. However, the man experienced no feeling of pain, and he rode back to the Roman army, while Valaris fell dead on the spot. But the flow of blood from <a href=/people/7305 target=_blank>Artabazes</a>' wound did not abate and on the third day afterwards he departed from among men; and this mishap shattered all the hopes of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, since he was rendered unfit for fighting in the engagement which followed, and himself injured their cause in no small degree. For while he went out of range of missiles and was caring for his wound, the two armies engaged with each other. <br />But when the engagement was hottest, the three hundred barbarians suddenly appeared advancing behind the Roman army; and when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> saw these men, supposing as they did that their assailants were a great multitude, they fell into a panic and straightway rushed off in flight, each man as best he could. And the barbarians kept up a slaughter of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> as they fled in complete disorder, and many of them they captured and held under guard, and they captured all the standards besides, a thing which had never before happened to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. As for the commanders, each one of them as he could fled with only a few men, and finding safety in whatever cities they happened to reach they continued to guard them.</p>                        </div>

And when they came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/438113UFlo class=place long=11.2569 lat=43.7687>Florentia</a>, they established themselves in camp about the wall and entered upon a siege. Thereupon Justinus, in great agitation because, as it happened, he had brought no provisions at all into the city, sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> to the commanders of the Roman army, begging them to come to his assistance with all speed. And the messenger slipped unobserved through the enemy's lines by night, and upon reaching <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> reported the situation which confronted the garrison. As a result of this intelligence a considerable Roman army immediately started on the way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/438113UFlo class=place long=11.2569 lat=43.7687>Florentia</a>, under command of <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a> and John the nephew of Vitalian. When the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> learned of this army through their scouts, they broke up the siege and withdrew to a place called Mucellis, one day's journey distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/438113UFlo class=place long=11.2569 lat=43.7687>Florentia</a>. And when the Roman army had joined forces with Justinus, the commanders left there a few of his men to guard the city, but took the rest along with them and proceeded against the enemy. <br />And as they proceeded on their way it was decided that the most advantageous plan was for one of the commanders to choose out the most famous fighters in the whole army and with them go in advance of the others, and make a sudden and unexpected attack upon the enemy, while the rest of the army should proceed without quickening its pace and come upon the scene later. So they cast lots with this plan in view and awaited the decision of fortune in the matter. Now the lot fell out for John, but the commanders were no longer willing to carry out the agreement. Thus it was that John was compelled with his own troops alone to go in advance of the others and make an attack upon the enemy. But the barbarians, learning that their opponents were advancing upon them and being greatly terrified, decided to abandon the plain where they had established their camp, and in confusion ran to the top of a high hill which rises near by. And when the force of John arrived there, they too ran up against the enemy and opened the attack. But since the barbarians defended themselves vigorously, a violent struggle took place and many men on both sides, while making a remarkable display of heroism, were beginning to fall. Now though John had led a charge with loud shouting and tumult against the enemy opposite him, it so happened that one of his bodyguards was hit by a javelin thrown by one of the enemy and fell , as a result of this the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, now repulsed, began to retire to the rear. <br />By this time the remainder of the Roman army also had reached the plain, where they formed a phalanx and stood waiting. And if they had stood fast to give support to John's troops, which were now in full flight, they could have advanced all together upon the enemy, and not only would they have defeated them in the battle, but they would have been able also to capture practically the whole force. But by some chance it so fell out that an untrue report was circulated through the Roman army to the effect that John had perished at the hand of one of his own bodyguards during the action then in progress. And when the report came to the commanders, they were no longer willing to hold their position, but they one and all began to retire in a disgraceful sort of retreat. <br />For neither did they keep their troops in order, nor did they move off in any kind of groups, but each man for himself, just as he could, rushed off in headlong flight. And many indeed perished in this flight, and as for the rest, all such as were saved continued their flight for many days although they were not pursued at all. And some time afterwards they entered such strongholds as each one happened upon, and the report they carried to those they chanced to meet was only this, that John was dead. And consequently they were no longer in contact with each other, nor had they any purpose of uniting thereafter against the enemy, but each remained inside the circuit-wall of his own fort and began to prepare for a siege, fearing that the barbarians would come against him. <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, meanwhile, was shewing great kindness to his prisoners, and thereby succeeded in winning their allegiance, and henceforth the most of them voluntarily served under him against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>.

After this he decided to besiege <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>, because the inhabitants, in spite of his many winning words, were quite unwilling to receive him into the city. For <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a> was keeping guard there with a force of a thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a>. And <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> himself with the greater part of the army made camp not far from the fortifications and remained quiet, but he sent off a part of the army and captured the fortress of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=place long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a> and certain other strongholds, from which he succeeded in gathering in great sums of money. And finding the wives of the senators there, he not only refrained from offering them any insult, but actually shewed such kindness as to let them go free, and by this act he won a great name for wisdom and humanity among all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. <br />And since no hostile force was operating against him, he was constantly sending small detachments of the army round about and accomplishing results of great importance. In this way he brought the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392165RBre class=ethnic long=16.5 lat=39.2>Bruttii</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=ethnic long=16 lat=40.4>Lucani</a> under his sway, and gained <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=place long=16.3 lat=41>Apulia</a> as well as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=place long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabria</a>. And he himself collected the public taxes and also received the revenues from the land instead of those who owned the estates, and in all other matters he conducted himself as having become master of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, In consequence of this the Roman soldiers naturally did not receive their customary payments at the times appointed, and the emperor owed them great sums of money. Because of this situation the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>, on the one hand, having been evicted from their property and finding themselves for the second time in very grave peril, were beginning to feel greatly dejected, while the soldiers, on the other hand, were shewing themselves increasingly insubordinate to their commanders, and were glad to remain inside the cities. So <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantianus</a> was holding <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, John <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a>, Justinus <a about=https://topostext.org/place/438113UFlo class=place long=11.2569 lat=43.7687>Florentia</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a>; and each one of the others was holding whatever town had originally provided him shelter and safety in his flight. <br />Upon hearing of these things, the emperor, in sore distress, made all haste to appoint <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> pretorian prefect of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, commissioning him to exercise authority over the commanders for the purpose of carrying on the war, and to furnish the soldiers with provisions according to their needs. And he sent a fleet of ships with him, manning them with Thracian and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> soldiers. The leader of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> was <a href=/people/3610 target=_blank>Herodian</a>, and of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a> Phazas the Iberian, nephew of Peranius; * and a few <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> also sailed with them. So <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> sailed forth from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> with the whole fleet and reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> in Greece, where for no good reason he proceeded to settle down and waste precious time. For he was utterly inexperienced in warlike deeds, and was consequently both timid and exceedingly prone to delay. Later on the emperor sent <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> also as general, a man who had previously served under <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> as commander of a detachment of infantry. <br />So <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> sailed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, and, upon learning that <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a> and the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> were exceedingly hard pressed by the siege, being altogether out of provisions, he wished indeed to go to their assistance with all speed, but was unable to do so because the force which followed him was so small as to be of little consequence, and so devised the following plan. Gathering as many ships as possible from all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and filling them with grain and other provisions, he set sail, making it appear to his opponents that some enormous army was aboard the ships. And he judged the mind of the enemy correctly; for they thought that a great army was coming upon them, reaching this conclusion just because they had learned that a huge fleet was sailing from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. And if <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> had been willing at the very first to steer straight for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>, I believe that he would have both struck terror into the enemy and saved the city, without a man opposing him. <br />But as it was, he felt that the danger involved was too great, and so did not put in to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> at all, but sailing to the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> began hastily to gather soldiers from there. But the soldiers at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, having been defeated by the barbarians and still regarding them with great awe, were by no means willing to follow <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> against <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. Thus it came about that he was compelled to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> with only the troops who had come with him from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. <br />Now there was another <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, a Cephalenian by birth, who had previously been a sailor and was thoroughly skilled in all matters pertaining to the sea and its dangers, and having sailed with <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> and to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, he had become noted for this skill of his; and for this reason the emperor had appointed him governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>. And when the barbarians began to besiege the town, he was so carried away by a spirit of utter wantonness that he commenced to heap insults upon <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, and continued often to do so, and the man was observed to have an exceedingly reckless tongue during this time of stress. <br />As the situation became worse and the loss of life among the besieged was becoming serious, this man, acting on the advice of <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a>, had the daring to embark secretly on a skiff and go alone to the general <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>. And having, to everybody's surprise, made the voyage in safety and coming before <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, he endeavoured with all his power to stir him to boldness, and urged him on to undertake the task before him. But <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> had heard the whole truth about this fleet and was holding many ships of the swiftest sort in readiness; and when the enemy put in at that part of the coast, not far from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>, he came upon them unexpectedly, and filling them with consternation turned the whole force to flight. And although he killed many of them, he captured a very large number, and there escaped only as many as succeeded at the first in leaping into the small boats of the ships, among whom was <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> the general. For the barbarians captured all the ships with their cargoes, crews and all, among whom they found <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, the governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>. And cutting off his tongue and both his hands, they did not indeed kill him, but released him thus mutilated to go where he would. This then was the penalty which <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> paid to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> for an unbridled tongue.</p>                        </div>

Now when the commanders of the Roman army learned of his coming, they all sent to him with great eagerness, begging him to come to the rescue with all speed; and <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a> sent a particularly urgent message from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>, where he was most vigorously besieged by the barbarians; for by this time all their provisions had been exhausted. But <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>, after delaying through the whole critical period in such a state of terror, was finally moved by his fear of the emperor's threats and gave way before the abuse of the other commanders; so, while he himself still remained just where he was, he sent the whole army to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> with <a href=/people/3610 target=_blank>Herodian</a>, <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> and Phazas, the winter season being already very close upon them. <br />But when the Roman fleet had reached a point close to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>, a violent wind came down upon them, raising an extraordinarily severe tempest. <br />And the darkness covered everything, while the surging waters prevented the sailors from pulling their oars or handling the ships in any other way. <br />And because of the roar of foaming waves they were no longer able to hear one another, but complete confusion prevailed and they were at the mercy of the wind's violence, which carried them, little as they wished it, to the very shore where the enemy were encamped. The barbarians, therefore, boarding the craft of their opponents at their leisure, began to kill the men and sink the ships without meeting any opposition. And they also captured along with many others the general <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>. But <a href=/people/3610 target=_blank>Herodian</a> and Phazas with some few men succeeded in making their escape, because their ships did not come very close to the enemy's camp. Such was the fate of the Roman fleet. <br />And <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> fastened a cord about <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>' neck and so dragged him up to the wall of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>, where he ordered him to advise the besieged no longer to ruin themselves by trusting in hopes of no avail, but to hand the city over as quickly as possible to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and thus rid themselves of bitter hardships; for the emperor, he said, was unable thereafter to send them further aid, but in this fleet both their strength and their hope had utterly perished. So <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> spoke the words which <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> commanded. <br />And the besieged, being now exceedingly hard pressed by famine and utter destitution, upon seeing the fate of <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> and hearing all his words, began to despair of every hope, and gave way to sorrowing and helplessness, and the city was filled with loud tumult and lamentation. <br />Afterwards <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> himself called them up to the battlement, and addressed them as follows: Men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>, it is not because we have any charge or reproach to bring against you, that we have undertaken this present siege, but in order that we may be able, by freeing you from most hated masters, to repay you for the service you have rendered us during this war — a service which has induced the enemy to treat you with the utmost severity. For it has come about that you alone among all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a> have manifested the greatest loyalty to the Gothic nation and have fallen most unwillingly under the power of our opponents. So that, in the present circumstances, when we have been compelled to besiege you along with them, we naturally have a feeling of reluctance on account of your loyalty to us, although we are not carrying on the siege in order to harm the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=ethnic long=14.24 lat=40.843>Neapolitans</a>. Do not, therefore, in vexation at the miseries arising from the siege, think that you ought to regard the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> with anger. For those who are striving to benefit their friends merit from them no blame, even though they be compelled to use unpleasant means in accomplishing the service they afford them. And as for the enemy, let not the least fear of them enter your hearts, and be not led by past events to think that they will gain the victory over us. For the unreasonable events of life, which are due to chance and contrary to expectation, are apt as time goes on to come to naught again. And such is the good-will which we feel toward you that Ave make the concession that both <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a> and all his soldiers may go free from harm wherever they may wish, on the one condition that they yield the city to us and depart hence, taking with them all their own possessions; and nothing shall prevent our taking an oath to secure these promises and to guarantee the safety of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=ethnic long=14.24 lat=40.843>Neapolitans</a>. Thus spoke <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>; and both the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=ethnic long=14.24 lat=40.843>Neapolitans</a> and all the soldiers under command of <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a> expressed approval; for the keen necessity of famine was pressing them hard. However, by way of guarding their allegiance to the emperor, and still expecting, as they did, that some assistance would come to them, they agreed to give up the city after thirty days. But <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, wishing to dispel from their minds every hope of assistance from the emperor, appointed three months' time, with the stipulation that after this time they should do as had been agreed. He declared, further, that until the time was accomplished he would make no assault on the wall, nor employ any stratagem of any kind. The agreement was accordingly approved in this sense. But the besieged, without awaiting the appointed day (for they were utterly overcome by the lack of necessities), a little later received <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the barbarians into the city. And the winter drew to its close, and the eighth year ended in this war, the history of [543 a.d.] which <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> has written.</p>                        </div>

For finding sickness prevalent among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> owing to famine — and indeed their bodily strength had already been reduced by it — he feared lest, if they suddenly sated themselves with food, they would in all probability choke to death, and so he devised the following plan. Stationing guards both at the harbour and at the gates, he gave orders that no one should go away from the city. Then he himself, with a sort of provident parsimony, proceeded to issue food more sparingly than they desired it, adding each day only so much to the quantity that the increase from day to day seemed not to be noticed at all. And only after having thus built up their strength did he open the gates and allow each man to go wherever he wished. <br />As for <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a> and the soldiers under his command, as many as were by no means satisfied to remain there he embarked on ships and bade them sail wherever they chose. And thinking that the return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> would bring disgrace upon them, they were purposing to sail with all speed for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. But since the wind stood against them and they were consequently quite unable to put out from the harbour, they were in great perplexity, fearing lest <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, seeing he had been victorious, should decide to disregard his agreement in some measure, and they should suffer some great harm at his hand. <br />When <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> perceived this, he called them all together and reassured them and gave still further confirmation of the pledges he had given, bidding them take courage immediately, mingle with the Gothic army with no fear, and buy from them their provisions and procure whatever else they lacked as from friends. But later, since the wind was still blowing against them and much time had been wasted, he provided them with both <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and pack animals, presented them with travelling-money, and bade them make the journey to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> by land, sending with them some of the Gothic notables as an escort. <br />And he set about razing the wall of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> to the ground, so that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> might not take possession of it again and, by using it as a strong base, make trouble for the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. For he preferred to reach an outright decision by a battle with them on a plain rather than to carry on a long contest by means of sundry devices of craft and cunning. But after tearing down a large part of it he left the rest. <br />While <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> was thus engaged, a certain Roman came before him — a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=demonym long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabrian</a> by birth— and made the charge that one of <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>'s bodyguards had violated his daughter, who was a maiden, utterly against her will. Whereupon, seeing that the man did not deny the charge, <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> made haste to punish him for the offence and confined him in prison. But the most notable men among the barbarians began to feel alarm for him (for he was, as it happened, an active fellow and a good warrior), and so they straightway gathered together and went before <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> with the request that he dismiss the charge against the man. <br />But he, gently and with no excitement, after hearing their statement, spoke as follows: Fellow soldiers, the reason for my speaking as I now do is not that I am yielding to a harsh inhumanity, or taking especial delight in the misfortunes of my kinsmen, but it is that I feel the greatest possible apprehension lest some mischance befall the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. <br />Now I, for my part, know this, that the great majority of mankind twist and turn the names of things until they reverse their meaning. For, on the one hand, they are accustomed to call kindness that which is really lawlessness, the outcome of which is that everything respectable is brought to utter confusion; and, on the other hand, they call any man perverse and exceedingly difficult who wishes to preserve the lawful order with exactness — to the end, plainly, that by using these names as screens tor their wanton deeds they may be able more fearlessly to do wrong and display their baseness. But I urge you not to sacrifice your own security for the sinful act of a single man, nor to assume any share yourselves in this foul sin, seeing that you have done no wrong. For the act of committing a sin and that of preventing the punishment of those who have committed sin are, in my judgment, on the same plane. I wish, accordingly, that you make your decision concerning the matter in hand taking this point of view — that two alternatives are now presented to your choice, either that this man should not pay the penalty for the wrong he has done or that the Gothic nation should be saved and achieve victory in the war. For I would have you consider this: we had, at the beginning of this war, a vast army unsurpassed both in renown and in actual experience of war; our wealth, to put all in a word, was too great to be reckoned; we possessed an extraordinary abundance of both <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and weapons; and, lastly, we held all the fortresses that there are in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. And truly these things are regarded as not entirely useless equipment when men are entering into a war. But while we were arrayed under <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a>, a man who made less of justice than of his desire to become wealthy, the lawlessness of our daily conduct caused God to be in no wise propitious to us, and to what our fortune has come as a result of this you are, of course, well aware, as you know what kind of men and how few of them have defeated us. But now that God has inflicted upon us sufficient punishment for the sins we committed, he is once more ordering our lives in accordance with our desire, and, to speak comprehensively, he is guiding our affairs in a better way than we could have hoped for, inasmuch as we have had the fortune to be victorious over our enemies beyond the measure of our actual strength. To preserve, therefore, the justification of our victory by acting righteously will be more to our interest than, by reversing our course, to let it seem that we have become envious of our own selves. For it is not possible, no, not possible, for a man who commits injustice and does deeds of violence to win glory in battle, but the fortune of war is decreed according to the life of the individual man. Thus then spoke <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>. <br />And the notables of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, approving his words, no longer begged for the bodyguard's release, but consented that he be treated in whatever manner <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> might deem best. And he executed the man not long afterwards, and gave to the injured girl all the money that belonged to him.</p>                        </div>

As for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>, the result of the situation for them was that they all suffered most severely at the hands of both armies. For while, on the one hand, they were deprived of their lands by the enemy, the emperor's army, on the other hand, took all their household goods. And they were forced besides to suffer cruel torture and death for no good cause, being hard pressed as they were by the scarcity of food. For the soldiers, though utterly unable to defend them when maltreated by the enemy, not only refused to feel the least blush of shame at existing conditions, but actually made the people long for the barbarians by reason of the wrongs they committed. And <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantianus</a>, being at a loss because of this situation, sent a letter to the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, setting forth plainly that he was unable to hold out in the war against the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. <br />And the other commanders, as if giving their vote in support of this view, indicated in this same letter their reluctance to carry on the struggle. Such then were the fortunes of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>. <br />Meantime <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> sent a letter to the Roman senate written in the following terms.  Such men as wrong their neighbours, being either the victims of ignorance or blinded by some forgetfulness that has come upon them, may fairly be forgiven by the victims of their ill-treatment. For their ignorance or forgetfulness, which led to their wrongdoing, also excuses it for the most part. If, however, any man does wrong as a result of deliberate intent solely, such a man will have nothing left with which even J? to defend his conduct. For it is not the deed alone, but also the intention, for which this man himself must, in justice, bear the responsibility. Therefore, since this is so, consider forthwith what defence you will possibly be able to make for your actions toward the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. Has it really come to pass that you are ignorant of the good deeds of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> and <a href=/people/12065 target=_blank>Amalasuntha</a>, or have they been blotted from your minds with the lapse of time and forgetfulness? <br />No, indeed; neither one of these is true. For it was not in some small matter, nor toward your ancestors in olden times that their kindness was displayed, but it was in matter of vital importance, dear <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, towards your very selves, recently and in days that are close at hand. But was it because you had been informed by hearsay or learned by experience the righteousness of the Greeks toward their subjects that you decided to abandon to them as you did the cause of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a> ? At any rate, you, for your part, have, I think, entertained them royally, but you know full well what sort of guests and friends you have found them, if you have any recollection of the public accounts of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. <br />For I need make no mention of the soldiers and the commanders by whose friendliness and magnanimity you have profited; and it is precisely this conduct of these men which has brought their fortunes to such a pass. Now let no one of you think that I am moved by youthful ambition to bring these reproaches against them nor that I am inclined to boastful speech merely because I am a ruler of barbarians. <br />For the overmastery of those men, I say, has not been a work of our valour, but I confidently maintain that a sort of vengeance has overtaken them for the wrongs you have suffered at their hands. How then could it fail to appear a most atrocious act on your part, that you, while God is exacting vengeance from them in your behalf, should cling fondly to that atrocity of theirs and be unwilling to be rid of the ills arising therefrom? Give yourselves, therefore, some ground for the defence you must make to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, and give us, on the other hand, some ground for forgiveness toward you. And you will give this if, without proposing to await the conclusion of the war, now that there is only scant hope left you, and that too of no avail, you chose the better course and set right the wrongs which you have committed against us. Such then was the message which the writing set forth; and now <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, placing it in the hands of some of the captives, commanded them to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and give it to the senators. And they did this. But John prevented those who saw this letter from making any reply to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>. For this reason <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> made a second attempt, writing a large number of short letters, in which he gave expression to the most solemn oaths, swearing in explicit terms that never would the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> do any harm to anyone of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. Now as to what persons conveyed these writings to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, I cannot speak; for all of them were posted late at night in the conspicuous places in the city, and only when it came day were they discovered; but the commanders of the Roman army entertained grave suspicions against the priests of the Arians, and consequently removed these all from the city immediately. <br /><a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, upon hearing this, sent a certain portion of his army into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=place long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabria</a>, bidding them make trial of the fortress at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a>. But since the troops keeping guard in this fortress absolutely refused to yield to him, he commanded the force which had been sent there to institute a siege, while he, with the greater part of the army, went to the vicinity of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. <br />When the emperor heard this, he was greatly embarrassed, and, in spite of the fact that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> were still pressing him very hard, was compelled to send <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> against <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>. And the winter drew to a close, and the ninth year ended in this war, the [544 A.D.] history of which <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> has written.</p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> loaded ships with provisions for a year's time and commanded <a href=/people/3712 target=_blank>Valentinus</a> to sail with them to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a>, and to remove the former garrison from the fortress as quickly as possible — for he learned that they had been much weakened by disease and famine — and to establish as a garrison in place of them some of the men sailing with him; for by this arrangement it would be comparatively easy for them, being fresh and not in want of any necessaries, to guard the fortress in security. So <a href=/people/3712 target=_blank>Valentinus</a>, chancing to find a favourable wind, sailed with this fleet to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a>, and arrived four days before the time appointed for the surrender; and finding the harbour unguarded, he took possession of it, and succeeded without trouble in entering the fortress. For the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, being confident in the agreement they had made, and supposing that they would encounter no obstacle in the interval, were now giving little heed to their operations against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a> and were remaining quiet. <br />Then, however, upon seeing the fleet suddenly bearing down upon them, they took fright and abandoned the siege, and going to a great distance from the place, they made camp and reported to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> all that had befallen them. So close was the peril from which the fortress of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a> escaped. But some of <a href=/people/3712 target=_blank>Valentinus</a>' men, wishing to plunder the adjoining country, began to make excursions; and by some chance they encountered the enemy near the shore of the sea, and engaged with them. And being badly defeated in the battle, the most of them fled into the sea-water; in this way they lost one hundred and seventy men, and the rest withdrew to the fortress. <br /><a href=/people/3712 target=_blank>Valentinus</a>, upon finding the previous garrison half dead, removed them from the fortress, and substituted other fresh men, just as <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had instructed him to do, and leaving them supplies for a year's time, returned with the rest of the army to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435165USal class=place long=16.4834 lat=43.5397>Salones</a>. <br />Then <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, setting sail from there with the whole fleet, put in at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/449138UPol class=place long=13.8468 lat=44.8701>Pola</a>, where he remained for a short time, putting the army in order. But <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, hearing that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/449138UPol class=place long=13.8468 lat=44.8701>Pola</a>, and wishing to discover the strength of the army which he was bringing, took the following measures. There was a certain Bonus, nephew of John, commanding the garrison in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/44489UGen class=place long=8.9315 lat=44.4076>Genoa</a>. He accordingly made use of this man's name and wrote a letter to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> purporting to be from this Bonus, and urging him to come with all possible speed to their assistance, as they were in some extreme peril. Then he chose out five men of an especially inquisitive nature, put the letter into their hands, and instructed them to observe accurately the force of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, while palming themselves off as having been sent from Bonus. So when the men came before <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, he received them with great friendliness, as was his custom. And after reading the letter, he bade them report back to Bonus that he would come with the whole army after no long time. Then, after they had looked over everything exactly as <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> had directed them to do, they returned to the Gothic camp and declared that the force of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was by no means considerable. <br />Meanwhile <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> captured the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a>, which contained a guard of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a>, through an act of treason; this happened in the following manner. Some of the inhabitants of the place were guarding the gates together with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a>. These men, having quarrelled with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> who kept guard with them, although the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> had given no cause for offence, now invited the enemy, who were encamped close by, to come in by night. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a>, on their part, adopted a common plan while the city was being captured, and practically all of them succeeded in making their escape. <br />Among the inhabitants, however, not a man was spared by the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, but they were all killed, together with the priest of the city, in a manner which I shall by no means mention, although I know it well, in order that I may not leave records of inhuman cruelty to future times. Among these victims Catellus also perished, a man of note among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>. So the barbarians took possession of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, in consequence, were no longer able to bring in their provisions from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscia</a> by way of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>. For the city, situated as it is fronting the river about a hundred and twenty stades above <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, became thereafter an outpost against those wishing to sail into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> by that route.</p>                        </div>

As for <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, he arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> with the whole fleet; there he gathered those of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> who were in the city and the Roman soldiers, and spoke as follows: This is not the first occasion on which it has come to pass that the achievements of virtue have been brought to naught by wickedness. For from of old this is wholly natural in human affairs, and many a time the depravity of persons of the basest sort has been quite sufficient to frustrate and destroy the deeds of good men. And now, too, this very thing has ruined the cause of the emperor, And he, for his part, is so deeply concerned to correct the mistakes which have been made that he has considered the task of defeating the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> as of less moment than this situation, and so has decided at the present time to dispatch me to you, in order that I may be able to set right and remedy whatever has been wrongly done by the commanders in their treatment of his soldiers or of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. Now it is not human that no mistakes at all should be committed by anyone, nor is it possible in the natural progress of events; but the task of setting right the mistakes which have been made is one eminently befitting an emperor, and also one which can well afford consolation to his beloved subjects. For not only will you find riddance from your distress, but you will also straightway be privileged to understand and enjoy the emperor's goodwill toward you. And of all things in the world what could be a greater boon for a man than this ? Seeing then that I am here with you for this very purpose, it is incumbent upon each one ol you, in your tarn, to exert himself to the utmost that you may profit by the service thus offered. If any one of you, then, chances to have relatives or friends with the usurper <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, let him summon these as quickly as possible, explaining the emperor's purpose; for by such a course you could achieve both the blessings which flow from peace and those which fall from the hand of the mighty emperor For f, for my part, have neither come here with a lust for war against anyone, nor should I ever, willingly at least, be an enemy of the subjects of the emperor. <br />If, however, they consider it even now too trivial a thing to choose the course which is better for themselves, and if they take their stand against us, it will be necessary for us likewise, even though it be sorely against our will, to treat them as enemies. So spoke <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. But not one of the enemy came over to him, either <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goth</a> or Roman. Next he sent his bodyguard Thurimuth and some of his own troops with Vitalius and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=demonym long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrian</a> soldiers into <a href=/people/2704 target=_blank>Aemilia</a>, commanding them to make trial of the towns there. So Vitalius with this force took up a position near the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445113UBon class=place long=11.3418 lat=44.4946>Bononia</a>, and, after taking some of the neighbouring fortresses by surrender, remained inactive in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445113UBon class=place long=11.3418 lat=44.4946>Bononia</a>. But not long after this the whole body of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a> who were serving under him, suddenly and without having either experienced any hard treatment or heard any rebuke, withdrew secretly from the town by night and betook themselves homeward. And sending envoys to the emperor, they begged him to grant them pardon, seeing that they had come to their homes in this manner for no other reason than that, after their long service in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> without receiving the regular pay at all, the state now owed them a large sum of money. But it so happened that a Hunnic army had fallen upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a> and enslaved the women and children, and it was because of this intelligence, and also because they had a scarcity of provisions in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, that they withdrew. And though the emperor was at first angry with them, he afterwards forgave them. <br />Now <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, upon learning of the withdrawal of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a>, sent an army against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445113UBon class=place long=11.3418 lat=44.4946>Bononia</a> in order to capture Vitalius and the troops with him by a swift attack. But Vitalius and Thurimuth laid ambuscades in several places and thus destroyed many of the attacking force and turned the rest to flight. There Nazares, a man of note and an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=demonym long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrian</a> by birth, commander of the troops in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, surpassed all others by the remarkable exhibition he made of warlike deeds against the enemy. Thereupon Thurimuth came to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>. <br />Then at length <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> sent three of his own bodyguards, Thurimuth, Ricilas and <a href=/people/3686 target=_blank>Sabinianus</a>, with a thousand soldiers to the city of Auximus, in order to support <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> besieged there. <br />This force, slipping past <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the enemy's camp by night, got inside of Auximus, and then began planning to make sallies against their opponents. So on the following day about noon, upon learning that some of the enemy were near at hand, they sallied forth with the purpose of confronting them; but, before proceeding, they decided to send scouts against them to spy out the enemy's strength so as not to make an attack on them without reconnoitring. <br />But Ricilas, the guardsman of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, who chanced to be drunk at the time, would not allow any others to go scouting, but he himself rode out alone on horseback and went on at full speed. And happening upon three <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> on a steep slope, he at first took his stand with the intention of opposing them; for he was a man of extraordinary bravery; but upon seeing many men rushing toward him from all sides, he made haste to flee. But his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> stumbled in a rough place, whereupon a great shout arose from the enemy and they all hurled their javelins at him. Then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> hearing this uproar, came to the rescue on the run. And Ricilas was killed, being buried under a great number of spears, but the troops of Thurimuth routed their opponents, and lifting up the body carried it inside the city of Auximus; thus did Ricilas meet his death in a manner unworthy of his valour. <br />Thereupon <a href=/people/3686 target=_blank>Sabinianus</a> and Thurimuth in conference with <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a> found it inadvisable for them to spend any more time there, reasoning that while clearly, owing to his numbers, they would never be a match for the enemy in battle, they would, on the other hand, by using up the supplies of the besieged, doom the city to still earlier capture by their opponents. And when this had been decided upon, they themselves and their thousand men began to prepare for their departure, intending to make the beginning of their journey at night; but one of the soldiers forthwith deserted secretly to the enemy's camp and made known the plans of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> accordingly picked out two thousand men distinguished for their valour and, as night came on, set guards upon the roads at a distance of thirty stades from Auximus, keeping his movements entirely secret. So when these guards at about midnight saw the enemy passing by, they drew their swords and began their attack. And they killed two hundred of them, but <a href=/people/3686 target=_blank>Sabinianus</a> and Thurimuth, together with the rest, thanks to the darkness, succeeded in escaping and fleeing into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a>. However, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> captured all the pack animals which were carrying the servants, the weapons, and the clothing of the soldiers. <br />There are two fortresses on the coast of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a>, Pisaurus and Fanus, situated between the cities of Auximus and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a>. They had been dismantled at the beginning of this war by <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a>, who had burned the houses in them and torn down their walls to about half their height, in order that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> might not, by seizing them, make trouble for the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. One of these fortresses, Pisaurus, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> decided to seize; for it seemed to him that the place was by its situation suitable for the pasturage of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. So he sent by night some of his associates and secretly obtained the accurate measurements, as to breadth and height, of each one of the gate-ways. He next had gates made and bound with iron and then loaded them on boats and sent them off, commanding the men of <a href=/people/3686 target=_blank>Sabinianus</a> and Thurimuth to fit these gates quickly to the walls and then to remain inside the circuitwall, and, after thus insuring their safety, to build up in whatever manner possible such parts of the circuit-wall as had fallen down, putting in stones and mud and any other material whatsoever. So they carried out these instructions. But <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, upon hearing what was going on, marched against them with a great army. And he made an attempt on the town and tarried near it for some time, but since he was unable to capture it, he returned baffled to his camp at Auximus. <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, however, were no longer making sallies against the enemy, but at each fortress they were remaining inside the walls. Furthermore, even when <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> sent two of his guardsmen to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, Artasires, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, and Barbation of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=person long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, ill order to assist <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> in guarding the city, he instructed them by no means to make sallies against the enemy. As for <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the Gothic army, seeing that the force of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was not sufficient to array itself against them, they decided to harass the strongest of the towns. They accordingly made camp in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a> before <a about=https://topostext.org/place/432137UFir class=place long=13.7168 lat=43.1611>Firmum</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/429136UAsc class=place long=13.5687 lat=42.8537>Asculum</a>,- and commenced a siege. And the winter drew to a close, and the tenth year ended in this war, the 546 a.d. history of which <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> has written.</p>                        </div>

For even the few soldiers he had were unwilling to fight, asserting that the state owed them much money and that they themselves were in want of everything. And this was true. <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> also wrote a letter to the emperor recording these matters; and the letter set forth the following. <br /> We have arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, most mighty emperor, without men, <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, arms, or money, and no man, I think, without a plentiful supply of these things, would ever be able to carry on a war. For though we did travel about most diligently through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, the soldiers we gathered are an exceedingly small and pitiful band, men without a single weapon in their hands and altogether unpractised in fighting. And we see, on the other hand, that the men who were left in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> are both insufficient in number and in abject terror of the enemy, their spirit having been utterly humbled by the many defeats they have suffered at their hands, — men who did not simply escape at random from their opponents, but even abandoned their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and flung their weapons to the ground. And as for the revenue, it is impossible for us to derive any money from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, since it has again been taken by the enemy into their possession. Consequently, since we have fallen behind in regard to the payment of the soldiers, we find ourselves quite unable to impose our orders upon them; for the debt has taken away our right to command. And this also thou must know well, my master, that the majority of those serving in thy armies have deserted to the enemy. If, therefore, it was only necessary that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> be sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, then thou hast made the best preparation possible for the war; for I am already in the very midst of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. If, however, it is thy will to overcome thy foes in the war, provision must also be made for the other necessary things. <br />For no man could, I think, be a general without men to support him. It is therefore needful that, above all others, my spearmen and guards should be sent me, and, next to them, a very large force of <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> and other barbarians is needed, to whom money must also be given immediately. Such was the letter written by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. But as for John, though he spent a long time in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, he accomplished none of the objects of his mission; but he married the daughter of Germanus, the nephew of the emperor. In the meantime <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> captured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/432137UFir class=place long=13.7168 lat=43.1611>Firmum</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/429136UAsc class=place long=13.5687 lat=42.8537>Asculum</a> by surrender; and advancing into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscia</a>, he began the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430126UAsi class=place long=12.6144 lat=43.0714>Asise</a>. Now the garrison in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a> was commanded by <a href=/people/3610 target=_blank>Herodian</a> and that in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430126UAsi class=place long=12.6144 lat=43.0714>Asise</a> by Sisifridus, who, though a <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goth</a> by birth, was exceedingly loyal to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and the emperor's cause. <a href=/people/3610 target=_blank>Herodian</a>, for his part, came to terms with the enemy, the agreement being that they should remain quiet for thirty days; and if no assistance should come to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> within this time, he was to surrender both himself and the city together with the soldiers and the inhabitants to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. And he furnished his son as a hostage for the keeping of this agreement. So when the appointed day came, and no Roman army had arrived from any quarter, <a href=/people/3610 target=_blank>Herodian</a> and the whole garrison of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a>, in accordance with the agreement, put themselves and the city into the hands of <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. But they say that the hostility existing between <a href=/people/3610 target=_blank>Herodian</a> and <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was the real cause of his surrendering himself and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a> to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>; for <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had threatened to call him to account for his previous record. <br />Such was the course of events as regards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a>. Sisifridus, on the other hand, in making a sally with his troops, lost the most of his men and perished himself Thereupon the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430126UAsi class=place long=12.6144 lat=43.0714>Asise</a>, despairing of the situation, immediately handed the city over to the enemy. <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> also sent straightway to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a>, demanding that he surrender <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a> to him, attempting to terrify him in case he should disobey, but promising, on the other hand, to reward him with a large sum of money if he should carry out this order. But since he met with no success in dealing with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a>, he bribed one of his bodyguard, Ulifus by name, to kill him by treachery. Ulifus accordingly, meeting <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a> by chance alone, killed him and got away in flight to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>. But nevertheless the soldiers of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a> continued to guard the city for the emperor, and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> consequently, decided to retire from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a>.</p>                        </div>

He did no harm, however, to the farmers in this or any other part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, but commanded them to continue tilling the soil without fear, just as they were accustomed to do, bringing to him the revenue which they had formerly brought to the public treasury and to the owners of the land. And when some <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had come close up to the fortifications of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, Artasires and Barbation made a sally against them, though <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> did not in the least approve their action, leading out a large number of their men to the attack. <br />And they straightway killed many and turned the rest to flight. But in following up these men and allowing themselves to be drawn into a pursuit over a great distance, they fell into an ambush set by the enemy. Here they lost the most of their men, and they themselves, accompanied by a handful of men, succeeded only with difficulty in making their escape. And thereafter they no longer dared go out against their opponents, even though they were pressing their attack. <br />From this time on a severe famine afflicted the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, for they were no longer able to bring in any necessaries from the country and the traffic by sea was cut off. For after the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> captured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>, they had stationed a navy of many light craft both there and at the so-called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385150IAio class=demonym long=15.05 lat=38.5>Aeolian</a> Islands and at such other islands as lie off this coast, and with these they were keeping a close watch over the sea-route. Consequently such ships as put out from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and started to sail to the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> fell one and all into the hands of these patrols together with their crews. <br /><a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> now sent an army into <a href=/people/2704 target=_blank>Aemilia</a>, with orders to take the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450097UPla class=place long=9.6931 lat=45.0526>Placentia</a> either by storm or by surrender. This is the chief city in the land of <a href=/people/2704 target=_blank>Aemilia</a> and has strong defences, being situated on the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450120WEri class=place long=12.0293 lat=44.9753>Eridanus</a>, and it was the only city still left in that region subject to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. So when this army came near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450097UPla class=place long=9.6931 lat=45.0526>Placentia</a>, they offered terms to the garrison there to the end that they might hand over the city by surrender to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. But since they met with no success, they made camp on the spot and began a siege, perceiving that the people in the city were in need of provisions. <br />At that time there arose a suspicion of treason among the commanders of the emperor's army in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> against <a href=/people/965 target=_blank>Cethegus</a>, a patrician and leader of the Roman senate. For this reason he departed hastily for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421118UCCe class=place long=11.7921 lat=42.091>Centumcellae</a>.2 <br />But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> became alarmed both for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and for the whole Roman cause, since it was impossible to lend assistance from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> in any case, and especially with a small army; and so he decided to remove from there and take possession of the district about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, in order that by being near at hand he might be able to go to the rescue of those in difficulty there. Indeed he repented having ever come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> at all, a course which he had taken earlier through the persuasion of Vitalius and not to the advantage of the emperor's cause, since by shutting himself up in that place he had given the enemy a free hand to determine the course of the war as they wished. And to me it seemed either that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had chosen the worse course because it was fated at that time that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> should fare ill, or that he had indeed determined upon the better course, but God, having in mind to assist <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, had stood as an obstacle in his way, so that the best of the plans of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had turned out utterly contrary to his expectations. For those upon whom the wind of fortune blows from a fair quarter, even though they make the worst plans, will meet with no calamity, since <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a> reverses these plans and brings them to an entirely favourable issue; but a man, I believe, who is under the ban of fortune utterly lacks the ability to plan wisely, being bereft of understanding and insight into the truth by the fact that he is fated to suffer ill. And even if he ever does make some plan adapted to the needs of the situation, still fortune straightway breathes contrariwise upon him after he has made such a plan, and perverts his wise purpose so as to bring about the most dire results. However, whether this is so or otherwise, I am unable to say. <br /><a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> then appointed Justinus to command the garrison of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, and himself, with only a few men, journeyed thence through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a> and the neighbouring lands to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413194PEpi class=place long=19.4449 lat=41.3164>Epidamnus</a>,i where he remained quiet expecting an army from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. <br />And writing a letter to the emperor, he reported the present situation. The emperor, therefore, not long afterward, sent him John the nephew of Vitalian and <a href=/people/1400 target=_blank>Isaac</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=person long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a>, brother of Aratius and <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a>, together with an army of barbarian and Roman soldiers. These troops reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413194PEpi class=place long=19.4449 lat=41.3164>Epidamnus</a> and joined <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> there. <br />The emperor also sent <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a> the eunuch to the rulers of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>, in order to persuade the most of them to march to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. And many of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> followed him, commanded by Philemuth and certain others, and they came with him into the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>. For the intention was that, after passing the winter there, they should be despatched to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> at the opening of spring. And they were accompanied also by John whom they called the Glutton. 2 And it so fell out that during this journey they unexpectedly rendered a great service to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. For a great throng of the barbarians, <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a>, had, as it happened, recently crossed the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, plundered the adjoining country and enslaved a very great number of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. Now the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> suddenly came upon these barbarians and joined battle with them, and, although far outnumbered, they unexpectedly defeated them, and some they slew, and the captives they released one and all to go to their homes. At that time also <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a> found a certain man who was pretending to the name of Chilbudius, a man of note who had once been a general of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and he easily succeeded in unmasking the plot. Here I shall give the facts of this story.</p>                        </div>

This Chilbudius was appointed by the emperor, in the fourth year of his reign, to be General of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, [531 ad] and was assigned to guard the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, being ordered to keep watch so that the barbarians of that region could no longer cross the river, since the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> and Antae and <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a> had already made the crossing many times and done irreparable harm to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. And Chilbudius became such an object of terror to the barbarians that for the space of three vears, during which time he remained there holding this office, not only did no one succeed in crossing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> actually crossed over to the opposite side many times with Chilbudius and killed and enslaved the barbarians there. But three years later, when Chilbudius crossed the river, as was his custom, with a small force, the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a> came against him with their entire strength; and a fierce battle taking place, many of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> fell and among them the general Chilbudius. Thereafter the river became free for the barbarians to cross at all times just as they wished, and the possessions of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were rendered easily accessible; and the entire Roman empire found itself utterly incapable of matching the valour of one single man in the performance of this task. <br />But later on the Antae and <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a> became hostile to one another and engaged in a battle, in which it so fell out that the Antae were defeated by their opponents. Now in this battle one of the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a> took captive a certain young man of the enemy named Chilbudius, who was just wearing his first beard, and took him off to his home. This Chilbudius, as time went on, became devoted to his master to an extraordinary degree and proved himself a vigorous warrior in dealing with the enemy. <br />Indeed he exposed himself to danger many times to save his master, distinguishing himself by his deeds of valour, through which he succeeded in winning great renown. At about this time the Antae descended upon the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> and plundered and enslaved many of the Roman inhabitants; and they led these captives with them as they returned to their native abode. <br />Now chance brought one of these captives into the hands of a kind and gentle master. This man was a great rascal and one capable of circumventing and deceiving those who fell in his way. And since he was unable by any device to effect his return to the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, much as he wished it, he conceived the following plan. Coming before his master, he praised him for his kindness and declared that God on account of this would bestow upon him blessings in abundance, and that he for his part would shew himself by no means ungrateful to a most kindly master; but, if only he was willing to give ear to the excellent suggestion which he had to offer, he would shortly put him in possession of a great sum of money. For there Mas, he said, among the nation of the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a> one Chilbudius, the former general of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, in the condition of a slave, while all the barbarians were ignorant as to who in the world he was. If, therefore, he was willing to pay out the price set upon Chilbudius and convey the man to the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, it was not unlikely that he would acquire for himself from the emperor not only a fair reputation but also an enormous amount of money. By these words the Roman speedily persuaded his master, and he went with him into the midst of the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a>; for these barbarians were already on peaceful terms and were mingling with one another without fear. <br />Consequently they were able, by paying out a large sum of money to the master of Chilbudius, to purchase the man, and they departed with him immediately. And when they had come into their own country, the purchaser enquired of the man whether he was Chilbudius himself, the general of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. And he did not hesitate to state truly all the facts in order, saying that he too was by birth of the Antae, and that while fighting with his compatriots against the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a>, who were then at war with them, he had been captured by one of the enemy, but now, upon arriving in his native country, he too according to the law would be free from that time forth. <br />Thereupon the man who had paid out gold for him became speechless with vexation, seeing that he had failed of a hope of no moderate sort. But the Roman, wishing to reassure the man and to controvert the truth, so that no difficulty might arise to prevent his return to his home, still insisted that this man actually was that Chilbudius, but that he was afraid, clearly because he was in the midst of the barbarians, and so was quite unwilling to reveal the whole truth; if, however, he should get into the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, he would not only not conceal the truth, but in all probability would actually take pride in that very name. Now at first these things were done without the knowledge of the other barbarians. <br />But when the report was carried about and reached the entire nation, practically all the Antae assembled to discuss the situation, and they demanded that the matter be made a public one, thinking that great benefit would come to them from the fact that they had now become masters of the Roman general Chilbudius. For these nations, the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a> and the Antae, are not ruled by one man, but they have lived from of old under a democracy, and consequently everything which involves their welfare, whether for good or for ill, is referred to the people. It is also true that in all other matters, practically speaking, these two barbarian peoples have had from ancient times the same institutions and customs. For they believe that one god, the maker of the lightning, is alone lord of all things, and they sacrifice to him <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and all other victims; but as for fate, they neither know it nor do they in any wise admit that it has any power among men, but whenever death stands close before them, either stricken with sickness or beginning a war, they make a promise that, if they escape, they will straightway make a sacrifice to the god in return for their life; and if they escape, they sacrifice just what they have promised, and consider that their safety has been bought with this same sacrifice. They reverence, however, both rivers and nymphs and some other spirits, and they sacrifice to all these also, and they make their divinations in connection with these sacrifices. They live in pitiful hovels which they set up far apart from one another, but, as a general thing, every man is constantly changing his place of abode. When they enter battle, the majority of them go against their enemy on foot carrying little shields and javelins in their hands, but they never wear corselets. Indeed some of them do not wear even a shirt or a cloak, but gathering their trews up as far as to their private parts they enter into battle with their opponents. And both the two peoples have also the same language, an utterly barbarous tongue. Nay further, they do not differ at all from one another in appearance. For they are all exceptionally tall and stalwart men, while their bodies and hair are neither very fair or blonde, nor indeed do they incline entirely to the dark type, but they are all slightly ruddy in colour. And they live a hard life, giving no heed to bodily comforts, just as the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a> do, and, like them, they are continually and at all times covered with filth; however, they are in no respect base or evildoers, but they preserve the Hunnic character in all its simplicity. In fact, the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a> and Antae actually had a single name in the remote past; for they were both called Spori in olden times, because, I suppose, living apart one man from another, they inhabit their country in a sporadic fashion. And in consequence of this very fact they hold a great amount of land; for they alone inhabit the greatest part of the northern bank of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>. So much then may be said regarding these peoples. <br />So on the present occasion the Antae gathered together, as has been said, and tried to compel this man to agree with them in the assertion that he was Chilbudius, the Roman general himself. And they threatened, if he denied it, to punish him. But while this affair was progressing in the manner described, meantime the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> had sent some envoys to these very barbarians, through whom he expressed the desire that they should all settle in an ancient city, Turris by name, situated to the north of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>. This city had been built by the Roman emperor <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> in earlier times, but for a long time now it had remained unoccupied, after it had been plundered by the barbarians of that region. It was this city and the lands about it that the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> agreed to give them, asserting that it had belonged to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> originally; and he further agreed to give them all the assistance within his power while they were establishing themselves, and to pay them great sums of money, on condition that they should remain at peace with him thereafter and constantly block the way against the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a>, when these wished to overrun the Roman domain. <br />When the barbarians heard this, they expressed approval and promised to carry out all the conditions, provided that he restore Chilbudius to the office of General of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and assign him to assist them in the establishment of their city, stoutly maintaining, what they wished was so, that the man there among them was Chilbudius. Thereupon the man himself, being lifted up by these hopes, began now to claim and to assert, as well as the others, that he was Chilbudius the Roman general. <br />Indeed he was setting out for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> on this mission when <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a>, in the course of his journey, came upon him. And when he met the man and found him to be playing the part of an imposter, although he spoke in the Latin tongue and had already learned many of the personal peculiarities of Chilbudius and had been very successful in assuming them, he confined him in prison and compelled him to confess the whole truth, and thereafter brought him in his own train to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. But I shall return to the point from which I have strayed.</p>                        </div>

Consequently, <a href=/people/3712 target=_blank>Valentinus</a> and Phocas secretly sent a messenger into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> bearing the intelligence to <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> that they were at that moment about to make a sudden attack upon the stockade of their opponents; he should, therefore, on his part, select the most warlike of the soldiers in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and, whenever he observed their assault, rush to their assistance, so that each of the two forces might be able to inflict some great injury upon the barbarians. <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a>, however, was by no means taken with this plan, notwithstanding the fact that he had as many as three thousand soldiers under him. Thus it was that <a href=/people/3712 target=_blank>Valentinus</a> and Phocas with a force of five hundred descended unexpectedly upon the enemy's camp and killed a few men, and the tumult occasioned thereby soon reached the ears of the besieged. But seeing that no one came out from the city against the camp, they quickly retired to the harbour without suffering any loss. <br />So they sent to <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> a second time, and first charging him with having had a regrettable attack of timidity, they declared that they would soon make another assault upon the enemy and urged that he too should fall upon the barbarians with all his strength at the proper moment. <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a>, however, still refused to make a sally against his opponents and risk a battle. Still <a href=/people/3712 target=_blank>Valentinus</a> and Phocas were purposing to assail the enemy in larger force and had already made their preparations. But a certain soldier of <a href=/people/9574 target=_blank>Innocentius</a>' command went as a deserter to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and carried the news that on the following day there would be an attack upon them from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a>. So <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> decided to fill with ambuscades of soldiers all the places which were adapted for this purpose. On the following day, therefore, <a href=/people/3712 target=_blank>Valentinus</a> and Phocas fell into these ambuscades, and not only lost the most of their men, but were also killed themselves. And only a small handful made their escape with difficulty and betook themselves to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a>. <br />It was at this time that Vigilius, the chief priest of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, who was then sojourning in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, filled with grain as many ships as he could and sent them off, thinking that in some way or other those who were conveying the cargoes would be able to get into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. So these ships were sailing toward the Roman harbour, but the enemy spied them and got to the harbour a short time before the ships arrived; there they concealed themselves inside the walls, their purpose being that, as soon as the ships should come to the land there, they might capture them with no difficulty. And when all the men keeping guard in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a> observed this, they went up to the battlement, every man of them, and by waving their cloaks strove to signal the men on the ships not to come ahead, but to turn aside and go elsewhere — anywhere in fact, where chance might lead them But the men on the ships failed to comprehend what they were doing, supposing that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a> were rejoicing and inviting them to the harbour, and since they had a favouring wind they quickly got inside the harbour. Now there were many <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> on board the ships, and among them a certain bishop named <a href=/people/3712 target=_blank>Valentinus</a>. Then the barbarians arose from their hiding place and took possession of all the boats without encountering any resistance. And as for the bishop, they took him prisoner and led him before <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, but all the rest they killed, and drawing the boats up on shore with their cargoes still in them, they departed. <br />And <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> made such enquiries of this priest as he wished, and then accused him of not telling the truth in any respect and so cut off both his hands. <br />Such was the course of these events. And the winter drew to a close, and the eleventh year ended 546 a.d. in this war, the history of which <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> has written.</p>                        </div>

In fact they had actually tasted each other's flesh. And it was because of this situation that they came to terms with the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and surrendered both themselves and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450097UPla class=place long=9.6931 lat=45.0526>Placentia</a> to them. Such was the course of events here. <br />At <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> likewise, as it laboured under the siege of <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, all the necessaries of life had already failed. Now there was a certain man among the priests of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, Pelagius by name, holding the office of deacon; he had passed a considerable time in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and had there become especially intimate with the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, and it so happened that he had a short time previously arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> possessed of a great fortune. And during this siege he had bestowed a great part of his fortune upon those destitute of the necessaries of life; and thus, though he had been a notable person even before that time, among all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>, now quite naturally he won still greater renown for philanthropy. So the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, finding their situation desperate by reason of the famine, persuaded this Pelagius to go before <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and negotiate for them an armistice of only a few days, the understanding to be that, if within the time of that armistice no help should reach them from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, they would surrender both themselves and the city to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. Pelagius accordingly went on this mission to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>. And when he came, <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> greeted him with great respect and friendliness, and then spoke first as follows: <br />Among all barbarian peoples it is a well-nigh universal custom to reverence the office of ambassadors, and I for my part have always been eager to honour particularly those, such as yourself, who can lay claim to excellence. Now it is my opinion that the distinction between honour and insult to a man clothed with the office of ambassador is not made by a smiling countenance or bombastic utterances on the part of those who receive him, but either by simply speaking the truth or, on the other hand, by addressing him with insincere speeches. For signal honour, on the one hand, is conferred upon him who has not been dismissed until the truth has been disclosed to him with directness, but the greatest possible insult, on the other hand, has been heaped upon that ambassador who takes his departure after hearing only deceitful and insincere phrases. Now, therefore, O Pelagius, with the exception of three things you will never fail to receive from us whatever you may crave. These things, then, you had best avoid and pass by without mention, so that you may not, though having been yourself most to blame for failing to accomplish any of the objects of your coming, impute to us the blame for this failure. For the inevitable consequence of making a request inappropriate to the actual situation is generally failure to gain one's object. I warn you, then, that you are to make no plea in the interest of either anyone of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a>, or the fortifications of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, or the slaves who have put themselves under our protection. <br />For it is impossible either for the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> to shew any mercy to anyone of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a> or for this wall to remain standing or for the slaves who have been serving in our army to return to the service of their former masters. And in order to avoid the appearance of advancing these demands in a spirit of unreason, we shall clear ourselves of that suspicion by stating our grounds immediately. <br /> In the first place, then, that island from ancient times enjoyed an unrivalled degree of prosperity, as evidenced by its revenues and by the abundance of the crops produced therein, so that it not only provided enough for its inhabitants, but you <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> also were abundantly supplied by importing annually as tribute the produce of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> fields. <br />It was for this reason that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> begged <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> at the beginning of his reign that no numerous garrison of <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> should be placed there, so that no check might be put upon the freedom of the inhabitants or their general prosperity. <br />In such circumstances the enemy's army put in at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> with a force which was a match for us neither in numbers of men nor in any other respect whatever. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a>, upon seeing the fleet, did not report this to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, did not even shut themselves into their strongholds, did not consent to shew hostility to our adversaries in any other manner, but opening the gates of their cities with all zeal received the army of the enemy with open arms,2 just as I suppose the most untrustworthy slaves would do, who had for a long time been watching for the favourable moment to escape from the hand of their owners and find some new and unknown masters. Then by using that island as a base, the enemy, as if fighting from an advanced fortress, without difficulty possessed themselves of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and seized upon this city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, having brought with them from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> such a great quantity of grain that, though they were besieged for an entire year, it continued to suffice for the whole population of the city. Such is the case of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a>, whose misdeeds have been such that it will be utterly impossible for the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> to shew them forgiveness, seeing that the gravity of the accusations sweeps away all compassion for the guilty. <br /> In the second place, it was within these walls that our enemy shut himself and from which he was quite unwilling to come down into the plain and array himself against us, but by crafty wiles and baffling tricks, he ever flouted the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> from day to day, and thus became, quite undeservedly, master of our possessions. Consequently it is worth while for us to make provision that we shall not have this same experience a second time. For when men who have once met with a reverse through ignorance fall into the same evil plight again without providing against the calamity which has already become familiar to them by experience, men believe what has befallen them to be no adversity of fortune, but in all likelihood a proof of the folly of the victims of the disaster. And one might add that the destruction of the walls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> will benefit you al)ove all others. For you will not hereafter be shut in with others and excluded from all the necessaries of life while you suffer siege at the hands of the assailants of the city, but, on the contrary, the two armies will stake their chances in open battle against one another, while you, without perils on your part, will simply become the prize of the victors. In the third place, regarding the slaves who have put themselves under our protection, we shall say only this, that if, after they have taken their places in our ranks against our adversaries and have received from us the promise that we will never abandon them to their former masters, we should at the present juncture decide to put them into your hands, we shall have no right to be trusted by you either. <br />For it is impossible — impossible, I say — for the man who makes light of his covenant with the most unfortunate of men to give evidence of a spirit that can be relied on in dealing with anyone else, but he always carries along with him his untrustworthiness, just as he does any other characteristic that reveals his true nature in all his dealings with other men. Thus spoke <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>; and Pelagius replied as follows: <br />Though you began, excellent Sir, by saying that you have the very greatest admiration not only for me, but also for the ambassadorial title, you have in fact assigned us to the very lowest grade of dishonour. Indeed I for my part think that he who really insults one who is both friend and ambassador is not the man who may strike him on the head or otherwise maltreat him, but rather he who decides to allow his visitor to depart with his mission unaccomplished. For it is not with the purpose of achieving any honour at the hands of those who receive them that men are accustomed to submit to the labours of an embassy, but in order that they may return with some good accomplished to those who have sent them. Consequently, it will be more favourable to their purpose to have been treated with wanton contempt and still have accomplished some of the objects for which they came, than, after hearing more courteous words, to return disappointed in their hope. Turning now to the present situation, I know not what plea I ought to make concerning those things which you yourself have mentioned. <br />For why should one importune him who had refused an agreement before hearing the plea? This, however, I could not leave unsaid, that it is clear what measure of kindness you are purposing to display toward the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who have taken up arms against you, seeing that, with regard to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a>, you have determined to vent your enmity upon them without mercy, though they have in no way opposed you. But as for me, I shall give over my petition to you and refer my mission to God, who is accustomed to send retribution upon those who scorn the prayers of suppliants.</p>                        </div>

And when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> saw him returning unsuccessful, they fell into a state of helpless despair. For the famine, becoming still more acute, was working terrible havoc among them from day to day. The soldiers, however, had not yet exhausted their supplies, but they could still hold out. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> therefore gathered in a throng and came before <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> and <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a>, the commanders of the emperor's army; there with weeping and loud lamentation they spoke to them as follows: The fate. Generals, which we see to be upon us at the present time is such that, if we actually had the power to commit some unholy deed against you, such a crime would have brought upon us no reproach. For the overwhelming constraint of necessity furnishes of itself a sufficient defence. But now, seeing that our strength cannot suffice for our defence, we have resorted to words and have come before you to make our position clear and to lament over our misfortune; and do you hear us with forbearance, not being stirred up by the boldness of our words, but judging it with due regard to the acuteness of our suffering. For he who has been compelled to despair of safety can no longer control his actions — no, nor his words — so as to preserve decorum. As for us, Generals, do not consider us to be either <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> or fellow-countrymen of yours, or even to have assimilated our ways of government to yours, and do not suppose that in the beginning we received the emperor's army into the city willingly, but regard us as enemies from the first and as men who have taken up arms against you, and later, when defeated in battle, have become your captive slaves simply in accordance with the customs of war. And do you furnish sustenance to these your captives, if not in quantities sufficient for our needs, at least in such measure as to make life possible, that by your so doing we too may survive and render you such service in return as it is fitting that slaves should render their masters. But if you find this difficult or contrary to your wish, then at least _£onsent to release us from your hands, by which action you will gain this advantage that you will not be troubled by the burial of your slaves. And if even this favour is not left us, deign to put us to death and do not deprive us of an honourable end nor begrudge us death, which to us is the sweetest of all things, but by a single act free the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> from ten thousand troubles. When <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> and his officers heard this, they asserted, firstly, that to furnish them with provisions was impossible, secondly, that to put them to death would be unholy, and, thirdly, that even to release them was not without danger. But they insisted that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> with the army from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> would arrive right speedily, and after thus consoling them sent them away. <br />But the famine, becoming more severe as time went on, was greatly increasing its ravages, driving men to discover monstrous foods unknown to the natural desires of man. Now at first, since <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> and <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a>, who commanded the garrison in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, had, as it happened, stored away a vast supply of grain for their own use within the walls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, they as well as the soldiers were constantly taking from the portion assigned for their own needs and selling at a great price to such <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> as were rich; for the price of a bushel had reached seven gold pieces. Those however, whose domestic circumstances were such that they were unable to partake of food which was so much dearer, were able, by paying in cash one fourth of this price, to get their bushel measures filled with bran; this was their food and necessity made it most sweet and dainty to their taste. As for beef, whenever the bodyguards of <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> captured an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> in making a sally, they sold it for fifty gold pieces. And if any man had a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> or any other animal which had died, this Roman was counted among those exceedingly fortunate, seeing that he was able to live luxuriously upon the flesh of a dead animal. But all the rest of the numerous inhabitants were eating nettles only, such as grow in abundance about the walls and among the ruins in all parts of the city. And in order to prevent the pungent herb from stinging their lips and throat they boiled them thoroughly before eating. <br />So long, then, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had their gold currency, they bought their grain and bran in the manner described and went their way; but when their supply of this had at length failed, then they brought all their household goods to the forum and exchanged them for their daily sustenance. But when, finally, the soldiers of the emperor had no grain which they could possibly sell to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> (except, indeed, that <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> still had a little left), nor had the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> anything with which to buy, they all turned to the nettles. But this food was insufficient for them, for it was utterly impossible to satisfy themselves with it, and consequently their flesh withered away almost entirely, while their colour, gradually turning to a livid hue, gave them a most ghostly appearance. And it happened to many that, even as they walked along chewing the nettles with their teeth, death came suddenly upon them and they fell to the ground. And now they were even beginning to eat each other's dung. There were many too, who, because of the pressure of the famine, destroyed themselves with their own hands; for they could no longer find either <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> or <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mice</a> or any dead animal of any kind on which to feed. <br />Now there was a Roman in the city, the father of five children; and they gathered about him and, laying hold of his garment, kept demanding food. But he, without a word of lament and without letting it be seen that he was sorely troubled, but most steadfastly concealing all his suffering in his mind, bade the children follow him as if for the purpose of getting food. But when he came to the bridge over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, he tied his cloak over his face, thus concealing his eyes, and leaped from the bridge into the waters of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, the deed being witnessed both by his children and by all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who were there. <br />From that time on the imperial commanders, upon receiving further money, released such of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> as desired to depart from the city. And only a few were left in the city; for all the rest made their escape by flight in whatever manner proved possible for each one. But the most of these, since their strength had been utterly wasted away by the famine, perished as soon as they had begun their journey, whether by water or by land. Many too were caught on the road by the enemy and destroyed. To such a pass had come the fortune of the senate and people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>.</p>                        </div>

For he thought that, since the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were suffering most cruelly in the siege, even the smallest delay would, in all probability, bring disaster to their cause. And if they went by sea and met with a favouring wind, it would be possible to land at the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the fifth day, while an army marching by land from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a> could not reach <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> even within forty days. <br />So <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> gave these directions to John and set sail from there with his whole fleet; but a violent wind fell upon them, and they put in at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a>. <br />And when the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> who had been stationed there to besiege the fortress saw this fleet, they abandoned the siege and straightway betook themselves to the neighbourhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, a city two days' journey distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a>, situated on the coast of the gulf and without walls; for they supposed that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> would immediately pass through the strait at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a>; and they reported their situation to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>. He, for his part, put his own army in readiness to oppose <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and commanded the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=place long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabria</a> to keep the passes under guard as best they could. <br />But when <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, finding a favourable wind, sailed away from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a>, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=place long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabria</a> thought no more of him and began to conduct themselves carelessly, while <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> was content to remain quiet and to guard still more closely the approaches to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, so that it might be impossible to bring any kind of provisions into the city. And he devised the following structure on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>. <br />Observing a place where the river flows in a very narrow channel, about ninety stades distant from the city, he placed very long timbers, reaching from one bank to the other, so as to form a bridge at that point. Then he constructed two wooden towers, one on either bank, and placed in each one a garrison of warlike men, so that it might be no longer possible for boats of any kind whatever to make their way up from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a> and so enter the city. <br />Meanwhile <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, on his part, landed at the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, while John with his army was remaining where he was. Then John ferried his force over to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=place long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabria</a>, quite unobserved by the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, who, as stated above, were waiting in the neighbourhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>. And he captured two of the enemy who were going out as scouts, one of whom he killed immediately; but the other laid hold of his knees and begged to be made a prisoner.  For, he said, I shall not be useless to you and the Roman army. And when John asked him what advantage he could possibly confer upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and him if he was not destroyed, the man promised to enable him to fall upon the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> while they had not the least expectation of such a thing. Then John said that his prayer should not fail to be heard, but first he must shew him the pastures of their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. This too the barbarian agreed to do and so he went with him. And first, upon finding the enemy's <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> pasturing, all the men who happened to be on foot leaped upon their backs; and there was a large number of such men comprising some of the best troops. Next they advanced at full speed upon the camp of their opponents. And the barbarians, being unarmed and utterly unprepared, and terror-stricken by the suddenness of the attack, were most of them destroyed where they stood, utterly forgetful of their valour, and only a small number succeeded in escaping and made their way to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>. <br />Then John began to console and pacify all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=ethnic long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabrians</a>, endeavouring to win them to loyalty to the emperor and promising that they would receive many benefits both from the emperor and from the Roman army. Then, departing as quickly as he could from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, he captured a city, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412161UCan class=place long=16.0651 lat=41.2205>Canusium</a> by name, which is situated approximately at the centre of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=place long=16.3 lat=41>Apulia</a> and is distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> five days ' journey as one goes westward toward <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. Twenty-five stades away from this city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412161UCan class=place long=16.0651 lat=41.2205>Canusium</a> is <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413162UCan class=place long=16.1515 lat=41.2964>Cannae</a>, where they say the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in early times suffered their great disaster at the hand of <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>, the general of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a>. <br />In that city a certain Tullianus, son of Venantius, a Roman who possessed great power among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392165RBre class=ethnic long=16.5 lat=39.2>Bruttii</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=ethnic long=16 lat=40.4>Lucani</a>, came before John and made charges against the emperor's army for the treatment they had previously meted out to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>, but he agreed that, if the army thereafter should treat them with some degree of consideration, he would hand over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392165RBre class=place long=16.5 lat=39.2>Bruttium</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=place long=16 lat=40.4>Lucania</a> to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, to be again subject and tributary to the emperor no less truly than they had been before. For it was not, he said, by their own will that they had yielded to men who were both barbarians and Arians, but because they had been placed under most dire constraint by their opponents, and had also been treated with injustice by the emperor's soldiers. <br />And upon John's declaration that thereafter the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a> would receive every blessing from the army, Tullianus went with him. Consequently the soldiers no longer entertained any suspicion as regards the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>, but the most of the territory south of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a> had become friendly to them and subject to the emperor. <br />But when <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> heard this, he selected three hundred of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and sent them to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>. <br />These men he instructed that, whenever they saw the army of John marching thence toward <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, they should simply follow him without drawing attention to themselves; for he himself would attend to the rest. In consequence of this John became afraid that he would fall into some trap and be surrounded by the enemy, and so discontinued his movement to join <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, and instead marched into the territory of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392165RBre class=ethnic long=16.5 lat=39.2>Bruttii</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=ethnic long=16 lat=40.4>Lucani</a>. <br />Now there was a certain Rhecimundus among the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, a man of note whom <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> had appointed to keep guard over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392165RBre class=place long=16.5 lat=39.2>Bruttium</a>; he had under him some of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> as well as Roman soldiers and Moors who had deserted, and his instructions were to guard with these troops the Strait of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383157LSky class=place long=15.715 lat=38.255>Scylla</a> and the adjoining coast, so that no one might be able fearlessly to set sail from there for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> nor to land there from the island. This army was surprised by John, whose presence had not been reported to them; and he fell upon them at a point between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=place long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a> and Vevon, threw them into consternation by a sudden attack, utterly heedless as they were of their valour, and turned them immediately to flight. And they sought refuge by fleeing to the mountain which rises near by, a difficult one to climb and generally precipitous; but John pursued them and reached the steep slopes along with the enemy, and thus, before they had as yet secured their position on the rough mountain-side, he engaged with them and killed many of the Moors and Roman soldiers, though they offered a most vigorous resistance, and captured by surrender Rhecimundus and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> together with all who remained. <br />After accomplishing this feat, John still continued to remain where he was, while <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, constantly expecting John, remained inactive. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> kept reproaching him because he would not take the risk of meeting in battle the force on guard at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>, only three hundred in number, and endeavour to make his way through in spite of the fact that he had barbarians under his command who were men selected for their valour. But John abandoned that plan, and proceeded to a place in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=place long=16.3 lat=41>Apulia</a>, called Cervarium, where he remained in idleness.</p>                        </div>

And since he plainly had no force sufficient to pit against the enemy, so that he could fight a decisive battle with them in the plain, he first arranged the following plan. He chose two skiffs of very unusual breadth and, after fastening them together and lashing them very firmly to one another, constructed a wooden tower upon them, making it much higher than those made by the enemy at their bridge. For he had previously had them accurately measured by sending some of his men, who, as it was made to appear, were going over to the barbarians as deserters. <br />Next he built wooden walls upon two hundred swift-sailing boats and launched them in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, having caused openings to be made in all parts of the wooden walls, in order that his men might be able to shoot at the enemy through them. <br />Finally he loaded grain and many other kinds of provisions on these boats and manned them with his most warlike soldiers. He also stationed other troops, both infantry and cavalry, on either side of the river in certain strong positions near the mouth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, commanding them to remain at their posts and, if any of the enemy should threaten <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a>, to prevent them with all their strength. But he stationed <a href=/people/1400 target=_blank>Isaac</a> inside <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a>, and it was to him that he entrusted both the city and his wife and whatever else he happened to possess there. And he directed him in no circumstances to go away from the city, not even if he learned that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had perished at the hand of the enemy, but to maintain a close and constant guard, so that, if any reverse should befall the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, they might have a place where they could take refuge and save themselves. For they held no other stronghold at all in that region, but the whole country in every direction was hostile to them. <br />Then he himself embarked on one of the swift boats and led on the fleet, giving orders to tow the boats on which he had constructed the tower. Now he had placed on the top of the tower a little boat which he had caused to be filled with pitch, sulphur, resin, and all the other substances on which fire naturally feeds most fiercely. And on the other bank of the river — that on the right as one goes from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> — a force of infantry was also drawn up along the stream to support him. But he had sent word to <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> the day before commanding that on the following day he should make a sally with a strong force and throw the enemy's camp into confusion; and indeed this was the same command that he had already sent him many a time before. But neither on previous occasions nor during the present battle did <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> see fit to carry out his orders. For now he was the only one who still had any grain left, since of all the grain which the magistrates of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> had previously sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to suffice both for the soldiers and for the whole population, he had let an exceedingly small amount go to the populace, while he had taken for himself the largest part on the pretext of providing for the soldiers and had hidden it away; and since he was selling this reserve to the senators at high prices, he by no means wished the siege to be broken. <br />Meanwhile <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and the Roman fleet were making their way upstream in spite of the difficulty caused by the adverse current. The <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, however, offered no opposition, but remained quietly in their fortified camps. But immediately upon coming close to the bridge, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> encountered a hostile guard; this force had been stationed on either side of the river to protect an iron chain which <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> had put in place there not long before, the which chain reached from one bank of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> to the other, and its purpose was to make it difficult for the enemy to get even as far as the bridge. And they killed some of the guards with their missiles and turned the rest to flight, then lifted out the chain and went straight on toward the bridge. And as soon as they came up to it, they opened their attack, while the barbarians, shooting from the towers, were striving most vigorously to drive them back. By this time, too, the barbarians had started out from their fortified camps and were rushing to the bridge. <br />Just at that moment <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> brought the skiffs on which the tower had been built as close as possible to one of the towers of the enemy — the one which stood on the road to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a> at the very edge of the water — and gave orders to set fire to the little boat and throw it on top of the enemy's tower. <br />And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> carried out this order. Now when this little boat fell upon the tower, it very quickly set fire to it, and not only was the tower itself consumed, but also all the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> in it, to the number of about two hundred. And among those thus burned was Osdas, their commander, who was the most warlike of all the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. Whereupon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> took courage and began to discharge their missiles still faster than before against the barbarians who had come to the support of their comrades. As for the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, they were struck with consternation at the turn of events, and facing about rushed off in flight, each man as best he could. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> then began to destroy the bridge and were ready, after wrecking it in a twinkling, to go ahead and proceed into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> with no further opposition. But, since this was not the will of fortune, some envious spirit interposed and contrived to ruin the cause of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in the following manner. <br />While the two armies were engaged in the operations just described, meantime a report fraught with ill for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a> and the tidings spread that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was victorious and had taken up the chain after destroying the barbarians at that point, and all the rest which I have told above. <br />Now when <a href=/people/1400 target=_blank>Isaac</a> heard this, he could no longer contain himself, but was eager to have a hand in that glorious victory. So, disregarding the instructions of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, he was off as quickly as possible to the other side of the river. And he took with him a hundred horsemen from among the troops which <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had stationed there, and advanced against the enemy's stockade, which was commanded by Ruderic, a capable warrior. Then he made a sudden assault upon the barbarians in the camp and smote a certain number of them, including Ruderic who had come out against him. The <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, for their part, immediately abandoned the camp and withdrew, either because they sui)posed that <a href=/people/1400 target=_blank>Isaac</a> had a very large hostile force in the rear, or by way of deceiving their opponents so that they might be able to capture them, as actually happened. <br />So <a href=/people/1400 target=_blank>Isaac</a>'s men penetrated the hostile camp, and began to plunder the silver which lay there and the other valuables. But the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> immediately returned and slew many of their opponents, but took <a href=/people/1400 target=_blank>Isaac</a> alive along with some few others. Horsemen then hastened to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and reported that <a href=/people/1400 target=_blank>Isaac</a> was in the hands of the enemy. <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was thunderstruck at what he heard, and, without investigating in what manner <a href=/people/1400 target=_blank>Isaac</a> could have been captured, but thinking that both <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a> and his wife were lost and that complete disaster had fallen upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, in that no other stronghold remained where they could now take refuge and save themselves, he fell into a state of speechlessness, an experience which he had never had before. It was for this reason that he hastily withdrew his forces to the rear, with the intention of attacking the enemy while they were still in disorder and recovering the town at all costs. <br />So the Roman army withdrew from the bridge without accomplishing its object. But when <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a>, he learned of the madness of <a href=/people/1400 target=_blank>Isaac</a> and perceived that his own excitement had been without reason; whereupon he was so overcome with sorrow at this adversity of fortune that he fell sick. For a fever came on which by its long continuance harassed him sorely and brought him into danger of death. Two days later it came about that Ruderic died and <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, being exceedingly grieved at his loss, put <a href=/people/1400 target=_blank>Isaac</a> to death.</p>                        </div>

And since he was entirely wrapped up in his concern for this traffic, he neither paid heed to the defence of the walls nor concerned himself with any other measures for security whatsoever, but any of the soldiers who so wished were allowed to neglect their duties; and meanwhile there was only an insignificant garrison on the walls, and even this received very little attention. For those who chanced from day to day to be assigned to guard duty were freely permitted to sleep, since no one was put in command of them who might possibly take some notice of such an act; nor did any officers consent to go the rounds of the fortifications, as had been customary, and inspect the guards to see what they were doing, and furthermore not one of the citizens was able to assist them in keeping guard: for an exceedingly small number, as I have said, were left in the city and these were wasted to the last degree by the famine. <br />Thus it came about that four <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> who were keeping guard by the Asinarian Gate did as follows: having waited carefully for that part of the night during which it always fell to the lot of the soldiers next them to sleep while the guarding of that portion of the wall devolved upon them, they fastened ropes to the battlement long enough to reach down to the ground, and laying hold of these with both hands got outside the fortifications; then they went before <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and agreed to receive him and the Gothic army into the city; for, as they declared, they were able to do this without any trouble. And <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> promised that he would be exceedingly grateful to them if they made good these promises and that he would put them in possession of great sums of money; he then sent with them two of his men to look over the place from which these men claimed that the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> could effect an entrance into the city. So this party came up beside the wall and, laying hold of the ropes, ascended to the battlement, where not a man uttered a sound or observed what was going on. <br />So when they reached the top, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> shewed the barbarians everything, namely that those who wished to ascend would meet with no obstacle, and that after they had come up they would have complete freedom of action, meeting as they would with not the least resistance; then, after bidding them carry this report to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, they sent them away. <br />Now when <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> heard this report, he was, in a way, pleased at the intelligence, but, notwithstanding this, he felt a suspicion as regards the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> and was not inclined to place very much confidence in them. Not many days later these men came to him again, urging him to undertake the enterprise. <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> thereupon sent two other men with them, with instructions that they too should make a thorough investigation of the whole situation and bring back a report. And these men, upon returning to him, made a report in all respects like that of those previously sent. But during this time a large force of Roman soldiers, who were out on a reconnoitering expedition, charged upon ten <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> walking along a road not far from the city, and they took them prisoners and straightway brought them before <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a>. And he enquired of these barbarians what <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>'s purpose really was; and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> said that he was in hopes that some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> would deliver the city to him: for the story had already become known to many of the barbarians. But even when <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> and <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a> heard this, they treated the matter with great unconcern and took no heed of the report. And a third time the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> came into the presence of <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and tried to induce the man to do the deed. So he sent with them a number of men and among them one related to him by blood, and they, upon returning to him, reported the whole situation and encouraged him to proceed. <br /><a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, then, as soon as night came on, put his whole force under arms in silence and led them up near the Asinarian Gate. And he commanded four men who were conspicuous among the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> for their bravery and strength to climb up the ropes with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> to the battlements, during that part of the night, of course, in which the guarding of that portion of the wall fell to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> while the others were taking their turn at sleeping. <br />And when these men got inside the fortifications, they descended to the Asinarian Gate without meeting any opposition; there they shattered with axes both the wooden beam with which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> customarily made the gates fast by fitting it into recesses in the wall on either side, and also all the ironwork into which the guards always inserted their keys to shut the gates or open them according to the need of the moment. Then they swung the gates open, just as they wished to do, and without any trouble received <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the Gothic army into the city. <br />But <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> collected his men there in one place and would not allow them to scatter at all, for he feared that they would fall into some ambush set by the enemy. And tumult and confusion, as was natural, fell upon the city, and the most of the Roman soldiers were fleeing with their commanders through another gate, each one taking whatever course he found easy to follow, while only a few with the rest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were taking refuge in the sanctuaries. Among the patricians Uecius and <a href=/people/1504 target=_blank>Basil</a> ius, in company with a few others (for <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> happened to be at hand for them) succeeded in escaping with <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a>. But <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, <a href=/people/5846 target=_blank>Olybrius</a>, <a href=/people/10891 target=_blank>Orestes</a>, and some others fled to the church of the Apostle Peter. Among the common people, however, it so fell out that only five hundred men had been left throughout the whole city, and these with difficulty found refuge in the sanctuaries. For all the rest of the population were gone, some having departed to other lands and some having been carried off by the famine, as I have stated above. <br />Now many persons during that night kept reporting to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> that both <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> and the enemy were fleeing. But he, saying the report they had given was a pleasing one, would not permit a pursuit. For what could be sweeter for a man, he said, than a fleeing enemy. When it was already day and there was now no suspicion left of any ambush, <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, for his part, went to the church of the Apostle Peter to pray, but the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> began to slay those who fell in their way. And in this manner there perished among the soldiers twenty-six, and among the people sixty. <br />And when <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> had come to the sanctuary, Pelagius came before him carrying the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> scriptures in his hand, and, making supplication in every manner possible, said  Spare thine own, O Master. And <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, mocking him with a haughty air of indifference, said Now at last, Pelagius, you have come to make yourself a suppliant before me. Yes replied Pelagius, at a time when God has made me your slave. Nay, spare your slaves, O Master, from now on. And <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> received this supplication with favour and forbade the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> thereafter to kill any Roman at all, but he permitted them, while setting aside for him the most valuable of the property, to have unrestricted authority to plunder all the rest for themselves. <br />Now he found much of value in the houses of patricians, but most of all in the house where <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> had lodged. For that ill-starred wretch had been only collecting for <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> the outrageous sums which, as set forth above, he had charged for the grain. And thus the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in general, and particularly the members of the senate, found themselves reduced to such straits that they clothed themselves in the garments of slaves and rustics, and lived by begging bread or any other food from their enemies; a very notable example of this change of fortune being that of Rusticiana, the daughter of <a href=/people/1720 target=_blank>Symmachus</a>, who had been wife of Boetius, a woman who was always lavishing her wealth upon the needy. Indeed these wretches went about to all the houses and kept knocking at the doors and begging that they give them food, feeling no shame in doing so. <br />Now the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, on their part, were eager to put Rusticiana to death, bringing against her the charge that after bribing the commanders of the Roman army, she had destroyed the statues of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>, her motive in so doing having been to avenge the murder not only of her father <a href=/people/1720 target=_blank>Symmachus</a>, but also of her husband Boethius. But <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> would not permit her to suffer any harm, but he guarded both her and all the other women safe from insult, although the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were extremely eager to have intercourse with them. Consequently not one of them had the ill fortune to suffer personal insult, whether married, unwed, or widow, and <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> won great renown for moderation from this course.</p>                        </div>

Do not, therefore, on this account regard this present exhortation as of little moment. For when words lead to good fortune, men ought not to feel surfeit of them, even though the speaker seem to wear out his hearers with much speaking; for they cannot reasonably reject the benefit gained from such words. Now what I would say is this: only yesterday, as it were, we assembled a host of two hundred thousand most warlike soldiers, we had at our disposal enormous wealth, and could display a lavish abundance of both <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and arms, we had a numerous company of mature men of the greatest discretion — a circumstance considered most advantageous for those entering upon a war — and yet, with all this in our favour, we were vanquished by five thousand Greeklings,p and for no good reason were stripped of our power and everything else that was ours. But now it has been our fortune, though reduced to a small number, destitute of arms and in pitiable plight and without any experience at all, to gain the mastery over an enemy more than twenty thousand strong. Our experience, then, to put it in a word, has been such as I have described. But the causes of this outcome, though you know them full well, I must now state to you. The <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> in earlier times paid less heed to justice than to any other thing, and treated each other and their Roman subjects as well in an unholy manner; wherefore God was then moved to take the field against them on the side of their enemies. <br />And so, although we were far superior to our opponents in number and in valour and in the general equipment for war, we were defeated by a power which was invisible and quite uncomprehended. It will therefore rest with you to guard your blessings — manifestly by continuing to observe justice. For if you change your course, God too will instantly change His favour and become hostile to you. For it is not His wont to fight with a race of men or a particular nation, but with such as shew the greater honour to justice. And for Him it is no labour to transfer his blessings from one people to the other. For whereas only to refrain from wrong-doing inheres in the will of man, God by His very nature has all things in His power. I say, therefore, that you must observe justice strictly both in your dealings with each other and with your subjects; for it would amount to the same thing to tell you to preserve your good fortune for ever. After <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> had made this speech before the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, he likewise called together the members of the Roman senate, and reproached and abused them at length, saying that, although they had received many benefits from both <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> and Atalaric, in that they themselves had always been appointed to the chief offices throughout the kingdom and had thus administered the government, and had, furthermore, amassed vast wealth, still they had acted with such ingratitude toward the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, their benefactors, that, regardless of their obligations, they had planned a revolt to their own harm, and brought in the Greeks to attack their fatherland, thus turning traitors to themselves on the impulse of the moment. Then, after enquiring whether they had ever suffered any personal harm at the hands of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, he compelled them to state whether any good thing came to them from the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, reviewing all that had happened in order: first, they had, he said, been stripped of practically all the offices; second, they had been maltreated by the logothetes,p as they were called, in that they had been compelled to settle accounts for their treatment of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> during their official careers; and, third, although they were in dire straits on account of the war, they were paying the Greeks not a whit less in public taxes than in times of peace. And he included many other things too in his speech, such things as an angry master might be expected to say in upbraiding men who have become his slaves. Then he set before them <a href=/people/3610 target=_blank>Herodian</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> who had handed over the city to him, and said: You, who have been reared together with the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, have not up to the present day seen fit to surrender to us even one empty town, but these men have received us into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> itself and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a>. By this action you have been reduced to the rank of household slaves, while these men, seeing that they have really proved themselves friends and kinsmen of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, will hold your offices hereafter. Now when the patricians heard this, they sat in silence. But Pelagius began to plead with <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> for them as men who had suffered reverse and misfortune, and would not let him go until he made them a promise of kind treatment and thus sent them away. <br />After this he sent Pelagius and one of the Roman orators, <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a> by name, as envoys to the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, having bound them by most solemn oaths that they would remain loyal to him and would make every effort to return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> as quickly as possible. And he instructed them to exert themselves to the utmost to secure peace for him from the emperor, in order, as he said, that he, for his part, might not be compelled to raze <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> entirely to the ground, to destroy the members of the senate, and to carry the war into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>. And he also wrote a letter to the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>. <br />Now the emperor had already heard of what had taken place in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. But when later on the envoys came before him, they delivered the message which <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> had instructed them to bring and put the letter into his hands. <br />Now the contents of the letter were as follows: As to what has transpired in the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, since I suppose thou hast learned everything, I have decided to remain silent. But as to the purpose for which I have sent these envoys, thou shalt straightway be informed. We demand that thou, for thy part, take to thyself the advantages which flow from peace and also grant them to us. <br />These advantages are recalled and exemplified most admirably in the lives of <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a> and <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>, who ruled as kings not long ago, and filled their whole reigns with peace and prosperity. And if this same condition should perchance please thee, thou wouldst properly be called my father, and thou wilt also have us hereafter as allies against whomsoever thou mayest wish to use us. When the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> saw this letter thus brought to him, and heard all the words of the envoys, he dismissed them instantly, giving them only this reply and writing it to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, that he had made <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> supreme commander in the war, and that he, consequently, had full power to make such settlement with <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> as he wished.</p>                        </div>

Tullianus gathered the rustics of that region and set a guard upon the pass (a very narrow one) which gives access to the district, with the purpose of preventing the enemy from entering to devastate the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=place long=16 lat=40.4>Lucania</a>. And three hundred Antae also were helping them to keep guard, men whom John had left there previously, as it happened, at the request of Tullianus; for these barbarians excel all others in their ability to fight on rough ground. When <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> learned this, though he considered it inexpedient to assign <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> to the task, he gathered a multitude of rustics, and sent them with a very few <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, with orders to try with all their strength to force the pass. When these two forces engaged in battle, a violent struggle ensued, each side striving to force the other back, but the Antae by their valour, and also because the very roughness of the ground was to their advantage, together with the rustics under Tullianus turned their opponents to flight; and a great number of them were slaughtered. <br />But when <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> learned this, he decided first to raze <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to the ground, and then, while leaving the most of his army in that neighbourhood, to march with the rest against John and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=ethnic long=16 lat=40.4>Lucanians</a>. <br />Accordingly he tore down the fortifications in many places so that about one third of the defences were destroyed. And he was on the point also of burning the finest and most noteworthy of the buildings and making <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>-pasture, but <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> learned of his design and sent envoys with a letter to him. <br />When these envoys came before <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, they stated why they had come and delivered the letter, which conveyed the following. While the creation of beauty in a city which has not been beautiful before could only proceed from men of wisdom who understand the meaning of civilization, the destruction of beauty which already exists would be naturally expected only of men who lack understanding, and who are not ashamed to leave to posterity this token of their character. <br />Now among all the cities under the sun <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> is agreed to be the greatest and the most noteworthy. For it has not been created by the ability of one man, nor has it attained such greatness and beauty by a power of short duration, but a multitude of monarchs, many companies of the best men, a great lapse of time, and an extraordinary abundance of wealth have availed to bring together in that city all other things that are in the whole world, and skilled workers besides. Thus, little by little, have they built the city, such as you behold it, thereby leaving to future generations memorials of the ability of them all, so that insult to these monuments would properly be considered a great crime against the men of all time; for by such action the men of former generations are robbed of the memorials of their ability, and future generations of the sight of their works. Such, then, being the facts of the case, be well assured of this, that one of two things must necessarily take place: either you will be defeated by the emperor in this struggle, or, should it so fall out, you will triumph over him. Now, in the first place, supposing you are victorious, if you should dismantle <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, you would not have destroyed the possession of some other man, but your own city, excellent Sir, and, on the other hand, if you preserve it, you will naturally enrich yourself by a possession the fairest of all; but if, in the second place, it should perchance fall to your lot to experience the worse fortune, in saving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> you would be assured of abundant gratitude on the part of the victor, but by destroying the city you will make it certain that no plea for mercy will any longer be left to you, and in addition to this you will have reaped no benefit from the deed. Furthermore; a reputation that corresponds with your conduct will be your portion among all men, and it stands waiting for you according as you decide either way. <br />For the quality of the acts of rulers determines, of necessity, the quality of the repute which they win from their acts. Such was the letter of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. <br />And <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, after reading it over many times and coming to realize accurately the significance of the advice, was convinced and did <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> no further harm. So he sent a statement of his decision to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and immediately dismissed the envoys. And he commanded the main body of the army to make camp not far from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> at the town of Algedon, which is about one hundred and twenty stades distant from the city toward the west, and to remain quietly there, in order that the troops of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> might have no freedom to go anywhere outside <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a>; but with the rest of the army he himself marched against John and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=ethnic long=16 lat=40.4>Lucanians</a>. <br />As for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, however, he kept the members of the senate with him, while all the others together with their wives and children he sent into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>, refusing to allow a single soul in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, but leaving it entirely deserted. <br />When John learned that <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> was marching against him, he refused to remain longer in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=place long=16.3 lat=41>Apulia</a>, but went hastily to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a>. Now those patricians who were being taken into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a> sent certain of their domestics into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=place long=16 lat=40.4>Lucania</a>, by direction of <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, and bade their tenants abandon their present machinations, and till the fields as they were accustomed; for, the message announced, they would have the property of their masters. So they detached themselves from the Roman army, and remained quietly on the land; whereupon Tullianus made off in flight, and the three hundred Antae decided to follow John in his retreat, in this way the whole territory south of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a>, with the exception of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a>, became once more subject to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>. And the barbarians by this time were filled with confidence and, scattering in small bands, began to overrun the whole country round about. When John learned this, he sent a numerous force of his men against them. And this force, falling unexpectedly upon the enemy, killed a large number. And <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, as a result of this experience, became cautious and gathered all his troops together in the neighbourhood of Mt. Garganon, which rises near the centre of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=place long=16.3 lat=41>Apulia</a>, and encamping in the fortified enclosure of <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=person long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyan</a>, he remained quiet.</p>                        </div>

Now when <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> saw him, he was exceedingly pleased. For he heard that the youth had won fame in single combats, and he had also seen him many times. And since the man had two children and his wife among the captives, <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> immediately restored to him his wife and one of the children, but the other he continued to guard as a hostage, and sent <a href=/people/6642 target=_blank>Martinianus</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a> with a few others. <br />Now it so happened that when the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> captured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a> by the surrender of <a href=/people/3610 target=_blank>Herodian</a>, they had indeed razed the whole circuit-wall of the city to the ground, but they had thoroughly walled up the entrances of the structure in front of the city, which served for the keeping of wild animals and has come to be called an amphitheatre, and had established in it a garrison both of <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and of Roman deserters, for the purpose of guarding the country round about. <br />So when <a href=/people/6642 target=_blank>Martinianus</a> had come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a>, he succeeded in winning the friendship of fifteen soldiers, whom he persuaded to return to the Roman army after first accomplishing some great exploit against the barbarians. And he also sent some men to the commander of the garrison in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a>, bidding him send an army to him at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a> with all possible speed, and explaining to him the whole situation. Now the garrison in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a> was at that time commanded by Odalgan, a <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Hun</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a> having been treacherously removed from the world, as has been stated above, by one of his own bodyguards. <br />And he came himself with an army to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a>. Then, when <a href=/people/6642 target=_blank>Martinianus</a> ascertained that this army was close at hand, he in company with the fifteen soldiers suddenly slew the commander of the garrison and, opening the gates, received all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> into the fortress. And the most of the enemy they slew, but they made some prisoners and brought them before <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. <br />Shortly after this <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> conceived the idea of going up to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and seeing into what condition it had fallen. So he selected a thousand of his soldiers and with them went to the city. But a man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> went in haste to the enemy who were in camp at Algedon, and reported the presence of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>' army. So the barbarians occupied the district in front of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> with several ambuscades, and, when they saw that the force of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had come close upon them, they rose from their places of ambush and attacked them. Thereupon a fierce battle ensued, in which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> by their valour routed their enemy, and, after destroying the most of them, they withdrew immediately to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a>. Such was the course of events at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. <br />There is a city on the coast of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=place long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabria</a> called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>, about two days' journey distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a>, on the road from there to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397164PTho class=place long=16.49 lat=39.716>Thurii</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=place long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a>. Thither John came with a few men, at the invitation of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=ethnic long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentines</a>, having established the rest of his command as a garrison in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a>. And when he saw that this city was exceedingly large and entirely without defences, he thought that he would be utterly unable to defend the whole of it; but he observed that the sea to the north of the city formed a bay on either side of a very narrow strip of land, where the port of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a> is situated, and thus the space between the bays naturally forms an isthmus for a distance of not less than twenty stades; so he formed the following plan. He cut off from the rest of the city that portion which lay on the isthmus, and enclosed it by means of a wall extending from one bay to the other and along the wall he dug a deep trench. There he collected not only the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=ethnic long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentines</a> but also all the inhabitants of the surrounding country, and he left them a garrison of considerable size. In this way all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=ethnic long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabrians</a> were now in a secure position and they consequently purposed to revolt from the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. Such was the course of events in this quarter. <br /><a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, for his part, occupied a very strong fortress in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=place long=16 lat=40.4>Lucania</a>, situated close to the boundaries of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=place long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabria</a>, called Acherontis by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>; and after establishing there a garrison of not less than four hundred men. he himself with the rest of his army marched against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, leaving in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a> some of the barbarians, who were charged with the guarding of Roman prisoners, the members of the senate being in that place.</p>                        </div>

But its outcome proved to be a splendid achievement of marvellous importance. For he sallied forth, leaving behind only a few of his soldiers to keep guard in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a>, and went himself with the rest of his army to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, with the intention of trying with all his strength to establish himself in possession of the city. And since he was unable in a short time to rebuild all the portions of the wall which <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> had torn down, he did as follows. Gathering stones which lay close by, he threw them one on top of the ether, regardless of order, without putting anything at all between the stones, since he had neither lime nor anything else of the sort, but caring only that the face of the masonry should be preserved, and he set a great quantity of stakes on the outside. Now he had previously, as it happened, dug deep trenches around the entire circuit-wall, as stated in the previous narrative. And since the whole army carried out this work with unbounded enthusiasm, in twenty-five days such parts of the fortifications as had been torn down had been finished in this manner. And all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who lived in the neighbourhood gathered in the city, both because of their desire to make their homes in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and also because they had for a time been scantily supplied with provisions and they found abundance there; for <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had been able to bring this about by loading a great number of boats with all manner of provisions and bringing them up to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> by the river. <br />When <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> heard this, he immediately set his whole army in motion and marched against <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, before <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had as yet been able to fit the gates to the wall. For it so happened that <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> had destroyed them all, and <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had not up to that time succeeded in having gates built because of the lack of artisans. And when the barbarian army came near the city, they made camp for the moment and bivouacked on the bank of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, but on the following day at sunrise they advanced, filled with great fury and shouting as they came, to a position before the walls. But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had selected the most warlike of his soldiers and stationed them in the open gateways, commanding the rest to stand above and ward off the assailants from the wall with all their force. So a fierce battle ensued; for the barbarians, on their part, at first entertained the hope that they would capture the city at the first shout, but since the attempt proved difficult, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> offered a most vigorous resistance, they gave way to rage and began to press upon the foe, their fury inspiring them to daring beyond their strength. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, meanwhile, resisted with unexpected determination, the danger naturally arousing them to bravery. <br />Consequently a great slaughter of the barbarians took place, since they were being shot at from a high position, and both armies were becoming very weary and distressed; and the battle, which had begun in the morning, ended at night. Thereupon the barbarians repaired to their camps and passed the night there, caring for their wounded; as for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, some were keeping guard on the wall, while others, who were the men most conspicuous of all for their bravery, were guarding the open gateways in relays, having placed triboli in great numbers in front of them, so that the enemy might not make a surprise attack upon them. <br />Now these triboli are of the following sort. Four spikes of equal length are fastened together at their butts in such a manner that their points form the outline of a triangle on every side. These they throw at random upon the ground, and because of their form three of the spikes all plant themselves very firmly upon the ground, while the remaining one stands up alone and always proves an obstacle for both men and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. And as often as anybody rolls over one of these triboli, the spike which hitherto has chanced to stand up straight in the air becomes planted on the ground, but another one takes its place above, as an obstacle to those who wish to advance to the attack. Such are the triboli So both sides bivouacked thus after the battle. <br />On the following day <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> decided to storm the wall again with his whole army, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> proceeded to ward them off in the manner described; and gaining the upper hand in the engagement, they plucked up courage to make a sally against their enemy. And as the barbarians retreated, some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, in pursuing them, went to a considerable distance from the fortifications. These the barbarians were on the point of surrounding, so that they might be unable to return to the city. But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, noting what was taking place, sent a large number of his men to that point and thus succeeded in rescuing the force. After being repulsed in this way the barbarians withdrew, having lost many of their able fighting men, and bringing with them a great number of wounded to their camp. <br />There they remained quiet, caring for their wounds and attending to their arms, many of which had now been destroyed, and putting everything else in readiness. <br />Many days later they again advanced against the wall with the purpose of storming it. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> came out to meet them and joined battle. <br />And by some chance the man who was bearing the standard of <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> received a mortal wound and not only fell from his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> himself, but also threw the standard to the ground. Whereupon those of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who were fighting at the front made a rush with the intention of seizing the standard and the corpse. But the most courageous of the barbarians got there first, seized the standard, and also cut off the left hand of the corpse and took it with them. <br />For the fallen man was wearing upon this hand a notable bracelet of gold, over which they were quite unwilling that their opponents should exult, and they sought thus to avoid the disgrace which its loss would involve. Then the barbarian army was turned to retreat in complete disorder, while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> despoiled what was left of the corpse, and in pursuing the enemy to a great distance killed many of them, and then returned to the city without the slightest loss. <br />Then all the notable <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> came to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and inveighed against him and reproached him mercilessly for his lack of wisdom; after capturing <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, they said, he had neither levelled the whole city to the ground so that it might be no longer possible for the enemy to take possession of it, nor had himself held it, but that which they had accomplished by a great expenditure of both labour and time, this he himself had undone in an altogether unreasonable manner. Thus it is by nature inbred in men to accommodate their judgment in every case to the outcome of events and to allow their mind to be dominated by the current of fortune, and to make their changes of opinion instantly as a result of this. It was indeed for this reason that while <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> was succeeding in his undertakings, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had reverenced him equally with God, calling him an unvanquished and invincible leader, at the time when he allowed them to destroy only a portion of the defences of captured cities, but when he met with the reverse above mentioned, they did not feel it improper to inveigh against him, unmindful of what they had recently said about him, and going contrary to these declarations without the least hesitation. But these errors of judgment and others like them must inevitably be constantly committed by men, since they are due to human nature. <br />So <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and his barbarians broke up the siege and went to the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a>, having torn down practically all the bridges over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, that it might not be easy for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> to make an attack upon them. One bridge, however, which bears the name of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BBMi class=place long=12.4671 lat=41.9352>Mulvian</a>, they were quite unable to destroy, since it was very close to the city. And they decided to rebuild the fortress in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a> with all their might; for they had dismantled it previously; and they deposited there all their possessions and remained quiet. As for <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, having now less cause for fear, he fitted gates to the circuit-wall of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on every side, bound them with iron, and once more sent the keys to the emperor. And the winter drew to a close, and the twelfth year ended in this war, the history of which <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> [547 a.d], has written.</p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg4029.tlg001:7.25.1'><b>&sect; 7.25.1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Long before this <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> had, as it happened, sent an army against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a>, and they had encamped about the circuit-wall of the city and were maintaining a close siege of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> there. And since they perceived that the city was scantily supplied with provisions, they sent to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and begged him to come there with his whole army, thinking that they would thus capture <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in it with less difficulty and labour. <br />Now <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> saw that the barbarians were not very eager to carry out his orders, and so he desired to deliver an exhortation to them. With this in view, he called them all together and spoke as follows. <br /> I have observed, fellow-soldiers, that you are cherishing toward me an unjustified anger, and at the same time that you bitterly resent that adversity of fortune which has befallen us; for this reason I have decided to bring you together on the present occasion, in order that I may be able to remove from your minds an impression which is absolutely wrong and bring you back to a better judgment, and also that you may appear neither to shew me an ingratitude which ill befits you, nor to be led by base motives to assume a thankless attitude toward the Deity. For it is of the very nature of human affairs that failure must come at times, and when any man, forgetting that he is human, shews himself rebellious against that which befalls him, he will himself naturally acquire a reputation for stupidity, and yet in no wise escape the necessity which fate has laid upon him. Now I wish to remind you of previous events, not so much in order to absolve myself from the blame for what has happened, as to demonstrate that this may with more justice be laid upon yourselves. For when <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> was entering upon this war at the very beginning, he did indeed tear down the walls of the coast towns <a about=https://topostext.org/place/438130UFFo class=place long=13.0181 lat=43.8443>Fanum</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/439129UPis class=place long=12.9145 lat=43.9109>Pisaurum</a>, but <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and the other cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> without exception he exempted, not damaging them in the least. Consequently, while no trouble has come to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/438130UFFo class=place long=13.0181 lat=43.8443>Fanum</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/439129UPis class=place long=12.9145 lat=43.9109>Pisaurum</a>, it was because of the circuit-walls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and the other fortified places that trouble came to the Gauls and <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> after the manner that is well-known to you. <br /> Accordingly, when I accepted the royal power offered by you, I formed the reasonable purpose of emulating those deeds which had come to be regarded as better for us rather than to damage our cause by doing those things which had harmed us. For while men do not seem to differ greatly one from the other as far as nature is concerned, still some have had the advantage of experience, which, like a teacher, makes him who has learned her lesson superior in every respect to those who have not received such instruction. Accordingly, when we captured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411148PBen class=place long=14.78 lat=41.13>Beneventum</a>, we razed its walls and straightway captured the other towns, whose circuit-walls we decided to raze in the same way, in order that the enemy's army might not be able, by having any strong base, to carry on the war by stratagem, but should at once be compelled to come down to the plain and engage with us there. <br />So while the enemy, for their part, were in flight, I was giving orders to raze such of the cities as were captured. And you, marvelling at my good judgment, aided and abetted this decision, and so, it would seem, made my actions your own. For he who praises the man who has done a deed becomes himself the agent of the deed no less than the other. <br />But now you have reversed your position, my dearest <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, simply because it has come about that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, by adopting a course of unreasonable daring, has unexpectedly attained the object for which he strove, and in consequence of this you have come to be astounded at the man as a marvel of courage. For men of daring are called courageous more readily than men of foresight are called safe. <br />And the reason is that, while he who displays daring beyond the established bounds of conduct is honoured with the name and fame of a strenuous man, he who refrains from danger with careful judgment and meets with ill success draws upon him the responsibility for what happens, and even if he achieves the success he planned, he still seems, to foolish men at any rate, to have accomplished nothing by himself. <br />And apart from this, you do not consider that you are angry with me for the things which, in reality, cause you resentment just now. Or do you really believe that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> has won a glorious success against you — you who, though reduced to the condition of prisoners of war and runaway slaves, took up arms under me as your general and have proved yourselves able many a time to overcome him in battle ? And yet if it was through my merit that you succeeded in accomplishing such things, out of respect for that merit you ought to be silent, remembering in the hour of men's reverses that nothing can remain fixed; and if, on the other hand, it was some fortune which bestowed that victory upon you, it will profit you more to shew reverence toward her rather than vexation, so that you may not be compelled through failure to learn the true meaning of her favour. Indeed, how could it fail to appear inconsistent with a welltempered spirit that men who have achieved for themselves many great successes not long ago and have now met with a slight reverse should allow their pride to be thus humbled ? For such an attitude means purely and simply this, that you obstinately refuse to acknowledge that you are human. For never to make mistakes could be predicated only of God. Consequently I say that you must abandon this attitude and with all enthusiasm grapple with the enemy in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a>. <br />For if you prove able to capture them, <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> will again smile upon you. For while that which has happened could never be undone by all eternity, still when fresh successes fall to the lot of those who have met with reverse, it comes about that the memory of evil days is made lighter. <br />And you will achieve the mastery of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a> without any trouble. For <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a>, who was commander of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> there, has been put out of the way by fortune, coupled with our planning, and an ungoverned multitude, particularly when scantily supplied with the necessities of life, is quite incapable of offering a brave resistance. Nor indeed will anyone harm us from the rear; for not only have I seen fit to destroy the bridges over the river, with this purpose, that we might suffer no loss from unexpected assaults, but it is also true that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and John are regarding each other with suspicion, a fact which can be seen from previous events. For the conflict of men's judgments, one with the other, is clearly detected by their actions. This indeed is the reason why they have not even been able to join forces with each other up to this time. For their mutual suspicion disconcerts each of them; and those who admit this feeling are bound to harbour envy and hostility besides. And when these passions assault men, no needful thing can be done. After this speech <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> led forth his army against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a>, and, upon their arrival at that city, they made camp hard by the circuit-wall and established themselves for a siege.</p>                        </div>

For upon hearing that <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the Gothic army were engaged in assaulting the fortifications of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, he chose out the most illustrious of his horsemen, and, without announcing his plan to anyone at all, he rode with them into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a> (for <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> had, as it happened, left the members of the senate there), resting neither day nor night, in order that by making an unexpected attack he might be able to seize and rescue the senators, seeing that the towns there were entirely without defences. <br />Now it so happened that <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> at that very time began to be alarmed lest some of the enemy should, as in fact they did, come with the intention of striking a blow to rescue the prisoners, and he had accordingly sent an army of cavalry to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>. <br />Now when this force reached the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412138UMin class=place long=13.7684 lat=41.242>Minturnae</a>,p it was decided that the better course for them was for the main body to remain quietly there and care for their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> (for they had become greatly fatigued on this journey), while they sent a few scouts to investigate the situation at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> and the adjoining towns. Now the distance between the two places is not more than three hundred stades. They accordingly sent forward as scouts four hundred men whose <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> were unwearied and whose strength was still unimpaired. And it so fell out by some chance that on that very day at the same time both John and his army and these same four hundred barbarians reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>, neither having heard anything previously of their opponents. <br />Thereupon a fierce battle ensued on the spur of the moment; for no sooner did they see each other than they began fighting; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> won a decisive victory and killed most of the enemy immediately. Only a few of the barbarians were able to escape, and these reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412138UMin class=place long=13.7684 lat=41.242>Minturnae</a> in rapid flight. <br />But when the others saw these men, some dripping with blood, some still actually carrying the missiles in their bodies, and others refusing to speak a word or give any account of what had happened, but still persisting in their retreat and openly displaying the terror which was in them, they leaped upon their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> immediately and joined in the flight. <br />And when they came before <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, they reported that there was an innumerable host of the enemy, seeking in this way to remove the shame of their flight. <br />Now it so happened that not less than seventy Roman soldiers of those who had previously deserted to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were on their way into the towns of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>, and these men decided to go over to John. And John found there only a few of the members of the senate, but practically all their wives. For during the capture of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> many of the men followed the soldiers in flight and reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a>, but the women were all captured. Clementinus, however, a patrician, took refuge in one of the sanctuaries there and refused absolutely to follow the Roman army, for he had previously handed over to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> a stronghold which is close to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> and in all probability dreaded the wrath of the emperor for this reason. On the other hand, <a href=/people/10891 target=_blank>Orestes</a>, who had been consul of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, though he chanced to be near at hand, was obliged to remain, altogether against his will, owing to a scarcity of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. John then immediately sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> the members of the senate together with the seventy soldiers who had come over to him. <br /><a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, upon hearing this, was sorely grieved, and eagerly sought an opportunity to inflict vengeance upon John for the deed. With this in view, he marched against him with the main body of his army, leaving a small part of his troops behind in order to keep guard. Now it so happened that John and his men, a thousand in number, had made camp in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=place long=16 lat=40.4>Lucania</a>, having previously sent out scouts who were watching all the roads closely and keeping guard that no hostile army should approach to do them harm. But <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> had in mind that such would be the case, believing it impossible that John's force should settle in their camp without sending out scouts, and so he abandoned the customary roads and marched against them through the mountains, many of which in that region are precipitous and rise to a very great height — a feat which no one would have been able to suspect, for these mountains are considered in fact impassable. <br />Meanwhile, the men thus sent out as scouts by John did indeed observe that a hostile army had got into that region, but they secured no definite information about it; however they feared what actually did take place, and so they too marched toward the Roman camp. And it so turned out that they arrived there at night together with the barbarians. <br />But <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, being now overmastered by violent passion and not weighing the consequences with careful judgment, reaped the fruits of his fatuous fury. For though he had under him an army ten times as large as that of his opponents, and though it was plain to be seen that for a stronger army it was of course advantageous to fight the decisive battle in broad daylight, and he should rather have engaged with his enemy at dawn in order that they might not be able to escape in the darkness, still he did not observe this precaution at all; for, in fact, he could have stretched a cordon about his opponents and immediately captured every man of them as in a net; but instead he gave way to his anger and fell upon the hostile army at an advanced hour of the night. And although not one of them thought of offering the least resistance, since the most were in fact still sleeping, none the less the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> did not find themselves able to slay many, but they got up, and the majority, thanks to the darkness, succeeded in slipping away. And once outside the camp they ran up into the mountains, many of which rise close by, and thus were saved. Among these was John himself and Arufus, the leader of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>. Of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> about a hundred perished. <br />Now there had been with John a certain Gilacius of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> race, commander of a small force of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a>. This Gilacius did not know how to speak either Greek or Latin or Gothic or any other language except <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> alone. When some of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> happened upon this man, they enquired who he might be. For they were quite averse to killing every man who came in their way, lest they be compelled to destroy each other in fighting at night, as might easily happen. But he was able to make them no answer except indeed that he was Gilacius, a general; for his title which he had received from the emperor he had heard many times and so had been able to learn it by heart. <br />The barbarians, accordingly, perceiving by this that he was an enemy, made him a prisoner for the moment, but not long afterwards put the man to death.

And the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> decided to send another army against the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, being led to do so by the dispatches of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, who kept urging him to take this action, having indicated many times the situation in which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> found themselves. <br />Accordingly, he first sent Pacurius, the son of Peranius, and <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a>, the nephew of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, with a few men. And they arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and immediately united with the rest of the army. Later on he sent <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> with three hundred <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>, and Varazes, an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> by birth, with eight hundred <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a>, and he recalled from his post of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a>, and ordered him to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> with his attendant spearmen and guards, who numbered more than a thousand. Now <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> was the first to put in at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a>, and he left his ships there, being quite unwilling to remain in that place, where John's army was, and went forward on horseback with his command. For this man was not of a serious temper, but was utterly addicted to the disease of drunkenness, and consequently he was always possessed by a spirit of reckless daring. And when they had come close to the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, they made camp and remained there. <br />And when <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> learned this, he said <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> has one of two things, either a powerful army or a very silly head. Let us then proceed against him instantly, that either we may make trial of the man's army, or that he may realize his own silliness. So <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> with these words marched against him with a numerous army; and the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>, spying the enemy already at hand, took refuge in a wood which was close by. And the enemy surrounded them and killed more than two hundred, and were about to lay hands on <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> himself and the rest of the force who were hiding among the thorn-bushes, but fortune came to their aid and saved them unexpectedly. For the ships in which Varazes and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a> under him were sailing suddenly put in at the shore there. Now when <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> saw this, supposing the hostile army to be more numerous than it really was, he immediately set out and marched away from there, while <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> and his men were glad to reach their ships on the run. And Varazes decided to sail no farther, but proceeded with them to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>, whither John the nephew of <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> also not long afterwards came with his whole army. Such was the course of these events. <br />Now the emperor wrote to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> that he had sent him a numerous army with which he should unite in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=place long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabria</a> and so engage with the enemy. <br />And in fact <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> had already come down close to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a>, but he thought that, for the present at any rate, it was inexpedient for him to ferry across. For at that season of the year, he reasoned, provisions would not be sufficient for men and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, since it was near the winter solstice. <br />But he did send three hundred of his men to John with the promise that after spending the winter there he would also come himself at the beginning of spring, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, accordingly, upon reading the emperor's letter, selected nine hundred men distinguished for valour, seven hundred <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>-men and two hundred foot-soldiers, and leaving all the rest to guard that district, and appointing <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a> commander over them, he immediately set sail for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. And from there he again put out to sea purposing to sail to the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>; and as he sailed by he had on his left the place called Scylaeum, at which the poets say that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383157LSky class=place long=15.715 lat=38.255>Scylla</a> once lived, not because there really existed there the woman in the form of a beast, as they say, but rather because a certain fish, formerly called scylax and now cyniscus has been found in great abundance in this part of the strait from ancient times even down to my day. <br />For names in the beginning are always appropriate to the things they describe, but rumour, carrying these names to other peoples, engenders there certain false opinions through ignorance of the facts. <br />And as time goes on with this process, it immediately becomes a powerful builder, as it were, of the story, and allies itself with the poets, presumably because of the licence of their art, as witnesses of things that never happened. Thus, for example, the natives of the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer class=place long=19.9156 lat=39.6063>Cercyra</a> have from ancient times called one headland of the island Dog's Head — the one toward the east — but others because of this name will have it that the people there are a kind of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-headed folk. Indeed they even call some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=ethnic long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidians</a> Wolf-Skulls, not because they have the heads of <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a>, but because the mountain which rises there has received the name Wolf-Helmet. Now as for these matters, let each one both think and speak as he wishes. But I shall return to the point from which I have strayed.</p>                        </div>

Now the shore there has approximately the form of a crescent, where the coast recedes and the sea advances in a gulf, as it were, far up into the land. But the distance, as one sails along this whole coast, extends to one thousand stades, and on either side of the opening of the gulf stand two cities, the one toward the west being <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391171PCro class=place long=17.129 lat=39.081>Croton</a>, and the one to the east <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>. And at the middle of this shore is the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397164PTho class=place long=16.49 lat=39.716>Thurii</a>. But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was hindered by a storm and forced from his course by a violent wind and a high sea which would not permit his ships to make any progress at all; he therefore put in at the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391171PCro class=place long=17.129 lat=39.081>Croton</a>. <br />And since he neither found any fortress there nor any place from which provisions could be brought in for the soldiers, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> himself together with his wife remained there with the infantry, in order that from there he might be able to summon and organize John's army; but he ordered all the horsemen to go ahead and make camp at the passes leading into the country, placing in command of them Phazas the Iberian and the guardsman Barbation. For in this way he thought that they could secure all necessary supplies for their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and themselves very easily, and would probably, too, be able in a narrow pass to repulse the enemy. For the mountains of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=place long=16 lat=40.4>Lucania</a> extend as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392165RBre class=place long=16.5 lat=39.2>Bruttium</a>, and standing as they do close to one another, they form there only two passes, which are exceedingly narrow, one of which has received the name Rock of Blood in the Latin tongue, while the natives are accustomed to call the other Lavula. Not far from these passes on the coast is Rusciane, the naval harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397164PTho class=place long=16.49 lat=39.716>Thurii</a>, while above it at a distance of about sixty stades is a very strong fortress built by the ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. This fortress had been occupied by John much earlier and he had established a considerable garrison in it. <br />Now the soldiers of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, upon reaching this district, chanced upon a hostile army, which <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> had sent for the purpose of making an attempt on the fortress there. And they engaged with them immediately and by their valour routed them without any difficulty, although they were far outnumbered, and they slew more than two hundred. <br />Those who were left took to flight and when they came before <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, reported everything that had befallen them. As for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, they made camp and remained there, but since they were without proper commanders and had won a victory, they began to conduct themselves in a rather careless manner. For they neither stayed quietly gathered in one place, nor did they take up positions near the pass and guard the approaches, but, becoming negligent, they were sleeping at night in encampments very far removed from one another, and during the day they would go about searching for provisions, neither sending any men out as scouts nor taking any other measures for security. <br /><a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, consequently, upon learning everything, selected three thousand horsemen from his whole army and went 'against the enemy. And falling upon them unexpectedly, not drawn up in battle formation but going about in the manner described, he threw them all into consternation and complete disorder. At this moment Phazas, who happened to be camping near by, encountered the enemy and made a display of valorous deeds, and he did, indeed, thus make himself the cause of the escape of a few men but he himself perished together with all his men. This misfortune fell heavily upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, because they all pinned their hope on this detachment as an unusually efficient fighting force. Now as many as succeeded in fleeing saved themselves in such manner as each found possible. And Barbation, the guardsman of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, fled with two others as hard as he could, and was the first to reach <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391171PCro class=place long=17.129 lat=39.081>Croton</a>. <br />There he reported how matters stood at the moment, and added that he thought the barbarians too would be at hand right speedily. And <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, upon hearing this, was sorely grieved, and rushed on board the ships. So they set sail from there, and since a wind was blowing, they succeeded that day in reaching <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382156PMes class=place long=15.5566 lat=38.1923>Messana</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, which is seven hundred stades from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391171PCro class=place long=17.129 lat=39.081>Croton</a>, being situated opposite to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=place long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a>.</p>                        </div>

And they had already succeeded in capturing numerous strongholds of that region, which were then quite undefended, but which previously had been reputed to be strong places, and they continued to roam about searching out everything at their own pleasure. And the commanders of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a> kept following them with an army of fifteen thousand men, without, however, having the courage to get close to the enemy. <br />At that time also, earthquakes of extraordinary severity occurred many times during the winter season, both in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and in other places, always at night. And the inhabitants of these cities, supposing that they would be overwhelmed, fell into great fear, yet no harm befell them as a result of the earthquakes. <br />Then it was, too, that the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> rose above eighteen cubits and flooded all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> with water , and yet in the region of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/257326PThe class=place long=32.641 lat=25.684>Thebes</a>, which is higher upstream, the waters settled and receded at the appointed time and gave opportunity to the inhabitants of that district both to sow the land and to attend to their other tasks just as they were accustomed to do. But as for the country below, after the water had first covered the surface, it did not recede, but remained in the way throughout the time of sowing, a thing which had never happened before in all time; and there were places where the water, even after receding, moved in again not long afterwards. Thus it came about that all the seeds, such as had been put into the ground in the interval, rotted. And by this strange occurrence the people were reduced to dire straits, while most of the animals died through lack of sustenance. <br />It was at that time also that the whale, which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=ethnic long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantines</a> called <a href=/people/12258 target=_blank>Porphyrius</a>, was caught. This whale had been annoying <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and the towns about it for fifty years, not continuously, however, but disappearing sometimes for a rather long interval. And it sank many boats and terrified the passengers of many others, driving them from their course and carrying them off to great distances. It had consequently become a matter of concern to the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> to capture this creature, but he was unable by any device to accomplish his purpose. <br />But I shall explain how it came to be captured in the present instance. It happened that while a deep calm prevailed over the sea, a very large number of <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphins</a> gathered close to the mouth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Euxine</a> Sea. And suddenly they saw the <a href=/people/12258 target=_blank>whale</a> and fled wherever each one could, but the most of them came in near the mouth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411306WSan class=place long=30.645 lat=41.109>Sangarius</a>. Meanwhile the whale succeeded in capturing some of them, which he swallowed forthwith. And then, either still impelled by hunger or by a contentious spirit, it continued the pursuit no less than before, until, without noticing it, it had itself come very close to the land. There it ran upon some very deep mud, and, though it struggled and exerted itself to the utmost to get out of it as quickly as possible, it still was utterly unable to escape from this shoal, but sank still deeper in the mud. Now when this was reported among all the people who dwelt round about, they straightway rushed upon the <a href=/people/12258 target=_blank>whale</a>, and though they hacked at it most persistently with axes on all sides, even so they did not kill it, but they dragged it up with some heavy ropes. And they placed it on waggons and found its length to be about thirty cubits, and its breadth ten. Then after forming several groups and dividing it accordingly, some ate the flesh immediately, while others decided to cure the portion which fell to them. <br />Now the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=ethnic long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantines</a>, observing the earthquakes and learning the circumstances of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>'s rise and the capture of this whale, began straightway to prophesy that such and such things would take place, according to the taste of each. For men are wont, when present events baffle them, to utter awesome prophecies of the future, and, distracted by occurrences which trouble them, to infer, with no good reason, what the future will bring forth. But as for me, I shall leave to others prophecies and explanations of marvels; still, I know well that the lingering of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> on the fields did prove a cause of great calamities at that time at any rate, while the disappearance of the <a href=/people/12258 target=_blank>whale</a>, on the other hand, unquestionably provided an escape from many troubles. However, some say that it was not the same whale that I mentioned, but another one that was captured. But I shall return to the point where I made the digression from my narrative. <br /><a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, after accomplishing what has been recounted, learning that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in the fortress near Rusciane were beginning to feel the want of provisions, thought that he would capture them very quickly if they should be unable to bring in any supplies, and so he made camp close to the town and settled down for a siege. And the winter drew to a close and the thirteenth year ended in this war, [548 a.d] the history of which <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> has written.</p>                        </div>

[548 A.D.] Meanwhile the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who were being held under siege in the fortress near Rusciane, hard pressed, as they were, by the lack of necessary supplies, opened negotiations with the enemy and agreed that precisely at the middle of the summer season they would hand over the fortress, unless some relief came to them in the interval, on condition, however, that they should all remain free from harm. <br />Now there were in this fortress many notables of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>, among whom was Deopheron the brother of Tullianus, while the Roman army was represented by three hundred <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=demonym long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrian</a> horsemen whom John had stationed in that place, appointing as commanders over them Chalazar the guardsman, a <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagete</a> by birth and an especially able warrior, and Gudilas the Thracian; and there were also a hundred infantry sent by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> to guard the fortress. <br />At that time also the soldiers who had been detailed by <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> for the garrison of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> killed their commander <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a>, bnnging against him the charge of trafficking in grain and the other pro visions to their detriment. And they sent some of the priests as envoys, firmly declaring that if the emperor did not exonerate them from guilt for this deed and remit to them within a specified time the back payment which the state owed them, they would without the slightest hesitation go over to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. And the emperor fulfilled their request. <br /><a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> now summoned John to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a> and, together with him and <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> and other commanders, he gathered a great fleet and sailed straight for Rusciane with all speed, being intent upon bringing relief to the besieged. And those in the fortress, seeing this fleet from their elevated position, revived their hopes and now decided not to yield to the enemy, although the day upon which they had agreed was already close at hand. First then a terrific storm came on, and for this reason and also because the coast there is altogether without harbours, the ships came to be scattered far apart from one another; thus it came about that considerable time was wasted. And when they had been collected in the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391171PCro class=place long=17.129 lat=39.081>Croton</a>, they put out a second time for Rusciane. But when the barbarians saw them, they leaped upon their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and came down to the beach, intending to prevent the disembarkation of their enemy. And <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> placed them for a great distance along the shore face to face with the prows of the ship, some with spears and some with bows ready strung. This array struck terror to the hearts of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> when they saw it and they had not the courage to come close, but they first stopped their ships at a great distance and remained quiet for some time, and then, giving up the landing in despair, they all backed off and put to sea and sailed once more into the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391171PCro class=place long=17.129 lat=39.081>Croton</a>. <br />There, after taking council together, they decided that it was better that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> should proceed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and there set matters in order as well as possible and bring in provisions, while John and <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> should first disembark the men and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> on the shore and then march overland into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a>, in order to throw into confusion those of the barbarians who were besieging the strongholds in that region. For they entertained the hope that <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> would be led by such moves to abandon the siege and follow them. Accordingly, John, for his part, accompanied by his troops, a thousand in number, carried out this plan; but <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>, fearing the danger, went around through the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a> with the ships and sailed straight for Ancon. For he thought that he could in this way reach <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a> with safety and unite -with John. But even so <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> was unwilling to abandon the siege, but, while he himself remained settled there, he selected two thousand horsemen from the army and sent them into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a>, in order to unite with the barbarians there and throw back the forces of John and <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>. <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who were besieged in the fortress at Rusciane, seeing that their provisions had now completely failed them and that they had no further hope of assistance from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, sent Gudilas the guardsman and Deopheron the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=person long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and opened negotiations concerning their safety, begging him to pardon them for their deeds. And <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> promised that he would inflict punishment upon no one except Chalazar, seeing that he had disregarded the previous agreement, but he would remit the charge against all the others. On such terms he in person took over the fortress. And he cut off both the hands of Chalazar and his private parts and then killed him immediately; as for the soldiers, he ordered those who wished to do so to remain, keeping their own possessions, on condition that they array themselves thereafter with the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> on terms of complete equality; indeed this was the same procedure which he had regularly followed when the other strongholds were captured; those, on the other hand, who were not at all satisfied to remain, he commanded to depart from there and go without equipment wherever they pleased, in order that no man in the world might march unwillingly under his standard. Thus, while eighty of the Roman army abandoned their possessions and came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391171PCro class=place long=17.129 lat=39.081>Croton</a>, the rest remained where they were with their possessions. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>, however, he deprived of all their property, though he left their persons entirely unharmed. <br />When Antonina, the wife of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> after the decease of the empress, she begged the emperor to summon her husband thither. This she accomplished very readily. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> war was now pressing the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> to the utmost, and influenced him to this decision.</p>                        </div>

And I shall now set forth how these men came to undertake this plot and the manner in which they were frustrated and never came to the accomplishment of their purpose. <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a>, after slaying the tyrant <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>, as told in the preceding narrative, conceived an immoderate desire to take to wife the emperor's niece Preiecta, who was betrothed to him. Now she, too, desired this very ardently, not that she was led to this by love for the man, but because she acknowledged a heavy debt of gratitude to him, seeing that he had not only avenged the murder of her husband <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a>, but had also rescued and snatched her from peril when she was a captive and destined after no long time to become the unwilling consort of the tyrant <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a>. Since, then, both wanted this, <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> sent Preiecta to the emperor, while he himself though appointed to the post of General of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, invented sundry untruthful pretexts to induce the emperor to summon him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. For he was led on to do this by the hope of this marriage, which suggested to him many blessings that would flow from the union and, in particular, that he would thereafter not be far from the throne. For when men lay hold upon prosperity unexpectedly, their minds cannot remain stable, but in their hopes they ever keep going forward, until they are deprived even of the felicity that has been undeservedly theirs. <br />However, the emperor fulfilled his request and summoned <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, while he appointed in his place another General of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=person long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, as has been related above. Now when <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, the common people admired him for his achievements and loved him for his other qualities For he was both tall of stature and handsome, of a noble character and little given to speech. And the emperor had honoured him in a very unusual manner. For he had appointed him general of the troops in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and commander of the foederati, as well as clothing him with the dignity of consul. <br />But as for Preiecta, <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> was quite unable to marry her. For he had already a wife who was a relative of his and had been married to him from childhood. This wife he had, for his part, repudiated long before, doubtless because one of those causes had developed such as lead to the estrangement of man and wife. She, for her part, as long as the affairs of <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> were not prosperous, had remained at home without causing any trouble, bearing her lot in silence. But when <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> had now become illustrious by his deeds and great by his good fortune, the woman could no longer bear her dishonour and came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, There, making herself a suppliant of the empress, she demanded the right to take back her husband. Whereupon the empress, whose nature always led her to assist unfortunate women, decided to force <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> to accept her as his wife, although he rebelled violently, while John the son of <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> and nephew of <a href=/people/4562 target=_blank>Hypatius</a> made Preiecta his wedded wife. This calamity <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> did not bear lightly, but he became furious and said that one who had served the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> so well . . . was now refused permission to lead in marriage the woman to whom he was betrothed and who shared with him a common desire to consummate the marriage, but he was, on the contrary, compelled for ever to share the couch of the one woman in the world most hateful to him — a situation which is bound inevitably to harass a man's soul. Consequently, a little later, as soon as the empress had passed from the world, he, without further ado, promptly and joyfully sent this wife away. <br />Now it happened that Germanus, who was nephew to the emperor, had a brother named Boraides. This Boraides, then, brother of Germanus, had recently died, leaving the most of his property to his brother and nephews. And though he had a wife and one daughter, he directed that the daughter should have only as much as the law required. Because of this, the emperor chose to champion the daughter's cause, an act which irritated Germanus exceedingly.</p>                        </div>

There was also a certain <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> by birth and one of the <a href=/people/2721 target=_blank>Arsacidae</a>, related to <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> by blood. This man had been detected not long before this in an attempt to harm the state, and he had been clearly convicted of treason, since he was negotiating with <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=person long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> king, to stir up trouble for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. But the emperor did him no further harm than to beat his back with not many blows and parade him through the city mounted on a <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camel</a>; however, he did him no injury in either his person or his property, nor did he even penalize him by exile. But <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a> was nevertheless incensed at what had taken place, and began to devise treacherous plans against both <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> and the state. And when he saw that <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a>, as his kinsman, was sharing his vexation, he began to stir him up still more, and, gaining the man's attention by crafty speeches, he ceased not day nor night to upbraid him, rebuking him for having been both courageous and faint-hearted out of season. For he had, on the one hand, given proof of his nobility of spirit in his attitude toward the misfortunes of others, in that he had put an end to the tyranny; indeed, though <a href=/people/12054 target=_blank>Gontharis</a> was his friend and his host, he had laid hold of him with his own hand and slain him under no compulsion whatever. But at the present juncture, he said, he was utterly cowed, and he continued to sit there without a spark of manhood, though his fatherland was kept under strictest guard and exhausted by unwonted taxes, his father had been slain on the pretext of a treaty and covenant, and his whole family had been enslaved and was kept scattered to every corner of the Roman empire. <br />But in spite of these facts <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> thought it sufficient for him to be a general of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and merely bear the name of consul.  And you, he said, do not share my sorrow in the least, though I am your kinsman and have suffered outrageous treatment, while I, for my part, pity you, my dear fellow, for the fortune you have suffered in the case of both those women, not only the one you have been cheated of wrongfully but also the other with whom you have been compelled to live. And yet it ill becomes anyone who has even a little spirit in him to refuse to undertake the murder of <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, nor should he hesitate nor entertain any fear, — a man who always sits unguarded in some lobby to a late hour of the night, eagerly unrolling the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> scriptures in company with priests who are at the extremity of old age. Furthermore, he continued, not one of the kinsmen of <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> will oppose you. Indeed the most powerful of them all, Germanus, will, I believe, assist you with all his heart and his sons as well, seeing that they are young men and consequently boiling with fury against him; and I am in hopes that these men will actually carry through the enterprise of their own accord. <br />For they have already suffered injustice at his hand such as neither we nor anyone else among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a> has suffered. By such speeches <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a> ever sought to cast a spell over <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a>, and as soon as ever he saw him beginning to yield, he carried the matter to another Persarmenian, Chanaranges by name. Now this Chanaranges was a young man who, though comely of person, was not a man of serious character, but childish to an extraordinary degree. <br />So when <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a> had brought him and <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> into mutual agreement, both in their thinking and in their speaking, he departed, promising to make Germanus and his sons of the same mind with them in regard to the undertaking. Now Justinus, the elder of the sons of Germanus, was a youth wearing his first beard, but an energetic fellow and unusually keen in action; indeed, as a result of these qualities, he had actually risen to the dignity of the consular chair not long before. Accordingly, <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a> approached him and said that he wished to speak with him secretly in some sanctuary. When they had both entered the church, <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a> first required Justinus to affirm on oath that he would never report their conversation to any man in the whole world, except his father alone. And after the man had sworn to this effect, he took him to task, because, on the one hand, he, a very close relative of the emperor, saw other men holding the offices of the state, common plebeian fellows with no claim to such distinction, while he himself, on the other hand, though he was now of such age that he was entitled to manage his own affairs, paid no heed to the fact that not only he himself, but also his father, and that, too, in spite of his high achievements, and his brother <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> had to sit for ever in the place of private citizens. Nay more, he had not even been allowed to enter into the property of his uncle, to which he and no other had been heir as far as concerned the purpose of Boraides, but the greater part of it had been unjustly wrested from him. Still it was probable that they would be still further humiliated forthwith, as soon as <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> should arrive from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>; for he was reported to be already somewhere in the heart of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>. After such an introduction <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a> sought to impel the youth to take part in the plot against the emperor, disclosing to him the agreement reached between himself, <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> and Chanaranges in regard to this business. Upon hearing this Justinus was greatly agitated and his head swam, but he told <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a> flatly that neither he himself nor his father Germanus could ever do these things. <br />Then, while <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a> reported to <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> what had happened, Justinus referred the whole matter to his father. He thereupon conferred with <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>, the commander of the palace guards, and they took the question under consideration whether it was advisable for them to report this matter to the emperor. Now this <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> was a man of very great dignity who observed silence in most matters, neither doing anything for the sake of money nor tolerating buffoonery in word or deed nor taking any pleasure in other forms of relaxation, but always living a kind of austere life to which pleasure was strange; but at the same time he was scrupulous in his observance of justice and a most ardent lover of truth. So he naturally would not on that occasion allow the report to be carried to the emperor. For as for you, he said, it is inexpedient that you should carry information of this thing. For if you should wish to say anything to the emperor in secret, <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> and his friends will straightway become suspicious that the matter has been denounced, and, if perchance <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a> is able to escape unnoticed, the charge will remain unproved. And I, on the other hand, am not at all accustomed either to believe myself or to report to the emperor anything which I have not thoroughly verified. It is my desire, consequently, either that I hear the words with my own ears or that one of my intimates, by your contriving, hear the man saying something unmistakably clear about these matters. When Germanus heard this, he bade his son Justinus arrange that the requirement of <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> should be carried out. He, however, was no longer able to say anything about this matter to <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a>, since he had, as stated above, given him a flat refusal. Still he did enquire of Chanaranges whether <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a> had recently approached him at the suggestion of <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a>. For I, he said, should never have had the courage to entrust any of my secrets to him, seeing he is such a man as he is. But if you should be willing yourself to tell me something to the point, we could, by deliberating in common, perhaps accomplish something really worth while. Chanaranges then conferred with <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> about this and reported to Justinus each and every thing which <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a> had previously told him. <br />Then, since Justinus agreed both to carry out everything himself and to bring his father to agreement with them, it was decided that Chanaranges should meet Germanus in conference, and a definite day was appointed for the interview. Germanus reported this to <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> and requested him to provide them one of his intimates who should hear with his own ears the words of Chanaranges. And he provided <a href=/people/972 target=_blank>Leontius</a>, the son-in-law of <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a>, a man who had strict regard for justice and thoroughly capable of speaking the truth. This man Germanus introduced into his house and placed in a room where a thick curtain had been hung to conceal the couch on which he was accustomed to dine. And he hid <a href=/people/972 target=_blank>Leontius</a> inside this curtain, while he himself with his son Justinus remained outside. When Chanaranges came there, <a href=/people/972 target=_blank>Leontius</a> clearly heard him say everything which he, <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a>, and <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a> had planned. Among these things this too was mentioned, that, if they killed the emperor while <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was still on the way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, their purpose would not be advanced at all; for, though they might wish to establish Germanus on the throne, it was probable that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> would gather a vast army from the towns of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, and they would be unable by any device to repulse the man when he came against them in this way. It would consequently be necessary to postpone the execution of the plan until <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> should be present, but as soon as the man should reach <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and should be closeted with the emperor in the palace, then, at some time late in the evening, they should go there unexpectedly, armed with daggers, and kill <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> and <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> as well as the emperor. For such a course of action would enable them thereafter to make such dispositions as they wished without fear. <br />Even when <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> learned this from <a href=/people/972 target=_blank>Leontius</a>, he could not as yet make up his mind to report the matter to the emperor, being, as he was, still very reluctant to act, lest by excessive haste he should doom <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> on imperfect evidence. Germanus, however, revealed everything to Bouzes and <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantianus</a>, fearing, as actually happened, that some suspicion would attach to him as a result of the delay. <br />Many days later, when word came that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was now close at hand, <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> reported the whole matter to the emperor, who immediately commanded <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> and his associates to be taken off to prison, entrusting to some of his officers the duty of torturing them. And when the whole conspiracy had now come to light and was clearly set down in writing, the emperor called a session of all the members of the senate in the palace, where they are accustomed to make their decisions regarding matters in dispute. <br />When they had read over everything which had been stated by the men under examination, they nevertheless sought to involve Germanus and his son Justinus in the accusation, until Germanus, by presenting the testimony of <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> and <a href=/people/972 target=_blank>Leontius</a>. succeeded in clearing himself of the suspicion. For these men, as well as <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantianus</a> and Bouzes, declared under oath that Germanus had concealed from them nothing whatever as far as concerned these matters, but that everythintr had happened as I have just related. The senators, consequently, straightway acquitted both him and his son unanimously as having committed no offence against the state. <br />But when all had gone within to the emperor's apartment, the emperor himself, who had become violently angry, began to complain and to speak with the greatest bitterness against Germanus, blaming him for the tardiness of his disclosure, and two of the officials, courting his favour, agreed with his opinion and seemed to share his displeasure In this way they greatly increased the emperor's anger, eager as they were to be complacent to him in matters involving other men's misfortunes. But the others, cowed by fear, remained silent, yielding to him by not opposing his wish; <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> alone, however, by speaking with plain directness succeeded in saving the man. For taking the blame upon himself and speaking with all the emphasis in his power, he said that Germanus, for his part, had told him most seasonably what was going on, but that he himself, making a very careful and detailed investigation, had reported the matter more deliberately. And in this way he allayed the emperor's anger. So <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> won for himself great renown from this incident among all men, as one who in a moment of the gravest peril shewed his sterling quality. And the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> removed <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> from the office he held, but he did him no harm, nor in fact any one of the others, beyond keeping them all under guard without dishonour — in the palace, however, not in the public prison.</p>                        </div>

Thus, though the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had been at first decisively victorious in the Gothic war, as I have previously said, the final result for them was that not only had they consumed money and lives in prodigal fashion to no advantage, but they had also lost <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> besides, and had to look on while practically all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> were being ravaged and destroyed in a pitiable manner by the barbarians, seeing they had now become their neighbours. And it came about as follows. <br />The <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had at the beginning of this war given to the Germans all of Gaul which was subject to them, believing that they could never be able to array themselves against both nations, as has been said by me in the previous narrative.p This act the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were not only unable to prevent, but the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> even encouraged it, in order that no obstacle might confront him through having these particular barbarians roused to war (for the Franks never considered that their possession of Gaul was secure except when the emperor had put the seal of his approval upon their title). And consequently the rulers of the Germans occupied <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433054PMas class=place long=5.36 lat=43.3>Massilia</a>, the colony of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387268UPho class=place long=26.7532 lat=38.6704>Phocaea</a>, and all the seacoast towns and gained control of that part of the sea. So as gentlemen of leisure they view the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> races at Arelatum, and also make a golden coin from the product of the mines in Gaul, not stamping the likeness of the Roman emperor on this stater, as is customary, but their own likeness. And yet, while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> king is accustomed to make silver coinage as he likes, still it is not considered right either for him or for any other sovereign in the whole barbarian world to imprint his own likeness on a gold stater, and that, too, though he has gold in his own kingdom; for they are unable to tender such a coin to those with whom they transact business, even though the parties concerned in the transaction happen to be barbarians. Thus, then, had matters proceeded as regards the Franks. <br />When the arms of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> had gained the upper hand in the war, the Franks assumed control of the largest part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/457120REne class=place long=12.01 lat=45.7>Venetia</a> with no right at all, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, for their part, being unable to ward them off any longer, and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> being unable to carry on the war against the two peoples. <br />Meanwhile the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> held the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450196USir class=place long=19.6102 lat=44.9666>Sirmium</a> * and practically all the cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=place long=25 lat=44.5>Dacia</a>, having taken possession of them at the moment the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> took them away from the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>; and they not only enslaved the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> of that region, but they were also constantly moving forward, plundering and doing violence to the Roman territory. <br />Consequently the emperor was no longer giving them the contributions which it had long been customary for them to receive from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. Now the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> had bestowed upon the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/470150RNor class=place long=15 lat=47>Noricum</a> and the strongholds of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=place long=19 lat=45>Pannonia</a>, as well as many other towns and a very great amount of money. It was because of this that the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> departed from their ancestral homes and settled on the south side of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> River, not far from the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a>. They then, in their turn, plundered the population of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> as far as the boundaries of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413194PEpi class=place long=19.4449 lat=41.3164>Epidamnus</a>. taking captives; and since some of the captives escaped and succeeded in getting back to their homes, these barbarians, on the ground that they were at peace with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, went about through the Roman domain, and whenever they recognized any of the escaped captives there, they laid hold of them as if they were their own slaves who had run away, and, dragging them from their parents, carried them off with them to their own homes, no one opposing them. Other towns of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=place long=25 lat=44.5>Dacia</a> also, about the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/448205USin class=place long=20.4504 lat=44.8235>Singidunum</a>, had been taken over by the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> as a gift from the emperor, and here they are settled at the present time, overrunning and plundering <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> and the Thracian towns very generally. Some of them have even become Roman soldiers serving among the foederati, as they are called. So whenever envoys of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> are sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, representing the very men who are plundering Roman subjects, they collect all their contributions from the emperor without the least difficulty and carry them off home.</p>                        </div>

But later on the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> and the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a>, having come to be neighbours, became exceedingly hostile toward one another. <br />And they were extremely enthusiastic in their desire to fight each other, so that each nation was eager to do battle with the enemy, and a fixed time had been determined upon for the encounter. But the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a>, thinking that they alone by their own strength would never be a match for the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> in battle (for they were, in fact, outnumbered by their enemy), decided to invite the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> to an alliance. Accordingly they sent envoys to the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> begging him to send them an ai-my. And when the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> learned this, they too sent envoys to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> to present the same request. Now the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> were ruled at that time by Thorisin, and the others by Adouin. So the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> decided indeed to hear the statement of each of them, but he did not wish them to come at the same time, but to appear before him separately. First the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> came into the emperor's presence and spoke as follows. <br />We, for our part, O Emperor, have been astounded at the outrageous conduct of the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a>, seeing that, although they have already perpetrated crimes both many and great against your rea.lm, as we all know, they have now come before you to offer you, in fact, the greatest possible insult. For they, and they only, can be said to put the utmost insult upon their neighbours, who imagine that these are so very easily deceived that they come to them with the intention of profiting by the simplicity of those very men whom they have already wronged. Now we ask you to give careful consideration to one matter only, the question namely as to what attitude the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> assume toward their friends. For thus you could with the greatest certainty assure the welfare of the Roman empire, since men are always able to infer safely from previous events what the future will bring forth. If, now, it were true that the nation of the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> had displayed their ingratitude only to some other people, it would have been necessary for us to occupy much time with a long speech and to bring in testimony from outside, in striving to demonstrate the base character of the men; but as it is, we are enabled to choose an example near at hand from your own experience. <br />This is what we would have you consider: the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> formerly held the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=place long=25 lat=44.5>Dacia</a> as a tributary province, while all the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> dwelt originally on the other side of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, being in such mortal terror of the Gothic power, on the one hand, that they never succeeded in crossing the stream, or even attempting it, while they were, on the other hand, on terras of close alliance and friendship with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and every year they received from the former emperors many gifts in the name of friendship, and indeed they have received them from thee in no less generous measure. We should be glad then to ask these gentlemen what good thing they have done for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in return for these benefits. <br />But they would not be able to mention one such thing, great or small. Now as long as they had no means of doing you wrong, they remained quiet, not because of any conviction on their part, but because they were compelled by lack of opportunity to do so. For you, on your part, did not seek to lay any claim to the country beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, while the fear inspired by the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> always frightened them from the land on this side. But who indeed would call impotence gratitude ? And what assurance of friendship could be based on inability to commit an offence? <br />None, O Emperor, none; these things cannot be. For opportunity alone reveals the nature of a man, bringing out his character to the common gaze of all because of his freedom to act. For behold, at the very moment the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> saw that the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had been driven from all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=place long=25 lat=44.5>Dacia</a>, while you, on your part, were busily engaged in fighting your enemies, the cursed wretches have dared to trespass upon your land in every part. <br />How could anyone adequately depict in words the outrageous nature of their action? Did they not heap contempt upon the Roman empire? Did they not break the bonds of both treaty and alliance ? Did they not insult those whom they should never have treated thus? Did they not do violence to an empire whose slaves they would crave the privilege of being should you find any leisure to deal with them ? The <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a>, O Emperor, are holding <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450196USir class=place long=19.6102 lat=44.9666>Sirmium</a> and enslaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and they make the boast that they are in possession of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=place long=25 lat=44.5>Dacia</a>. Yet what war have they ever won fighting in your behalf, or with you, or against you ? Or what struggle do they consider has brought them this land as a prize? And in spite of all this, they have often been in your pay and have been receiving their payments, as previously stated, for we know not how long a time. And yet there has never been in all time an act more despicable than this present embassy of theirs. For as soon as they saw that we were eager to make war on them, they had the hardihood to come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and appear before the emperor who has been so grievously insulted by them. In sooth they will, perhaps, in their excess of shamelessness, invite you to form an alliance of arms against us who have been so favoured by you. And verily if they have come with the purpose of giving back what they have usurped without any right, the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> should be counted by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> most responsible for that benefit, if they are really constrained through fear of them unwillingly to change their course and manifest gratitude late in the day. For naturally he who creates the constraint will be thanked by him who receives the benefit. But if indeed they have decided even now to retreat from none of their usurped holdings, what could surpass such baseness? <br />This then shall be our plea, expressed with barbarian simplicity, with scant words, and in no way worthily of the situation. But we beg that thou, O Emperor, after carefully weighing what we have said less adequately than the facts deserve, take that course of action which will redound to the benefit both of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and of the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a>, thy people, calling to mind this, in addition to all other considerations, that while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> will justly take sides with us, seeing that we have been in agreement from the first as regards religion, they will stand in opposition to our opponents for the simple reason that they are Arians. Thus spoke the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a>. On the following day the envoys of the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> in turn came before the emperor and spoke as follows: It may fairly be expected, O Emperor, that those who approach a neighbouring state with a request to form an alliance of arms, should first demonstrate that they have come with a just request and with proposals of advantage to those who are to form the alliance, and then speak on the matters of which they have come to treat. In the first place, then, that we have been wronged by the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> is evident from the facts themselves; for we are eager to settle our difficulties by arbitration, and those who are bent on arbitration can have nothing to do with violence. In the second place, why should one, in order to prove that the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> are far superior to the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> both in multitude and in valour, address long speeches to those who know. Now the policy of entering a conflict on the side of the weaker contestant and thus getting into an evil plight which has been foreseen, though the opportunity is offered of having the victory without danger by arraying oneself with the more powerful contestant, is not one, we think, which any men gifted with even a little discretion would choose. <br />Consequently you also will find, when you go forth against another enemy, that the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> hereafter will array themselves with you, thus paying a debt of gratitude for what you have done, and by their overwhelming power helping you in all probability to achieve the overmastery of your foes. Furthermore, it would be in point for you to consider this fact also, that while the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> have become friends of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> on the spur of the moment, the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> have been in alliance with you and well known to you from ancient times. And friendship cemented by long continuance is not easily dissolved. Consequently you will acquire not only powerful, but also steadfast, allies. These, then, are the just grounds on the basis of which we invite you to form this alliance. <br /> Now observe what manner of men the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> are. At first they absolutely refused to settle our differences by arbitration, though we invited them repeatedly to do so, overcome, as they were, by unreasoning boldness. But now that the war has come almost to an actual engagement, they, making a tardy retreat from their position because they realize fully their own weakness, have come to you, asking the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> to take up the unjust struggle in their behalf. Doubtless these thieves bring up the case of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450196USir class=place long=19.6102 lat=44.9666>Sirmium</a> and a few other towns in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=place long=25 lat=44.5>Dacia</a>, and put this forward as a pretext on which you may enter this war. And yet thy empire comprises such an overabundance both of cities and of lands that thou art actually searching for men upon whom thou couldst confer some part of it for their habitation. Indeed thou hast bestowed upon the Franks and the nation of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> and these <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> such generous gifts of both cities and lands, O Emperor, that no one could enumerate them all. But we, emboldened by thy friendship, have accomplished that which thou didst wish , and truly, when a man has formed the purpose of parting with some one of his possessions, he thinks far less highly of one who waits to receive his gift than of one who anticipates his purpose and takes the gift by his own decision, provided such an one does not appear to have claimed the right to take this course in a spirit of insolence toward the possessor, but in a spirit of confidence in the strong friendship he feels toward him; and this is exactly the attitude of the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> toward the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. We ask you, then, to recall these things and, preferably, to observe the terms of our alliance by throwing all your strength into the conflict on our side against the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> , otherwise, to stand aside for both. For in reaching such a decision you are acting with justice and greatly to the advantage of the Roman empire. Such was the speech of the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a>, whom the Emperor Justini-an, after long deliberation, decided to send away with their mission unaccomplished; but he made a sworn alliance of arms with the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a>, and then sent them more than ten thousand horsemen commanded by <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantianus</a>, Bouzes, and Aratius. Associated with them also was John the nephew of Vitalian, who had received previous instructions from the emperor that, as soon as they should fight a decisive battle with the nation of the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a>, he should hasten thence to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> with his troops. For he, too, as it happened, had returned from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. They also took with them as allies fifteen hundred <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>, commanded by Philemuth and others. For, except for these, the whole nation of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>,to the number of three thousand, were arrayed with the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a>, since they had revolted from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> not long before for a cause which I have set forth above. <br />Now a detachment of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who were marching to join the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> as allies unexpectedly chanced upon some of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> with Aordus, the brother of their ruler. And a fierce battle ensued in which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were victorious, and they slew both Aordus and many of the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a>. <br />Then the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a>, upon learning that the Roman army was close at hand, straightway settled their disagreement with the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a>, and so these barbarians made a treaty of peace with each other, contrary to the will of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. When the Roman army learned this, they found themselves  involved in a very perplexing situation. For neither were they able to continue their advance nor could they retrace their steps, because the generals feared lest both <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> and <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Eruli</a> would overrun and plunder the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>. At any rate, they remained there and reported their situation to the emperor. Such was the course of these events. But I shall return to the point in my narrative from which I strayed.</p>                        </div>

As a result of this the enemy, having now little to fear, had enslaved <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and everything else, practically speaking. It was on this occasion also that he abandoned <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a>, the leading city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscia</a>, though it was very closely besieged; indeed it was captured by storm while he was still on his way. After reaching <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> he took up a permanent residence there, having now amassed a great fortune and being greatly admired because of his earlier successes, just as the Deity had foretold to him by an unmistakable sign before he made the expedition to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. <br />Now the sign was as follows. <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had an inherited property in the suburb of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> which is called Panteichion, and is situated on the opposite mainland. On this property, shortly before the time when <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was about to lead the Roman army against <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, it so happened that his vines bore a great abundance of grapes. And with the wine thus produced his servants had filled a great quantity of jars, which they placed in the wine-cellar, burying the lower part of them in the earth and smearing the upper part carefully with clay. But eight months later the wine in some jars, as it began to ferment, burst the clay with which each of them had been sealed; then it ran over the tops of the jars and, flowing copiously, covered the ground around with such a flood that it actually formed a great pool on the floor there. When the servants saw this, they were filled with amazement; and they were able to fill many amphoras from it, after which they again stopped up those same jars with clay and remained silent about the matter. <br />But when they had seen this happen many times at about the same date, they did report the matter to their master, and he, for his part, gathered many of his friends there and displayed the phenomenon; whereupon they foretold that many blessings would fall upon that house, basing their conclusion upon this sign. <br />Such was the fortune of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. But Vigilius, the chief priest of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, together with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a> who were in the city at that time (and there were many very notable men there), was giving the emperor no respite from his entreaty to stand forth with all his power as champion of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. But <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> was influenced most of all by Gothigus, a man of patrician rank who had long before this time risen to the dignity of the consular office; for he, too, had recently come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> for this very purpose. <br />Now although the emperor did promise to concern himself personally with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, still he was devoting his time for the most part to the doctrines of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, seeking eagerly and with great determination to make a satisfactory settlement of the questions disputed among them. <br />Such was the situation in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. Meanwhile one of the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> had fled to the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> for the following reason. When Vaces was ruler of the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a>, he had a nephew named Risiulfus, who, according to the law, would be called to the royal power whenever Vaces should die. So Vaces, seeking to make provision that the kingdom should be conferred upon his own son, brought an unjustified accusation against Risiulfus and penalized the man svith banishment. He then departed from his home with a few friends and fled immediately to the Varni, leaving behind him two children. But Vaces bribed these barbarians to kill Risiulfus. As for the children of Risiulfus, one of them died of disease, while the other, Ildiges by name, fled to the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a>. <br />Now not long after this Vaces fell sick and passed from the world, and the rule of the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> fell to Valdarus, the son of Vaces. But since he was very young, Auduin was appointed regent over him and administered the government. And since he possessed great power as a result of this, he himself seized the rule after no long time, the child having immediately passed from the world by a natural death. Now when the war arose between the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> and the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a>, as already told, Ildiges went straight to the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> taking with him not only those of the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> who had followed him, but also many of the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a>, and the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> were in hopes of restoring him to the kingdom. But on account of the treaty which had now been made with the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a>, Auduin straightway requested the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a>, as friends, to surrender Ildiges; they, however, refused absolutely to give up the man, but they did order him to depart from their country and save himself wherever he wished. He, then, without delay, took with him his followers and some volunteers of the <a href=/people/12116 target=_blank>Gepaedes</a> and came back to the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a>. And departing from there, he went to join <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, having with him an army of not less than six thousand men. Upon his arrival in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/457120REne class=place long=12.01 lat=45.7>Venetia</a>, he encountered some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> commanded by Lazarus, and engaging with them he routed the force and killed many. He did not, however, unite with the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, but recrossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> River and withdrew once more to the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a>. <br />While these events were taking place in the manner described, one of the guardsmen of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, Indulf by name and of barbarian birth, a passionate and energetic fellow, who had been left in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, went over to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> for no good reason. And <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> straightway sent him with a large army and a fleet to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a>. So he came to the place called Mouicurum, which is a coast town situated very near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435165USal class=place long=16.4834 lat=43.5397>Salones</a>, and at first, being a Roman and a member of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>' suite, he mingled with the people of the town; then however he raised his own sword, urged his followers to do the same, and suddenly killed them all. Then, taking all the valuables as plunder, he departed from there and descended upon another fortress situated on the coast, which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call Laureate. Here he entered the town and slew those who fell in his way. <br />When Claudian, who was commander of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435165USal class=place long=16.4834 lat=43.5397>Salones</a> at that time, learned this, he sent an army against him on dromones, as they are called. And when this force reached Laureate, they engaged with the enemy. But they were overwhelmingly defeated in the battle and took to flight, wherever each man could, abandoning their ships in the harbour. And it so happened that the other boats were there laden with grain and other provisions. All these Indulf and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> captured, and, after killing all whom they met and making plunder of the valuables, they returned to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>. And the winter drew to a close and the fourteenth year ended in this war, the history of which <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> has written.</p>                        </div>

Consequently a long time was consumed in the blockade. For the besieged, on their part, shewed themselves, thanks to their extraordinary valour, a match for the entire Gothic army, while <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> was ever keeping a strict watch that no one should approach the wall to damage it; furthermore, he sowed grain in all parts of the city inside the circuit-wall and so brought it about that they had not the least shortage of food. Many times indeed the barbarians attempted to storm the fortifications and make trial of the circuitwall, but they were always repulsed, being driven back from the wall by the valour of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. <br />They did, however, capture <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123HPor class=place long=12.2585 lat=41.7792>Portus</a>, and thereafter held <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> under close siege. Such was the course of these events. <br />As soon as the emperor saw <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, he began to make plans for sending another commander with an army against the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>. And if he had actually carried out this idea, I believe that, with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> still under his power, and the soldiers in the city saved for him and enabled to unite with the relieving force from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, he would have overcome his opponents in the war. But in fact, after first selecting <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a>, one of the patricians from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and ordering him to make himself ready, he later, perhaps because some other business claimed his attention, lost interest in the matter. <br />After the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> had continued for a long time, some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> who were keeping guard at the gate which bears the name of Paul the Apostle — men nursing a grievance because for many years nothing had been paid them by the emperor, and observing, at the same time, that those <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> who had previously surrendered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had become the proud possessors of vast sums of money — very secretly opened negotiations with <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and agreed to hand over the city, and a definite day was appointed for the transaction. So when the appointed day was come. <br /><a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> contrived the following plan. He launched in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> River during the first watch of the night two long boats, placing on them men who understood the use of the trumpet. These he commanded to row straight across the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, and when they came close to the circuit-wall to sound the trumpets there with all their might. Meanwhile he himself was holding the Gothic army in readiness close to the above-mentioned gate which bears the name of the Apostle Paul, unobserved by his enemy. <br />And reasoning that, if any of the Roman army should succeed in escaping from the city, as they well might under cover of darkness, they would go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421118UCCe class=place long=11.7921 lat=42.091>Centumcellae</a>, for no other fortress was left to them anywhere among the towns of that region, he decided to guard the road leading thither by means of some ambuscades of warlike men, to whom he gave instructions to destroy the fugitives. So the men in the boats, upon getting near the city, immediately made use of their trumpets, as they had been instructed to do. Thereupon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were thunderstruck, and falling into great fear and confusion suddenly abandoned for no sufficient reason their several posts and hastened on the run to give assistance at that point, supposing that the attempt was directed against that part of the wall. Thus the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> who were betraying the city remained alone at their post, and they opened the gates at their leisure and received the enemy into the city. <br />And there was great slaughter of those who fell into the hands of the enemy there, though many made off in flight through other gates, but those who went toward <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421118UCCe class=place long=11.7921 lat=42.091>Centumcellae</a> got into the ambuscades and perished. However, a few of them did escape with difficulty, <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> too, they say, being among them and securing his safety though wounded. <br />Now there was in the Roman army one named <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a>, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=demonym long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilician</a> by birth, who at first had been in charge of the household of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, but later went with the army to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> in command of a cavalry troop, and had been appointed with <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> to command the garrison of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. This <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a>, during the capture of the city at that time, rushed with four hundred horsemen into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125GHad class=place long=12.4664 lat=41.9026>Tomb</a> of <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> and seized the bridge leading to the church of the Apostle Peter. And while it was still dawn and a little daylight was about to appear, the Gothic army assailed these men, but they withstood their enemy most vigorously where they were and gained the upper hand; indeed they slew large numbers of the barbarians, seeing they were in a great throng and huddled together. When <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> saw this, he stopped the fighting immediately, and commanded the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> quietly to blockade their enemy, thinking that he would capture the men by starvation. Consequently <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> and the four hundred passed that day without food, and bivouacked during the night in the same condition. On the following day, however, they resolved to use some of the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> for food, but a feeling of reluctance owing to the unusual nature of this food prevented them until late afternoon, although exceedingly hard pressed by hunger. At that time, after long deliberation among themselves, and after exhorting one another to boldness, they came to the conclusion that the better course for them was to end their lives then and there by a glorious death. In fact their decision was to make a sudden rush upon their enemy, to kill as many of them as each man could, aud thus each and every one of them to meet his death valiantly. Accordingly they rushed suddenly into each other's arms, and kissing one another's cheeks held their friends in a last embrace on the point of death, intending one and all to perish forthwith. <br />But <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, observing this, began to fear that men who were setting their faces toward death, having now no further hope as regards safety, would inflict irreparable harm upon the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. He therefore sent to them and offered them a choice of two alternatives, either to leave their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and arms there, take an oath not again to fight against the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, and thus to depart for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> without experiencing any harm, or, on the other hand, to keep their own possessions and fight thereafter in the Gothic army, enjoying full and complete equality with the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. These proposals were heard gladly by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. And at first, to be sure, all were for choosing to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, but later, being ashamed to make their withdrawal on foot and without arms, and dreading also that they would fall into some ambuscades on the homeward journey and thus be destroyed, and bearing a grudge, furthermore, because the Roman State owed them pay for a long period, they all mingled voluntarily with the Gothic army, except indeed that <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> and one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a>, Mindes by name, came before <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and prayed him to send them to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. For they stated that they had children and wives in their native land, and apart from these they were unable to live. And <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> received the request of these men with favour, believing that they were speaking the truth, and he released them after presenting them with travelling money and sending an escort with them. There were others also of the Roman army, those, namely, who had chanced to take refuge in the sanctuaries of the city, about three hundred in number, who received pledges and went over to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>. As for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> itself, <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> was unwilling thereafter either to dismantle or to abandon it: instead he decided to establish in residence there both <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, not only members of the senate, but also all the others, for the following reason.</p>                        </div>

But the Frankish king spurned the request, declaring that <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> neither was nor ever would be king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, seeing that after capturing <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> he had been utterly unable to hold it, but after tearing down a portion of it had let it fall again into the hands of his enemy. Consequently he made haste on the present occasion to convey supplies into the city, and gave orders to rebuild as quickly as possible everything which he himself had pulled down and destroyed by fire when he captured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> at the previous time; then he summoned the members of the Roman senate and all the others whom he had under guard in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>. And after witnessing the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>-races there, he made ready his whole army, intending to make an expedition against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. At the same time too he put his four hundred war-ships in readiness for sea-fighting, as well as a very considerable fleet of large ships which had been sent thither from the East by the emperor, and which he, during all this time, had had the fortune to capture with both crews and cargoes. He; also sent a Roman named <a href=/people/309 target=_blank>Stephanus</a> as an envoy to the emperor, requesting him to put an end to this war and make a treaty with the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, with the understanding that they should fight as his allies when he should go against his other enemies. But the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> would not permit the envoy even to come into his presence, nor did he pay the least attention to anything he said. <br />When <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> heard this, he again set about making preparations for the war. And it seemed to him advisable first to make trial of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421118UCCe class=place long=11.7921 lat=42.091>Centumcellae</a> and then to proceed against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. Now the garrison there was at that time commanded by <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>, the guardsman of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, and he had a sufficient force under him. So the Gothic army, upon reaching <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421118UCCe class=place long=11.7921 lat=42.091>Centumcellae</a>, made camp close to the circuit-wall and commenced a siege. And <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> sent envoys to <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> and challenged him and his soldiers, if it was their wish to reach a decision by battle with the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, to fall to with all speed. He also advised them to entertain no hope whatever that further reinforcements from the emperor would reach them: for <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, he said, was unable longer to carry on this war against the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, if anyone could base a reasonable judgment upon those things which had taken place at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> for such a long period. He accordingly offered them the privilege of choosing whichever of two alternatives they wished, either to mingle with the Gothic army on terms of complete equality, or to depart from the city without suffering harm and betake themselves to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> declared that it was not their wish either to fight a decisive battle or, on the other hand, to mingle with the Gothic army, because they would find it impossible to live apart from their children and their wives. And as for the city over which they were keeping guard, they were quite unable for the present to surrender it with any plausible excuse, since they had, in fact, not even a pretext for doing so at that time, particularly if they wished to present themselves before the emperor; they did, however, beg him to defer the matter for a time, in order that they might during that interval report the situation to the emperor, and in case no relief should come to them from him in the meantime, that then finally they might quit the city; thus they would surrender the city to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, while they, for their part, would not be without justification in leaving it. This was approved by <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>. and a definite day was agreed upon; then thirty men were given as hostages by each side to make this agreement binding, and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> broke up the siege and proceeded on the way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. <br />But when they came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=place long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a>, they did not cross the strait there until they had made trial of the fortress of that city. Now the garrison there was commanded by Thurimuth and <a href=/people/7767 target=_blank>Himerius</a>, whom <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had appointed to that post. And since they had under them a large force of excellent men, they not only repulsed the enemy when he attacked the wall, but also made a sally and gained the advantage in combat. Later, however, since they were far outnumbered by their opponents, they were shut up inside the circuit-wall and remained quiet. So <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> left a portion of the Gothic army there to guard the place, expecting that at a later time they would capture the Roman garrison through failure of the food supply; meanwhile he sent an army against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a> and took over the fortress there with no difficulty; likewise the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> whom he had left in the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a> also took the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a> at that time; for it was betrayed to them. <br />When the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> heard this, he formed the purpose of appointing his nephew Germanus commander-in-chief to carry on the war against the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, and he directed him to make ready. Now when the report of this reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> became very deeply concerned; for the reputation of Germanus happened to be a favourable one among all men. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, on the other hand, straightway became confident one and all, and the soldiers of the emperor's army began to meet danger and hardship much more courageously. But the emperor for some unknown reason changed his mind and decided to appoint to the post <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a>, a Roman whom I have mentioned in the preceding narrative, in place of Germanus. And <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a> did in fact make preparations with all possible speed, and it was expected that he would sail away immediately with an army. But again the emperor changed his mind, and consequently he too remained quiet. It was at this time that <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> with a band of excellent warriors whom he had gathered about him came to an engagement not far from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> with the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> who were in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a>, and he not only lost many of his followers but was also killed himself after shewing himself a brave man in the encounter.</p>                        </div>

Now the one section of them contained eighteen hundred men, while the other comprised the remainder. And although the two sections were thus separated from each other, the commanders of the Roman army, upon engaging with them, both in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, were defeated unexpectedly, and some of them were killed on the field of battle, while others saved themselves by a disorderly flight. <br />Now after all the generals had fared thus at the hands of the two barbarian armies, though they were far inferior to the Roman forces in number, one section of the enemy engaged with Asbadus. This man was a guard of the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, since he served among the candidati as they are called, and he was also commander of the cavalry cohorts which from ancient times have been stationed at Tzurullum, the fortress in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, a numerous body of the best troops. These too the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a> routed with no trouble, and they slew the most of them in a most disgraceful flight; they also captured Asbadus and for the moment made him a prisoner, but afterwards they burned him by casting him into a fire, having first flayed strips from the man's back. Having accomplished these things, they turned to plunder all the towns, both of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> and of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, in comparative security; and both armies captured many fortresses by siege, though they neither had any previous experience in attacking city walls, noi had they dared to come down to the open plain, since these barbarians had never, in fact, even attempted to overrun the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. <br />Indeed it appears that they have never in all time crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> River with an army before the occasion which I have mentioned above. <br />Then those who had defeated Asbadus plundered everything in order as far as the sea and captured by storm a city on the coast named Topirus,- though it had a garrison of soldiers; this is the first of the coast towns of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> and is twelve days' journey distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. And they captured it in the following manner. The most of them concealed themselves in the rough ground which lay before the fortifications, while some few went near the gate which is toward the east and began to harass the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> at the battlements. Then the soldiers keeping guard there, supposing that they were no more than those who were seen, immediately seized their arms and one and all sallied forth against them. Whereupon the barbarians began to withdraw to the rear, making it appear to their assailants that they were moving off in retreat because they were thoroughly frightened by them; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, being drawn into the pursuit, found themselves at a considerable distance from the fortifications. Then the men in ambush rose from their hiding-places and, placing themselves behind the pursuers, made it no longer possible for them to enter the city. Furthermore, those who had seemed to be in flight turned about, and thus the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> now came to be exposed to attack on two sides. Then the barbarians, after destroying these to the last man, assaulted the fortifications. But the inhabitants of the city, deprived as they were of the support of the soldiers, found themselves in a very difficult situation, yet even so they warded off the assailants as well as the circumstances permitted. And at first they resisted successfully by heating oil and pitch till it was very hot and pouring it down on those who were attacking the wall, and the whole population joined in hurling stones upon them and thus came not very far from rejecting the danger. But finally the barbarians overwhelmed them by the multitude of their missiles and forced them to abandon the battlements, whereupon they placed ladders against the fortifications and so captured the city by storm. Then they slew all the men immediately, to the number of fifteen thousand, took all the valuables as plunder, and reduced the children and women to slavery. Before this, however, they had spared no age, but both these aud the other group, since the time when they fell upon the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, had been killing all who fell in their way, young and old alike, so that the whole land inhabited by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> came to be everywhere filled with unburied corpses. <br />Now they killed their victims, not with sword nor spear, nor in any other accustomed manner, but by planting very firmly in the earth stakes which they had made exceedingly sharp, and seating the poor wretches upon these with great violence, driving the point of the stake between the buttocks and forcing it up into the intestines; thus did they see fit to destroy them. These barbarians also had a way of planting four thick stakes very deep in the ground, and after binding the feet and hands of the captives to these they would then assiduously beat them over the head with clubs, killing them like <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> or <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> or any other animal. Others again they would imprison in their huts together with their <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>— those, of course, which they were utterly unable to take with them to their native haunts — and then they would set fire to the huts without mercy. Thus did the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a> consistently destroy those who fell in their way. But from this time onward both these and those of the other group, being as it were drunk with the great quantity of blood they had shed, saw fit to make prisoners of some who fell into their hands, and consequently they were taking with them countless thousands of prisoners when they all departed on the homeward way.</p>                        </div>

But he went back into the city and remained quiet, attending to the guarding of the place. The <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, however, since no one came out against them, plundered practically the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> besieged in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=place long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a>, commanded by Thurimuth and <a href=/people/7767 target=_blank>Himerius</a>, as I have said, seeing their provisions had failed completely, came to terms and surrendered themselves and the fortress to the enemy. <br />When the emperor heard of these things, he gathered a fleet and embarked on these ships a very considerable army formed from infantry detachments, and appointing <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a> commander over them, ordered him to sail with all speed for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, and to put forth all his power to save the island. <br />But he very speedily repented having appointed <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a> commander of the fleet; for he was an extremely old man and without experience in deeds of war. Then he absolved <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> from all the charges against him, and appointing him General of the forces in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> straightway sent him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, providing him with an army of no great size but instructing him to take over the fleet commanded by <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a>. since he was summoning <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. But as commander-in-chief in the war against <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> he appointed Germanus, his own nephew. To him he gave an army of no great size, but he provided him with a considerable amount of money and directed him to gather a very formidable army from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> and then to set forth with great speed for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. And he further instructed him to take with him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> both Philemuth the <a href=/people/9356 target=_blank>Erulian</a> with his troops and his own son-in-law John the nephew of Vitalian; for John, as General of the forces in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, was stationed there. <br />Then a great ambition took possession of Germanus to achieve for himself the overthrow of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, in order that it might be his fortune to recover for the Roman empire both <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. For in the case of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, at any rate, he had been sent there by the emperor at the time when Stotzas had established his tyranny and was already holding the power of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> most securely, and he had exceeded all expectations by defeating the rebels in battle, put an end to the tyranny, and once more recovered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> for the Roman empire, as I have recounted in the preceding narrative. And now that the affairs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> had come to such a pass as I have just described, he naturally wished to win for himself great glory in that field, by showing himself able to recover this too for the emperor. Now his first move, made possible by the fact that his wife, who was named Passara, had died long before, was to marry Matasuntha, the daughter of <a href=/people/12065 target=_blank>Amalasuntha</a> and granddaughter of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>, since <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vittigis</a> had already passed from the world. For he cherished the hope that, if the woman should be with him in the army, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> would probably be ashamed to take up arms against her, calling to mind the rule of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a> and Atalaric. Then, by expending great suras of money, part of which was provided by the emperor, but most of which he furnished unstintingly from his own resources, he easily succeeded, contrary to expectation, in raising a great army of very warlike men in a short space of time. <br />For among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, on the one hand, the experienced fighters in many cases ignored the officers to whom they belonged as spearmen and guards and followed Germanus; these came not only from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, but also from the towns of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> as well, his sons Justinus and <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> having displayed great zeal in this matter — for he had taken them also on his departure. He also enrolled some from the cavalry detachments which were stationed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, with the emperor's permission. The barbarians also, on the other hand, who had their homes near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> River kept coming in great numbers, attracted by the fame of Germanus, and, upon receiving large sums of money, these mingled with the Roman army. And other barbarians too kept flocking to his standard, collected from the whole world. Furthermore, the ruler of the <a href=/people/12059 target=_blank>Lombards</a> made ready a thousand heavy-armed soldiers and promised to send them right speedily. <br />When these things were reported in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, with such additions as rumour customarily makes as it spreads among men, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were both frightened and perplexed at the same time, being faced, as they were, with the necessity of making war upon the race of <a href=/people/12050 target=_blank>Theoderic</a>. But those Roman soldiers who chanced to be fighting unwillingly in the ranks of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> sent a messenger to Germanus with orders to state to him that, as soon as they should see him arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and his army actually encamped, they too without any hesitation would certainly array themselves with his troops. All these things brought fresh courage to the detachments of the emperor's army in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> and whatever other cities chanced to be left in their hands, and being now filled with the highest hopes they were determined to guard the towns rigorously for the emperor. Nay, more, all those who under <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a> or other commanders had previously engaged with the enemy and had escaped after being defeated in battle by their opponents, and were now dispersed and wandering about, each man wherever chance led him, all these, as soon as they heard that Germanus was on the way, gathered in a body in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450139RHis class=place long=13.9 lat=45>Istria</a>, and there remained quiet, awaiting this army. <br />Just at this time <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421118UCCe class=place long=11.7921 lat=42.091>Centumcellae</a> (for the time agreed upon by him and <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> as touching this town had arrived), and commanded <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> to surrender the city in accordance with the agreement. <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>, however, said that he personally no longer had authority to do this; for he had heard that Germanus had been appointed commander-in-chief to carry on that war, and was not far away with his army. And he added that, in regard to the hostages, it was his desire to receive back, on the one hand, their own, and, on the other, to return those furnished by the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. Then, after dismissing the messengers, he turned his attention to the defence of the city, expecting Germanus and the army with him. Such was the course of these events; and the winter drew to its close, and the fifteenth year ended in this war, the history of which <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> has written.</p>                        </div>

Now some few of these had scattered from their army and, wandering about the country there alone, were captured by certain of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and made prisoners; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> questioned them as to why this particular army of the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a> had crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> and what they had in mind to accomplish. And they stoutly declared that they had come with the intention of capturing by siege both <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=place long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonice</a> itself and the cities around it. When the emperor heard this, he was greatly agitated and straightway wrote to Germanus directing him to postpone for the moment his expedition to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and defend <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=place long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonice</a> and the other cities, and to repel the invasion of the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a> with all his power. So Germanus, for his part, was devoting himself to this problem. <br />But the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a>, upon learning definitely from their captives that Germanus was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427233USer class=place long=23.3283 lat=42.6975>Sardice</a>, began to be afraid; for Germanus had a great reputation among these particular barbarians for the following reason. During the reign of <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, the uncle of Germanus, the Antae, who dwell close to the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a>, had crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> River with a great army and invaded the Roman domain. Now the emperor had not long before this, as it happened, appointed Germanus General of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>. He accordingly engaged with the hostile army, defeated them decisively in battle, and killed practically all of them; and Germanus, as a result of this achievement, had covered himself with great glory in the estimation of all men, including these same barbarians. <br />Consequently, on account of their dread of him, as I have said, and also because they supposed that he was conducting a very formidable force, seeing that he was being sent by the emperor against <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a> immediately turned aside from their march on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=place long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonice</a> and no longer dared to descend to the plain, but they crossed over all the mountain ranges of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> and so came into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a>. Germanus, accordingly, paid no further attention to them and issued orders to the entire army to prepare for marching, intending to commence the journey thence to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> two days later. <br />But by some chance it so befell that he was taken sick and abruptly reached the term of life. Thus did Germanus suddenly pass away, a man endowed with the finest qualities and remarkable for his activity; for in war, on the one hand, he was not only a most able general, but was also resourceful and independent in action, while in peace and prosperity, on the other hand, he well understood how to uphold with all firmness both the laws and the institutions of the state. As a judge he was conspicuously upright, while in private life he made loans of large sums of money to all who requested it, never so much as speaking of taking interest from them. <br />Both in the palace and in the market-place he was a man of very impressive personality and exceedingly serious demeanour, while in his daily home life he was a pleasant, open-hearted, and charming host. <br />He would not permit, as far as his strength allowed, any offence in the palace against established laws, nor did he ever share either in the purpose or in the conversations of the conspirators in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, though many even of those in power went so far in their unnatural conduct. Such then was the course of these events. <br />The emperor was deeply moved by this misfortune, and commanded John, the nephew of Vitalian and son-in-law of Germanus, in company with <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, one of the two sons of Germanus, to lead this army into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. So they set out on the way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a>, intending to pass the winter in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435165USal class=place long=16.4834 lat=43.5397>Salones</a>, since it seemed to them impossible at that season to make the circuit of the gulf, as they would be obliged to do in travelling into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>; for it was impossible for them to ferry across since they had no ships. Meanwhile <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a>, not having as yet learned anything of the emperor's change of purpose regarding the fleet he commanded, put in at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a> while it was under siege by the enemy. And he forced his way through the barbarian lines, sailed into the harbour, and so got inside the fortifications with the whole fleet. Now <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> not long after this reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382206IKep class=place long=20.59 lat=38.2>Cephallenia</a>, and finding that <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a> and his army had already put out to sea and departed thence on the way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, he immediately set out from there and crossed the so-called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421170WAdr class=place long=16.95 lat=42.09>Adriatic</a> Sea. But when he came near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=place long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabria</a>, he was assailed by a terrific storm and a head wind of extraordinary violence, and it so fell out that all the ships were scattered so completely that it appeared that the most of them had been driven on the shore of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=place long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabria</a> and fallen into the hands of the enemy. This, however, was not the case, but they had first been driven apart by the great violence of the wind, then had turned about, heavily buffeted meanwhile by the sea, and had reached the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a> again. As for the other ships, some were lost and some were saved, according to where chance carried them. But one ship, that in which <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> himself was sailing, had its mast broken off in this heavy sea, and yet, after coming to such a degree of danger, was carried by the surge and followed the swell until it came to land at the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/359144IMel class=place long=14.44 lat=35.88>Melita</a>. Thus did it come about contrary to expectation that <a href=/people/12056 target=_blank>Artabanes</a> was saved. <br /><a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a> now found himself unable to make sallies against the besiegers or to fight a decisive battle against them, while at the same time their provisions could not possibly suffice for any considerable time, seeing they were a large force, and so he set sail from there with his troops, and, eluding the enemy, withdrew to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381134UPan class=place long=13.363 lat=38.118>Panormus</a>. <br /><a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, meanwhile, had plundered practically the whole land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>; they had collected as booty a vast number of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and other animals, and had stripped the island of grain and all its other crops; these, together with all the treasure, which amounted to a great sum indeed, they loaded on their ships, and then suddenly abandoned the island and returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, being impelled to do so for the following reason. Not long before this, as it happened, <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> had appointed one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, Spinus by name, a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spolitium</a>, to be his personal adviser. This man was staying in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375151PCat class=place long=15.0881 lat=37.503>Catana</a>, which was an un walled town. And, by some chance, it came about that he fell into the hands of the enemy there. Now <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, being eager to rescue this man, wished to release to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in his stead a notable's wife who was his prisoner. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> would not consent to accept a woman in exchange for a man holding the position of quaestor, as it is called. The man consequently became fearful that he would be destroyed while in hostile hands, and so promised the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> that he would Modern Meleda, persuade <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> to depart immediately from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and cross over to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> with the whole Gothic army. <br />So they first bound him over by oaths to carry out this promise and then gave him up to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, receiving the woman in return. He then went before <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and asserted that the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were not consulting their own interests, now that they had plundered practically the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, in remaining there for a few insignificant fortresses. For he declared that he had recently heard, while he was among the enemy, that Germanus, the emperor's nephew, had passed from the world, and that John, his son-in-law, and <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, his son, with the whole array collected by Germanus were already in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a> and would move on from there, after completing their preparations in the briefest time, straight for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=place long=8.3 lat=44.3>Liguria</a>, in order, obviously, to descend suddenly upon the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and make slaves of their women and children and to plunder all their valuables; and it would be better for the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, he said, to be there to meet them, passing the winter meanwhile in safety in company with their families. <br />For, he went on, if we overcome that army, it will be possible for us at the opening of spring to renew our operations against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> free from anxiety and with no thought of an enemy in our minds. <br /><a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> was convinced by this suggestion, and so, leaving guards in four strongholds, he himself, taking with him the entire booty, crossed over with all the rest of the army to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. Such was the course of these events. <br />Now John and the emperor's army, upon reaching <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a>, decided to pass the winter in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435165USal class=place long=16.4834 lat=43.5397>Salones</a>, purposing to march from there straight for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> after the winter season. But the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a> now reappeared, both those who had previously come into the emperor's land, as I have recounted above, ind others who had crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> not long afterwards and joined the first, and they began to overrun the Roman domain with complete freedom. <br />And some indeed entertained the suspicion that <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> had bribed these very barbarians with large gifts of money and so set them upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> there, with the definite purpose of making it impossible for the emperor to manage the war against the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> well because of his preoccupation with these barbarians. But as to whether the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a> were conferring a favour upon <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, or whether they came there without invitation, I am unable to say. These barbarians did, in any case, divide themselves into three groups and wrought irreparable damage in all Europe, not merely plundering that country by sudden raids, but actually spending the winter as if in their own land and having no fear of the enemy. Afterwards, however, the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> sent a very considerable army against them, which was led by a number of commanders, including <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantianus</a>, Aratius, Nazares, Justinus the son of Germanus and John who bore the epithet of the Glutton. <br />But he placed in supreme command over them all Scholasticus, one of the eunuchs of the palace. <br />This army came upon a part of the barbarians near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417266PHad class=place long=26.559 lat=41.678>Adrianopolis</a>, which is situated in the interior of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, five days' journey distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. <br />And the barbarians were unable to proceed further; for they were taking with them a booty which surpassed all reckoning, consisting of men and animals and valuables of every description. So they remained there, eager to come to an engagement with the enemy, but without letting this be known to them in any way. Now the <a href=/people/12176 target=_blank>Sclaveni</a> were encamped on the hill which rises there, while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were in the plain not far away. And since a long time was consumed in thus blocking the enemy, the soldiers began to be resentful and made a great to-do, laying against the generals the charge that while they themselves, as commanders of the Roman army, had all provisions in abundance, they were paying no heed to the soldiers, to whom the want of absolute necessities was causing hardship and who were unwilling to engage with the enemy. By these remonstrances the generals were compelled to join battle with the enemy. And the battle which followed was a fierce one, but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were decisively vanquished. In that battle many of the best soldiers perished, and the generals came within a little of falling into the hands of the enemy, succeeding only with difficulty in making their escape with the remnant of the army and thus saving themselves, each as best he could. The standard of <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantianus</a> was also captured by the barbarians, who now moved forward heedless of the Roman army. And they plundered the land of Astica, as it is called, without let or hindrance, a place which had not been ravaged since ancient times, and for this reason it turned out that they found there an enormous booty. Thus they devastated a wide expanse of country and came as far as the long walls, which are a little more than one day's journey distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. But not long afterwards the Roman army, in following up these barbarians, came upon a portion of their force, engaged with them suddenly, and turned them to flight. And they not only slew many of the enemy, but also rescued a vast number of Roman captives, and they also found and recovered the standard of <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantianus</a>. But the rest of the barbarians departed on the homeward way with the other booty.</p>                        </div>

For after my writings had appeared before the public, I was no longer able to add to each the events which happened afterwards, but all the later developments in these wars, and in the war against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> as well, now that I have published the previous parts, will be written down in full in this present narrative, and thus the record which I shall make of these events will of necessity be composite. <br />Now all that took place up to the fourth year of the five-year truce which was made between the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> has already been recounted by me in the previous books.

In command of this army was a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, Chorianes by name, a man of wide experience in many wars, and a large number of barbarians of the tribe of the <a href=/people/2232 target=_blank>Alani</a> followed him as allies. When this army had come to a part of <a href=/people/9676 target=_blank>Lazica</a>, which is called Mocheresis, they made camp in a suitable position and remained there. Now there is a river in that place, the Hippis, not a large or navigable stream, but actually passable for both horsemen and foot-soldiers, and it was on the right of this that they made their entrenchment, not along the bank, but at a considerable distance from it. </p>                        </div>

Some of these writers, for example, have stated that the territory of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410397PTra class=ethnic long=39.727 lat=40.999>Trapezuntines</a> is adjoined either by the Sani, who at the present day are called Tzani, or by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=ethnic long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchians</a>, calling another people <a href=/people/4580 target=_blank>Lazi</a>, who are actually addressed by this name at the present day. And yet neither of these statements is true. For, in the first place, the Tzani live at a very great distance from the coast as neighbours of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a> in the interior, and many mountains stand between, which are thoroughly impassable and altogether precipitous, and there is an extensive area always devoid of human habitation, canyons from which it is impossible to climb out, forested heights, and impassable chasms — all these prevent the Tzani from being on the sea. In the second place, it is impossible that the <a href=/people/4580 target=_blank>Lazi</a> should not be the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=ethnic long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchians</a>, because they inhabit the banks of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=place long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasis</a> River; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=ethnic long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchians</a> have merely changed their name at the present time to <a href=/people/4580 target=_blank>Lazi</a>, just as nations of men and many other things do. But apart from this, a long period of time has elapsed since these accounts were written, and has brought about constant changes along with the march of events, with the result that many of the conditions which formerly obtained have been replaced by new conditions, because of the migration of nations and successive changes of rulers and of names. These things it has seemed to me very necessary to investigate, not relating the mythological tales about them nor other antiquated material, nor even telling in what part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Euxine</a> Sea the poets say <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a> was bound (for I consider that history is very widely separated from mythology), but stating accurately and in order both the names of each of those places and the facts that apply to them at the present day.</p>                        </div>

It was somewhere in this part of <a href=/people/9676 target=_blank>Lazica</a>, as the inhabitants say, that the famous fleece was placed for safe keeping, that fleece on account of which, as the poets tell the tale, the <a href=/people/352 target=_blank>Argo</a> was fashioned. But in saying this they are, in my opinion, not telling the truth at all. For I think that <a href=/people/102 target=_blank>Jason</a> would not have eluded <a href=/people/320 target=_blank>Aeetes</a> and got away from there with the fleece in company with <a href=/people/165 target=_blank>Medea</a>, unless both the palace and the other dwellings of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=ethnic long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchians</a> had been separated by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=place long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasis</a> River from the place in which that fleece was lying; indeed the poets who have recorded the story imply that this was the case. So the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=place long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasis</a>, flowing as I have said, empties into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Euxine</a> Sea approximately at the very point where it comes to an end. Now at the one end of the crescent, that, namely, which is in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, was the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418418FPet class=place long=41.7538 lat=41.7681>Petra</a>, while on the opposite coast which forms a part of Europe the territory is held by the Apsilii; these Apsilii are subjects of the <a href=/people/4580 target=_blank>Lazi</a> and have been <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> from ancient times, just as all the other nations which I have mentioned up to this point in my narrative.</p>                        </div>

But it seems to me that those have spoken the truth about the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a> at any rate better than any others, who have stated that there never was a race of women endowed with the qualities of men and that human nature did not depart from its established norm in the mountains of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a> alone; but the fact was that barbarians from these regions together with their own women made an invasion of <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> with a great army, established a camp at the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412369WThe class=place long=36.942 lat=41.194>Thermodon</a>, and left their women there; then, while they themselves were overrunning the greater part of the land of <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, they were encountered by the inhabitants of the land and utterly destroyed, and not a man of them returned to the women's encampment; and thereafter these women, through fear of the people dwelling round about and constrained by the failure of their supplies, put on manly valour, not at all of their own will, and, taking up the equipment of arms and armour left by the men in the camp and arming themselves in excellent fashion with this, they made a display of manly valour, being driven to do so by sheer necessity, until they were all destroyed. That this is about what happened and that the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a> did make an expedition with their husbands, I too believe, basing my judgment on what has actually taken place in my time. For customs which are handed down to remote descendants give a picture of the character of former generations. I mean this, that on many occasions when <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a> have made raids into the Roman domain and have engaged in battle with those who encountered them, some, of course, have fallen there, and after the departure of the barbarians the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, in searching the bodies of the fallen have actually found women among them.

But they have suffered most cruelly at the hands of their rulers owing to the excessive avarice displayed by them. <br />For both their kings used to take such boys of this nation as they noted having comely features and fine bodies, and dragging them away from their parents without the least hesitation they would make them eunuchs and then sell them at high prices to any persons in Roman territory who wished to buy them. They also killed the fathers of these boys immediately, in order to prevent any of them from attempting at some time to exact vengeance from the king for the wrong done their boys, and also that there might be in the country no subjects suspected by the kings. And thus the physical beauty of their sons was resulting in their destruction; for the poor wretches were being destroyed through the misfortune of fatal comeliness in their children. And it was in consequence of this that the most of the eunuchs among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and particularly at the emperor's court, happened to be <a href=/people/12179 target=_blank>Abasgi</a> by birth. </p>                        </div>

These two sons, when their father oame to the end of his life, divided the power between them, and each gave his own name to his subjects; for the one group has been called Utigurs and the other Cutrigurs even to my time. All these now continued to live in this region, associating freely in all the business of life, but not mingling with the people who were settled on the other side of the lake and its outlet; for they never crossed these waters at any time nor did they suspect that they could be crossed, being fearful of that which was really easy, simply because they had never even attempted to cross them, and they remained utterly ignorant of the possibility. </p>                        </div>

These Tetraxitae were called also <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> in ancient times, because all the nations who held these regions are called in general <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, while a few of them had an additional designation such as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490315RSar class=ethnic long=31.5 lat=49>Sauromatae</a> or <a href=/people/12118 target=_blank>Melanchlaenae</a> or something else. <br />But as time went on, they say (if, indeed, the story is sound), some youths of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454367WBos class=ethnic long=36.66 lat=45.36>Cimmerians</a> were engaged in hunting, and a single doe which was fleeing before them leaped into these waters. And the youths, either moved by a thirst for glory or in some sort of competition, or perhaps it was really some deity which constrained them, followed after this doe and refused absolutely to let her go, until they came with her to the opposite shore. And then the quarry, whatever it was, immediately disappeared from sight; for in my opinion it appeared there for no other purpose than that evil might befall the barbarians who lived in that region. Thus, while the youths did fail in their hunt, they found an incentive to battle and plunder. For they returned as fast as they could to their own land, and thus made it clear to all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454367WBos class=ethnic long=36.66 lat=45.36>Cimmerians</a> that these waters could be crossed by them.

Yet the land on the left of this same sea is counted as a portion of <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>. But apart from this the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/473393WTan class=place long=39.336 lat=47.268>Tanais</a> rises in the so-called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/520255LRhi class=place long=25.5 lat=52>Rhipaean</a> mountains, which are in the land of Europe, as, in fact, those who have written of these matters from ancient times agree. Now the Ocean is very far removed from these <a about=https://topostext.org/place/520255LRhi class=place long=25.5 lat=52>Rhipaean</a> mountains; consequently all the land beyond them and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/473393WTan class=place long=39.336 lat=47.268>Tanais</a> River in both directions must necessarily be European. Just at what point, then, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/473393WTan class=place long=39.336 lat=47.268>Tanais</a> River begins to divide the two continents it is not easy to say.

For it flows in a direction opposite to that of the strait of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gadira</a>, and so passes between the two continents; for while the strait, coming out of the ocean and torming this sea, has these two continents, one on either side, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=place long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasis</a> River flows almost at the end of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Euxine</a> Sea and empties into the middle of the crescent, obviously continuing the division of the land heretofore made by the sea.

For the test is near at hand and vision can provide most satisfactory evidence, and I think no obstacle will be placed in the way of those eager to discover the truth. To proceed, then, <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal class=person long=27.4238 lat=37.0323>Halicarnassus</a> in the Fourth Book of his History says that the entire earth is one, but is considered to be divided into three parts, having three separate titles, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, and Europe.

But knowing as he did that some thought that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/473393WTan class=place long=39.336 lat=47.268>Tanais</a> River performed this function, he mentioned this view also afterwards. And it has seemed to me not inappropriate to insert in my narrative the actual language of <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>, which is as follows.  Nor am I able to conjecture for what reason it is that, though the earth is one, three names are applied to it which are women's names. And its lines of division have been established as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=demonym long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchian</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=place long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasis</a>.

For the phenomena which are exhibited in all straits appear to be susceptible of no explanation, nor has anyone ever shewn himself able to account for them. Indeed it was this question which led <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406238PSta class=person long=23.7946 lat=40.5918>Stagira</a>, a man prominent among all others as a philosopher, to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236PCha class=place long=23.6153 lat=38.4597>Chalcis</a> on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a>, where he observed the strait which they call <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236WEur class=place long=23.591 lat=38.465>Euripus</a> in an effort to discover by careful investigation the physical reason why it is and in what manner it comes about that sometimes the current of the strait flows from the west, but at other times from the east, and the sailing of all boats there is governed by this fact; whenever, for example, the current is running from the east and the mariners have begun to sail their boats from that direction following the inflow of the water, as they are accustomed to do, if then the current turns upon itself, a thing which is wont to happen there. On the upper part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411291WBos class=place long=29.0753 lat=41.1194>Bosporus</a>, many a time, it immediately turns these boats back in the direction from which they have started, while the other boats sail from the west to the opposite end, even though no wind has blown upon them in the least but deep calm prevails there with all winds absent; all this the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406238PSta class=demonym long=23.7946 lat=40.5918>Stagirite</a> observed and pondered for a long time, until he worried himself to death with anxious thought and so reached the term of his life. But this is not an isolated case, for in the strait also which separates <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> nature plays many strange tricks. For it appears that the current runs into this strait from the sea called the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421170WAdr class=place long=16.95 lat=42.09>Adriatic</a>, and this in spite of the fact that the forward movement of the sea takes place from the ocean and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gadira</a>. But there are also numerous whirlpools which appear there suddenly from no cause apparent to us and destroy the ships. It is on account of this that the poets say that the boats are gulped down by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382156WCha class=place long=15.606 lat=38.248>Charybdis</a>, when any chance to be in this strait at such a time. But the advocates of the second view think that all these exceedingly strange phenomena which present themselves in all straits come about in consequence of the two sides coming very close to each other; for the water, they say, being constrained by the limited space, is subject to some strange and unaccountable compulsion. </p>                        </div>

Consequently we shall be obliged because of this fact actually to despise the enemy as having been defeated in previous combats and having no such ground for courage as you have. For when the spirit has been humbled, it is by no means wont to mount again.

Those who built this city originally placed the foundations of the circuit-wall for the most part upon rock, but here and there they were allowed to rest upon earth. And there was such a portion of the wall on the west side of the city of no great extent, on either side of which they had constructed the foundations of the circuit-wall upon hard, unyielding rock. This was the portion which Dagisthaeus on the previous occasion and now <a href=/people/12057 target=_blank>Bessas</a> likewise undermined, the character of the ground not permitting them to go further, but quite naturally determining the length of the trench for them and controlling it naturally. </p>                        </div>

Filling the excavated space with gravel, they laid upon it heavy timbers which they had planed very thoroughly, making them entirely smooth, and then they bound them together so as to cover a wide space; these then they used as a base instead of foundation stones, and upon them they skilfully carried out the construction of the circuit-wall. This was not understood by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and they thought they were making their ditch under the foundations. But by excavating the entire space under the timbers which I have just mentioned and carrying their work across most of the ground they did succeed in damaging the wall seriously, and a portion of it had actually dropped down suddenly, but nevertheless this fallen part did not incline at all to either side nor was one of the courses of stone deranged, but the whole section descended intact in a direct line, as if let down by a machine, into the excavated space and stopped there, keeping its proper position, though not with the same height as before, but somewhat less.

At that time, accordingly, the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, by way of inviting those of the Sabiri who were friendly to him to a righting alliance, had sent a man who was to convey the money to them.

And though both nations have often been in need of this device throughout their history, in storming the walls of fortresses situated on any rough and difficult ground, yet not to a single one of them has come this idea which now occurred to these barbarians. Thus as time goes on human ingenuity is ever wont to keep pace with it by discovering new devices. For these Sabiri improvised a ram, not in the customary form, but using a new method which was their innovation. They did not put any beams into this engine, either upright or transverse, but they bound together some rather thick wands and fitted them in place everywhere instead of the beams; then they covered the entire engine with hides and so kept the shape of a ram, and hung a single beam by loose chains, as is customary, in the centre of the engine, and the head of this, having been made sharp and covered over with iron like the barb of a missile, was intended to deal repeated blows to the circuit-wall. And they made the engine so light that it was no longer necessary that it be dragged or pushed along by the men inside, but forty men, who were also destined to draw back the beam and thrust it forward against the wall, being inside the engine and concealed by the hides, could carry the ram upon their shoulders with no difficulty. </p>                        </div>

For though he was a man of more than seventy years and already well past his prime, he was the first to mount the ladder.

For it is not a manly thing to array oneself against the inevitable, nor a wise thing to refuse to bow to those who have won the mastery; nor, on the other hand, is it inglorious to live by falling in with the situation chance has brought. For man, in the grip of necessity which is relieved by no hope of rescue, is thereby justly acquitted of the charge of dishonour, even if he is involved in the most shameful actions; for evil, when it is unavoidable, is naturally followed by forgiveness. Do not, therefore, emulate madmen in the midst of obvious danger, and do not barter your safety for wanton folly, but rather call to mind that it is impossible for the dead to come to life, while the living can destroy themselves at a later time, if indeed this seems best. Make, then, your final deliberation and consider well your interests, recalling the fact that those decisions would be the best in which reversal shall still be within the power of those who have made the decision. For we on our part do pity you, though you are fighting against your own friends, and spare you when you are courting death, and we expect, as is customary for <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, to feel compassion for you though you throw life to the winds, and look upon it as a trivial matter. <br />And the result for you will be simply this, that by shifting your citizenship for the better you will have <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> instead of <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> as master; indeed we agree to give you pledges to make this promise binding. Do not then destroy yourselves when it is possible to be saved. For it is not a glorious thing to linger fondly in danger for no advantage whatsoever, since this is not playing the part of brave men, but simply courting death. But noble is he who steels himself to endure the most severe fortune, when he can anticipate from it some benefit. For men do not applaud voluntary death in a situation where even the surrounding danger gives ground for some stronger hope, but a useless destruction of life is downright folly, and senseless daring which leads to death, when held out as a pretence of high seriousness, merits no praise, at least in the judgment of thinking men. Furthermore, you are bound also to take into consideration that you may seem to be shewing some ingratitude toward <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a>. For if God wished to destroy you, my men, he would not, I think, have put you into the hands of those who are striving to preserve you. Seeing then that such is our stand in the matter, it will clearly be for you to decide what it is fitting should befall you. </p>                        </div>

The water which was being carried into the city he divided into three parts and had a very deep trench dug, in which he constructed three pipe-lines, one lying on the very bottom of this trench, and this he covered with mud and stones up to the middle of the trench; at that level he concealed the second pipe-line, and above it built the third, which was above ground and visible to all; so the piping was on three levels, but this fact was concealed. This the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> at the beginning of the siege did not understand, and so, after they had cut this obvious pipe-line, they did not carry forward their work on the trench, but gave up the labour before the next pipe-line was destroyed, and thought that the besieged were in want of water, their minds being deceived by their own slipshod methods. But as the siege was prolonged, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> by capturing some of the enemy learned that the besieged were drawing water from the aqueduct.

But although this was the feeling of practically all men, it actually fell out that this general met with the good fortune and displayed the valour which I have described. Thus it is that human affairs proceed not according to the judgment of men, but are subject to the power and authority of God, which men are wont to call fortune, knowing not why in the world events proceed in the manner in which they manifest themselves to them. For the name of fortune is wont to attach to that which appears to be contrary to reason. But as regards this matter, let each man think as he wishes.</p>                        </div>

Next he sent the Dolomites, as they are called, to the precipitous parts of the city, directing them to harass the enemy there with all their strength. These Dolomites are barbarians who live indeed in the middle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, but have never become subject to the king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>. For their abode is on sheer mountainsides which are altogether inaccessible, and so they have continued to be autonomous from ancient times down to the present day; but they always march with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> as mercenaries when they go against their enemies. And they are all footsoldiers, each man carrying a sword and shield and three javelins in his hand. But they shew extraordinary nimbleness in running over cliffs and peaks of mountains, just as on a level plain. For this reason Mermeroes assigned them to attack the wall there, while he with the rest of the army went against the lower gate, bringing up the rams and the elephants. So then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and Sabiri together, by shooting rapidly at the wall so that they filled the air round about it with their arrows, came not far from compelling the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> there to abandon the parapet.

Fellow-soldiers, you perceive the danger which is upon us and the necessity in which we are involved. But it is incumbent upon us not to yield in the least to these evils. For those who come into a situation where safety is despaired of could be saved only by not courting safety; for a fondness for life is wont in most cases to be followed by destruction. And you will be obliged to consider this fact also in our present stress, that by simply warding off the enemy from this parapet your safety will by no means be firmly established, even though we carry forward the struggle with the greatest zeal. For a battle which is waged between armies standing apart gives no one opportunity to shew himself a brave man, but the issue as a general thing is determined by chance. If, however, the conflict becomes a hand-to-hand struggle, enthusiasm will in most cases prevail, and victory will appear where valour lies. And apart from this, even in the case of success in the conflict, men fighting from the wall would reap no great benefit from this success, because, while they have for the moment succeeded in repulsing the enemy, the danger will again be acute on the morrow, and, on the other hand, if they fail even by a little, they are naturally destroyed along with their defences. But once having conquered their opponents in hand-to-hand combat they will thereafter have their safety assured. Let us then with these thoughts in mind advance against the enemy with all zeal, calling to our aid the assistance from above, and with our hopes raised high by that desperate situation which has now fallen to us. For God is ever wont to save those men above all others who find no hope of safety in themselves. </p>                        </div>

For though the season of the year was late autumn, there was a very remarkable period of drought and hot weather as in the middle of summer, so that a great quantity of roses actually came out, as if it were spring, differing in no way at all from ordinary roses. And practically all the trees brought forth new fruit again, while the clusters likewise appeared on the vines, although the vintage had already been gathered not many days before. From these things those that are clever in such matters drew sundry conclusions, saying that some great and unexpected thing would take place, some that it would be good and others the opposite. But I for my part think that this was the result of a sort of coincidence, the usual south winds having prevailed for a very long period, and great heat having consequently come upon the land beyond what is customary and not in keeping with the season. But if it really does, as they say, indicate that some unexpected event will happen, we shall know most certainly from the future outcome.</p>                        </div>

And he wrote the following letter to <a href=/people/12131 target=_blank>Gubazes</a>: Two things there are which harmonize the lives of men, power and wisdom. For some, who, by reason of their power, are superior to their neighbours, both live themselves according to their own desires and also never fail to lead where they wish those less powerful than themselves, while others, though enslaved to the stronger through their weakness, can still remedy their impotence by discretion, and by courting the powerful with flattery are still able to live with their own possessions, enjoying by means of their conciliatory attitude everything of which they are deprived by their weakness. And this does not hold only for some of the nations of men, while it is otherwise in other nations, but one might say that this is implanted in human experience universally in every part of the inhabited world like any other natural characteristic. Do you, accordingly, my dear <a href=/people/12131 target=_blank>Gubazes</a>, if you think you are going to overcome the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> in the war, neither hesitate nor let anything stand in your way. For you will find us in any part of <a href=/people/9676 target=_blank>Lazica</a> you may choose ready to meet your attack and prepared in battle-array to fight for this land with all our might; so that in waging a decisive struggle you will have the opportunity to display your valour against us. If, however, even you yourself realize that you are unable to array yourself against the might of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, then do you, good Sir, take the second alternative and ' know thyself,' and bow down before your master <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> as king and victor and lord. And beg that he be merciful to you in spite of your acts, in order that you may be able henceforth to escape the evils which harass you. For I personally promise that King <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> will be merciful to you and will give pledges, furnishing you as hostages sons of the notable rulers in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, that you will have your safety and your kingdom and everything else in security for all time. But if neither of these things meets your wish, do you at least go off to some other land and thus grant to the <a href=/people/4580 target=_blank>Lazi</a>, who have been reduced to wretchedness through your folly, recovery at length and respite from the difficulties which press upon them, and do not wish to inflict upon them this lingering destruction, being carried on by a deceptive hope, by which I mean assistance from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. For they will never be able to defend you, just as they have not been able up to the present day. Thus wrote Mermeroes.

For men as a general thing adapt their decisions to the dictates of their desire, and while, on the one hand, they incline toward the argument which pleases them and espouse all its consequences, not investigating to see whether it may be false, they, on the other hand, are outraged by the one which annoys them and they distrust it, never searching out to see whether it may not be true.</p>                        </div>

That wild beast, the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>, might, they say, possibly not be unable actually to change in some degree the colour of his fur, but his character he doth not transform, nature not permitting him to change this. This proverb, says Sandil, have I heard from my elders, who thus hinted at the ways of men by means of a dark saying. And I know something also which I have learned from experience, one of those things which it would be natural that a rough barbarian should learn: the shepherds take <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> when they are still suckling and rear them with no lack of care in the house, and the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> is an animal grateful to those who feed it and most mindful of kindness. Now this is obviously done by the shepherds with this purpose, that when the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a> attack the flock at any time, the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> may check their attacks, standing over the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> as guardians and saviours. And I think this takes place throughout the whole world. For no man in the world has at any time seen <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> attacking a flock nor <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a> defending it, but nature as a law-maker has established this as a kind of ordinance, as it were, for <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> and <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a>.

He, being eager to strengthen his kingdom, had made the sister of Theudibert, ruler of the Franks, his wedded wife. For his previous wife had died recently, having been the mother of one child, Radigis by name, whom she left to his father; and he sought a marriage for this child with a maiden born in Brittia, whose brother was then king of the nation of the Angili, and had given her a large sum of money because of his wooing. Now this man, while riding with the most notable of the Varni in a certain place, saw a bird sitting in a tree and croaking loudly. And whether he really comprehended the bird's voice, or, possessing some other knowledge, simply made a mysterious pretence of comprehending the bird's as prophecy he at any rate immediately told those with him that he would die forty days later. For this, he said, was revealed to him by the pronouncement of the bird. Now I, he said, making provision that you should live most securely and at your ease, have related myself with the Franks by taking from their country the wife who is now my consort, and I have bestowed Brittia upon my son by betrothal. But now, since I expect to die very shortly, and, as far as this wife is concerned, I am without issue male or female, and my son furthermore is still unwed and without his bride, come now, let me communicate my thought to you, and, if it should seem to you not without some profit, do you, as soon as I reach the term of my life, put upon it the seal of your approval and execute it. I think, then, that it will be more to the advantage of the Varni to make the alliance by marriage with the Franks than with the islanders. For the men of Brittia, on the one hand, are not even able to join forces with you except after a long and difficult journey, while the Varni and Franks, on the other hand, have only vonder water of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> between them, so that they, being very close neighbours to you, and having achieved an enormous power, have the means ready at hand both to help you and to harm you whenever they wish; and they will undoubtedly harm you if the said marriage alliance shall not prevent them. For men naturally find a neighlwuring state's power, when it surpasses their own, grievous and a most ready cause of injustice, for a powerful neighbour may with comparative ease secure causes of war against his neighbours who are doing no wrong. <br />Since, then, the facts are these, let the island girl who has been wooed for this boy be given up by you, and all the money which she has received from us lor this purpose, let her retain as remuneration for the indignity, as the common law of mankind has it; but let my son Radigis be married to his own stepmother thenceforth, just as our ancestral law permits us. </p>                        </div>

But when the betrothed of Radigis learned this, she could not bear the indignity of her position and undertook to secure revenge upon him for his insult to her. For so highly is virtue regarded among those barbarians, that when merely the name of marriage has been mentioned among them, though the fact has not been accomplished, the woman is considered to have lost her maidenhood. First, then, she sent an embassy to him of some of her kinsmen and inquired for what reason he had insulted her, though she had neither been unfaithful nor done him any other wrong.

Now when this was approved by the girl, and Radigis had been released from his bonds and received kind treatment in all other matters, he straightway dismissed the sister of Theudibert and wedded the girl from Brittia.

For to the east of the wall there is a salubrious air, changing with the seasons, being moderately warm in summer and cool in winter. And many people dwell there, living in the same fashion as other men, and the trees abound with fruits which ripen at the fitting season, and the corn-lands flourish as abundantly as any; furthermore, the land seems to display a genuine pride in an abundance of springs of water. <br />But on the west side everything is the reverse of this, so that it is actually impossible for a man to survive there even a half-hour, but countless <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> and <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a> and every other kind of wild creature occupy this area as their own.

And as to the manner in which this is done, I shall presently explain, having many a time heard the people there most earnestly describe it, though I have come to the conclusion that the tales they tell are to be attributed to some power of dreams. Along the coast of the ocean which lies opposite the island of Brittia there are numerous villages. These are inhabited by men who fish with nets or till the soil or carry on a sea-trade with this island, being in other respects subject to the Franks, but never making them any payment of tribute, that burden having been remitted to them from ancient times on account, as they say, of a certain service, which will here be described by me. </p>                        </div>

So the men who on the following night must go to do this work relieving others in the service, as soon as darkness comes on, retire to their own houses and sleep, awaiting him who is to assemble them for the enterprise. And at a late hour of the night they are conscious of a knocking at their doors and hear an indistinct voice calling them together for their task. <br />And they with no hesitation rise from their beds and walk to the shore, not understanding what necessity leads them to do this, but compelled nevertheless. There they see skiffs in readiness with no man at all in them, not their own skiffs, however, but a different kind, in which they embark and lay hold of the oars. And they are aware that the boats are burdened with a large number of passengers and are wet by the waves to the edge of the planks and the oarlocks, having not so much as one finger's breadth above the water; they themselves, however, see no one, but after rowing a single hour they put in at Brittia. And yet when they make the voyage in their own skiffs, not using sails but rowing, they with difficulty make this passage in a night and a day. Then when they have reached the island and have been relieved of their burden, they depart with all speed, their boats now becomig suddenly light and rising above the waves, for they sink no further in the water than the keel itself. And they, for their part, neither see any man either sitting in the boat with them or departing from the boat, but they say that they hear a kind of voice from the island which seems to make announcement to those who take the souls in charge as each name is called of the passengers who have come over with them, telling over the positions of honour which they formerly held and calling out their fathers' names with their own. And if women also happen to be among those who have been ferried over, they utter the names of the men to whom they were married in life. This, then, is what the men of this country say takes place.

For even though they were for a long period under barbarian sway, they preserved the buildings of the city and the most of its adornments, such as could through the excellence of their workmanship withstand so long a lapse of time and such neglect. Furthermore, all such memorials of the race as were still left are preserved even to this day, and among them the ship of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, the founder of the city, an altogether incredible sight. For they built a ship-house in the middle of the city on the bank of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, and depositing it there, they have preserved it from that time. And I shall now explain what sort of a ship this is, having seen it myself. The ship is one with a single bank of oars and is very long, being one hundred and twenty feet in length and twenty-five feet wide, and its height is all that it can be without becoming impossible to row. But there is nowhere in the boat any piecing together of timbers at all nor are the timbers fastened together by any device of iron, but all the timbers are of one piece, a thing strange and unheard of and true only, as far as we know, of this one boat. For the keel, which is a single piece, extends from the extreme stern to the bow, gradually sinking to the middle of the ship in a remarkable way and then rising again thence properly and in due order until it stands upright and rigid. And all the heavy timbers which fit into the keel (these the poets call oak-stays, but others call them shepherds) extend each and every one from one side all the way to the other side of the ship. These, too, sinking from either end, form a remarkably shapely bend, in order that the ship may be fashioned with a very wide hull, whether nature under the constraint of their future use originally carved out the timbers and fashioned this arch or the sweep of the ribs was properly adjusted by craftsmen's skill and other devices. Each plank, furthermore, extends from the very stem to the other end of the ship, being of one piece and pierced by iron spikes only for this purpose, that by being fastened to the timbers they may form the side of the ship. This ship thus constructed makes an impression when seen which transcends all description, for the nature of things always makes those works which are most cunningly built not easy for men to describe, but by means of her innovations so prevails over our usual habits of mind as to check even our power of speech.

But I shall cease. For the constraint imposed upon the besieged does not permit my letter to be made longer, since it strictly appropriates the time to its own uses, while the danger demands assistance more swift than words. When John had read this letter, he dared, though it had been forbidden him by the emperor, to go on his own initiative, considering the straitened condition brought about by chance more weighty than the imperial commands. <br />So selecting men whom he considered the most able fighters of all, and manning thirty-eight ships of war with them — boats of great swiftness and built with all possible care for warfare on the sea — and putting a few of his provisions aboard, he set sail from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435165USal class=place long=16.4834 lat=43.5397>Salones</a> and put in at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/438159USca class=place long=15.923 lat=43.8179>Scardon</a>.

When the Gothic generals learned this, they too immediately manned with the notable <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> the ships of war which they had with them, forty-seven in number, and leaving the rest of the army engaged in the siege of the fortress they advanced straight against their enemy. Now Scipuar, on the one hand, commanded those who remained to carry on the siege, and Gibal and Gundulf commanded the men on the ships. And when the two forces came near each other, both commanders stopped their ships and drew them close together and made an exhortation to the soldiers. <br />And John and <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> spoke first as follows. Let not one of you, fellow-soldiers, think that on the present occasion you are to struggle in behalf of this city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/436135PAnc class=place long=13.51 lat=43.61>Ancon</a> alone and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> besieged in it, nor that the result of this struggle will affect that matter only, but you must consider that the main issue of the whole war, to speak comprehensively, is here involved, and to whichever side the battle inclines, there will be bestowed also the final decision of fortune. For you should regard the present situation thus: War depends for its decision in large measure upon the commissary, and those in want of supplies are inevitably bound to be defeated by their enemy. For valour cannot dwell together with hunger, since nature will not permit a man to be starving and to be brave at the same time. This being the case, we have no other stronghold left us from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, where we can deposit the food supplies for ourselves and our <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and the enemy are so thoroughly masters of the land that not a single town remains there friendly to us, from which we could even in small measure provide ourselves with supplies. And it is on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/436135PAnc class=place long=13.51 lat=43.61>Ancon</a> alone that our whole expectation is based that the army sailing in from the opposite mainland can land here and be in safety. Consequently, if we fare well in to-day's encounter, and secure <a about=https://topostext.org/place/436135PAnc class=place long=13.51 lat=43.61>Ancon</a>, as is probable, for the emperor, we shall perhaps be in a position henceforth to hope that what remains of the Gothic war will likewise go well for us. If, however, we fail in this battle, — but of further calamity we would not speak, only may God grant to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> the lasting mastery of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. And this too is worthy of our consideration, that, if we shew ourselves cowards in the struggle, even flight will be impossible. For neither will you have the land, seeing it is held fast by our opponents, nor will you be able to .sail the sea, since the enemy control it as they do; but it has come to this — that our hope of safety lies in our own strength alone and will shape itself in accordance with our performance during the combat. Be valiant, then, as far as in you lies, laying to heart this one thought, that if, on the one hand, you are defeated on the present occasion, you will suffer your last defeat, but if, on the other hand, you are victorious, you will not only win glory but will also be ranked with the very fortunate. </p>                        </div>

For foolishness which is not checked in the beginning does mount up to boundless daring, but ends in irreparable calamity to those concerned. Shew them, therefore, as quickly as possible that they are Greeklings and unmanly by nature and are merely putting on a bold front when defeated, and do not consent that this experiment of theirs proceed further. For cowardice, when merely despised, proceeds to flaunt itself still more, because rashness just by continuing comes to be devoid of fear. And do not by any means suppose that they will resist you long if you play the part of brave men. For when a lofty spirit is not matched by a commensurate power on the part of those who indulge in it, though before the event it may appear exalted to the highest pitch, yet when the combat begins, it is wont to ebb away. Seeing then that this is true, call to mind in what manner the enemy have fared on many occasions when they have made trial of your valour, and consider that in coming against you they have not become better men on the spur of the moment, but shewing merely a degree of daring similar to that on previous occasions, they will now also achieve the same fortune. </p>                        </div>

And the righting was exceedingly fierce and resembled a battle on land. For both sides set their ships head on with the bows against those of their opponents and discharged their arrows against each other, and all those who laid some claim to valour brought their ships close enough to touch one another and then engaged from the decks, fighting with sword and spear just as if on a plain. Such was the opening stage of this encounter. <br />But after this the barbarians, through lack of experience in sea-fighting, began to carry on the combat with great disorder; for some of them became so far separated from one another that they gave their enemy opportunity to ram them singly, while others drew together in large groups and were constantly hindered by one another because of the crowding of the boats. One would have thought that the decks of their boats were built together like a mat. And neither could they shoot their bows against those of their opponents who were at a distance except late and with difficulty, nor could they use sword or spear whenever they saw them bearing down upon them; but their attention was constantly engrossed by the shouting and crowding among themselves, as they continually collided with each other and then pushed off again with their poles in a disorderly manner, sometimes pushing their prows into the crowded space, and sometimes backing off to a great distance, thus making trouble for their own side in either case. And each crew kept shouting orders and howling wildly to those nearest them, not to urge them against the enemy, but in order that their own ships might get the proper intervals from each other.

At this the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> became fearful, being deeply moved by the outcome of the naval battle, so that they were beginning to despair of the war, having by now become utterly hopeless; for they reasoned that even in the existing circumstances they had been shamefully defeated by their enemy and completely demoralized, and if any assistance should come to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, even in small measure, they would be unable by any means to hold out against them even for the least space of time or to keep a foothold in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. Nor indeed had they any hope of accomplishing anything by negotiation with the emperor. For <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> had, as it happened, sent envoys to him often. These envoys had indeed come before <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> and explained that the Franks had occupied the greater part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, while the rest of it had become for the most part deserted on account of the war; yet the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were willing to retire in favour of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a>, which alone had remained intact, and agreed to pay tribute and taxes for the abandoned land every year and would fight as allies against whomsoever the emperor should wish and would be in other respects subject to him. But the emperor would pay no attention to what they said and dismissed the envoys one and all, hating as he did the Gothic name and intending to drive it out absolutely from the Roman domain.

It may perhaps be true that on other occasions events have gone contrary to the expectations of men, but such a thing as has been done to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in the present case by you has, I think, never happened to anyone else in the world. For the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, on his part, did not enter into this war, nor did he let it appear that he was about to fight the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, until the Franks, in the name of alliance and friendship, had received from him great sums of money and agreed to assist him in the struggle. They, however, have not only; seen fit to fulfil none of their promises, but they have further wronged the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in a way which no one could have easily imagined. For your father Theudibert undertook to trespass upon territory to which he had no just claim and which the emperor had mastered with great labour by the perils of war, and that too while all the Franks were standing out of the way. Consequently I now come to you, not to reproach you or lay charges against you, but in order to make demands and to counsel you as to what will be of advantage to you yourselves, I say, then, that you, on the one hand, should preserve the prosperity which you now enjoy, and allow the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, on the other hand, to have that which is their own; for when a nation is possessed of great power, the unholy acquisition of even some trifling thing has many a time been of sufficient moment to rob it of the advantages it has enjoyed from of old, since prosperity is by no means wont to associate itself with injustice; and I demand, furthermore, that you join with us in carrying on the war against <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, thus fulfilling your father's agreement. For the conduct which above all others would become true-born sons is this — to correct whatever mistakes have been made by their parents, but to continue and confirm whatever deeds of excellence they have done. Indeed this would be a thing most ardently prayed for by the most understanding of men-, that their children might emulate the best of their activities, and that whatever has not been well done by them should be corrected by no one else than their children. In fact you ought to have taken up this war with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> unsummoned. For our struggle is against the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, who have been from the beginning bitter enemies of the Franks and altogether untrustworthy toward them, waging a truceless and implacable war upon them through all the ages. Of course they do not hesitate now, through fear of us, to adopt a wheedling air toward you; but if ever they should get rid of us, they will at no distant time display their real attitude toward the Franks. For evil men cannot change their character either in prosperity or in adversity, though it is true as a general thing that, during periods of ill fortune, they are wont to conceal it, particularly when they need something from their neighbours, their need compelling them to cover up their baseness of heart. Call to mind then these things and renew, on the one hand, your friendship with the emperor, and defend yourselves, on the other hand, against your ancient enemies with all your power. </p>                        </div>

And Theudibald replied as follows. You summon us, in the first place, to be allies against the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> contrary to rectitude and justice; for it so happens that the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> at the present time are our friends. And if the Franks should be unfaithful to them, neither will they ever be faithful to you. For men whose sentiments have once been seen to be base toward their friends are always of such a nature as to turn aside from the path of justice. And, in the second place, as to the lands you have mentioned, we shall say only this — that my father Theudibert never set his mind upon doing violence to any one of his neighbours or usurping the possessions of others. In proof of this witness the fact that I am not rich. Consequently he did not acquire these lands by robbing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> of them, but he took possession of them as a gift from <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, who already held them and expressly handed them over to him, and upon this the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> should certainly have congratulated the Franks. For he who sees men who have robbed him of some of his private possessions roughly handled by any others would naturally rejoice, believing that those who wronged him have rightly and justly paid the penalty, except in case he be privately envious of those who have done the violence — for men feel that the appropriation by others of property which is claimed by an enemy tends, as a general thing, to envy. We are, however, able to leave to arbiters the decision of these matters, with the understanding that, if it becomes evident that my father robbed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> of anything, it shall be obligatory for us to restore this without delay. And envoys will be sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> by us in regard to this matter not long hence. With such words he dismissed <a href=/people/972 target=_blank>Leontius</a> and despatched Leudardus, a Frank, with three others to the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>. And upon their arrival at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> they treated of the matters for which they had come. </p>                        </div>

But when the barbarians learned this, they made a sally against them from the city, and falling suddenly upon their enemy routed them with no difficulty and slew many.

And spending as they did a long time in this plundering expedition, they filled all the roads with corpses, and enslaved countless multitudes and pillaged everything without meeting any opposition; then finally they departed on the homeward journey with all their plunder.

Upon hearing this Thorisin was plunged into uncertainty.

Later, however, he thought of the following plan. He sent to Auduin and demanded the surrender of Ustrigothus, son of Elemundus, urging him to commit a sin equal to the one urged upon himself, and inviting him to betray one suppliant in exchange for the other. In this way he hoped that he would frustrate their demand through dread of a similar transgression and would immediately catch Auduin himself by the proposed illicit compact.

For the river which flows by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a> is scarcely passable for a single unarmed man making his way on foot over the bridge with great labour and difficulty, and that too when no one is harassing him or disputing the passage; but for a large number of men, particularly when under arms, and above all when confronted by an enemy, it is impossible by any means whatever to make that crossing. Consequently <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a> went to the site of the bridge accompanied by a few, and being thoroughly perplexed he was considering carefully what solution he could possibly find for the difficulty. <br />And Usdrilas also came thither, bringing some of his horsemen, lest anything that was done should escape him. Then one of the followers of <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a> drew his bow and shot at them, and he hit one of their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and killed it outright.

And the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> became excited, because they were greatly troubled both by the rough ground and by the din of the shields, and also because they could not get through anywhere, while the men at the same time were gradually worn out, fighting as they were with men packed so closely together and not giving an inch of ground, and trying to manage <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> that did not in the least obey their urging.

And <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a> gathered his army in a small space and exhorted them as follows.  When an army is entering the combat with its strength evenly matched with that of the enemy, a long speech of exhortation and encouragement would perhaps be necessary of the sort which would inspire the men with ardour, in order that, being superior to the enemy in this respect they might find the issue of the combat wholly what they wish. But in your case, my men, you who have to fight against an army vastly inferior to you in valour, in numbers, and in every sort of equipment besides, I think nothing further is necessary than that we enter this engagement with God propitious to us. Do you, then, invoke His alliance with unceasing prayer, and so fare forth with great contempt to achieve the overthrow of these robbers, who, being originally slaves of the great emperor and then turning fugitives and setting a tyrant over themselves who was a worthless fellow from the common rabble, have been able for a certain season to work havoc in the Roman empire by their thievish actions. And yet one would have supposed that these men would not even have arrayed themselves against us now, if they had considered the probabilities. Yet they are playing a desperate game with an irrational sort of boldness and displaying the rashness of frenzy, and in this spirit they dare to embrace a death which obviously awaits them, not shielding themselves by a reasonable hope, nor even looking forward to see what will fall to their lot through a strange and unexpected turn of events, but being indisputably led on by God to the punishment earned by their administration of the state. For such men as have been condemned to suffer by the powers above move on to their punishment unaided. But aside from this, while you for your part are entering this combat in defence of a lawful government, they are in revolt against the laws and fighting a battle of desperation, not expecting to transmit anything they hold to any successors, but well assured that it will all perish with them and that the hope on which they live is ephemeral. Consequently they deserve thoroughly to be despised. For those who are not organized under law and good government are bereft of all virtue, and the victory, naturally, is already decided; for victory is not accustomed to range itself against the virtues.

For so thoroughly have both we and the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> become exhausted and stripped of all power through being subjected to toils and battles and hardships for an exceedingly long time, and so completely have we found ourselves unable to meet the demands of the war, that, if we shall overcome our opponents in this present engagement, they will be utterly unable to come back in the future, while if we meet with any reverse in this battle, no hope will be left the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> of renewing the fight, but either side will have in defeat a thoroughly sufficient excuse for inaction. </p>                        </div>

Having heard this, my men, play the brave part with all your might, without holding any fighting power in reserve for some other occasion, and put your whole strength into the struggle without trying to save your bodies for another danger. And let there be on your part no sparing of arms or of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, for they will never again be useful to you. For fortune, having demolished everything else, has preserved only the ultimate hope for this day. Tune your hearts, then, to a high courage, and make ready for deeds of noble daring. For when hope hangs by a thread, as it now does with you, the only safe course will be not to lose courage for the briefest moment of time. For after the point of the crisis has passed, zeal becomes for ever worthless, even though it be of an altogether immoderate sort, since the nature of things has no place for valour after the event, for once the need has passed, everything which follows must necessarily be too late. I believe, then, that you should enter the struggle making the best use of every opportunity which presents itself in action, so that you may be enabled also to enjoy the benefits to come from it. And you understand well that in the present situation he who flees thoroughly deserves his own destruction. For men abandon their post and flee for no other reason than that they may live; but if flight can be seen to involve the death of the fugitive, he who faces the danger will be in much greater safety than the man who flees. But the vast number of the enemy is worthy only to be despised, seeing that they present a collection of men from the greatest possible number of nations. For an alliance which is patched together from many sources gives no firm assurance of either loyalty or power, but being split up in nationality it is naturally divided likewise in purpose. </p>                        </div>

For he had learned that the two thousand <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> who had been missing were now drawing near, and so he sought to put off the engagement until their arrival by doing as follows. <br />First of all, he was not at all reluctant to make an exhibition to the enemy of what manner of man he was. For the armour in which he was clad was abundantly plated with gold and the ample adornments which hung from his cheek-plates as well as from his helmet and spear were not only of purple but in other respects befitting a king, marvellous in their abundance.

And wishing to prolong indefinitely the postponement of the battle, he sent to the Roman army saying that he wished to confer with them.

And when <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> reached his quarters, he found the two thousand already present.

But even so he did not find the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> unprepared. For <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a> had feared, as actually happened, that the enemy would fall upon them when they were not expecting it, and so he had given orders that not a single man should either sit down to lunch or go off to sleep or even remove his cuirass, nor yet take his bridle off his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. However, he did not allow them to be altogether without food, but commanded them to eat a small meal in ranks and with their equipment on, meanwhile maintaining a sharp look-out constantly and expecting the attack of the enemy. However, they were no longer arrayed in the same formation as before, for the Roman wings, in each of which four thousand unmounted horsemen had taken their stand, were moved forward at <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a>' command so as to form a crescent, out the Gothic infantry were all placed in a body in the rear of the cavalry, in order that, if the horsemen should be routed, the fugitives might fall back upon them and be saved, and all could then advance immediately together. </p>                        </div>

For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, on the one hand, made use of each weapon in the fighting according to the particular need of the moment, shooting with bows or thrusting with spears or wielding swords, or using any other weapon which was convenient and suitable at a given point, some of them mounted on <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and others entering the combat on foot, their numbers proportioned to the needs of the situation, so that at one point they could carry out an encircling movement around the enemy, and at another receive a charge and with their shields stop short the attack. The cavalry of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, on the other hand, leaving their infantry behind, and trusting only to their spears, made their charge with reckless impetuosity; and once in the midst of the fray they suffered for their own folly. <br />For in making their charge against their enemy's centre they had, before they realized it, placed themselves in between the eight thousand infantry, and being raked by their bowshots from either side they gave up immediately, since the bowmen kept gradually turning both the wings of their front so as to form the crescent which I have mentioned above. Consequently the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> lost many men as well as many <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> in this phase of the encounter before they had ever engaged with their opponents, and only after they had experienced very heavy losses did they with difficulty finally reach the ranks of their enemy. </p>                        </div>

And they gave not a thought to resistance, being as filled with terror as if some apparitions of the air had fallen upon them or as if <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a> were warring against them. But when shortly they reached their own infantry, their misfortune was doubled and trebled. For they did not come to them in an orderly retreat, as with the purpose of recovering their breath and renewing the fight with their assistance, as is customary; indeed they had no intention either of throwing back their pursuers by a massed attack or of undertaking a counter pursuit or any other military manoeuvre, but they arrived in such disorder that some of the men were actually destroyed by the onrushing cavalry. Consequently the infantry did not open intervals to receive them nor stand fast to rescue them, but they all began to flee precipitately with the cavalry, and in the rout they kept killing each other just as in a battle at night. Meanwhile the Roman army, profiting by their panic, continued to kill without mercy all who fell in their way, while their victims offered no defence nor dared look them in the face, but gave themselves up to their enemy to treat as they wished; so thoroughly had terror settled upon them and panic possessed them. </p>                        </div>

But a Gothic youth of the household of <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, who was following his fleeing master, outraged at what was taking place, cried aloud, What is this, you <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>? Are you rushing to smite your own master? Then Asbadus thrust his spear with all his strength at <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, but he himself was wounded in the foot by Scipuar and remained there. And Scipuar was wounded in turn by one of the pursuers and stopped, whereupon those who had been making the pursuit with Asbadus, four in number, gave up the chase in order to save him, and turned back with him. But the escort of <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, thinking that the enemy were still pursuing them, rode forward without pausing, taking him along with great determination, though mortally wounded and fainting, for necessity compelled them to that headlong flight. So after covering eighty-four stades they came to a place called Caprae. Here they rested from travel and endeavoured to treat the wound of <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, who not long afterwards completed the term of his life. And there his followers buried him in the earth and departed. </p>                        </div>

The <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, on the one hand, as by their flight they abandoned the dominion of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, made it an incident of their progress to destroy without mercy the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who fell in their way. And the barbarians of the Roman army, on the other hand, treated as enemies all whom they chanced upon as they entered the city. Furthermore, this too befell them. Many of the members of the senate, by decision of <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, had been remaining previously in the towns of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>. And some of them, upon learning that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was held by the emperor's army, departed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a> and went thither. But' when this was learned by the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> who happened to be in the fortresses there, they searched that whole country and killed all the patricians. Among these was <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, whom I have mentioned in the preceding narrative. It happened also that <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a>, when he went from there to encounter <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a>, had gathered the children of the notable <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> from each city and selected about three hundred of them whom he considered particularly fine in appearance, telling their parents that they were to live with him, though in reality they were to be hostages to him. And at that time <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> merely commanded that they should be north of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450120WEri class=place long=12.0293 lat=44.9753>Padus</a> River, but now Teias found and killed them all. </p>                        </div>

But he was eager and determined to get back the hostages, and so devised the following plan. He sent to Pacurius with the request that a few Roman soldiers be sent him in order that it might be possible for his men with safety to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a> and from there to cross the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a> and make their way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. So Pacurius, being utterly ignorant of the man's purposes, sent him fifty of his men. <br />And when Ragnaris had received them in the fortress, he immediately put them into confinement and sent word to Pacurius that, if it was his wish to recover his own soldiers, he would be obliged to surrender the Gothic hostages. But when Pacurius heard this, he left a few men to keep guard over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Dryus</a>, and immediately marched with all the rest of his army against the enemy. Thereupon Ragnaris killed the fifty men immediately, and then led forth the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a> to encounter his enemy. And when they engaged with each other, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were defeated. Whereupon Ragnaris, having lost great numbers there, set off in flight with the remnant. However, he was quite unable to get back into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>, since the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> surrounded it on every side, but he went to Acherontis and remained there.

And whenever this occurs, the mountain also belches forth a great quantity of hot ashes. So much was said at that point in my narrative. Now the centre of this mountain, just as is the case with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377150LAit class=place long=15.001 lat=37.748>Aetna</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, is a natural cavity extending from its base to its peak, and it is at the bottom of this cavity that the fire burns continually. <br />And to such a depth does this cavity descend that, when a man stands on the summit of the mountain and dares to look over the edge from there, the flames are not easily visible. And whenever it comes about that this mountain belches forth the ashes, as stated above, the flames also tear out rocks from the bottom of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408144LVes class=place long=14.425 lat=40.8216>Vesuvius</a> and hurl them into the air above the summit of this mountain, some of them small, but some exceedingly large, and thus shooting them forth from there it scatters them wherever they chance to fall.

And the stream of fire forms high banks on either side in cutting out its bed.

And it was at this river that the two armies then made camp, one on one side and the other on the other. Now while this <a href=/people/2513 target=_blank>Dracon</a> is a small stream, it still cannot be crossed either by horsemen or infantry, because, as it flows in a narrow channel and cuts into the earth to a great depth, it makes the banks on both sides overhanging as it were. But whether the cause is to be found in the nature of the soil or of the water, I cannot decide. <br />Now the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> had seized the bridge over the river, since they had encamped very near it, and placing wooden towers upon it they had mounted various engines in them, among them those called ballistae, in order that they might be able to shoot from the tower down upon the heads of such of their enemy as harassed them. It was consequently impossible for a hand-to-hand engagement to take place, since the river, as I have said, lay between; but both armies came as close as possible along the banks of the stream, and for the most part used only bows against each other. Some single encounters also took place, when some <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goth</a> on occasion, in answer to a challenge, crossed the bridge. And two months' time was spent by the armies in this way. <br />Now as long as the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> controlled that part of the sea, they maintained themselves by bringing in provisions by ship, since they were encamped not far from the shore.

And whenever he saw that his shield was filled with spears fixed in it, he would hand this over to one of his guards and take another for himself. And he continued fighting in this manner for the third part of the day, and at the end of that time his shield had twelve spears stuck in it and he was no longer able to move it where he wished and repel his assailants. So he eagerly called one of his bodyguards without leaving his post so much as a finger's breadth nor giving ground nor allowing the enemy to advance, nor even turning round and covering his back with his shield, nor, in fact, did he even turn sidewise, but as if fastened to the ground he stood there, shield in hand, killing with his right hand and parrying with his left and calling out the name of the bodyguard. <br />And the guard was now at his side with the shield, and Teias immediately sought to take this in exchange for the one weighed down with spears. But while he was doing so his chest became exposed for a brief instant of time, and it chanced that at that moment he was hit by a javelin and died instantly from the wound. Then some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> raised his head aloft on a pole and went about shewing it to both armies, to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in order that they might be encouraged, and to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> in order that they might in despair make an end of the war. </p>                        </div>

But when it began to grow dark, the two armies separated and passed the night on the battle-field in their equipment. And on the following day they arose at dawn, and arraying themselves again in the same manner they fought till nightfall, neither army retreating before the other nor being routed nor even giving ground, though large numbers were being slain on both sides, but they kept at it with the fury of wild beasts by reason of their bitter hatred of each other, the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, on the one hand, knowing well that they were fighting their last battle, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, on the other, refusing to be worsted by them. But finally the barbarians sent to <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a> some of their notables, saying that they had learned that the struggle they had taken up was against God; for they recognized, they said, the power that was arrayed against them, and, since they were coming to realize by what had hapnened the truth of the matter, they were desirous from now to acknowledge defeat and give up the struggle, not, however, to obey the emperor, but to live in independence with some of the other barbarians; and they begged that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> concede to them a peaceful withdrawal, not begrudging them a reasonable settlement, but presenting them, in fact, with their own money as travelling funds, that money, namely, which each of them had previously deposited in the fortresses of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. These proposals <a href=/people/12008 target=_blank>Narses</a> took under consideration. Now John the nephew of Vitalian advised that they should allow this request and not carry on battle further with men who courted death nor expose themselves to those whose daring was sprung from despair of life, an attitude which proves dangerous not only for those possessed by it, but also for their opponents. For victory, he said, is sufficient for the wise, but extravagant desires might perhaps turn out even to a man's disadvantage. </p>                        </div>
