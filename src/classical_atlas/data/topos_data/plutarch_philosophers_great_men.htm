They themselves are rather to be accused of an indirect but more vehement sort of ambition, who would not upon any terms be found in the company or so much as be seen to give a civil salute to a person of quality. For how unreasonable would it be to enforce a well-disposed young gentleman, and one who needs the direction of a wise governor, to such complaints as these: Would that I might change myself from a <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a> or a <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> to a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BSim class=place long=23.722194 lat=37.974731>cobbler</a> like <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a> or a grammarian like <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, that I might like them have the conversation of such a man as <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, enjoy his company, and hear his instructive lessons of morality. </p>                        </div>

Shall we then deny that privilege to men of interest and power, which this good man would have communicated (if it had been possible) to the brute beasts? But these men have taken a false notion of philosophy, they make it much like the art of statuary, whose business it is to carve out a lifeless image in the most exact figure and proportions, and then to raise it upon its pedestal, where it is to continue for ever. The true philosophy is of a quite different nature; it is a spring and principle of motion wherever it comes; it makes men active and industrious, it sets every wheel and faculty a going, it stores our minds with axioms and rules by which to make a sound judgment, it determines the will to the choice of what is honorable and just; and it wings all our faculties to the swiftest prosecution of it. It is accompanied with an elevation and nobleness of mind, joined with a coolness and sweetness of behavior, and backed with a becoming assurance and inflexible resolution. And from this diffusiveness of the nature of good it follows, that the best and most accomplished men are inclined to converse with persons of the highest condition. Indeed a physician, if he have any good nature and sense of honor, would be more ready to cure an eye which is to see and watch for a great many thousands, than that of a private person; how much more then ought a philosopher to form and fashion, to rectify and cure the soul of such a one, who is (if I may so express it) to inform the body politic, — who is to think and understand for so many others, to be in so great measure the rule of reason, the standard of law, and model of behavior, by which all the rest will square and direct their actions? </p>                        </div>

There is a passage of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> very pertinent to this purpose, in which he calls <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> Διὸς μεγάλου ὀαϱιστήν, which, as <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> interprets it, signifies the disciple and companion of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. For it were beneath his dignity indeed to teach private men, such as care only for a family or indulge their useless speculations; but kings are scholars worthy the tuition of a God, who, when they are well advised, just, good, and magnanimous, never fail to procure the peace and prosperity of all their subjects. The naturalists tell us that the eryngium hath such a property with it, that if one of the flock do but taste it, all the rest will stand stock still in the same place till the shepherd hath taken it out of its mouth. Such quickness of action does it have, pervading and spreading itself over every thing that is near it, as if it were fire. The effects of philosophy, however, are different according to the difference of inclinations in men. If indeed it lights on one who loves a dull and inactive sort of life, that makes himself the centre and the little conveniences of life the circumference of all his thoughts, such a one does contract the sphere of her activity, </p>                        </div>

Such was the effect of the conversation of <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a> with <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a>, of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> with <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a>, and of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> with the principal statesmen of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> himself took a voyage, when he had the concern of an expedition lying upon him, to see and hear <a href=/people/692 target=_blank>Athenodorus</a>; and <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> sent for <a href=/people/959 target=_blank>Panaetius</a>, when he was commissioned by the senate to take a survey alike of the outrages and the good order which were practised in their provinces, as <a href=/people/457 target=_blank>Posidonius</a> observes.

However, thus much shall be said, that the end of them both is friendship, — in the first case with ourselves, in the second case with another. For he that hath attained to virtue by the methods of philosophy hath his mind all in tune and good temper; he is not struck with those reproaches of conscience, which cause the acutest sense of pain and are the natural punishments of our follies; but he enjoys (the great prerogative of a good man) to be always easy and in amity with himself. No factious lusts reason's just power control, Nor kindle civil discord in his soul. His passion does not stand in defiance to his reason, nor do his reasonings cross and thwart one the other, but he is always consistent with himself. But the very joys of wicked men are tumultuary and confused, like those who dwell in the borders of two great empires at variance, always insecure, and in perpetual alarms; whilst a good man enjoys an uninterrupted peace and serenity of mind, which excels the other not only in duration, but in sense of pleasure too. As for the other sort of discourse, that which consists in expression of itself to others, <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> says very well, that it was not mercenary in old time, nor indeed is it so now; but by the baseness and ambition of a few it is made use of to serve their poor secular interests. For if the poets represent <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> herself as much offended with those who make a trade and traffic of the passion of love, how much more reasonably may we suppose that <a href=/people/10587 target=_blank>Urania</a> and <a href=/people/2195 target=_blank>Clio</a> and <a href=/people/736 target=_blank>Calliope</a> have an indignation against those who set learning and philosophy to sale?

The charms and <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a> of youth will not make a philosopher shy of their conversation, when the endowments of their minds are answerable to the features of their bodies. The case is the same when greatness of place and fortune concur with a well-disposed mind in the same person; he will not therefore forbear loving and respecting such a one, nor be afraid of the name of a courtier, nor think it a curse that such attendance and dependence should be his fate. They that strive most Dame <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> to eschew Do fault as much as they who her pursue. The application is easy to the matter in hand. A philosopher therefore, if he is of a retired humor, will not shun such persons; while one who generously designs his studies for the public advantage will cheerfully embrace their advances of friendship, will not force them after a troublesome manner to hear him, will lay aside his scholastical terms and distinctions, and will rejoice to discourse and pass his time with them when they are willing and disposed.

He who first gave the names to the three <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a> well understood this, for they all signify delectation and joy, and these surely are far greater and purer in him who does the good turn. This is so evidently true, that we all receive good turns blushing and with some confusion, but we are always gay and well pleased when we are conferring one. If then it is so pleasant to do good to a few, how are their hearts dilated with joy who are benefactors to whole cities, provinces, and kingdoms? And such benefactors are they who instil good principles into those upon whom so many millions do depend.

In like manner, he who instructs an ordinary man makes him to pass his life decently and with comfort; but he who instructs a prince, by correcting his errors and clearing his understanding, is a philosopher for the public, by rectifying the very mould and model by which whole nations are formed and regulated. It is the custom of all nations to pay a peculiar honor and deference to their priests; and the reason of it is, because they do not only pray for good things for themselves, their own families and friends, but for whole communities, for the whole state of mankind. Yet we are not so fond as to think that the priests cause the Gods to be givers of good things, or inspire a vein of beneficence into them; but they only make their supplications to a being which of itself is inclinable to answer their requests. But in this a good tutor hath the privilege above the priests, — he effectually renders a prince more disposed to actions of justice, moderation, and mercy, and therefore hath a greater satisfaction of mind when he reflects upon it. </p>                        </div>

The builder of the <a href=/people/352 target=_blank>Argo</a> certainly would have been mightily pleased, if he had known what noble mariners were to row in his ship, and that at last she should be translated into heaven; and a carpenter would not be half so much pleased to make a coach or plough, as to make the tablets on which <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>'s laws were to be engraved.
