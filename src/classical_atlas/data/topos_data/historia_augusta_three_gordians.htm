On his father's side he traced his descent from the house of the <a href=/people/1832 target=_blank>Gracchi</a>, on his mother's from the Emperor <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>. His own father, his grandfather, and his great-grandfather, his wife's father and grandfather, and likewise another of his wife's grandfathers and two of her great-grandfathers, were consuls. 3 He himself as consul was most rich and powerful; at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> he owned the House of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, and in the provinces more land than any other subject. 4 After his consulship, which he served with <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, he was sent out as proconsul to Africa by decree of the senate. </p>                        </div>

As a matter of fact, all the subjects were those which <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> also treated, that is, <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, <a href=/people/12272 target=_blank>Aratus</a>, Alcyonae, Uxorius and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nilus</a>. And he wrote these in order that <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>'s poems might seem out of date. 3 Besides these, just as <a href=/people/118 target=_blank>Vergil</a> wrote an Aeneid, <a href=/people/594 target=_blank>Statius</a> an Achilleid, and many others Alexandriads, he wrote an Antoniniad — the lives, that is, of <a href=/people/12361 target=_blank>Antoninus Pius</a> and <a href=/people/809 target=_blank>Marcus Antoninus</a>, most learnedly versified in thirty books, wherein he recounted their wars and other doings both public and private. 4 And all this he did as a young boy. Later on, when he grew to manhood, he declaimed and disputed at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BAth class=place long=12.4833 lat=41.8958>Athenaeum</a>, at times in the presence of his emperors. <br />5 He served his quaestorship most splendidly. When he was aedile he gave the Roman people twelve exhibitions, that is one for each month, at his own expense; at times, indeed, he provided five hundred pairs of gladiators, and never less than a hundred and fifty. 6 He produced a hundred wild beasts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> at once, and likewise at one time a thousand bears. There exists also today a remarkable wild-beast hunt of his, pictured in Gnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s House of the Beaks; this palace belonged to him and to his father and grandfather before him until your privy-purse took it over in the time of <a href=/people/12098 target=_blank>Philip</a>. 7 In this picture at the present day are contained two hundred stags with antlers shaped like the palm of a hand, together with stags of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>, thirty wild <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, a hundred wild <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, ten elks, a hundred <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=person long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a> <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>, three hundred red Moorish ostriches, thirty wild <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a>, a hundred and fifty wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a>, two hundred chamois, and two hundred fallow deer. 8 And all these he handed over to the people to be killed on the day of the sixth exhibition that he gave. </p>                        </div>

He admired the Antonines marvellously; many say that he himself assumed the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> or, as more declare, <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a>. 8 And certainly there is no doubt that he embellished his son with the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, when, after the Roman custom, he acknowledged him before the prefect of the Treasury and entered his name in the public records. </p>                        </div>

You are accustomed to take oath when discussing these matters, moreover, that no one shall hear or know anything of them until the business is completed. 3 But among the ancients the custom was introduced in the interests of the state, that, if by any chance violence threatened at the hands of their enemies, which forced them either to adopt ignoble counsels or resolve on things which should not be disclosed until they were ready to be put into effect, or if they were unwilling for certain measures to be divulged to friends, the senate passed a secret decree. At these sessions not even the clerks or public servants or officers of the Census were present; the senators took over and the senators performed the duties of all the clerks and officers of the Census, lest anything by any chance should be betrayed. 4 To prevent news of it reaching <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>, therefore, this decree of the senate was made secret. </p>                        </div>

Everything that had been his was added to the city's revenues. 2 So excellent was this man's management of public affairs that there was nowhere a border city of major size, such as could contain an army and emperor of the Roman people, that did not have supplies of cheap wine, grain, bacon, barley, and straw for a year; other smaller cities had supplies for thirty days, some for forty, and not a few for two months, while the very least had supplies for fifteen days. 3 When he was prefect, likewise, he constantly inspected his men's arms. He never let an old man serve and he never let a boy draw rations. He used to go over the camps and their entrenchments, and he even frequently visited the sentries during the night. 4 And because he so loved the emperor and the state, everyone loved him. The tribunes and generals both loved and feared him so much that they were unwilling to do wrong and, for that matter, in no way did wrong. 5 <a href=/people/12098 target=_blank>Philip</a>, they say, was mightily in fear of him for many reasons and on this account plotted with the doctors against his life. He did it in this way: <a href=/people/6023 target=_blank>Timesitheus</a>, as it happened, was suffering from diarrhoea and was told by the doctors to take a potion to check it. 6 And then, they say, they changed what had been prepared and gave him something which loosened him all the more; and thus he died. </p>                        </div>
