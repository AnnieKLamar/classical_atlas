And why? You charge and then: <br />It’s a quick death in a moment, or a joyful victory won.’ <br />When a client knocks hard on his door before cockcrow <br />The adept in justice and law praises the farmer’s life, <br />While he, going bail and having been dragged up to town <br />From the country, proclaims only town-dwellers happy. <br />Quoting all the other numerous examples would tire <br />Even that windbag <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a>. So to avoid delaying you, <br />Here’s what I’m getting at. If some god said: ‘Here I am! <br />Now I’ll perform whatever you wish: you be a merchant <br />Who but now was a soldier: you the lawyer become a farmer: <br />You change roles with him, he with you, and depart. Well! <br />What are you waiting for? They’d refuse, on the verge of bliss. <br />What in reason would stop <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> rightly swelling his cheeks <br />Then, in anger, and declaring that never again will he <br />Be so obliging as to attend to their prayers. </p>                        </div>

Tell me then, what difference to the man <br />Who lives within Nature’s bounds, whether he ploughs a hundred <br />Acres or a thousand? ‘But it’s sweet to take from a big heap.’ <br />Even so why praise your granaries more than our bins, <br />So long as we’re able to draw as much from the smaller? <br />It’s as if though you needed no more than a jug of water, <br />Or a single cup, you said: ‘I’d rather have the same amount <br />From some vast river rather than this little spring.’ That’s why <br />Raging <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412160WAuf class=place long=16.02 lat=41.23028>Aufidus</a> sweeps away riverbanks, and all those <br />Who delight in owning more than their fair share of wealth. <br />But the man who desires only as much as he needs, <br />Won’t drink muddy water, or lose his life in the flood. </p>                        </div>

Let such people be wretched, <br />Since that’s what they wish: like the rich <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> miser <br />Who used to hold the voice of the crowd in contempt: <br />‘They hiss at me, that crew, but once I’m home I applaud <br />Myself, as I contemplate all the riches in my chests.’ <br /><a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a>, thirsty, strains towards water that flees his lips – <br />Why do you mock him? Alter a name and the same tale <br />Is told of you: covetously sleeping on money-bags <br />Piled around, forced to protect them like sacred objects, <br />And take pleasure in them as if they were only paintings. <br />Don’t you know the value of money, what end it serves? <br />Buy bread with it, cabbages, a pint of wine: all the rest, <br />Things where denying them us harms our essential nature. <br />Does it give you pleasure to lie awake half dead of fright, <br />Terrified night and day of thieves or fire or slaves who rob <br />You of what you have, and run away? I’d always wish <br />To be poorest of the poor when it comes to such blessings. <br />‘But,’ you say, ‘when your body’s attacked by a feverish chill <br />Or some other accident’s confined you to your bed, <br />I’d have someone to sit by me, prepare my medicine <br />Call in the doctor to revive me, restore me to kith and kin.’ <br />Oh, but your wife doesn’t want you well, nor your son: all <br />Hate you, your friends and neighbours, girls and boys. <br />Yet you wonder, setting money before all else, <br />That no-one offers you the love you’ve failed to earn! <br />While if you tried to win and keep the love of those kin <br />Nature gave you without any trouble on your part, <br />Your effort would be as wasted as trying to train <br />A <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>donkey</a> to trot to the rein round the Plain of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>. </p>                        </div>

It’s not a long tale: he was rich, <br />So much so he was forced to weigh his coins: so stingy <br />He dressed no better than a slave: and right to the end <br />He was fearful lest starvation overcome him. <br />Instead a freedwoman cut him in two with an axe, <br />She an indomitable scion of <a href=/people/362 target=_blank>Tyndareus</a>’ race! <br />‘Do you want me to live, then,’ you say, ‘like <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a><br />Or Nomentanus?’ Now you’re setting up a war <br />Of opposites. When I order you not to be avaricious <br />I’m not telling you to become an idle spendthrift. <br />Between Visellius’ father-in-law and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/473393WTan class=place long=39.336 lat=47.268>Tanais</a><br />There’s a mean. Measure in everything: in short, there are <br />Certain boundaries, on neither side of which lies Right. <br />I return to the point I first made, that no one’s content <br />In himself, because of greed, but envies all others <br />Who follow different paths, pines that his neighbour’s <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a><br />Has fuller udders, and instead of comparing himself <br />With the poorer majority, tries to outdo this man and that. <br />But however he hurries there’s always one richer in front, <br />As when the galloping hooves whisk the chariots away <br />From the gate, the charioteer chasing the vanishing teams, <br />Indifferent to the stragglers he’s leaving behind. <br />So we can rarely find a man who claims to have lived <br />A happy life, who when his time is done is content <br />To go, like a guest at the banquet who is well sated. <br />That will do. Lest you think I’ve pillaged the shelves <br />Of bleary-eyed <a href=/people/1397 target=_blank>Crispinus</a>, I’ll add not a single word. </p>                        </div>
