                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi033:1'><b>&sect; 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a new crime, and one never heard of before this day, O <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caius Caesar</a>, which my relation Quintus <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a> has brought before you, when he accuses Quintus <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a> with having been in Africa; and that charge Caius <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a>, a man of eminent genius, relying perhaps on that intimacy with you which he enjoys, has ventured to confess. Therefore I do not know which way I had best proceed. For I had come prepared, as you did not know that fact of your own knowledge, and could not have heard it from any other quarter, to abase your ignorance in order to further the safety of a miserable man. But, however, since that which was previously unknown has been ferreted out by the diligence of his enemy we must, I suppose, confess the truth; especially as my dear friend Caius <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a> has so acted that it would not now be in my power to deny it. Therefore, abandoning all dispute of the fact, all my speech must be addressed to your mercy; by which many have already been preserved, having besought of you, not a release from all guilt, but pardon from admitted error. <br /> [2] You, therefore, O <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a>, have that which is of all things most desirable for a prosecutor, a defendant who confesses his fault; but still, one who confesses it only so far as he admits that he was of the same party as you yourself, O <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a>, were, and as that man worthy of all praise, your father, also was. Therefore you must inevitably confess yourselves also to be guilty, before you can find fault with any part of the conduct of <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a>. <br />Quintus <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a>, then, at a time when there was no suspicion of war, went as lieutenant into Africa with Caius <a href=/people/3564 target=_blank>Considius</a>, in which lieutenancy he made himself so acceptable, both to our citizens there and to our allies, that <a href=/people/3564 target=_blank>Considius</a> on departing from the province could not have given satisfaction to those men if he had appointed any one else to govern it. Therefore, Quintus <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a>, after refusing it for a long time without effect, took upon himself the government of the province against his will. And while peace lasted, he governed it in such a manner that his integrity and good faith were most acceptable both to our citizens and to our allies. [3] On a sudden, war broke out, which those who were in Africa heard of as being actually raging before any rumour of its preparation had reached them. But when they did hear of it, partly out of an inconsiderate eagerness, partly out of some blind apprehension, they sought for some one as a leader, at first only with the object of securing their safety, and afterwards with that of indulging their party-spirit; while <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a>, keeping his eyes fixed on home, and wishing to return to his friends, would not allow himself to be implicated in any business of the sort. In the meantime, Publius <a href=/people/2292 target=_blank>Attius</a> <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a>, who as praetor had obtained the province of Africa, came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371101UUti class=place long=10.0623 lat=37.0565>Utica</a>. Every one immediately flocked to him, and he seized on the government with no ordinary eagerness, if that may be called government which was conferred on him, while a private individual, by the clamour of an ignorant mob, without the sanction of any public council. [4] Therefore, <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a>, who was anxious to avoid being mixed up in any transactions of the sort remained quiet for some time on the arrival of <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a>. </p>                        </div>

He left his home, not only not for the purpose of joining in any war, but when there was not even the slightest suspicion of war. Having gone as lieutenant in time of peace, he behaved himself in a most peaceable province in such a manner that it wished that peace might last for ever. Beyond all question, his departure from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> with such an object ought not to be and cannot be offensive to you. Was, then, his remaining there offensive? Much less. For if it was no discreditable inclination that led to his going thither, it was even an honourable necessity which compelled him to remain. Both these times, then, are free from all fault — the time when he first went as lieutenant and the time when, having been demanded by the province, he was appointed governor of Africa. <br /> [5] There is a third time that during which he remained in Africa after the arrival of <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a>; and if that is at all criminal, the crime is one of necessity, not of inclination. Would he, if he could possibly have escaped thence by any means whatever, would he rather have been at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371101UUti class=place long=10.0623 lat=37.0565>Utica</a> than at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, — with Publius <a href=/people/2292 target=_blank>Attius</a>, in preference to his own most united brothers, — would he rather have been among strangers, than with his own friends? When his lieutenancy itself had been full of regret and anxiety on account of the extraordinary affection subsisting between him and his brothers, could he possibly remain there with any equanimity when separated from those brothers by the discord of war? <br /> [6] You have, therefore, O <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, no sign as yet of the affections of Quintus <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a> being alienated from you. And observe, I entreat you, with what good faith I am defending his cause. I am betraying my own by so doing. O the admirable clemency, deserving to be celebrated by all possible praise, and publicity, and writings, and monuments! Marcus Cicero is urging in <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a>'s defence before you, that the inclinations of another were not the same as he admits his own to have been; nor does he fear your silent thoughts, nor is he under any apprehension as to what while you are hearing of the conduct of another, may occur to you respecting his own. </p>                        </div>

See how brilliantly the light of your liberality and wisdom rises upon me while speaking before you. As far as I can, I will lift up my voice so that the Roman people may hear me. [7] When the war began, O <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, when it was even very greatly advanced towards its end, I, though compelled by no extraneous force, of my own free judgment and inclination went to join that party which had taken up arms against you. Before whom now am I saying this? Forsooth, before the man who, though he was acquainted with this, nevertheless restored me to the republic before he saw me; who sent letters to me from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, to desire me to behave as I always had behaved; who, when he himself might have been the sole leader of the Roman people in the whole empire, still permitted me to be the other; by whose gift it was, (this very Caius <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a>, who is here present, bringing me the news,) that I retained the fasces wreathed with laurel, as long as I thought it becoming to retain them at all, and who would not have considered that he was giving me safety at all, if he did not give it me without my being stripped of any of my previous distinctions. <br /> [8] Observe, I pray you, O <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a>, how I, who do not hesitate to speak of my own conduct, do not venture to make any confession with respect to <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a>: and I have said thus much respecting myself, to induce <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a> to excuse me when I say the same things of him. For I look in the forum on his industry and desire of glory, either on account of the nearness of our relationship, or because I am delighted with his genius and with his earnestness, or because I think that the praises of a young man who is my relative redound somewhat to my own credit. [9] But I ask this — Who is it who thinks that it was any crime in <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a> to have been in Africa? Why, the very man who himself also wished to be in Africa, and who complains that he was prevented by <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a> from going there, and who certainly was in arms and fought against <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. For, O <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a>, what was that drawn sword of yours doing in the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393224UPha class=place long=22.3869 lat=39.2883>Pharsalia</a>? against whose side was that sword-point of yours aimed? What was the feeling with which you took up arms? What was your intention? Where were your eyes? your hands? your eagerness of mind? what were you desirous of? What were you willing for? I am pressing you too hard. The young man appears to be moved. I will return to myself. I also was in arms in the same camp. </p>                        </div>

Shall, then, O <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, the speech of those men spur you on to deeds of cruelty whose impunity is the great glory of your clemency? And in this cause, in truth, O <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a>, I am somewhat at a loss to discern your usual prudence, but much more so to see the sagacity of your father, since that man, eminent both for genius and erudition, did not perceive what sort of case this was. For if he had perceived it, he would, I doubt not, have preferred that you should conduct it in any manner in the world, rather than as you did. <br />You are accusing one who confesses the facts which you allege against him. That is not enough. You are accusing one who has a case, as I say, better than your own, or, as you yourself allow, at least as good as yours. [11] This is strange though; but what I am about to say is a perfect miracle. That accusation of yours does not tend to the point of procuring the condemnation of Quintus <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a>, but of causing us death. And this is an object which no Roman citizen has ever pursued before you. That way of acting is quite foreign. It is the hatred of fickle Greeks or of savage barbarians that is usually excited to the pitch of thirsting for blood. For what else is your object? To prevent him from being at ionic? To deprive him of his country? To hinder him from living with his excellent brothers, with this Titus <a href=/people/6302 target=_blank>Brocchus</a>, whom you see in court, his uncle, or with <a href=/people/6302 target=_blank>Brocchus</a>'s son, his cousin? To prevent his appearing in his country? Was that it? Can he be more deprived of all these things than he is already? He is prevented from approaching <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>; he is banished. You, therefore, do not wish to deprive him of his country, of which he already is deprived, but of his life. <br /> [12] But even in the time of that dictator who punished with death every one whom he disliked, no one ever proceeded in that manner to accomplish such an end. He himself ordered men to be slain, without any one asking him; he even invited men to slay them by rewards; and that cruelty of his was avenged some years afterwards by this selfsame man whom you now wish to become cruel! </p>                        </div>

I think indeed that you do not intend to do so, O <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a>, for I know you, I know your father, I know your birth and your name, and the pursuits of your race and family; our love of virtue, and civilization, and learning; your many admirable qualities, — all are known to me. [13] Therefore I know for a certainty that you are not thirsting for blood, but you give no heed to the effect of your prosecution. For the transaction has this tendency, to make you seem not contented with that punishment under which Quintus <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a> is at present suffering. What further punishment then is there but death? For if he is in exile, as he is, what more do you require? That he may never be pardoned? But this is much more bitter and much harsher. That which we begged for at his house with prayers and tears, throwing ourselves at his feet, trusting not so much to the strength of our cause as to his humanity, will you now struggle to prevent our obtaining? Will you interrupt our weeping? and will you forbid us to speak, lying at his feet with the voice suppliants? [14] If, when we were doing this at his house, as and as I hope we did not do in vain, you had all on a sudden burst in, and had begun to cry out “O <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caius Caesar</a>, beware how you pardon, beware how you pity brothers entreating you for the safety of their brother,” would you not have renounced all humanity by such conduct? How much harder is this, for you to oppose in the forum what we begged of him in his own house! and while numbers are in this distress, to take away from them the refuge which they might find in his clemency! <br />I will speak plainly, O <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caius Caesar</a>, what I feel. [15] If in this splendid fortune of yours your lenity had not been as great as you of your own accord — of your own accord, I say, (I know well what I am saying,) make it, that victory of yours would have been pregnant with the bitterest grief to the state. For how many of the conquering party must have been found who would have wished you to be cruel, when some of even the conquered party are found to wish it! how many who, wishing no one to be pardoned by you, would have thrown obstacles in the way of your clemency, when even those men whom you yourself have pardoned are unwilling that you should be merciful to others <br /> [16] But if we could prove to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> that <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a> was actually not in Africa at all, if we wished to save an unfortunate citizen by an honourable and merciful falsehood; still it would not be the act of a man, in a case of such danger and peril to a fellow-citizen, to contradict and refute our falsehood; and if it were decent for any one to do so, it would certainly not be so for one who had himself been in the same case and condition But, however, it is one thing to be unwilling that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> should make a mistake, and another to be unwilling he should be merciful. Then you would say, “Beware, O <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, of believing all this — <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a> was in Africa. He did bear arms against you.” But now what is it that you say “Take care you do not pardon him.” This is not the language of a man but he who uses it to you, O <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caius Caesar</a>, will find it an easier matter to abjure his own humanity than to strip you of yours. </p>                        </div>

I make no doubt that you wondered how it was that no one made this statement respecting some one else, or how it was that he made it who had been in the same condition himself, or what new crime it was which he was bringing forward. Do you call that wickedness, <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a>? Why so? For that cause has not as yet been wicked by that name. Some call it mistake; some call it fear; those who give it a harder name term it hope, ambition, hatred, obstinacy; those who use the hardest language style it rashness. But up to this time no one except you has ever called it wickedness. My own opinion is, if any one seeks for a proper and accurate name for our misfortune, that some disaster sent by destiny descended upon and occupied the provident minds of men; so that no one ought to wonder that human counsels were overruled by divine necessity. <br /> [18] Let it be allowed to us to be miserable, although that cannot be when this man is our conqueror. But I am not speaking of those who have perished. Grant that they were ambitious, that they were angry, that they were obstinate men; but still let Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, for he is dead, and let any others with him, be free from the imputation of wickedness, of insanity, of parricide. When did any one hear such expression from you, O <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caius Caesar</a>? or what other object did your arms propose to themselves except the repelling insult from yourself? What was it that was accomplished by that invincible army of yours; beyond the preservation of its own rights, and of your dignity? What? when you were anxious for peace, was it your object to be able to come to terms of agreement with the wicked, or with the virtuous part of the citizens? [19] To me, of a truth, O <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, your services towards me, immense as they are, would certainly not appear so great, if I thought that I had been preserved by you while you considered me a wicked man. And how could you possibly have deserved well of the republic, if you had wished so many wicked men to remain with all their dignity unimpaired? Originally, O <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, you considered that as a secession, not as a declaration of war; you considered it as a demonstration not of hostile hatred, but of civil dissension, in which both parties desired the safety of the republic, but some departed from measures calculated for the general welfare out of an error of judgment, and some out of party spirit. The dignity of the leaders was nearly on a par; but that of those who followed them was perhaps not quite equal; the justice of the cause, too, was at that time doubtful, because there was something on each side which deserved to be approved of; but now that is unquestionably entitled to be thought the better cause which even the gods assisted. But now that your clemency is known; who is there who does not think well of that victory, in which no one has fallen except those who fell with arms in their hands? </p>                        </div>

Which do you think was easiest, O <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a>, for <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a> to depart from Africa, or for you to abstain from coming into Africa? “Could we so abstain,” you will say, “after the senate had voted that we should do so?” If you ask me, I say, Certainly not. But still the same senate had appointed <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a> lieutenant. And he obeyed them at a time when men were forced to obey the senate; but you obeyed at a time when no one obeyed them who did not like it. Do I then find fault with you? By no means; — for a man of your family, of your name, of your race, of your hereditary principles, could not act otherwise. But I do not grant that you have a right to reprove in others the very same conduct which you boast of in yourselves. <br /> [21] <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a>'s lot was drawn in pursuance of a resolution of the senate when he himself was not present, when he was even hindered by sickness from being present. He had made up his mind to excuse himself. I know all this from the great intimacy which exists between Lucius <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a> and myself: we were brought up together, in our campaigns we were comrades, afterwards we became connected by marriage, and throughout the whole of our lives, in short, we have been friends; it has been, moreover, a great bond between us, that we have been devoted to the same studies. I know, therefore, that <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a> wished to remain at home; but there was a person who contrived matters in such a way, who put forth that most holy name of the republic so artfully, that even had his sentiments been different from what they were, he would not have been able to support the weight of his language. [22] He submitted to the authority of a most distinguished man, or, I should rather say, he obeyed him. He went off at the same time with those men who were already embarked in the same cause, but he made us journey slower than they. Therefore, he arrived in Africa when it was already occupied; and from this it is that the charge against <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a>, or rather the enmity against him, has its rise. For if it be a crime in him to have wished to hinder you, it is a no less serious one for you to have wished to obtain Africa, the citadel of all the provinces, a land created for the purpose of waging war against this city, than for somebody else to have preferred obtaining it himself, — and that somebody was not <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a>. <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> kept saying, that he had the command there; the fasces he certainly had. [23] But however the case, as to that part of it may be, what weight is there, O <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a>, in this complaint of yours? “We were admitted into the province.” Well, suppose you had been admitted? was it your object to deliver it up to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, or to hold it against <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>? </p>                        </div>

For even if the action had been an acceptable one to you, it would not have been thought an honest one by you. [24] But, however, all these topics I will pass over, not so much for fear of offending your most patient ears, as because that I do not wish that <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a> should appear to have been likely to do what he never thought of. <br />You two came, then, into the province of Africa, — the province of all others that was most hostile to the views of this victorious party in which there was a most powerful king, an enemy to this cause, and in which the inclinations of a large and powerful body of Roman settlers were entirely adverse to it. I ask what you intended to do? Though I do not really doubt what you intended to do, when I see what you have done. You were forbidden to set foot in your province, and forbidden, as you state yourselves, with the greatest insults. [25] How did you bear that? To whom did you carry your complaints of the insults which you had received? Why, to that man whose authority you had followed when you came to join his party in the war. If it had been in <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s cause that you were coming to the province, unquestionably, when excluded from the province, it was to him that you would have gone. But you came to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. What is the meaning, then, of this complaint which you now urge before <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, when you accuse that man by whom you complain that you were prevented from waging war against <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>? And as to this part of the business you may boast for all I care, even though it will be falsely, that you would have given the province up to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, even if you had been forbidden by <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a>, and by some others.

Where, then, was there ever an example of such great consistency in any man? Consistency, do I say? I do not know whether I might not more fitly call it patience. For how few men would have acted in such a manner as to return to that same party by which he had been rejected in a time of civil dissension, and rejected even with cruelty? That is the act of a great mind, and of a man whom no contumely, no violence, and no danger can turn from a side which he has espoused, and from an opinion which he has adopted. [27] Grant that in all other respects <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a> and <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> were on a par, as to honour, that is, and nobleness of birth, and respectability, and genius, — which, however, was by no means the case; at all events, <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a> had this great advantage, that he had come to his own province with a legitimate command, in pursuance of a resolution of the senate. When he was prevented from entering it, he did not betake himself to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, lest he should appear to be in a passion, — he did not go home, lest he should be thought inactive, — he did not go to any other district, lest he might seem to condemn that cause which he had espoused.

You only stayed in some garrison? But your affections were alienated from his cause? Or were we all, as is the case in a civil war, and not more with respect to you two, than with respect to others, — were we all wholly occupied with a desire of victory? I, indeed, was at all times an advocate of peace, but that time was too late. For it was the part of a madman to think of peace when he saw the hostile army in battle array. We all, every one of us, I say, were eager for victory; you most especially, as you had come into a place where you must inevitably perish if your side were not victorious. Although, the result now turns out, I make no doubt that you confer your present safety preferable to what would have been the consequences of victory. </p>                        </div>

In whatever I have said, I have endeavoured to refer everything to the leading idea of your humanity, or clemency, mercy, whichever may be its most proper name. [30] I have, indeed, O <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caius Caesar</a>, pleaded many causes with you, while your pursuit of honours detained you in the forum; but certainly I never pleaded in this way, “Pardon my client, O judges; he has erred, he has tripped, he did not think.<br /> ** If ever hereafter<br /> **” This is the sort of way in which he pleads with a parent; to judges one says, “He never did it, he never thought of it the witnesses are false, the accusation is false.” Say, O <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, that you are sitting as judge on the conduct of <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a>. Ask me in what garrisons he was. I make no reply. I do not even adduce these arguments, which, perhaps, might have weight even with a judge, — “He went as a lieutenant before the war broke out; he was left there in time of peace; he was overtaken by the war; in the war itself he was not cruel; he was in disposition and zeal wholly yours.” This is the way in which men are in the habit of pleading before a judge. But I am addressing a parent. “I have erred; I have acted rashly; I repent; I flee to your clemency; I beg pardon for my fault; I entreat you to pardon me.” If no one has gained such indulgence from you, it is an arrogant address. [31] But if many have, then do you give us assistance who have already given us hope. Is it possible that <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a> should have no reason for hope, when I am allowed to approach you even for the purpose of entreating mercy for another?

Therefore, you grant your friends so many favours, that they who enjoy your liberality appear to me sometimes to be happier than you yourself who give them so much. But, however, I see, as I said before, that the causes of those who entreat your mercy have more weight with you than the entreaties themselves; and that you are most moved by those men whose grief, which they display in their petitions to you, is the most genuine. <br /> [32] In preserving Quintus <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a> you will do what will be acceptable to numbers of your intimate friends; but, I entreat you, give weight to the considerations which are accustomed to influence you.

Any exile is more desirable for them than their own country, their own house, and their own household gods will be if this their brother is banished by himself. If they act as brothers should, — if they behave with affection and with genuine grief, then let their tears, their affection, and their relationship as brothers move you. Let that expression of yours have weight now which gained the victory; for we heard that you said that we thought all men our enemies, but those who were with us; but that you considered all men as your friends who were not actually arrayed against you. Do you see, then, this most respectable band; do you see the whole house of the Brocchi here present, and Lucius <a href=/people/10971 target=_blank>Marcius</a>, and Caius <a href=/people/4460 target=_blank>Caesetius</a>, and Lucius <a href=/people/6383 target=_blank>Corfidius</a>, and all these Roman knights, who are present here in mourning garments, — men who are not only well known to, but highly esteemed by you? They all were with you then; and we were full of anger against them, — we were attacking them; some even personally threatened them. Preserve, therefore, their friends to your friends; so that, like everything else which has been said by you, this, too, may be found to be strictly true. </p>                        </div>

I hope that you, too, who are not in the habit of forgetting anything, except the injuries which have been done to you, since it is a part of your character, a part of your natural disposition, to do so, while you are thinking of the manner in which he conducted himself in the discharge of his duty as quaestor, and while you remember, too, how some other quaestors behaved, — I hope, I say, that you will also recollect this. <br /> [36] This Titus <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a>, then, who had at that time no other object except to induce you to think him attached to your interests, and a virtuous man also, (for he could never foresee these present circumstances,) now as a suppliant begs the safety of his brother from you. And when, urged by the recollection of his devotion to you, you have granted that safety to these men, you will by so doing have made a present of three most virtuous and upright brothers, not only to themselves, nor to these men, numerous and respectable as they are, nor to us who are their intimate friends, but also to the republic. [37] That, therefore, which in the case of that most noble and most illustrious man, Marcus <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>, you lately did in the senate-house, do now also in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a> with respect to these most virtuous brothers, who are so highly esteemed by all the crowd here present. As you granted him to the senate, so grant this man to the people, whose affections you have always considered most important to you. And if that day was one most glorious to you, and at the same time most acceptable to the Roman people, do not, I entreat you, — do not hesitate to earn the praise of a glory like that as frequently as possible. <br />For there is nothing so calculated to win the affections of the people as kindness. Of all your many virtues, there is none more admirable, none more beloved than your mercy. [38] For there is no action by which men make a nearer approach to the gods, than by conferring safety on others. <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> has no greater gifts for you than when it bestows on you the ability — nature has no better endowment for you than when it bestows on you the will, to save as many people us possible. The cause of my client, perhaps, requires a longer speech than this a shorter one would certainly be sufficient for a man of your natural disposition. Wherefore, as I think it more desirable for you to converse, as it were, with yourself, than for me or any one else to be speaking to you, I shall now make an end. This only will I remind you of, that if you do grant this protection to him who is absent, you will be giving it also to all these men who are here present. </p>                        </div>
