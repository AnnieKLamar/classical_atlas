Once when he went to visit his farm, a farm hand who had gathered some very fine figs brought them to <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>'s master and said, Here, master, take this early harvest of your fruit. The master was pleased and said, Bless me, these are fine figs. And he said to his servant, Agathopous, take these and keep them for me. After I have a bath and dinner, serve me the fruit. About that time <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> happened to quit work and came in for his daily meal. But Agathopous, who had taken the figs, began to feel hungry and ate one or two of them. He was strongly tempted to eat all of them but did not quite dare. One of his fellow slaves, seeing his affliction, said to him, Friend slave, I know you have something on your mind. You want to eat those figs. Yes, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, I do, said he, but how do you know? He said, I know the thought in your heart from the look on your face. Now, I'll give you an idea how the two of us can eat them. Well, you haven't given me a very good idea, said he, for when the master looks for his figs and we can't produce them, what's going to happen? He said, Tell him that <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> found the storeroom door conveniently open, got in, and ate the figs. Since <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> can't talk, he'll get a beating, and you'll get what you want. So saying, they sat down and started to eat the figs. As they were eating they said, Poor <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>. He's really a sad sack, good for nothing but whipping. Let's make this bargain once and for all: Whatever gets broken or lost or spilled we'll say that <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> did it, and we'll be unbeatable. And so they ate the figs. </p>                        </div>

The master, seeing that he was cheated for all his pains and learning that <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> had eaten the figs, said, Somebody call <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>. He was called, and when he came, the master said to him, You damned scoundrel, do you have so little respect for me that you would go to the storeroom and eat the figs that were set aside for me? <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> heard but couldn't talk because of the impediment in his speech, and seeing his accusers face to face, knowing he would get a beating, he threw himself at his master's knees and begged him to wait a bit. When the master acceded, he took a pitcher which he saw at hand and by gestures asked for some warm water. Then, putting a basin before him, he drank the water, put his fingers into his throat, retched, and threw up the water he had drunk. He hadn't eaten a thing. Then having proven his point through his resourcefulness, he asked that his fellow slaves do the same thing so that they might find out who it was that had eaten the figs. The master was pleased with this idea and ordered the others to drink and vomit. The other slaves said to themselves, What shall we do, Hermas? Let's drink and not put our fingers down our throat but only in our cheek. But as soon as they drank the warm water, the figs, now mixed with bile, rose up, and they no sooner removed their fingers than out came the figs. The master said, Look how you've lied against a man who can't speak. Strip them. They got their beating and learned a good lesson to the effect that when you scheme up trouble for someone else, the first thing you know, you are bringing the trouble on yourself. </p>                        </div>

[On the following day the master returned to the] city. As <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> was digging in the field, a priestess of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> happened to stray from the highway and came across the field where he was digging. Seeing him toiling away at his work and not knowing his misfortune she said, Good man, if you have any pity for mortal souls, show me the road to the city, for I have lost my way. When <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> turned around and saw a woman wearing the raiment of a goddess, being a pious man, he bowed down to her and began to make signs with his head as much as to say, Why have you left the highway and come to the farm? Seeing that he could hear but could not speak, she began to gesture and said to him, I am a stranger in these parts and a priestess, as you see, of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>. I beg of you to show me the way, for I am lost. <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> picked up the mattock with which he was digging, and taking her by the hand, he led her to a grove and put before her bread and olives from his napkin and cut wild greens and brought them to her. He pressed her to share his food, and she did. Then he took her to a spring of water and indicated that she should partake of it, too. When she had partaken of his food and drink, she offered a prayer for the finest rewards for <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>. Then again she asked him by signs to complete his kindness by showing her the way. He took her to the highway by which the wagons traveled, and when he had pointed it out, he went back and put his mind to his work. </p>                        </div>

And if you are unwilling to repay this man with a livelihood of many talents for what the other gods have taken from him, at least grant him the power of speech, for you have the power to bring back to light those things which have fallen into darkness.

I'll sleep these hours while it's hot. He picked out a spot on the farm that was green and peaceful, a wooded, shady place where all kinds of flowers bloomed amid the green grass and where a little stream wandered among the neighboring trees. There <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> threw his mattock on the ground, lay down on the grass and, putting his napkin and his sheepskin under his head, went to sleep. The stream whispered and, as a gentle zephyr blew, the leaves of the trees around about were stirred and exhaled a sweet and soothing breath. There was much humming of cicadas from the branches, and the song of birds of many kinds and many haunts was to be heard. There the nightingale prolonged her plaintive song, and the branches of the olive murmured musically in a sympathetic refrain. On the slenderest branch of a pine-tree the stirring of the breeze mocked the blackbird's call. And mingling with it all in harmony. <a href=/people/741 target=_blank>Echo</a>, the imitator of voices, uttered her answering cries. The combined sound of all these was soothing to hear and <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>, lulled by it, drifted off into a pleasant slumber. </p>                        </div>

Well done, by <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>. An acute and philosophical, indeed a marvelous, a perfect merchant! The students: What are you praising, professor? What is worthy of your admiration? Let us in on it, too. Don't begrudge us a share of the beautiful. <a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthus</a> said, Gentlemen and scholars, you must not think that philosophy consists only in what can be put in words but also in acts. Indeed, unspoken philosophy often surpasses that which is expressed in words. You can observe this in the case of dancers, how by the movement of their hands the continued motions themselves express an unspoken philosophy. You see, this man had two handsome boys and one ugly one. He put the ugly one between the handsome ones in order that his ugliness should make their beauty noticeable, for if the ugliness were not set in contrast to that which is superior to it, the appearance of the handsome ones would not have been put to the test. The students: You are marvelous, professor. How fine of you to perceive so clearly his purpose! <a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthus</a>: Very well, but come along, and let's buy one of these slaves, for I need a servant. </p>                        </div>

He replied, I'm a Cappadocian. What's your name? Liguris. <a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthus</a> said, What do you know how to do? He said, I know how to do everything. <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> stood there and burst into laughter. When the students saw him suddenly taken with a fit of laughter, his face all drawn and contorted so that only his teeth showed, they thought they were seeing some unearthly portent. They said to one another, Do you suppose this is a turnip with teeth? Another said, What did he see to laugh at? Another spoke up, He doesn't laugh, he shudders. But let's see what he has to say. He went up behind him, pulled at his robe, and said, What were you laughing at, wise guy? <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> turned around and said to him, Go away, you silly <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>. The student was nonplused at this retort and retreated. <br /><a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthus</a> said to the merchant, How much for this musician? He said, A thousand denarii.

Again <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> burst out laughing, and when the students saw this, they said, Why does he laugh at everything? Another said, If I want to be called a silly <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> again, I'll ask him once more. <br /><a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthus</a> said to the merchant, How much will you sell the teacher for? He said, three thousand denarii. When <a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthus</a> heard this, he lost interest and turned to go away. But the students said, Professor, didn't you like the slaves? Yes. he said, but it's a principle with me not to buy high-priced slaves but to be served by cheap ones. One of the students said, If you're determined not to pay high prices, buy the unsightly fellow. He'll serve you just as well, and we'll chip in to pay the price. He said, It would be ridiculous for you to pay the price and for me to buy the slave, and anyhow my wife is fussy and won't stand for having an ugly slave. The students said, Professor, most of your teachings are to the effect that one shouldn't pay attention to a woman. </p>                        </div>

It's my opinion that you are sex-crazy and don't follow your bent simply because you are afraid that I'll give you a piece of a new slave's mind, you slut. <a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthus</a>' wife said, What has brought this calamity on? <a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthus</a> said, He's already said this much to you, my dear, but watch out that he doesn't see you defecating or urinating, or you'll find <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> a regular <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>. <a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthus</a>' wife said, By the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, the little fellow seems to be spirited and tricky. I'd better make my peace with him. <a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthus</a> said, Your mistress has made her peace with you. <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> said, A great accomplishment to have tamed a woman by browbeating her. <a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthus</a> said, Bah, you runaway! </p>                        </div>

At the request, of the leader of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> (i.e. <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>), <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> gave him the gift of prophecy so that he excelled everyone in oracular skill. But the leader of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, from being marveled at by all men and habitually looking down on everyone else, got to be too boastful in everything. This angered his superior, and since he didn't want him to have so much power among men, he contrived some true dreams that would tell men in their sleep what was going to happen. When the superior of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> realized that no one was going to have any use for him and his prophecy, he asked <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> to forgive him and not to discredit his oracle. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> forgave him and contrived other dreams for men that would give them false indications in their sleep, so that once they had found the dreams inaccurate, they would fall back again on the original prophet. That's why it is that one of the second kind of dreams, when it comes, gives the impression of truth to what you see in your sleep. So don't be surprised if you see things one way in your sleep, and they turn out otherwise, for it wasn't the first kind you saw, but one of the lying ones come to trick you with false visions. </p>                        </div>

[Listen and pay attention. It's just as it is with a woman who comes to a second marriage with children by her first husband and finds her husband has children by a former wife. She is mother of the children she brings with her but a stepmother to the ones she finds. And there is a great deal of difference between the two things. She lavishes affection on the rearing of the children she has borne, but out of jealousy she hates the ones produced by someone else's birth pangs. Moreover, she shortens the rations for the latter and gives them to her own children, for she naturally loves her own and hates her husband's as strangers. It's the same with the earth. She is the mother of plants that grow spontaneously, but a stepmother to the ones you plant, and by giving more nurture to her own, she makes them flourish better than the orphans you plant. When the gardener had heard this, he said, You've relieved me of a great deal of concern. Take the vegetables as a gift. And if you want anything else, come to the garden as though it were your own.

In the course of the dinner <a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthus</a> took portions and gave them to <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>. <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> took them and put them in the basket. <a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthus</a> turned to <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> and said, Do you have all the portions? <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> said, I have. <a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthus</a> said, Then take them to her who loves me. <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> said, I will. As he went out, <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> said to himself, Now is my chance to pursue my feud with the mistress and pay her back for poking fun at me and running me down just after I was bought, for tearing up and trampling the vegetables I was given by the gardener, and for not giving my gift a chance to please the master. I'll show her that a wife can't match strength with a friendly slave. Since the master said: 'Give the portion to her who loves me,' now let him see who loves him. </p>                        </div>

But now keep these precepts as a trust. First, reverence God as is right. Honor your king, for his power deserves the same honor as that of God. Honor your professor as your parents, for you are naturally obliged to treat them well, but you should be doubly grateful to him whose affection is freely bestowed. Take good food for the day as well as you can so that you may be ready for the work of the next day and keep your health. At the king's court let whatever you hear perish within you so that you may not quickly perish yourself. Let your relations with your wife be worthy so that she may not wish to have experience of another man, for womankind is a vain thing and less likely to go astray when flattered. When in your cups do not discuss serious matters to show off your learning, for you will be tripped up in an off moment and get yourself laughed at. Keep ahead of your tongue. Do not envy those who are successful, but rejoice with them, and you will share in their good fortune, for he who is jealous unwittingly harms himself. Take care of your slaves, and share what you have with them so that they may not only obey you as their master but also honor you as their benefactor. Rule your passions. If you learn a thing later than you should, do not be ashamed, for it is better to be called a late learner than a dolt. Keep your councils from your wife, and reveal no secrets to her, for womankind is a rival in married life, and she will sit all day plotting and scheming how to get you under her control. </p>                        </div>
