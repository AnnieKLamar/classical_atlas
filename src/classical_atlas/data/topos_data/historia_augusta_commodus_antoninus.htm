For even from his earliest years he was base and dishonourable, and cruel and lewd, defiled of mouth, moreover, and debauched. 8 Even then he was an adept in certain arts which are not becoming in an emperor, for he could mould goblets and dance and sing and whistle, and he could play the buffoon and the gladiator to perfection. 9 In the twelfth year of his life, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421118UCCe class=place long=11.7921 lat=42.091>Centumcellae</a>, he gave a forecast of his cruelty. For when it happened that his bath was drawn too cool, he ordered the bathkeeper to be cast into the furnace; whereupon the slave who had been ordered to do this burned a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>-skin in the furnace, in order to make him believe by the stench of the vapour that the punishment had been carried out. <br />10 While yet a child he was given the name of Caesar, along with his brother <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a>, and in his fourteenth year he was enrolled in the college of priests. </p>                        </div>

Then he set out with his father for the German war. <br />6 The more honourable of those appointed to supervise his life he could not endure, but the most evil he retained, and, if any were dismissed, he yearned for them even to the point of falling sick. 7 When they were reinstated through his father's indulgence, he always maintained eating-houses and low resorts for them in the imperial palace. He never showed regard for either decency or expense. 8 He diced in his own home. He herded together women of unusual beauty, keeping them like purchased prostitutes in a sort of brothel for the violation of their chastity. He imitated the hucksters that strolled about from market to market. 9 He procured chariot-<a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> for his own use. He drove chariots in the garb of a professional charioteer, lived with gladiators, and conducted himself like a procurer's servant.

On this pretext he executed Paternus and <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a>, and also Vitruvius <a href=/people/1174 target=_blank>Secundus</a>, a very dear friend of Paternus, who had charge of the imperial correspondence. 9 Besides this, he exterminated the whole house of the <a href=/people/5219 target=_blank>Quintilii</a>, because Sextus, the son of Condianus, by pretending death, it was said, had made his escape in order to raise a revolt. 10 Vitrasia <a href=/people/3838 target=_blank>Faustina</a>, Velius <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a>, and <a href=/people/1779 target=_blank>Egnatius</a> <a href=/people/903 target=_blank>Capito</a>, a man of consular rank, were all slain. 11 <a href=/people/116 target=_blank>Aemilius</a> Iuncus and <a href=/people/585 target=_blank>Atilius</a> <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a>, the consuls, were driven into exile.

He fought in the arena with foils, but sometimes, with his chamberlains acting as gladiators, with sharpened swords. By this time <a href=/people/11057 target=_blank>Perennis</a> had secured all the power for himself. 6 He slew whomsoever he wished to slay, plundered a great number, violated every law, and put all the booty into his own pocket. 7 <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>, for his part, killed his sister <a href=/people/11061 target=_blank>Lucilla</a>, after banishing her to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406143ICap class=place long=14.2623 lat=40.5579>Capri</a>. 8 After debauching his other sisters, as it is said, he formed an amour with a cousin of his father, and even gave the name of his mother to one of his concubines. 9 His wife, whom he caught in adultery, he drove from his house, then banished her, and later put her to death. 10 By his orders his concubines were debauched before his own eyes, 11 and he was not free from the disgrace of intimacy with young men, defiling every part of his body in dealings with persons of either sex. <br />12 At this time <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> also, whose son had previously come into <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>' presence with a dagger, was slain, ostensibly by bandits, and many other senators were put to death, and also certain women of wealth. 13 And not a few provincials, for the sake of their riches, were charged with crimes by <a href=/people/11057 target=_blank>Perennis</a> and then plundered or even slain; 14 some, against whom there was not even the imputation of a fictitious crime, were accused of having been unwilling to name <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> as their heir. </p>                        </div>

Appointments to the provinces were uniformly sold; 10 in fact, <a href=/people/857 target=_blank>Cleander</a> sold everything for money. He loaded with honours men who were recalled from exile; he rescinded decisions of the courts. 11 Indeed, because of <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>' utter degeneracy, his power was so great that he brought <a href=/people/4905 target=_blank>Burrus</a>, the husband of <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>' sister, who was denouncing and reporting to <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> all that was being done, under the suspicion of pretending to the throne, and had him put to death; and at the same time he slew many others who defended <a href=/people/4905 target=_blank>Burrus</a>. 12 Among these Aebutianus was slain, the prefect of the guard; in his place <a href=/people/857 target=_blank>Cleander</a> himself was made prefect, together with two others whom he himself chose. 13 Then for the first time were there three prefects of the guard, among whom was a freedman, called the Bearer of the Dagger. </p>                        </div>
