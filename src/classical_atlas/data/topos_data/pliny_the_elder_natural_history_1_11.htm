Nor has fortune's grandeur made any change in you save in enabling you to bestow all the benefit you desire. Consequently as all those methods of paying you reverence are open to everybody else, to me is left only the presumption of treating you with more intimate respect. For that presumption therefore you will debit the responsibility to yourself, and will grant yourself pardon on the score of my offence. I have tried to put on a bold face, and yet have not succeeded, as your grandeur meets me by another route and the rods of office that your genius bears make me move on yet further: in no other person ever radiate more genuinely the dictatorial power of oratory and the tribunician authority of wit! How eloquently you thunder forth your father's praises and your brother's fame! How great you are in the poet's art! O mighty fertility of genius — you have contrived a way to imitate your brother also. </p>                        </div>

In the latter case I could have said: 'Why does your Highness read that? It was written for the common herd, the mob of farmers and of artisans, and after them for students who have nothing else to occupy their time: why do you put yourself on the jury? You were not on this panel when I took the contract for this undertaking: I knew you to be too great for me to think you likely to descend to this! Moreover even in the court of learning there is an official procedure for challenging the jury: it is employed even by Marcus <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, who where genius is in question stands outside all hazard... It may surprise us, but <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> calls in the aid of council — nor yet for the very learned; <a href=/people/382 target=_blank>Manius</a> <a href=/people/1515 target=_blank>Persius</a> I don't want to read this, I want <a href=/people/514 target=_blank>Junius</a> Congus. </p>                        </div>

But for my part at the present I have deprived myself of these defences by my nomination, as it matters a great deal whether one obtains a judge by lot or by one's own selection, and one's style of entertainment ranks quite differently with a guest one has invited and one who has offered himself. The candidates in a hotly contested election deposited sums of money with <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, that resolute foe of corruption, who enjoyed a defeat at the polls as an honour obtained free of charge; and they gave out that they did this in the defence of the highest among human possessions, their innocence. This was the occasion of that famous sigh of <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> — 'O happy Marcus <a href=/people/756 target=_blank>Porcius</a> whom no one dares to ask for something underhand!' Lucius <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> Asiaticus by appealing to the tribunes, one of them being <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a>, testified that his case could be made good even to an unfriendly judge: in fact a judge whom one chooses oneself one makes the supreme arbiter of one's case — this is the source of the term 'appeal.' You yourself indeed, I know, being placed on the loftiest pinnacle of all mankind, and being endowed with supreme eloquence and learning, are approached with reverential awe even by persons paying a visit of ceremony, and consequently care is taken that what is dedicated to you may be worthy of you. However, country folk, and many natives, not having incense, make offerings of milk and salted meal, and no man was ever charged with irregularity for worshipping the gods in whatever manner was within his power. </p>                        </div>

My subject is a barren one — the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, nay barbarian, words that actually have to be introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor one in which the mind is eager to range: there is not one person to be found among us who has made the same venture, nor yet one among the Greeks who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject. A large part of us seek agreeable fields of study, while topics of immeasurable abstruseness treated by others are drowned in the shadowy darkness of the theme. Deserving of treatment before all things are the subjects included by the Greeks under the name of 'Encyclic Culture'; and nevertheless they are unknown, or have been obscured by subtleties, whereas other subjects have been published so widely that they have become stale. It is a difficult task to give novelty to what is old, authority to what is new, brilliance to the commonplace, light to the obscure, attraction to the stale, credibility to the doubtful, but nature to all things and all her properties to nature. Accordingly, even if we have not succeeded, it is honourable and glorious in the fullest measure to have resolved on the attempt. </p>                        </div>

For assuredly he ought to have composed his history for the glory of the world-conquering nation and of the Roman name, not for his own; it would have been a greater merit to have persevered from love of the work, not for the sake of his own peace of mind, and to have rendered this service to the Roman nation and not to himself. As Domitus <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> says, it is not books but storehouses that are needed; consequently by perusing about 2000 volumes, very few of which, owing to the abstruseness of their contents, are ever handled by students, we have collected in 36 volumes 20,000 noteworthy facts obtained from one hundred authors that we have explored, with a great number of other facts in addition that were either ignored by our predecessors or have been discovered by subsequent experience. Nor do we doubt that there are many things that have escaped us also; for we are but human, and beset with duties, and we pursue this sort of interest in our spare moments, that is at night — lest any of your house should think that the night hours have been given to idleness. The days we devote to you, and we keep our account with sleep in terms of health, content even with this reward alone, that, while we are dallying (in <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a>'s phrase) with these trifles, we are adding hours to our life — since of a certainty to be alive means to be awake. Because of these reasons and these difficulties I dare make no promise; the very words I am writing to you are supplied by yourself. This guarantees my work, and this rates its value; many objects are deemed extremely precious just because of the fact that they are votive offerings. </p>                        </div>

Where is this work? you will enquire. The draft has long been finished and in safe keeping; and in any case it was my resolve to entrust it to my heir, to prevent its being thought that my lifetime bestowed anything on ambition: accordingly I do a good turn to those who seize the vacant position, and indeed also to future generations, who I know will challenge us to battle as we ourselves have challenged our predecessors. You will deem it a proof of this pride of mine that I have prefaced these volumes with the names of my authorities. I have done so because it is, in my opinion, a pleasant thing and one that shows an honourable modesty, to own up to those who were the means of one's achievements, not to do as most of the authors to whom I have referred did. For you must know that when collating authorities I have found that the most professedly reliable and modern writers have copied the old authors word for word, without acknowledgement, not in that valorous spirit of <a href=/people/118 target=_blank>Virgil</a>, for the purpose of rivalry, nor with the candour of <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> who in his Republic declares himself a companion of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, and in his <a href=/people/3927 target=_blank>Consolation</a> to his daughter says 'I follow <a href=/people/1532 target=_blank>Crantor</a>,' and similarly as to <a href=/people/959 target=_blank>Panaetius</a> in his De <a href=/people/6717 target=_blank>Officiis</a> — volumes that you know to be worth having in one's hands every day, nay even learning by heart.

One they entitled Κηρίον, meaning Honeycomb; others called their Kέρας 'Αμαλθείας, i.e. Horn of Plenty (so that you can hope to find a draught of hen's milk in the volume), and again Violets, <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, Hold-alls, Handbooks, Meadow, Tablet, Impromptu titles that might tempt a man to forfeit his bail. But when you get inside them, good heavens, what a void you will find between the covers! Our authors being more serious use the titles Antiquities, Instances and Systems, the wittiest, Talks by Lamplight, I suppose because the author was a toper — indeed Tippler was his name. <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> makes a rather smaller claim in his Satires A <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>-and-a-half and Folding-tablet. <a href=/people/12391 target=_blank>Diodorus</a> among the Greeks stopped playing with words and gave his history the title of Library. Indeed the philologist <a href=/people/1363 target=_blank>Apion</a> (the person whom <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius Caesar</a> used to call 'the world's cymbal,' though he might rather have been thought to be a drum, advertising his own renown) wrote that persons to whom he dedicated his compositions received from him the gift of immortality. For myself, I am not ashamed of not having invented any livelier title. And so as not to seem a downright adversary of the Greeks, I should like to be accepted on the lines of those founders of painting and sculpture who, as you will find in these volumes, used to inscribe their finished works, even the masterpieces which we can never be tired of admiring, with a provisional title such as Worked on by <a href=/people/460 target=_blank>Apelles</a> or <a href=/people/3073 target=_blank>Polyclitus</a>, as though art was always a thing in process and not completed, so that when faced by the vagaries of criticism the artist might have left him a line of retreat to indulgence, by implying that he intended, if not interrupted, to correct any defect noted. Hence it is exceedingly modest of them to have inscribed all their works in a manner suggesting that they were their latest, and as though they had been snatched away from each of them by fate. Not more than three, I fancy, are recorded as having an inscription denoting completion — Made by so-and-so (these I will bring in at their proper places); this made the artist appear to have assumed a supreme confidence in his art, and consequently all these works were very unpopular. </p>                        </div>

'What then?' he says in the book in question, 'I myself know that if certain writings are published there will be plenty of people to quibble and quarrel, but mostly people quite devoid of true distinction.

This remark dealt those declamations such a nasty blow that in cultivated circles they are thought the most shameless things extant.

To us who live within it the world glides silently alike by day and night. Stamped upon it are countless figures of animals and objects of all kinds — it is not the case, as has been stated by very famous authors, that its structure has an even surface of unbroken smoothness, like that which we observe in birds' eggs: this is proved by the evidence of the facts, since from seeds of all these objects, falling from the sky in countless numbers, particularly in the sea, and usually mixed together, monstrous shapes are generated; and also by the testimony of sight — in one place the figure of a bear, in another of a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>, in another a wain, in another a letter of the alphabet, the middle of the circle across the pole being more radiant. </p>                        </div>

Thus the mutual embrace of the unlike results in an interlacing, the light substances being prevented by the heavy ones from flying up, while on the contrary the heavy substances are held from crashing down by the upward tendency of the light ones. In this way owing to an equal urge in opposite directions the elements remain stationary, each in its own place, bound together by the unresting revolution of the world itself; and with this always running back to its starting-point, the earth is the lowest and central object in the whole, and stays suspended at the pivot of the universe and also balancing the bodies to which its suspension is due; thus being alone motionless with the universe revolving round her she both hangs attached to them all and at the same time is that on which they all rest. Upheld by the same vapour between earth and heaven, at definite spaces apart, hang the seven stars which owing to their motion we call 'planets,' although no stars wander less than they do. In the midst of these moves the sun, whose magnitude and power are the greatest, and who is the ruler not only of the seasons and of the lands; but even of the stars themselves and of the heaven. Taking into account all that he effects, we must believe him to be the soul, or more precisely the mind, of the whole world, the supreme ruling principle and divinity of nature. He furnishes the world with light and removes darkness, he obscures and he illumines the rest of the stars, he regulates in accord with nature's precedent the changes of the seasons and the continuous rebirth of the year, he dissipates the gloom of heaven and even calms the storm-clouds of the mind of man, he lends his light to the rest of the stars also; he is glorious and pre-eminent, all-seeing and even all-hearing — this I observe that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> the prince of literature held to be true in the case of the sun alone. </p>                        </div>

Whoever God is — provided there is a God — and in whatever region he is, he consists wholly of sense, sight and hearing, wholly of soul, wholly of mind, wholly of himself. To believe in gods without number, and gods corresponding to men's vices as well as to their virtues, like the Goddesses of <a href=/people/2825 target=_blank>Modesty</a>, Concord, Intelligence, <a href=/people/1068 target=_blank>Hope</a>, Honour, <a href=/people/2103 target=_blank>Mercy</a> and Faith — or else, as <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> held, only two, Punishment and Reward, reaches an even greater height of folly. Frail, toiling mortality, remembering its own weakness, has divided such deities into groups, so as to worship in sections, each the deity he is most in need of. Consequently different races have different names for the deities, and we find countless deities in the same races, even those of the lower world being classified into groups, and diseases and also many forms of plague, in our nervous anxiety to get them placated. Because of this there is actually a Temple of Fever consecrated by the nation on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LPal class=place long=12.4884 lat=41.8896>Palatine</a> Hill, and one of Bereavement at the Temple of the Household Deities, and an Altar of Misfortune on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LEsq class=place long=12.496 lat=41.895>Esquiline</a>. For this reason we can infer a larger population of celestials than of human beings, as individuals also make an equal number of gods on their own, by adopting their own private Junos and Genii; while certain nations have animals, even some loathsome ones, for gods, and many things still more disgraceful to tell of — swearing by rotten articles of food and other things of that sort. To believe even in marriages taking place between gods, without anybody all through the long ages of time being born as a result of them, and that some are always old and grey, others youths and boys, and gods with dusky complexions, winged, lame, born from eggs, living and dying on alternate days — this almost ranks with the mad fancies of children; but it passes all bounds of shamelessness to invent acts of adultery taking place between the gods themselves, followed by altercation and enmity, and the existence of deities of theft and of crime. For mortal to aid mortal — this is god; and this is the road to eternal glory: by this road went our Roman chieftains, by this road now proceeds with heavenward step, escorted by his children, the greatest ruler of all time, His Majesty <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, coming to the succour of an exhausted world. To enrol such men among the deities is the most ancient method of paying them gratitude for their benefactions. In fact the names of the other gods, and also of the stars that I have mentioned above, originated from the services of men: at all events who would not admit that it is the interpretation of men's characters that prompts them to call each other <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> or <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a> or other names, and that originates the nomenclature of heaven? That that supreme being, whatever it be, pays heed to man's affairs is a ridiculous notion. Can we believe that it would not be defiled by so gloomy and so multifarious a duty? Can we doubt it? It is scarcely pertinent to determine which is more profitable for the human race, when some men pay no regard to the gods at all and the regard paid by others is of a shameful nature: they serve as the lackeys of foreign ritual, and they carry gods on their fingers; also they pass sentence of punishment upon the monsters they worship, and devise elaborate viands for them; they subject themselves to awful tyrannies, so as to find no repose even in sleep; they do not decide on marriage or having a family or indeed anything else except by the command of sacrifices; others cheat in the very <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> and swear false oaths by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> who wields the thunderbolts — and these indeed make a profit out of their crimes, whereas the others are penalized by their religious observances. </p>                        </div>

To her is debited all that is spent and credited all that is received, she alone fills both pages in the whole of mortals' account; and we are so much at the mercy of chance that Chance herself, by whom God is proved uncertain, takes the place of God. Another set of people banishes fortune also, and attributes events to its star and to the laws of birth, holding that for all men that ever are to be God's decree has been enacted once for all, while for the rest of time leisure has been vouchsafed to Him. This belief begins to take root, and the learned and unlearned mob alike go marching on towards it at the double: witness the warnings drawn from lightning, the forecasts made by oracles, the prophecies of augurs, and even inconsiderable trifles — a sneeze, a stumble — counted as omens. His late Majesty put abroad a story that on the day on which he was almost overthrown by a mutiny in the army he had put his left boot on the wrong foot. This series of instances entangles unforeseeing mortality, so that among these things but one thing is in the least certain — that nothing certain exists, and that nothing is more pitiable, or more presumptuous, than man! inasmuch as with the rest of living creatures their sole anxiety is for the means of life, in which nature's bounty of itself suffices, the one blessing indeed that is actually preferable to every other being the fact that they do not think about glory, money, ambition, and above all death. </p>                        </div>

But the chief consolations for nature's imperfection in the case of man are that not even for God are all things possible — for he cannot, even if he wishes, commit suicide, the supreme boon that he has bestowed on man among all the penalties of life, nor bestow eternity on mortals or recall the deceased, nor cause a man that has lived not to have lived or one that has held high office not to have held it — and that he has no power over what is past save to forget it, and (to link our fellowship with God by means of frivolous arguments as well) that he cannot cause twice ten not to be twenty, or do many things on similar lines: which facts unquestionably demonstrate the power of nature, and prove that it is this that we mean by the word 'God.'

We have stated that the stars are attached to the firmament, not assigned to each of us in the way in which the vulgar believe, and dealt out to mortals with a degree of radiance proportionate to the lot of each, the brightest stars to the rich, the smaller ones to the poor, the dim to those who are worn out; they do not each rise with their own human being, nor indicate by their fall that someone's life is being extinguished. There is no such close alliance between us and the sky that the radiance of the stars there also shares our fate of mortality. When the stars are believed to fall, what happens is that owing to their being overfed with a draught of liquid they give back the surplus with a fiery flash, just as with us also we see this occur with a stream of oil when lamps are lit. But the heavenly bodies have a nature that is eternal — they interweave the world and are blended with its weft; yet their potency has a powerful influence on the earth, indeed it is owing to the effects that they produce and to their brilliance and magnitude that it has been possible for them to become known with such a degree of precision, as we shall show in the proper place. Also the system of the revolutions of the sky will be more appropriately stated when we deal with geography, since it is entirely related to the earth; only we must not postpone the discoveries that have been made as to the zodiac. Tradition says that <a href=/people/1151 target=_blank>Anaximander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=person long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a> in the fifty-eighth Olympiad was the first person to discover the obliquity of the zodiac, that is, to open the portals of science; and that next <a href=/people/4123 target=_blank>Cleostratus</a> explained the signs in it, beginning with the Ram and the Archer; the firmament itself having been explained long before by <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a>. </p>                        </div>

The following points are certain: (1) The star called <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a>'s is the highest and consequently looks the smallest and revolves in the largest orbit, returning in thirty years at the shortest to its initial station. (2) The motions of all the planets, and among them the sun and moon, follow a course contrary to that of the world, namely to the left, the world always running to the right. (3) Although they are borne on by it and carried westward with an unceasing revolution of immeasurable velocity, nevertheless they travel with an opposite motion along their respective tracks. (4) Thus it comes about that the air is not massed in a dull lethargic ball by revolving in the same direction because of the eternal rotation of the world, but is scattered into separate portions by the opposite impact of the stars. (5) <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a> is of a cold and frozen nature. The orbit of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> is much below it and therefore revolves much faster, completing one rotation every twelve years. The third star is <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, called by some <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>; owing to the proximity of the sun it has a fiery glow; it revolves once in about two years, and consequently, owing to its excessive heat and <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a>'s frost, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> being situated between them combines the influence of each and is rendered healthy. (6) Next, the sun's course is divided into 360 parts, but in order that an observation taken of the shadows that it casts may come round to the starting-point, five and a quarter days per annum are added; consequently to every fourth a year an intercalary day is added to make our chronology tally with the course of the sun. </p>                        </div>

This property of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> was first discovered by <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=person long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a> about the 42nd Olympiad, [612-609 BC] 142 years after the foundation of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. Further it surpasses all the other stars in magnitude, and is so brilliant that alone among stars it casts a shadow by its rays. Consequently there is a great competition to give it a name, some having called it <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>, others <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>, others the <a href=/people/11088 target=_blank>Mother of the Gods</a>.

It completes the circuit of the zodiac every 348 days, and according to <a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaeus</a> is never more than 46 degrees distant from the sun. The star next to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> is <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a>, by some called <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>; it has a similar orbit, but is by no means similar in magnitude or power.

Consequently the course of these stars also is peculiar, and not shared by those above-mentioned: those are often observed to be a quarter or a third of the heaven away from the sun and travelling against the sun, and they all have other larger circuits of full revolution, the specification of which belongs to the theory of the Great Years. </p>                        </div>

The vast size of the sun will be shown with the more certainty from the two bodies, so that there is no need to investigate its size by the evidence of the eyes and by logical inference, arguing that it is immeasurably large for the following reasons: (1) the shadow that it throws of rows of trees along the balks of fields are at equal distances apart for ever so many miles, just as if over the whole space the sun were in the centre; (2) during the equinoxes it reaches the vertical simultaneously for all the inhabitants of the southern region; (3) the shadows of the people living round the Tropic of Cancer fall northward at midday but westward at sunrise, which could not happen unless the sun were much larger than the earth; (4) when it is rising its breadth exceeds Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352248LIda class=place long=24.7708 lat=35.2263>Ida</a>, overlapping it widely right and left — and that though it is separated from it by so great a distance. </p>                        </div>

Indeed, this is also proved by the silent testimony of nature herself; for why in the division of the turns of the year does the winter sun retire, so as to refresh the earth with the darkness of the nights? when otherwise it would unquestionably scorch up the earth, and even as it is does so in a certain part, so great is its magnitude. </p>                        </div>

The stars we have mentioned travel through the zodiac, and the only habitable part of the earth is what lies beneath it — all the other parts towards the poles are frost-bound. Only the planet <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> goes two degrees outside the zodiac; this is understood to be the reason that causes some animals to be born even in the desert places of the world. The moon also wanders through the whole of its breadth, but without going at all outside it. The planet <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a> diverges very widely from these, but without wandering over more than 6 of the 12 degrees of latitude of the zodiac, and these 6 not uniformly but two in the middle of the zodiac, four above it and two below it. Then the sun travels unevenly in the middle of the zodiac between the two halves with a wavy serpentine course, the planet <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> over 4 degrees in the middle, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> one in the middle and two above it, <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a> two like the sun. This will be the principle of the latitudes of the planets when setting towards the South or rising towards the North. Most people have supposed that with this system agrees also the third mentioned above, that of their rising from the earth to the sky, and that this ascent also is made simultaneously; but this is a mistake.

It is similarly admitted that their velocity increases as long as they are in the neighbourhood of the earth and decreases when they withdraw from it to a height: this theory is specially supported by the apogees of the moon. It is equally undoubted that the three higher ones moreover increase their motion in their morning risings and diminish it from their first (morning) stations to their second (evening) stations. In view of these facts it will be evident that the latitudes are ascended from their morning rising, because in that state their acceleration first begins to diminish, but in their first stations their altitude also is ascended, since then the numbers first begin to be reduced and the stars begin to recede. The reason for this must especially be given. When struck in the degree that we stated and by a triangular ray of the sun they are prevented from pursuing a straight course, and are lifted upward by the fiery force. This cannot be directly perceived by our sight, and therefore they are thought to be stationary, which has given rise to the term 'station.' Then the violent force of the same ray advances and compels them by the impact of the heat to retire. This occurs much more at their evening rising, when they are driven out to the top of their apsides by the full opposing force of the sun, and appear very small because they are at the distance of their greatest altitude and are moving with their smallest velocity — which is proportionately smaller when this occurs in the highest signs of their apsides. From their evening rise their altitude is descended with a velocity now decelerating less and less, but not accelerating before their second stations, when their altitude also is descended, the ray passing above them from the other side and pressing them down again to the earth with the same force as that with which it had raised them to the sky from the former triangle. So much difference does it make whether the rays come from below or from above, and the same things occur far more in the evening setting. </p>                        </div>

As situated below the sun both have arcs that are the opposite of those of the other planets, and as much of their circle is below the earth as that of the planets mentioned before is above it; and they cannot be further from it than they are because the curve of their arcs does not allow greater elongation there; consequently the edges of their arcs put a limit on a similar principle for each, and compensate for the dimensions of their longitude by the enlargement of their latitude. But, it will be objected, why do they not reach 46 and 23 degrees always? As a matter of fact they do, but the explanation escapes the theorists. For it is manifest that even their arcs alter, because they never cross the sun; accordingly when the edges have fallen on one side or the other into the actual degree of the sun, then the stars also are understood to have reached their longest distances, but when the edges are short of that, they themselves too are compelled to return with proportionately greater velocity, since with each of them that is always the extreme limit. </p>                        </div>

The former travel backward from their morning to their evening station, the planet <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> from her evening to her morning station. But she begins to climb her latitude after her morning rise, but after her morning station to ascend her altitude and follow the sun, being swiftest and highest at her morning setting; whereas she begins to descend in latitude and decelerate after her evening rising, and to turn back and simultaneously to descend in altitude after her evening station; on the other hand the planet <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a> begins to climb in both ways after his morning rising, but after his evening rising to descend in latitude, and following the sun at an interval of 15 degrees he stands motionless for almost four days. Afterwards he descends from his altitude and proceeds back from his evening setting to his morning rise.

The majority of writers, however, have stated that the clouds rise to a height of 111 miles. These figures are really unascertained and impossible to disentangle, but it is proper to put them forward became they have been put forward already, although they are matters in which the method of geometrical inference, which never misleads, is the only method that it is possible not to reject, were anybody desirous of pursuing such questions more deeply, and with the intention of establishing not precise measurement (for to aspire to that would mark an almost insane absorption in study) but merely a conjectural calculation. For since it appears from the sun's revolution that the circle through which its orb travels extends nearly 366 degrees, and since the diameter of a circle always measures a little less than ⅓ + 1/21 of the circumference, it appears that, as half the circle is subtracted by the interposition of the earth at the centre, the measure of the sun's altitude comprises about tth of this conjecturally estimated immense space of the solar circle round the earth, and the moon's altitude tth, since the moon runs in a circuit that is much shorter than the sun's; so that it comes between the sun and the earth. It is marvellous to what length the depravity of man's intellect will go when lured on by some trifling success, in the way in which reason furnishes impudence with its opportunity in the case of the calculations above stated. And when they have dared to guess the distances of the sun from the earth they apply the same figures to the sky, on the ground that the sun is at its centre, with the consequence that they have at their finger's ends the dimensions of the world also. For they argue that the circumference of a circle is us times its diameter, as though the measure of the heavens were merely regulated from a plumb-line!

There are also stars that suddenly come to birth in the heaven itself; of these there are several kinds. The Greeks call them 'comets,' in our language 'long-haired stars,' because they have a blood-red shock of what looks like shaggy hair at their top. The Greeks also give the name of 'bearded stars' to those from whose lower part spreads a mane resembling a long beard. 'Javelin-stars' quiver like a dart; these are a very terrible portent. To this class belongs the comet about which <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a> Imperator Caesar in his 5th consulship wrote an account in his famous poem, that being its latest appearance down to the present day. The same stars when shorter and sloping to a point have been called 'Daggers'; these are the palest of all in colour, and have a gleam like the flash of a sword, and no rays, which even the Quoit-star, which resembles its name in appearance but is in colour like amber, emits in scattered form from its edge. The 'Tub-star' presents the shape of a cask, with a smoky light all round it. The 'Horned star' has the shape of a horn, like the one that appeared when Greece fought the decisive battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380236ASSB class=place long=23.573 lat=37.952>Salamis</a>. The 'Torch-star' resembles glowing torches, the '<a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>Horse</a>-star <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>' manes in very rapid motion and revolving in a circle. There also occurs a shining comet whose silvery tresses glow so brightly that it is scarcely possible to look at it, and which displays within it a shape in the likeness of a man's countenance. There also occur '<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>Goat</a> comets,' enringed with a sort of cloud resembling tufts of hair. Once hitherto it has happened that a 'Mane-shaped' comet changed into a spear; this was in the 108th [348-345 BC] Olympiad, AUC 408 [346 BC]. The shortest period of visibility on record for a comet is 7 days, the longest 80. </p>                        </div>

Comets also occur in the winter months and at the south pole, but comets in the south have no rays. A terrible comet was seen by the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, to which <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a> the king of that period gave his name; it had a fiery appearance and was twisted like a coil, and it was very grim to behold: it was not really a star so much as what might be called a ball of fire. Planets and all other stars also occasionally have spreading hair. But sometimes there is a comet in the western sky, usually a terrifying star and not easily expiated: for instance, during the civil disorder in the consulship of <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, and again during the war between <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, or in our day about the time of the poisoning which secured the bequest of the empire by <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius Caesar</a> to <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, and thereafter during <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>'s principate shining almost continuously and with a terrible glare. People think that it matters in what direction a comet darts, what star's strength it borrows, what shapes it resembles, and in what places it shines; that if it resembles a pair of flutes. It is a portent for the art of music, in the private parts of the constellations it portends immorality, if it forms an equilateral triangle or a rectangular quadrilateral in relation to certain positions of the fixed stars, it portends men of genius and a revival of learning, in the head of the Northern or the Southern Serpent it brings poisonings. </p>                        </div>

Now the remaining noteworthy facts as to the heavens: for the name 'heaven' was also given by our ancestors to this which is otherwise designated 'air' — the whole of that apparently empty space which pours forth this breath of life. This region below the moon, and a long way below it (as I notice is almost universally agreed), blends together an unlimited quantity from the upper element of air and an unlimited quantity of terrestrial vapour, being a combination of both orders. From it come clouds, thunder-claps and also thunderbolts, hail, frost, rain, storms and whirlwinds; from it come most of mortals' misfortunes, and the warfare between the elements of nature. The force of the stars presses down terrestrial objects that strive to move towards the sky, and also draws to itself things that lack spontaneous levitation. Rain falls, clouds rise, rivers dry up, hailstorms sweep down; rays scorch, and impinging from every side on the earth in the middle of the world, then are broken and recoil and carry with them the moisture they have drunk up. Steam falls from on high and again returns on high. Empty winds sweep down, and then go back again with their plunder. So many living creatures draw their breath from the upper air; but the air strives in the opposite direction, and the earth pours back breath to the sky as if to a vacuum. Thus as nature swings to and fro like a kind of sling, discord is kindled by the velocity of the world's motion. Nor is the battle allowed to stand still, but is continually carried up and whirled round, displaying in an immense globe that encircles the world the causes of things, continually overspreading another and another heaven interwoven with the clouds. This is the realm of the winds. consequently their nature is here pre-eminent, and almost includes all the rest of the phenomena caused by the air, as most men attribute the hurling of thunderbolts and lightning to the winds' violence, and indeed hold that the cause of the rain of stones that sometimes occurs is that the stones are caught up by the wind; and likewise many other things. On this account more facts have to be set out at the same time. </p>                        </div>

For who can doubt that summer and winter and the yearly vicissitudes observed in the seasons are caused by the motion of the heavenly bodies? Therefore as the nature of the sun is understood to control the year's seasons, so each of the other stars also has a force of its own that creates effects corresponding to its particular nature. Some are productive of moisture dissolved into liquid, others of moisture hardened into frost or coagulated into snow or frozen into hail, others of a blast of air, others of warmth or heat, others of dew, others of cold. But it must not be thought that the stars are of the size that they appear to the sight, since the consideration of their immense altitude proves that none of them is smaller than the moon. Consequently each of them exercises its own nature in its own motion, a fact which the transits of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a> in particular make clear by their storms of rain. Nor does this power belong to the moving stars only, but also to many those that are fixed to the sky, whenever they are impelled forward by the approach of the planets or goaded on by the impact of their rays, as we observe occurring in the case of the Little <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>Pigs</a>, the Greek name for which is consequently the <a href=/people/1564 target=_blank>Hyades</a>, a word denoting rain.

Some men are paralysed by a star, others suffer periodic disturbances of the stomach or sinews or bead or mind. The olive and white poplar and willow turn round their leaves at the solstice. Fleabane hung up in the house to dry flowers exactly on midwinter day, and inflated skins burst. This may surprise one who does not notice in daily experience that one plant, called heliotrope, always looks towards the sun as it passes and at every hour of the day turns with it, even when it is obscured by a cloud. Indeed persistent research has discovered that the influence of the moon causes the shells of oysters, cockles and all shell-fish to grow larger and again smaller in bulk, and moreover that the phases of the moon affect the tissues of the shrewmouse, and that the smallest animal, the ant, is sensitive to the influence of the planet and at the time of the new moon is always slack.

And I agree that these produce storms, and if there is wind or steam struggling in the cloud, it gives out claps of thunder, if it bursts out on fire, flashes of lightning, if it forces its way on a longer track, heat-lightning. The latter cleaves the cloud, the flashes burst through it, and thunder-claps are the blows of the fires colliding, causing fiery cracks at once to flash out in the clouds. It is also possible for breath emerging from the earth, when pressed down by the counter-impact of the stars, to be checked by a cloud and so cause thunder, nature choking down the sound while the struggle goes on but the crash sounding when the breath bursts out, as when a skin is stretched by being blown into. It is also possible for this breath, whatever it is, to be set on fire by the friction during its headlong progress. It is also possible for it to be struck out by the impact of the clouds, as by that of two stones, with heat-lightning flashing out like sparks. But all these occurrences are accidental — they cause mere senseless and ineffectual thunder-claps, as their coming obeys no principle of nature — they merely cleave mountains and seas, and all their other blows are ineffectual; but the former are prophetical and sent from on high, they come by fixed causes and from their own stars. </p>                        </div>

This also practically applies to all the winds whose positions I shall give afterwards, although every leap-year they come a day earlier, but they keep the regular rule in the period that follows. Certain persons give the name Chelidonias to the West wind on the 19th February, owing to the appearance of the swallow, but some call it Ornithias, from the arrival of the birds on the 71st day after the shortest day, when it blows for nine days. Opposite to the West wind is the wind that we have called <a href=/people/6959 target=_blank>Subsolanus</a> (E.). The rise of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> in the same degrees of <a href=/people/94 target=_blank>Taurus</a> on May 10 brings summer; it is a period of South wind, <a href=/people/1011 target=_blank>Auster</a>, the opposite of <a href=/people/208 target=_blank>Septentrio</a>. But in the hottest period of summer the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a>-star rises, when the sun is entering the first degree of <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> — this day is July 17. The <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a>-star's rise is preceded for about eight days by North-east winds: these are called the Forerunners. But two days after his rising the North-east winds begin again, and continue blowing steadily for 30 days; these are called <a href=/people/12230 target=_blank>Etesian</a> or Annual winds. They are believed to be softened by the sun's warmth being reinforced by the heat of the star; and they are the most regular of any of the winds. They are followed in turn by South winds, continuing to the rise of <a href=/people/7290 target=_blank>Areturus</a>, which occurs 40 days before the autumnal equinox. With the equinox begins the North-west wind; this, the opposite of <a href=/people/2459 target=_blank>Volturnus</a>, marks the beginning of autumn. About 44 days after the autumnal equinox the setting of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> marks the beginning of winter, which it is customary to date on November 11; this is the period of the winter Aquilo, which is very unlike the summer one mentioned above; it is opposite to the South-west wind. But for six days before the shortest day and six days after it the sea calms down for the breeding of the halcyons from which these days derive their name. The rest of the time there is wintry weather. However, not even the fury of the storms closes the sea; <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> first compelled men by the threat of death to rush into death and venture on the winter seas, but now avarice exercises the same compulsion. </p>                        </div>

The North-west and South-east are dry, except when they are falling. The North-east and North are snow winds; the North brings hailstorms, and so does the North-west. The South wind is hot, the South-east and West warm; the latter are also drier than the East wind, and in general all the northerly and westerly winds are drier than the southerly and easterly. The healthiest of all is the North wind; the South is harmful, and more so when dry, perhaps because when damp it is colder; living creatures are believed to be less hungry when it is blowing. <a href=/people/12230 target=_blank>Etesian</a> winds usually cease at night and rise at eight o'clock in the morning; in Spain and Asia they are East winds, on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Black Sea</a> North, and in other regions South. But they also begin to blow at midwinter then they are called the Bird-winds), but more gently and only for a few days. Two winds also change their nature with their geographical position: the South wind in Africa is fine and the North-east cloudy. All the winds blow in their own turns, usually the one opposite to the one that ceases beginning. When those next to the ones falling rise, they go round from left to right a like the sun. The fourth moon usually decides about the course of the winds for the month. Vessels by means of slacking sheets can sail in contrary directions with the same winds, so that collisions occur, usually at night, between ships on opposite tacks. The South wind causes larger waves than the Northeast because the former being below blows from the bottom of the sea but the latter from the top; consequently earthquakes following South winds are specially destructive. The South wind is more violent at night and the North-east wind in the day-time; and easterly winds continue longer than westerly. North winds usually stop after blowing an odd number of days, an observation that holds good in many other departments of nature also: this is why the odd numbers are thought to be masculine. The sun both increases and reduces the force of the wind — the former when rising and setting, the latter at midday in summer seasons; consequently the winds are usually lulled at midday or midnight, because either excessive cold or excessive heat makes them slack. Also winds are lulled by rain; but they are most to be expected from quarters where the clouds have broken, revealing a clear sky. </p>                        </div>

If travelling with a heavier momentum they burst a great gap in a dry cloud, they produce a storm called by the Greeks a cloudburst; but if they break out from a downward curve of cloud with a more limited rotation, they cause a whirl unaccompanied by fire — I mean by lightning — that is called a typhoon, which denotes a whirling cloudburst. This brings down with it a portion of heat torn from a cloud, which it turns and whirls round, increasing its own downward velocity by its weight, and shifting from place to place with a rapid whirl; it is specially disastrous to navigators, as it twists round and shatters not only the yards, but the vessels themselves, leaving only the slender remedy of pouring out vinegar in advance of its approach, vinegar being a very cold substance.

It differs from a fiery pillar in the way in which a flame differs from a fire: a fiery pillar spreads out its blast widely, whereas a thunderbolt masses together its onrush. On the other hand a tornado differs from a whirlwind by returning, and as a whiz differs from a crash; a storm is different from either in its extent — it is caused by the scattering rather than the bursting of a cloud. There also occurs a darkness caused by a cloud shaped like a wild monster — this is direful to sailors.

And those that fall from the nearer elements are supposed to come out of the earth because they leave no traces as a result of their rebound, although that is the principle not of a downward blow but of a slanting one.

It takes a bold man to believe that Nature obeys the behests of ritual, and equally it takes a dull man to deny that ritual has beneficent powers, when knowledge has made such progress even in the interpretation of thunderbolts that it can prophecy that others will come on a fixed day, and whether they will destroy a previous one or other previous ones that are concealed: this progress has been made by public and private experiments in both fields. In consequence although such indications are certain in some cases but doubtful in others, and approved to some persons but in the view of others to be condemned, in accordance with Nature's will and pleasure, we for our part are not going to leave out the rest of the things worth recording in this department. </p>                        </div>

Of these the most formidable are those lying between West and North. Hence the line of approach and the line of retirement of thunderbolts is of very great importance.

She belongs to men as the sky belongs to God: she receives us at birth, and gives us nurture after birth, and when once brought forth she upholds us always, and at the last when we have now been disinherited by the rest of nature she embraces us in her bosom and at that very time gives us her maternal shelter; sanctified by no service more than that whereby she makes us also sacred, even bearing our monuments and epitaphs and prolonging our name and extending our memory against the shortness of time; whose divinity is the last which in anger we invoke to lie heavy on those who are now no more, as though we did not know that she is the only element that is never wroth with man. Water rises in mist, freezes into hail, swells in waves, falls headlong in torrents; air becomes thick with clouds and rages with storms; but earth is kind and gentle and indulgent, ever a handmaid in the service of mortals, producing under our compulsion, or lavishing of her own accord, what scents and savours, what juices, what surfaces for the touch, what colours! how honestly she repays the interest lent her! what produce she fosters for our benefit! since for living creatures that are noxious the breath of life is to blame — she is compelled to receive them when their seed is sown and to maintain them when they have been born; but their harm lies in the evils of those that generate them. When a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> has stung a man she harbours it no more, and she exacts retribution even on the account of the helpless; she produces medicinal herbs, and is ever fertile for man's benefit; nay, even poisons she may be thought to have invented out of compassion for us, lest, when we were weary of life, hunger, the death most alien to earth's beneficence, should consume us with slow decay, lest precipices should scatter in fragments our lacerated body, lest departure it is seeking; lest if we sought death in the deep our burial should serve for fodder; lest the torture of the steel should cleave our body. So is it! in mercy did she generate the potion whereof the easiest draught — as men drink when thirsty — gifts might painlessly just blot us out, without injury to the body or loss of blood, in such wise that when dead no birds nor beasts should touch us, and one that had perished for himself should be preserved for the earth. Let us own the truth: what earth has produced as a cure for our ills, we have made into a deadly poison; why, do we not also put her indispensable gift of iron to a similar use? Nor yet should we have any right to complain even if she had engendered poison to serve the purpose of crime. In fact in regard to one of nature's elements we have no gratitude. For what luxuries and for what outrageous uses does she not subserve mankind? She is flung into the sea, or dug away to allow us to let in the channels. Water, iron, wood, fire, stone, growing crops, are employed to torture her at all hours, and much more to make her minister to our luxuries than our sustenance. Yet in order to make the sufferings inflicted on her surface and mere outer skin seem endurable, we probe her entrails, digging into her veins of gold and silver and mines of copper and lead; we actually drive shafts down into the depth to search for gems and certain tiny stones; we drag out her entrails, we seek a jewel merely to be worn upon a finger! How many hands are worn away with toil that a single knuckle may shine resplendent! If any beings of the nether world existed, assuredly even they would have been dug up ere now by the burrowings of avarice and luxury. And can we wonder if earth has also generated some creatures for our harm? since the wild animals, I well believe, are her guardians, and protect her from sacrilegious hands; do not <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a> infest our mines, do we not handle veins of gold mingled with the roots of poison? Yet that shows the goddess all the kinder towards us, because all these avenues from which wealth issues lead but to crime and slaughter and warfare, and her whom we besprinkle with our blood we cover with unburied bones, over which nevertheless, when at length our madness has been finally discharged, she draws herself as a veil, and hides even the crimes of mortals. I would reckon this too among the crimes of our ingratitude, that we are ignorant of her nature. </p>                        </div>

This is the consequence of the very nature of things, it is not due to the same causes as those we have adduced in the case of the heaven; for in the heaven the convex hollow converges on itself and from all sides rests upon its pivot, the earth, whereas the earth being a solid dense mass rises like an object swelling, and expands outward. The world converges to its centre, whereas the earth radiates outward from its centre, the ceaseless revolution of the world around her forcing her immense globe into the shape of a sphere. </p>                        </div>

There is an intermediate theory that is acceptable even to the unlearned crowd — that the earth is of the shape of an irregular globe, resembling a pine cone, yet nevertheless is inhabited all round. But what is the good of this theory when there arises another marvel, that the earth herself hangs suspended and does not fall and carry us with it? As if forsooth there were any doubt about the force of breath, especially when shut up inside the world, or as if it were possible for the earth to fall when nature opposes, and denies it any place to fall to For just as the sole abode of fires is in the element of fire, and of waters in water, and of breath in breath, so earth, barred out by all the other elements, has no place except in itself. Yet it is surprising that with this vast level expanse of sea and plains the resulting formation is a globe. This view has the support of <a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a>, a savant of the first rank, who with the support of royal patrons took the measurement of mountains, and published that the highest of them was <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394230LPel class=place long=23.046 lat=39.437>Pelion</a>, with an altitude of 1250 paces [above 6000 feet] inferring that this was no portion of the earth's general sphericity.

Nevertheless nothing else in the natural world is more visibly manifest. For (1) hanging drops of liquid always take the shape of small round globes; (2) when dropped on dust or placed on the downy surface of leaves they are seen to be absolutely spherical; (3) in goblets when filled the surface curves upward most at the centre, though owing to the transparency of the liquid and its fluidity tending to find its own level this is more easily discovered by theory than by observation; and (4) a still more remarkable fact is that when a very little additional liquid is poured into a cup that has already been filled the surplus overflows, but the opposite happens when weighty solids, often as many as 20 coins, are put into it, presumably because these pass inside the liquid and raise its surface to a peak, whereas liquids poured on to the upward curving surface slip off. (5) The same cause explains why the land is not visible from the deck of a ship when in sight from the masthead; and why as a vessel passes far into the distance, if some shining object is tied to the top of the mast it appears slowly to sink and finally it is hidden from sight. Lastly (6) what other conformation could have caused the ocean, which we acknowledge to be at the extreme outside, to cohere and not fall away, if there is no boundary beyond to enclose it? The very question as to how, although the sea is globular in shape, its edge does not fall away, itself ranks with the marvellous. On the other side the Greek investigators, greatly to their delight and to their glory, prove by subtle mathematical reasoning that it cannot possibly be the case that the seas are really flat and have the shape that they appear to have. For, they argue, while it is the ease that water travels downward from an elevation, and this is its admitted nature, and nobody doubts that the water on any coast has reached the farthest point allowed by the slope of the earth, it is manifest beyond doubt that the lower an object is the nearer it is to the centre of the earth, and that all the lines drawn from the centre to the nearest bodies of water are shorter than those drawn from the edge of these waters to the farthest point in the sea: it therefore follows that all the water from every direction converges towards the centre, this pressure inward being the cause of its not falling off. </p>                        </div>

This theory shows clearly why the seas do not increase in bulk with the daily accession of so many rivers. The consequence is that the earth at every point of its globe is encircled and engirdled by sea flowing round it, and this does not need theoretical investigation, but has already been ascertained by experience. </p>                        </div>

On this subject a remarkable and immortal inspiration is attributed (if we can believe it) to the natural philosopher <a href=/people/1151 target=_blank>Anaximander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=person long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a>, who is said to have warned the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> to be careful of their city and buildings, because an earthquake was impending; and subsequently the whole of their city collapsed, and also a large part of Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370223LTay class=place long=22.35 lat=36.9535>Taygetus</a> projecting in the shape of a ship's stern broke off and crashing down on it added to the catastrophe.

Assuming the truth of these stories, how far pray can such men even in their lifetime be thought to differ from a god? And though these matters may be left to the estimation of individual judgment; I think it indubitable that their cause is to be attributed to the winds; for tremors of the earth never occur except when the sea is calm and the sky so till that birds are unable to soar because all the Breath that carries them has been withdrawn; and never except after wind, doubtless because then the blast has been shut up in the veins and hidden bob lows of the sky. And a trembling in the earth is not different from a thunderclap in a cloud, and a fissure is no different from when an imprisoned current of air by struggling and striving to go forth to freedom causes a flash of lightning to burst out. </p>                        </div>

They are however preceded or accompanied by a terrible sound, that sometimes resembles a rumble, sometimes the lowing of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> or the shouts of human beings or the clash of weapons struck together, according to the nature of the material that receives the shock and the shape of the caverns or burrows through which it passes, proceeding with smaller volume in a narrow channel but with a harsh noise in channels that bend, echoing in hard channels, bubbling in damp ones, forming waves in stagnant ones, raging against solid ones. Accordingly even without any movement occurring a sound is sometimes emitted. And sometimes the earth is not shaken in a simple manner but trembles and vibrates. Also the gap sometimes remains open, showing the objects that it has sucked in, while sometimes it hides them by closing its mouth and drawing soil over it again in such a way as to leave no traces; it being usually cities that are engulfed, and a tract of farmland swallowed, although seaboard districts are most subject to earthquakes, and also mountainous regions are not free from disaster of the kind: I have ascertained that tremors have somewhat frequently occurred in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425136LApe class=place long=13.567 lat=42.47>Apennines</a>. </p>                        </div>

The safest parts of buildings are arches, also angles of walls, and posts, which swing back into position with each alternate thrust; and walls built of clay bricks suffer less damage from being shaken. There is also a great difference in the actual kind of movement, as the earth shakes in several ways; there is least danger when it quivers with a trembling rattle of the buildings, and when it rises in a swell and settles back again, with an alternating motion; also no harm is done when buildings collide and ram against each other, as the one motion counteracts the other. A waving bend and a sort of billowy fluctuation is dangerous, or when the whole movement drives in one direction. Earthquakes stop when the wind has found an outlet, or else, if they go on, they do not stop before forty days, and usually even longer, some in fact having gone on for one or two years' time. </p>                        </div>

But the rise and fall of the tides of the sea is extremely mysterious, at all events in its irregularity; however the cause lies in the sun and moon. Between two risings of the moon there are two high and two low tides every 24 hours, the tide first swelling as the world moves upward with the moon, then falling as it slopes from the midday summit of the sky towards sunset, and again coming in as after sunset the world goes below the earth to the lowest parts of the heaven and approaches the regions opposite to the meridian, and from that point sucking back until it rises again; and never flowing back at the same time as the day before, just as if gasping for breath as the greedy star draws the seas with it at a draught and constantly rises from another point than the day before; yet returning at equal intervals and in every six hours, not of each day or night or place but equinoctial hours, so that the tidal periods are not equal by the space of ordinary hours whenever the tides occupy larger measures of either diurnal or nocturnal hours, and only equal everywhere at the equinox. It is a vast and illuminating proof, and one of even divine utterance, that those are dull of wit who deny that the same stars pass below the earth and rise up again, and that they present a similar appearance to the lands and indeed to the whole of nature in the same processes of rising and setting, the course or other operation of a star being manifest beneath the earth in just the same way as when it is travelling past our eyes. </p>                        </div>

When the moon is northward and retiring further from the earth the tides are gentler than when she has swerved towards the south and exerts her force at a nearer angle. At every eighth year the tides are brought back at the hundredth circuit of the moon to the beginnings of their motion and to corresponding stages of increase. They make all these increases owing to the yearly influences of the sun, swelling most at the two equinoxes and more at the autumn than the spring one, but empty at mid-winter and more so at midsummer. Nevertheless this does not occur at the exact points of time I have specified, but a few days after, just as it is not at full or new moon but afterwards, and not immediately when the world shows or hides the moon or slopes it in the middle quarter, but about two equinoctial hours later, the effect of all the occurrences in the sky reaching the earth more slowly than the sight of them, as is the case with lightning, thunder and thunderbolts. </p>                        </div>

When the Vespasians were emperors and censors, in the year from its building 826, the circumference of the walls which surrounded it was thirteen miles and two-fifths. Surrounding as it does the Seven Hills, the city is divided into fourteen districts, with 265 cross-roads under the guardianship of the <a href=/people/12089 target=_blank>Lares</a>.

Add to these calculations the height of the houses, and then a person may form a fair idea of this city, and will certainly be obliged to admit that there is not a place throughout the whole world that for size can be compared to it. On the eastern side it is bounded by the agger of <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> <a href=/people/2188 target=_blank>Superbus</a>, a work of surpassing grandeur; for he raised it so high as to be on a level with the walls on the side on which the city lay most exposed to attack from the neighbouring plains.

According to <a href=/people/1510 target=_blank>Isidorus</a>, it is 563 miles in circumference; and nearly as much again, allowing for the sea-line on the margin of its gulfs. The narrow pass at which it commences is known by the name of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a>. At this spot the two seas, which we have previously mentioned, running from the north and the east, invade the land from opposite sides, and swallow up its entire breadth, the result being that through these inroads in opposite directions of such vast bodies of water, the sides of the land are eaten away to such an extent, that Hellas only holds on to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a> by the narrow neck, five miles in width, which intervenes.

At this spot are supposed to be the hinges upon which the world revolves, and the extreme limits of the revolutions of the stars. Here we find light for six months together, given by the sun in one continuous day, who does not, however, as some ignorant persons have asserted, conceal himself from the vernal equinox to autumn. On the contrary, to these people there is but one rising of the sun for the year, and that at the summer solstice, and but one setting, at the winter solstice. This region, warmed by the rays of the sun, is of a most delightful temperature, and exempt from every noxious blast. The abodes of the natives are the woods and groves; the gods receive their worship singly and in groups, while all discord and every kind of sickness are things utterly unknown. Death comes upon them only when satiated with life; after a career of feasting, in an old age sated with every luxury, they leap from a certain rock there into the sea; and this they deem the most desirable mode of ending existence. Some writers have placed these people, not in Europe, but at the very verge of the shores of Asia, because we find there a people called the <a href=/people/7332 target=_blank>Attacori</a>, who greatly resemble them and occupy a very similar locality. Other writers again have placed them midway between the two suns, at the spot where it sets to the Antipodes and rises to us; a thing however that cannot possibly be, in consequence of the vast tract of sea which there intervenes. Those writers who place them nowhere but under a day which lasts for six months, state that in the morning they sow, at mid-day they reap, at sunset they gather in the fruits of the trees, and during the night conceal themselves in caves. Nor are we at liberty to entertain any doubts as to the existence of this race; so many authors are there who assert that they were in the habit of sending their first-fruits to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253SSan class=place long=25.2666 lat=37.4004>Delos</a> to present them to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, whom in especial they worship. Virgins used to carry them, who for many years were held in high veneration, and received the rites of hospitality from the nations that lay on the route; until at last, in consequence of repeated violations of good faith, the <a href=/people/801 target=_blank>Hyperboreans</a> came to the determination to deposit these offerings upon the frontiers of the people who adjoined them, and they in their turn were to convey them on to their neighbours, and so from one to the other, till they should have arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a>.

Here, when it has once more become sensible of the presence of man, it again emerges, at the same source, in all probability, to which writers have given the name of <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a>, or Black.

It does not obtain the name of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> until its waters have again met and are united in a single stream; and even then, for some miles both above and below the point of confluence, it has the name of Siris. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> has given to the whole of this river the name of <a href=/people/1155 target=_blank>Egyptus</a>, while other writers again have called it <a href=/people/664 target=_blank>Triton</a>. Every now and then its course is interrupted by islands which intervene, and which only serve as so many incentives to add to the impetuosity of its torrent; and though at last it is hemmed in by mountains on either side, in no part is the tide more rapid and precipitate.

Of these, however, the most probable are, either that its waters are driven back by the <a href=/people/12230 target=_blank>Etesian</a> winds, which are blowing at this season of the year from an opposite direction, and that the sea which lies beyond is driven into the mouths of the river; or else that its waters are swollen by the summer rains of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Aethiopia</a>, which fall from the clouds conveyed thither by the <a href=/people/12230 target=_blank>Etesian</a> winds from other parts of the earth. <a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaeus</a> the mathematician has alleged a reason of an occult nature: he says that the source of the river is known by the name of Phiala, and that the stream buries itself in channels underground, where it sends forth vapours generated by the heat among the steaming rocks amid which it conceals itself; but that, during the days of the inundation, in consequence of the sun approaching nearer to the earth, the waters are drawn forth by the influence of his heat, and on being thus exposed to the air, overflow; after which, in order that it may not be utterly dried up, the stream hides itself once more. He says that this takes place at the rising of the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a>-Star, when the sun enters the sign of <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, and stands in a vertical position over the source of the river, at which time at that spot there is no shadow thrown. Most authors, however, are of opinion, on the contrary, that the river flows in greater volume when the sun takes his departure for the north, which he does when he enters the signs of Cancer and <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, because its waters then are not dried up to so great an extent; while on the other hand, when he returns towards the south pole and re-enters <a href=/people/10728 target=_blank>Capricorn</a>, its waters are absorbed by the heat, and consequently flow in less abundance. If there is any one inclined to be of opinion, with <a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaeus</a>, that the waters of the river may be drawn out of the earth by the heat, it will be as well for him to bear in mind the fact, that the absence of shadow is a phaenomenon which lasts continuously in these regions. </p>                        </div>

It has totally subsided between its banks, as we learn from <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>, on the hundredth day, when the sun has entered Libra. While it is rising it has been pronounced criminal for kings or prefects even to sail upon its waters. The measure of its increase is ascertained by means of wells. Its most desirable height is sixteen cubits; if the waters do not attain that height, the overflow is not universal; but if they exceed that measure, by their slowness in receding they tend to retard the process of cultivation. In the latter case the time for sowing is lost, in consequence of the moisture of the soil; in the former, the ground is so parched that the seed-time comes to no purpose. The country has reason to make careful note of either extreme. When the water rises to only twelve cubits, it experiences the horrors of famine; when it attains thirteen, hunger is still the result; a rise of fourteen cubits is productive of gladness; a rise of fifteen sets all anxieties at rest; while an increase of sixteen is productive of unbounded transports of joy. The greatest increase known, up to the present time, is that of eighteen cubits, which took place in the time of the Emperor <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>; the smallest rise was that of five, in the year of the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393224UPha class=place long=22.3869 lat=39.2883>Pharsalia</a>, the river by this prodigy testifying its horror, as it were, at the murder of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a>. When the waters have reached their greatest height, the people open the embankments and admit them to the lands. As each district is left by the waters, the business of sowing commences. This is the only river in existence that emits no vapours. </p>                        </div>

Of immense extent, and separating nations innumerable, after taking its first rise at the Indian Sea, it branches off to the north on the right-hand side, and on the left towards the south.

Both on the right hand and the left are overhanging rocks, which look as though they had been exposed to the action of fire; and there is a tract of country, quite destitute of water, twenty-eight miles in extent. This narrow pass, too, is rendered still more difficult by a liquid salt which oozes from the rocks, and uniting in a single stream, makes its way along the pass.

In this country there are nations and cities which would be found to be quite innumerable, if a person should attempt to enumerate them. For it has been explored not only by the arms of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the Great and of the kings who succeeded him, by <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> and <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, who sailed round even to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400516WHyr class=demonym long=51.6 lat=40>Caspian</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400516WHyr class=place long=51.6 lat=40>Hyrcanian Sea</a>, and by <a href=/people/12353 target=_blank>Patrocles</a>, the admiral of their fleet, but has been treated of by several other Greek writers who resided at the courts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> kings, such, for instance, as <a href=/people/1316 target=_blank>Megasthenes</a>, and by <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, who was sent thither by <a href=/people/814 target=_blank>Philadelphus</a>, expressly for the purpose: all of whom have enlarged upon the power and vast resources of these nations. Still, however, there is no possibility of being rigorously exact, so different are the accounts given, and often of a nature so incredible. The followers of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the Great have stated in their writings, that there were no less than five thousand cities in that portion of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> which they vanquished by force of arms, not one of which was smaller than that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369273PKos class=place long=27.2859 lat=36.8914>Cos</a>; that its nations were eight in number, that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> forms one-third of the whole earth, and that its populations are innumerable — a thing which is certainly far from improbable, seeing that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> are nearly the only race of people who have never migrated from their own territories.

They state also that nineteen rivers discharge their waters into it; those among them that are navigable, besides the rivers already mentioned, are the Condochates, the Erannoboas, the Cosoagus, and the Sonus. Other writers again say that it bursts forth at its very source with a loud noise, hurling itself over rocks and precipices; and that after it has reached the plains, its waters become more tranquil, and it pauses for a time in a certain lake, after which it flows gently on. They say also that it is eight miles in breadth, where it is the very narrowest, and one hundred stadia where it is but moderately wide, and that it is nowhere less than twenty paces in depth. The last nation situate on the banks of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/38898WGan class=place long=89.8009 lat=23.7818>Ganges</a> is that of the <a href=/people/3845 target=_blank>Gangarides</a> Calingae; the city where their king dwells has the name of Protalis. This king has sixty thousand foot-soldiers, one thousand <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and seven hundred elephants, always caparisoned ready for battle. The people of the more civilized nations of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> are divided into several classes. One of these classes tills the earth, another attends to military affairs, others again are occupied in mercantile pursuits, while the wisest and the most wealthy among them have the management of the affairs of state — act as judges, and give counsel to the king. The fifth class, entirely devoting themselves to the pursuit of wisdom, which in these countries is almost held in the same veneration as religion, always end their life by a voluntary death upon the lighted pile. In addition to these, there is a class in a half-savage state, and doomed to endless labour; by means of their exertions, all the classes previously mentioned are supported. It is their duty to hunt the elephant, and to tame him when captured; for it is by the aid of these animals that they plough; by these animals they are conveyed from place to place; these in especial they look upon as constituting their flocks and herds; by their aid they wage their wars, and fight in defence of their territories. <a href=/people/3102 target=_blank>Strength</a>, age, and size, are the points usually considered in making choice of these animals. </p>                        </div>

It begins at the Eastern sea, and lies extended opposite to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, east and west. This island was in former times supposed to be twenty days' sail from the country of the <a href=/people/5205 target=_blank>Prasii</a>, but in later times, whereas the navigation was formerly confined to vessels constructed of papyrus with the tackle peculiar to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, the distance has been estimated at no more than seven days' sail, in reference to the speed which can be attained by vessels of our construction. The sea that lies between the island and the mainland is full of shallows, not more than six paces in depth; but in certain channels it is of such extraordinary depth, that no anchor has ever found a bottom. For this reason it is that the vessels are constructed with prows at either end; so that there may be no necessity for tacking while navigating these channels, which are extremely narrow. The tonnage of these vessels is three thousand amphorae. In traversing their seas, the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/073805ITap class=place long=80.5 lat=7.3>Taprobane</a> take no observations of the stars, and indeed the Greater Bear is not visible to them; but they carry birds out to sea, which they let go from time to time, and so follow their course as they make for the land. They devote only four months in the year to the pursuits of navigation, and are particularly careful not to trust themselves on the sea during the next hundred days after our summer solstice, for in those seas it is at that time the middle of winter. </p>                        </div>

The circumstances under which this took place were as follow: <a href=/people/1125 target=_blank>Annius</a> Plocamus had farmed from the treasury the revenues arising from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Red Sea</a>. A certain freedman of his, while sailing around <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>, was carried away by a gale from the north beyond the coast of <a href=/people/6329 target=_blank>Carmania</a>. In the course of fifteen days he had drifted to Hippuros, a port of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/073805ITap class=place long=80.5 lat=7.3>Taprobane</a>, where he was most kindly and hospitably received by the king; and having, after a study of six months, become well acquainted with the language, was enabled to answer all his enquiries relative to the Romans and their emperor. But of all that he heard, the king was more particularly struck with surprise at our rigid notions of justice, on ascertaining that among the money found on the captive, the denarii were all of equal weight, although the different figures on them plainly showed that they had been struck in the reigns of several emperors. By this circumstance in especial, the king was prompted to form an alliance with the Romans, and accordingly sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> an embassy, consisting of four persons, the chief of whom was Itachias. </p>                        </div>

They also informed us that in the interior there is a lake called Megisba, three hundred and seventy-five miles in circumference, and containing islands which are fertile, though for pasturage only. In this lake they informed us two rivers take their rise, one of which, called Palesimundus, flows into the harbour near the city of that name, by three channels, the narrowest of which is five stadia in width, the largest fifteen; while the other, Cydara by name, takes a direction northward, towards the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> coast. We learned also that the nearest point of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> coast is a promontory known as Coliacum, distant from the island four days' sail, and that midway between them lies the island of the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>. They stated also that those seas are of a deep green tint; besides which, there are numerous trees growing at the bottom, so much so, that the rudders of the vessels frequently break off portions of their foliage. They were much astonished at the constellations which are visible to us, the Greater Bear and the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a>, as though they had now beheld a new expanse of the heavens; and they declared that in their country the moon can only be seen above the horizon from the eighth to its sixteenth day. They also stated that <a href=/people/2757 target=_blank>Canopus</a>, a large bright star, gives light to them by night. But what surprised them more than anything, was that the shadow of their bodies was thrown towards our hemisphere and not theirs, and that the sun arose on the left hand and set on the right, and not in the opposite direction. They also informed us that the side of their island which lies opposite to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> is ten thousand stadia in length, and runs in a south-easterly direction — that beyond the Emodian Mountains they look towards the Serve, whose acquaintance they had also made in the pursuits of commerce; that the father of Rachias had frequently visited their country, and that the Serae always came to meet them on their arrival. These people, they said, exceeded the ordinary human height, had flaxen hair, and blue eyes, and made an uncouth sort of noise by way of talking, having no language of their own for the purpose of communicating their thoughts. The rest of their information was of a similar nature to that communicated by our merchants. It was to the effect that the merchandize on sale was left by them upon the opposite bank of a river on their coast, and it was then removed by the natives, if they thought proper to deal on terms of exchange. On no grounds ought luxury with greater reason to be detested by us, than if we only transport our thoughts to these scenes, and then reflect, what are its demands, to what distant spots it sends in order to satisfy them, and for how mean and how unworthy an end! </p>                        </div>

The lands are carefully tilled; the vine is not cultivated there, but of other fruits there is great abundance.

The more distant of the <a href=/people/4652 target=_blank>Parthi</a> are called Nomades; on this side of them there are deserts.

This maritime region of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persis</a> has the name of Ciribo; on the side on which it runs up to that of the Medi, there is a place known by the name of Climax Megale, where the mountains are ascended by a steep flight of stairs, and so afford a narrow passage which leads to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/299529PPer class=place long=52.8909 lat=29.9352>Persepolis</a>, the former capital of the kingdom, destroyed by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. It has also, at its extreme frontier, <a href=/people/7858 target=_blank>Laodicea</a>, founded by <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>.

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> formed these communities into cities, being prompted thereto by the extraordinary fertility of the soil. Besides the cities already mentioned, it contains those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/331445USel class=place long=44.5263 lat=33.101>Seleucia</a>, <a href=/people/7858 target=_blank>Laodicea</a>, Artemita; and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>, the peoples known as the <a href=/people/6735 target=_blank>Orei</a> and the Mardani, besides Antiochia, founded by <a href=/people/401 target=_blank>Nicanor</a>, the governor of <a href=/people/290 target=_blank>Mesopotamia</a>, and called Arabis. Joining up to these in the interior is an <a href=/people/275 target=_blank>Arabian</a> people, called the Eldamani, and above them, upon the river Pallaconta, the town of <a href=/people/8617 target=_blank>Bura</a>, and the <a href=/people/275 target=_blank>Arabian</a> peoples known as the Salmani and the Masei. Up to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375433RGor class=ethnic long=43.3 lat=37.5>Gordyaei</a> join the Aloni, through whose territory runs the river Zerbis, which falls into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a>; next are the <a href=/people/8945 target=_blank>Azones</a>, the Silici, a mountain tribe, and the <a href=/people/709 target=_blank>Orontes</a>, to the west of whom lies the town of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/366435UGau class=place long=43.481 lat=36.593>Gaugamela</a>, as also Sue, situate upon the rocks. Beyond these are the Silici, surnamed Classitae, through whose district runs the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360435WLyk class=place long=43.4882 lat=36.042>Lycus</a> on its passage from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a>, the Absithris running south-east, the town of Accobis, and then in the plains the towns of Diospage, Polytelia, <a href=/people/1082 target=_blank>Stratonice</a>, and Anthermis.

We have also similarly made mention of Apamea on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370379UZeu class=place long=37.8768 lat=37.048>Zeugma</a>. Leaving that city and going eastward, we come to Caphrena, a fortified town, formerly seventy stadia in extent, and called the Court of the Satraps. It was to this place that the tribute was conveyed; now it is reduced to a mere fortress. Thaebata is still in the same state as formerly: after which comes Oruros, which under <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius Magnus</a> formed the extreme limit of the Roman Empire, distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370379UZeu class=place long=37.8768 lat=37.048>Zeugma</a> two hundred and fifty miles.

The <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> universally call this river by the name of Narmalcha, which signifies the royal river. At the point where its waters divide, there was in former times a very large city, called Agranis, which the <a href=/people/3444 target=_blank>Persae</a> have destroyed. </p>                        </div>

The circuit of its walls, which were two hundred feet in height, was sixty miles. These walls were also fifty feet in breadth, reckoning to every foot three fingers' breadth beyond the ordinary measure of our foot. The river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> flowed through the city, with quays of marvellous workmanship erected on either side. The temple there of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a> is still in existence; he was the first inventor of the science of Astronomy. In all other respects it has been reduced to a desert, having been drained of its population in consequence of its vicinity to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/331445USel class=place long=44.5263 lat=33.101>Seleucia</a>, founded for that purpose by Nicator, at a distance of ninety miles, on the confluence of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a> and the canal that leads from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/331445USel class=place long=44.5263 lat=33.101>Seleucia</a>, however, still bears the surname of <a href=/people/471 target=_blank>Babylonia</a>: it is a free and independent city, and retains the features of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> manners. It is said that the population of this city amounts to six hundred thousand, and that the outline of its walls resembles an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> with expanded wings: its territory, they say, is the most fertile in all the East. The <a href=/people/4652 target=_blank>Parthi</a> again, in its turn, founded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/331446UKte class=place long=44.5807 lat=33.0937>Ctesiphon</a>, for the purpose of drawing away the population of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/331445USel class=place long=44.5263 lat=33.101>Seleucia</a>, at a distance of nearly three miles, and in the district of <a href=/people/5552 target=_blank>Chalonitis</a>; <a about=https://topostext.org/place/331446UKte class=place long=44.5807 lat=33.0937>Ctesiphon</a> is now the capital of all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> kingdoms. Finding, however, that this city did not answer the intended purpose, king <a href=/people/2358 target=_blank>Vologesus</a> has of late years founded another city in its vicinity, Vologesocerta by name. Besides the above, there are still the following towns in <a href=/people/290 target=_blank>Mesopotamia</a>: Hipparenum, rendered famous, like <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, by the learning of the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldaei</a>, and situate near the river Narraga, which falls into the Narroga, from which a city so called has taken its name.

Orchenus also, a third place of learning of the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldaei</a>, is situate in the same district, towards the south; after which come the Notitae, the Orothophanitae, and the Grecichartae. From <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a> and <a href=/people/936 target=_blank>Onesicritus</a> we learn that the distance by water from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> Sea to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, up the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>, is four hundred and twelve miles; other authors, however, who have written since their time, say that the distance to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/331445USel class=place long=44.5263 lat=33.101>Seleucia</a> is four hundred and forty miles: and <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a> says that the distance from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/309476UCha class=place long=47.578 lat=30.8947>Charax</a> is one hundred and seventy-five. Some writers state that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> continues to flow with an undivided channel for a distance of eighty-seven miles beyond <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, before its waters are diverted from their channel for the purposes of irrigation; and that the whole length of its course is not less than twelve hundred miles. The circumstance that so many different authors have treated of this subject, accounts for all these variations, seeing that even the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> writers themselves do not agree as to what is the length of their schoeni and parasangoe, each assigning to them a different length. </p>                        </div>

But it will be as well now to give some particulars respecting the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a> itself. This river rises in the region of Greater <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a>, from a very remarkable source, situate on a plain. The name of the spot is Elegosine, and the stream, as soon as it begins to flow, though with a slow current, has the name of Diglito. When its course becomes more rapid, it assumes the name of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a>, given to it on account of its swiftness, that word signifying an arrow in the <a href=/people/538 target=_blank>Median</a> language. It then flows into Lake <a href=/people/2027 target=_blank>Arethusa</a>, the waters of which are able to support all weighty substances thrown into them, and exhale nitrous vapours. This lake produces only one kind of fish, which, however, never enter the current of the river in its passage through the lake: and in a similar manner, the fish of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a> will never swim out of its stream into the waters of the lake. Distinguishable from the lake, both by the rapidity and the colour of its waters, the tide of the river is hurried along; after it has passed through and arrived at Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a>, it disappears in a cavern of that mountain, and passing beneath it, bursts forth on the other side; the spot bears the name of Zoroande. That the waters on either side of the mountain are the same, is evident from the fact, that bodies thrown in on the one side will reappear on the other. It then passes through another lake, called Thospites, and once more burying itself in the earth, reappears, after running a distance of twenty-two miles, in the vicinity of Nymphaion. <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius Caesar</a> informs us that, in the district of Arrene it flows so near to the river <a href=/people/5469 target=_blank>Arsanias</a>, that when their waters swell they meet and flow together, but without, however, intermingling. For those of the Arsani, as he says, being lighter, float on the surface of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a> for a distance of nearly four miles, after which they separate, and the <a href=/people/5469 target=_blank>Arsanias</a> flows into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a>, after flowing through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a> and receiving the well-known rivers <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378218WPar class=place long=21.707 lat=37.649>Parthenias</a> and <a href=/people/9887 target=_blank>Nicephorion</a>, separates the <a href=/people/275 target=_blank>Arabian</a> <a href=/people/6735 target=_blank>Orei</a> from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360440RAdi class=place long=44 lat=36>Adiabeni</a>, and then forms by its course, as previously mentioned, the country of <a href=/people/290 target=_blank>Mesopotamia</a>. After traversing the mountains of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375433RGor class=ethnic long=43.3 lat=37.5>Gordyaei</a>, it passes round Apamea, a town of <a href=/people/3633 target=_blank>Mesene</a>, one hundred and twenty-five miles on this side of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=demonym long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonian</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/331445USel class=place long=44.5263 lat=33.101>Seleucia</a>, and then divides into two channels, one of which runs southward, and flowing through <a href=/people/3633 target=_blank>Mesene</a>, runs towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/331445USel class=place long=44.5263 lat=33.101>Seleucia</a>, while the other takes a turn to the north and passes through the plains of the Cauchae, at the back of the district of <a href=/people/3633 target=_blank>Mesene</a>. When the waters have reunited, the river assumes the name of <a href=/people/3064 target=_blank>Pasitigris</a>. After this, it receives the <a href=/people/1774 target=_blank>Choaspes</a>, which comes from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a>; and then, as we have already stated, flowing between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/331445USel class=place long=44.5263 lat=33.101>Seleucia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/331446UKte class=place long=44.5807 lat=33.0937>Ctesiphon</a>, discharges itself into the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldaean</a> Lakes, which it supplies for a distance of seventy miles. Escaping from them by a vast channel, it passes the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/309476UCha class=place long=47.578 lat=30.8947>Charax</a> to the right, and empties itself into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> Sea, being ten miles in width at the mouth. Between the mouths of the two rivers <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>, the distance was formerly twenty-five, or, according to some writers, seven miles only, both of them being navigable to the sea. But the Orcheni and others who dwell on its banks, have long since dammed up the waters of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> for the purposes of irrigation, and it can only discharge itself into the sea by the aid of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a>. </p>                        </div>

It was first founded by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the Great, with colonists from the royal city of Durine, which was then destroyed, and such of his soldiers as were invalided and left behind. By his order it was to be called Alexandria, and a borough called <a href=/people/5875 target=_blank>Pella</a>, from his native place, was to be peopled solely by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>; the city, however, was destroyed by inundations of the rivers. <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, the fifth king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, afterwards rebuilt this place and called it by his own name; and on its being again destroyed, Pasines, the son of Saggonadacus, and king of the neighbouring <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a>, whom <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a> has incorrectly described as a satrap of king <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, restored it, and raised embankments for its protection, calling it after himself. These embankments extended in length a distance of nearly three miles, in breadth a little less. It stood at first at a distance of ten stadia from the shore, and even had a harbour of its own. But according to <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a>, it is fifty miles from the sea; and at the present day, the ambassadors from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>, and our own merchants who have visited the place, say that it stands at a distance of one hundred and twenty miles from the sea-shore. Indeed, in no part of the world have alluvial deposits been formed more rapidly by the rivers, and to a greater extent than here; and it is only a matter of surprise that the tides, which run to a considerable distance beyond this city, do not carry them back again. At this place was born <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, the most recent author of a description of the world; he was sent by the late emperor <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> to gather all necessary information in the East, when his eldest son was about to set out for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a> to take the command against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a>. </p>                        </div>

We first come to the place where the mouth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> formerly existed, the river <a href=/people/10210 target=_blank>Salsus</a>, and the Promontory of Chaldone, from which spot, the sea along the coast, for an extent of fifty miles, bears more the aspect of a series of whirlpools than of ordinary sea; the river Achenus, and then a desert tract for a space of one hundred miles, until we come to the island of Ichara; the gulf of Capeus, on the shores of which dwell the Gaulopes and the Chateni, and then the gulf of Gerra. Here we find the city of Gerra, five miles in circumference, with towers built of square blocks of salt. Fifty miles from the coast, lying in the interior, is the region of Attene, and opposite to Gerra is the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/262505ITyl class=place long=50.5205 lat=26.2328>Tylos</a>, as many miles distant from the shore; it is famous for the vast number of its pearls, and has a town of the same name; in its vicinity there is a smaller island, distant from a promontory on the larger one twelve miles and a half.

There are many islands also that have no name, but the better known ones are Isura, Rhinnea, and another still nearer the shore, upon which there are some stone pillars with an inscription in unknown characters. There are also the port of Goboea, the desert islands called Bragae, the nation of the Thaludaei, the region of Dabanegoris, Mount Orsa, with a harbour, the gulf of Duatus, with numerous islands, Mount Tricoryphos, the region of Cardaleon, and the islands called Solanades, Cachinna, and that of the <a href=/people/9557 target=_blank>Ichthyophagi</a>.

He states that the first is called <a href=/people/10890 target=_blank>Ombrios</a>, and that it presents no traces of buildings whatever; that among the mountains there is a lake, and some trees, which bear a strong resemblance to giant fennel, and from which water is extracted; that drawn from those that are black is of a bitter taste, but that produced by the white ones is agreeable and good for drinking. He states also that a second island has the name of <a href=/people/6575 target=_blank>Junonia</a>, but that it contains nothing beyond a small temple of stone: also that in its vicinity there is another, but smaller, island of the same name, and then another called Capraria, which is infested by multitudes of huge lizards. According to the same author, in sight of these islands is Ninguaria, which has received that name from its perpetual snows; this island abounds also in fogs. The one next to it is Canaria; it contains vast multitudes of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> of very large size, two of which were brought home to <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a>: there are some traces of buildings to be seen here. While all these islands abound in fruit and birds of every kind, this one produces in great numbers the date palm which bears the caryota, also pine nuts. Honey too abounds here, and in the rivers papyrus, and the fish called silurus, are found. These islands, however, are greatly annoyed by the putrefying bodies of monsters, which are constantly thrown up by the sea. </p>                        </div>

Following this mode of reckoning, the dimensions of Europe will be eight thousand two hundred and ninety-four miles; of Africa, to adopt a mean between all the various accounts given by authors, the length is three thousand seven hundred and ninety-four miles, while the breadth, so far as it is inhabited, in no part exceeds two hundred and fifty miles. But, as <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, including its deserts, makes it from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrenaica</a>, a part of it, to the country of the <a href=/people/9422 target=_blank>Garamantes</a>, so far as was then known, a further distance of nine hundred and ten miles, the entire length, added together, will make a distance of four thousand six hundred and eight miles. The length of Asia is generally admitted to be six thousand three hundred and seventy-five miles, and the breadth, which ought, properly, to be reckoned from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=demonym long=35.01 lat=13.01>Aethiopian</a> Sea to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, near the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, so as to run through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/169337UMer class=place long=33.7104 lat=16.938>Meroe</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/241329USye class=place long=32.898 lat=24.0811>Syene</a>, is eighteen hundred and seventy-five. It appears then that Europe is greater than Asia, by a little less than one half of Asia, and greater than Africa by as much again of Africa and one-sixth. If all these sums are added together, it will be clearly seen that Europe is one-third, and a little more than one-eighth part of one-third, Asia one-fourth and one-fourteenth part of one-fourth, and Africa, one-fifth and one-sixtieth part of one-fifth of the whole earth. </p>                        </div>

First of all, man alone of all animals she drapes with borrowed resources. On all the rest in various wise she bestows coverings — shells, bark, spines, hides, fur, bristles, hair, down, feathers, scales, fleeces; even the trunks of trees she has protected against cold and heat by bark, sometimes in two layers: but man alone on the day of his birth she casts away naked on the naked ground, to burst at once into wailing and weeping, and none other among all the animals is more prone to tears, and that immediately at the very beginning of life; whereas, I vow, the much-talked-of smile of infancy even at the earliest is bestowed on no child less than six weeks old. This initiation into the light is followed by a period of bondage such as befalls not even the animals bred in our midst, fettering all his limbs; and thus when successfully born he lies with hands and feet in shackles, weeping — the animal that is to lord it over all the rest, and he initiates his life with punishment because of one fault only, the offence of being born.

When does man begin to walk? when to speak? when is his mouth firm enough to take food? how long does his skull throb, a mark of his being the weakest among all animals? Then his diseases, and all the cures contrived against his ills — these cures also subsequently defeated by new disorders! And the fact that all other creatures are aware of their own nature, some using speed, others swift flight, others swimming, whereas man alone knows nothing save by education — neither how to speak nor how to walk nor who to eat; in short the only thing he can do by natural instinct is to weep! Consequently there have been many who believed that it were best not to be born, or to be put away as soon as possible. On man alone of living creatures is bestowed grief, on him alone luxury, and that in countless forms and reaching every separate part of his frame; he alone has ambition, avarice, immeasurable appetite for life, superstition, anxiety about burial and even about what will happen after he is no more. No creature's life is more precarious, none has a greater lust for all enjoyments, a more confused timidity, a fiercer rage. In fine, all other living creatures pass their time worthily among their own species: we see them herd together and stand firm against other kinds of animals — fierce <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> do not fight among themselves, the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>'s bite attacks not <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a>, even the monsters of the sea and the fishes are only cruel against different species; whereas to man, I vow, most of his evils come from his fellowman. </p>                        </div>

Not to mention <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peacocks</a>, or the spotted skins of tigers and panthers and the colourings of so many animals, a small matter to tell of but one of measureless extent if pondered on is the number of national languages and dialects and varieties of speech, so numerous that a foreigner scarcely counts as a human being for someone of another race! Again though our physiognomy contains ten features or only a few more, to think that among all the thousands of human beings there exist no two countenances that are not distinct — a thing that no art could supply by counterfeit in so small a number of specimens! Nevertheless in most instances of these I shall not myself pledge my own faith, and shall preferably ascribe the facts to the authorities who will be quoted for all doubtful points: only do not let us be too proud to follow the Greeks, because of their far greater industry or older devotion to study. </p>                        </div>

According to the writings of <a href=/people/1500 target=_blank>Agatharchides</a> there was also a similar tribe in Africa, the <a href=/people/6861 target=_blank>Psylli</a>, named after King <a href=/people/8219 target=_blank>Psyllus</a>, whose tomb is in the region of the greater <a about=https://topostext.org/place/314186WSyr class=place long=18.6 lat=31.4>Syrtes</a>.

It is known that many of the inhabitants are more than seven feet six inches high, never spit, do not suffer from headache or toothache or pain in the eyes, and very rarely have a pain in any other part of the body — so hardy are they made by the temperate heat of the sun; and that the sages of their race, whom they call <a href=/people/12221 target=_blank>Gymnosophists</a>, stay standing from sunrise to sunset, gazing at the sun with eyes unmoving, and continue all day long standing first on one foot and then on the other in the glowing sand. <a href=/people/1316 target=_blank>Megasthenes</a> states that on the mountain named Nulus there are people with their feet turned backwards and with eight toes on each foot, while on many of the mountains there is a tribe of human beings with <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>' heads, who wear a covering of wild beasts' skins, whose speech is a bark and who live on the produce of hunting and fowling, for which they use their nails as weapons; he says that they numbered more than 120,000 when he published his work. <a href=/people/485 target=_blank>Ctesias</a> writes that also among a certain race of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> the women bear children only once in their lifetime, and the children begin to turn grey directly after birth; he also describes a tribe of men called the Monocolia who have only one leg, and who move in jumps with surprising speed; the same are called the Umbrella-foot tribe, because in the hotter weather they lie on their backs on the ground and protect themselves with the shadow of their feet; and that they are not far away from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195372RTro class=ethnic long=37.2 lat=19.5>Cave-dwellers</a>; and again westward from these there are some people without necks, having their eyes in their shoulders.

Beyond these in the most outlying mountain region we are told of the Three-span men and <a href=/people/10944 target=_blank>Pygmies</a>, who do not exceed three spans, i.e. twenty-seven inches, in height; the climate is healthy and always spring-like, as it is protected on the north by a range of mountains; this tribe <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> has also recorded as being beset by cranes. It is reported that in springtime their entire band, mounted on the backs of rams and she-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> and armed with arrows, goes in a body down to the sea and eats the cranes eggs and chickens, and that this outing occupies three months; and that otherwise they could not protect themselves against the flocks of cranes that would grow up; and that their houses are made of mud and feathers and eggshells. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says that the <a href=/people/10944 target=_blank>Pygmies</a> live in caves, but in the rest of his statement about them he agrees with the other authorities.

A man of low station named <a href=/people/2210 target=_blank>Artemo</a> so closely resembled <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> [3, 223-187 BC], king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, that the royal consort <a href=/people/948 target=_blank>Laodice</a> after she had murdered <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> successfully made use of him to stage a play of her being recommended for succession to the throne. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> the Great had two doubles almost indistinguishable from him in appearance, a plebeian named <a href=/people/1725 target=_blank>Vibius</a> and one Publieius who was actually a liberated slave, both of whom reproduced that noble countenance and the actual dignity of his magnificent brow. A similar resemblance was the reason that saddled <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s father also with the surname <a href=/people/7962 target=_blank>Menogenes</a>, that being the name of his cook, when he already had the surname <a href=/people/911 target=_blank>Strabo</a> [cross-eyed] from the appearance of his eyes, which actually copied a defect in his slave; and a <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> received the surname <a href=/people/1678 target=_blank>Serapio</a> in a similar way, <a href=/people/1678 target=_blank>Serapio</a> being a low chattel belonging to a dealer in <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>hogs</a>. Another <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> of a later generation received his name from an actor <a href=/people/10211 target=_blank>Salutio</a>, just as <a href=/people/2258 target=_blank>Spinther</a> and <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a> who played second and third roles respectively gave their names to the colleagues in the consulship <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> and <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, a situation which also (most inappropriately) resulted incidentally in the counterfeit presentations of two consuls being seen on the stage at once. Vice-versa, Lucius <a href=/people/505 target=_blank>Plancus</a>, an orator, gave a surname to a player <a href=/people/1903 target=_blank>Rubrius</a>, whereas Burbuleius gave his name to <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> senior and likewise <a href=/people/7962 target=_blank>Menogenes</a> to the former censor <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messala</a>, both alike being actors. A fisherman in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> not only resembled the proconsul Sara in appearance but actually reproduced his gape while speaking and his tongue-tied stammering utterance. The famous orator <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a> was taunted for his likeness to the gladiator Armentarius. Recently in the household of Annaeus people used to mistake <a href=/people/4156 target=_blank>Gallio</a> for the freedman Castellanus and the senator <a href=/people/7189 target=_blank>Agrippinus</a> for the actor Sannius, surnamed <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a>. The slave-dealer <a href=/people/8441 target=_blank>Toranius</a> sold to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> after he had become one of the triumvirate two exceptionally handsome boys, who were so identically alike that he passed them off as twins, although one was a native of Asia and the other of a district North of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a>. Later the boys' speech disclosed the fraud, and a protest was made to the dealer by the wrathful <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, who complained especially about the large amount of the price (he had bought them for 200,000 sesterces); but the crafty dealer replied that the thing protested about was precisely the cause of his having charged so much, because there was nothing remarkable in a likeness between any pair of twin brothers, whereas (he said) to find natives of different races so precisely alike in appearance was something above all appraisal; and this produced in <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> so convenient a feeling of admiration that the great inflictor of outlawry, who had just been in a fury of threats and abuse, considered that no other property that he possessed was more suited to his station! </p>                        </div>

This mole is a shapeless and inanimate mass of flesh that resists the point and the edge of a knife; it moves about, and it checks menstruation, as it also checks births: in some cases causing death, in others growing old with the patient, sometimes when the bowels are violently moved being ejected. A similar object is also formed in the stomach of males, called a tumour, as in the case of the praetorian <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a> <a href=/people/903 target=_blank>Capito</a>. But nothing could easily be found that is more remarkable than the monthly flux of women. Contact with it turns new wine sour, crops touched by it become barren, grafts die, seeds in gardens are dried up, the fruit of trees falls off, the bright surface of mirrors in which it is merely reflected is dimmed, the edge of steel and the gleam of ivory are dulled, hives of <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> die, even bronze and iron are at once seized by rust, and a horrible smell fills the air; to taste it drives <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> mad and infects their bites with an incurable poison.

Even that very tiny creature the ant is said to be sensitive to it, and throws away grains of corn that taste of it and does not touch them again. Not only does this pernicious mischief occur in a woman every month, but it comes in larger quantity every three months; and in some cases it comes more frequently than once a month, just as in certain women it never occurs at all. The latter, however, do not have children, since the substance in question is the material for human generation, as the semen from the males acting like rennet collects this substance within it, which thereupon immediately is inspired with life and endowed with body.

The teeth are so far indestructible by fire as not to burn when the rest of the body is cremated, but although they resist fire they are corroded by a morbid state of the saliva. A certain drug gives them whiteness. Use wears them down, and in some people they decay much before this. Nor are they only necessary for food and nourishment, as the front teeth regulate the voice and speech, meeting the impact of the tongue with a kind of harmony, and according to their regularity of arrangement and size clipping or modulating or else dulling the words, and when they are lost preventing all clear articulation. Moreover this part of the body is believed to possess prophetic powers. Males (excepting the <a href=/people/12086 target=_blank>Turduli</a> tribe) have 32 teeth; there have been cases of men with more — this is thought to foretell a longer term of life. Women have fewer; with them two dogteeth on the right side of the upper jaw are a promise of fortune's favours, as in the case of <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>'s mother <a href=/people/720 target=_blank>Agrippina</a>; on the left side the opposite. — (It is the universal custom of mankind not to cremate a person who dies before cutting his teeth.) — But more of this later when our researches go through the parts of the body seriatim. </p>                        </div>

In fact, apart from other considerations, assuredly there is a fear that fortune may grow weary, and this fear once entertained, happiness has no firm foundation. What of the proverb that none among mortals is wise all the time? And would that as many men as possible may deem this proverb false, and not as the utterance of a prophet! Mortality, being so vain and so ingenious in self-deception, makes its calculation after the manner of the Thracian tribe that puts stone counters of different colours corresponding to each day's experience in an urn, and on the last day sorts them and counts them out and thus pronounces judgement about each individual. What of the fact that the very day commended by that stone of brilliant whiteness contained the source of misfortune? How many men have been overthrown by attaining power! How many have been ruined and plunged into the direst torments by wealth! <a href=/people/923 target=_blank>Wealth</a> forsooth it is called if a man has had an hour of joy while surrounded by it. So doubtless is it! Different days pass verdict on different men and only the last day a final verdict on all men; and consequently no day is to be trusted. What of the fact that goods are not equal to evils even if of equal number, and that no joy can counterbalance the smallest grief? Alas what vain and foolish application! we count the number of the days, when it is their weight that is in question! </p>                        </div>

It would be a lengthy matter to refute this, and it is superfluous to do so as it is abundantly rebutted by a single accidental misfortune: inasmuch as this <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> passed an old age of blindness, having lost his sight in a fire when saving the <a href=/people/12046 target=_blank>statue of Pallas</a> from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SVes class=place long=12.48621 lat=41.89171>temple</a> of <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a>, a memorable purpose but disastrous in its result.

Besides receiving an abundance of high honours and the surname of Macedonicus, he was borne to the tomb by four sons, one a praetor, three ex-consuls (two winners of triumphs), one an ex-censor — things that even separately have fallen to few men's lot. Nevertheless at the very height of his distinguished career, when coming back from the Field at midday, the market place and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> being empty, he was carried off to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LTrp class=place long=12.4815 lat=41.8914>Tarpeian Rock</a> by Gaius <a href=/people/2037 target=_blank>Atinius</a> <a href=/people/822 target=_blank>Labeo</a>, surnamed Macerio, tribune of the plebs, whom when censor he had ejected from the senate, with the intention of hurling him down the cliff; the numerous company of persons who called him their father did it is true hasten to his aid, but as was inevitable in this sudden emergency, too late and as if coming for his funeral, and as he had not the right to resist and to repel the hallowed person of a tribune his virtue and his strictness would have resulted in his destruction, but with difficulty another tribune was found to intercede, and he was recalled from the very threshold of death; and subsequently he lived on the charity of another, as his own property had immediately been confiscated on the proposal of the very man whom he had himself caused to be condemned, just as though the penalty exacted from him of having his throat tied in a rope and the blood forced out through his ears were not sufficient! Although for my own part I should also reckon it as a disaster to have been at enmity with the second <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a>, on the evidence of Macedonicus himself, inasmuch as he said, Go, my sons, celebrate his obsequies; you will never see the funeral of a greater citizen! And he said this to sons who had already won the titles of <a href=/people/7357 target=_blank>Balearicus</a> and Dalmaticus, while he himself was already Macedonicus. But even if only that injury be taken into account, who could rightly pronounce happy this man who ran the risk of perishing at the will of an enemy, and him not even an <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a>? Victory over what enemies was worth so much? or what honours and triumphal cars did not fortune put into the shade by that violent stroke — a censor dragged through the middle of the city (for this had been the sole reason for delaying), dragged to that same <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> to which he himself had not thus dragged even prisoners when he was triumphing over the spoils taken from them? This was rendered a greater crime by the happiness that followed, as it placed Macedonicus in danger of losing even that great and glorious funeral in which he was carried to the pyre by his children who had themselves won triumphs, so that even his obsequies were a triumphal procession. Assuredly it is no firmly founded happiness that any outrage in a man's career has shattered, let alone so great an outrage as that. For the rest I know not whether it counts to the credit of our morals or increases the anguish of our indignation that among all the many <a href=/people/9802 target=_blank>Metelli</a> that criminal audacity of Gaius <a href=/people/2037 target=_blank>Atinius</a> for ever went unpunished. </p>                        </div>

In fact whatever be this gift of nature that is bestowed upon us, it is uncertain and insecure, indeed sinister and of brief duration even in the case of those to whose lot it has fallen in most bounteous measure, at all events when we regard the whole extent of time. What of the fact that, if we take into account our nightly period of slumber, everybody is alive for only a half of his life, whereas an equal portion is passed in a manner that resembles death, or, in default of slumber, torture. And we are not counting in the years of infancy that lack sensation, nor those of old age that remains alive to be tormented, nor all the kinds of dangers, all the diseases, all the fears, all the anxieties, with death so often invoked that this is the commonest of prayers. But nature has granted man no better gift than the shortness of life. The senses grow dull, the limbs are numb, sight, hearing, gait, even the teeth and alimentary organs die before we do, and yet this period is reckoned a portion of life. Consequently it is virtually a miracle — and this is the solitary instance of it found — that the musician <a href=/people/2359 target=_blank>Xenophilus</a> lived to 105 without any bodily disablement. But assuredly with all the rest of men, as in the case of none of the other animals, morbid heat or else stiffness returns through the several portions of the limbs at fixed hours, and not only at certain hours but also every three or four days or nights, even all the year round. And moreover the death of the intellect in some measure is a disease. For nature has imposed certain laws even upon diseases: a four-day-period fever never begins at midwinter or in the winter months, and some people are not attacked by it when over the age of 60, while with others, particularly women, it is discarded at puberty; and old men are least susceptible to plague. For diseases attack not only entire nations but also particular classes, sometimes the slaves, sometimes the nobility, and so Through other grades. In this respect it has been observed that plague always travels from southern quarters westward and almost never otherwise, and that it does not spread in winter, nor during a period exceeding three months. </p>                        </div>

This inventiveness I for my part also receive in a similar way in the case of <a href=/people/969 target=_blank>Epimenides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353252PKno class=person long=25.1631 lat=35.2978>Cnossus</a> — that when a boy, being weary with the heat and with travel, he slept in a cave 57 years, and when he woke, just as if it had been on the following day, was surprised at the appearance of things and the change in them; and afterwards old age came on him in the same number of days as he had slept years, though nevertheless he lived to the age of 157. The female sex seems specially liable to this malady, caused by distortion of the womb; if this is set right, the breathing is restored. To this subject belongs the essay of <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a>, well known in Greece, about the woman recalled to life after being dead for seven days. </p>                        </div>

He adds some marvellous occurrences that it would be suitable to have set out in their entirety: that there were two brothers <a href=/people/6383 target=_blank>Corfidius</a>, of the rank of knights, to the elder of whom it happened that he appeared to have expired, and when his will was opened the younger brother was read out as his heir, and set about arranging his funeral; in the meantime the brother who appeared to be dead summoned the servants by clapping his hands and told them that he had come from his brother, who had entrusted his daughter to his care, and had also shown him where he had without anybody's knowledge hidden some gold in a hole dug in the ground, and had asked that the preparations that he had made for his brother's funeral might be used for himself. While he was telling this story his brother's servants hurriedly came with the news that their master was dead; and the gold was found in the place where he had said. Moreover life is full of these prophecies, but they are not worth collecting, because more often than not they are false, as we will prove by an outstanding example. In the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> War the bravest man in <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s navies Gabienus was taken prisoner by Sextus <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, by whose order his throat was cut and almost severed, and so he lay a whole day on the shore. Then on the arrival of evening, a crowd having been gathered to the spot by his groans and entreaties, he besought that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> should come to him, or send one of his personal staff, as he had come back from the lower world and had some news to tell him. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> sent several of his friends, who were told by Gabienus that the gods below approved <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s cause and the righteous party, so that the issue would be what <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> desired; that he had had orders to bring this news, and that a proof of its truth would be that as soon as his errand was accomplished he would expire. And this so happened. There are also cases of persons appearing after burial — save that our subject is the works of nature, not prodigies. </p>                        </div>

All men are in the same state from their last day onward as they were before their first day, and neither body nor mind possesses any sensation after death, any more than it did before birth — for the same vanity prolongs itself also into the future and fabricates for itself a life lasting even into the period of death, sometimes bestowing on the soul immortality, sometimes transfiguration, sometimes giving sensation to those below, and worshipping ghosts and making a god of one who has already ceased to be even a man — just as if man's mode of breathing were in any way different from that of the other animals, or as if there were not many animals found of greater longevity, for which nobody prophesies a similar immortality! But what is the substance of the soul taken by itself? what is its material? where is its thought located? how does it see and hear, and with what does it touch? what use does it get from these senses, or what good can it experience without them? Next, what is the abode. or how great is the multitude, of the souls or shadows in all these ages? These are fictions of childish absurdity, and belong to a mortality greedy for life unceasing. Similar also is the vanity about preserving men's bodies, and about <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a>'s promise of our coming to life again — who did not come to life again himself! Plague take it, what is this mad idea that life is renewed by death? what repose are the generations ever to have if the soul retains permanent sensation in the upper world and the ghost in the lower? Assuredly this sweet but credulous fancy ruins nature's chief blessing, death, and doubles the sorrow of one about to die by the thought of sorrow to come hereafter also; for if to live is sweet, who can find it sweet to have done living?

They are also believed to understand the obligations of another's religion in so far as to refuse to embark on board ships when going overseas before they are lured on by the mahout's sworn promise in regard to their return. And they have been seen when exhausted by suffering (as even those vast frames are attacked by diseases) to lie on their backs and throw grass up to the heaven, as though deputing the earth to support their prayers. Indeed so far as concerns docility, they do homage to their king by kneeling before him and proffering garlands.

It is said that when an elephant accidentally meets a human being who is merely wandering across its track in a solitary place it is good-tempered and peaceful and will actually show the way; but that when on the other hand it notices a man's footprint before it sees the man himself it begins to tremble in fear of an ambush, stops to sniff the scent, gazes round, trumpets angrily, and avoids treading on the footprint but digs it up and passes it to the next elephant, and that one to the following, and on to the last of all with a similar message, and then the column wheels round and retires and a battle line is formed: since the smell in question lasts to be scented by them all, though in the majority of cases it is not even the smell of bare feet. Similarly a tigress also, It is said, even though savage to all other animals and herself scorning the footprints even of an elephant, when she sees the track of a human being at once carries her cubs elsewhere. — Though how has she recognized or where has she seen before the person that she fears? For it is certain that such forests are very little frequented. Granted that no doubt they may be surprised by the mere rarity of the print; but how do they know that it is something to be afraid of? Indeed there is a further point, why should they dread even the sight of a man himself when they excel him so greatly in strength, size and speed? Doubtless it is Nature's law and shows her power, that the fiercest and largest wild beasts may have never seen a thing that they ought to fear and yet understand immediately when they have to fear it. </p>                        </div>

When going to ford a river they put the smallest in front, so that the bottom may not be worn away by the tread of the larger ones, thus increasing the depth of the water. <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> states that two elephants employed for military purposes by King <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> were known to the public even by name; indeed they know their own names. It is a fact that <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, although he has removed the names of military commanders from his Annals, has recorded that the elephant in the Carthaginian army that was the bravest in battle was called the Syrian, and that it had one broken tusk. When <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> was trying to ford a river his elephant Ajax refused, though on other occasions it always led the line; thereupon <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> issued an announcement that the elephant that crossed should have the leading place and he rewarded <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a>, who made the venture, with the gift of silver harness, an elephant's greatest delight, and with every other mark of leadership. The one disgraced preferred death by starvation to humiliation; for the elephant has a remarkable sense of shame, and when defeated shrinks from the voice of its conqueror, and offers him earth and foliage. Owing to their modesty, elephants never mate except in secret, the male at the age of five and the female at ten; and mating takes place for two years, on five days, so it is said, of each year and not more; and on the sixth day they give themselves a shower-bath in a river, not returning to the herd before. Adultery is unknown among them, or any of the fighting for females that is so disastrous to the other animals — though not because they are devoid of strong affection, for it is reported that one elephant in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> fell in love with a girl who was selling flowers, and (that nobody may think that it was a vulgar choice) who was a remarkable favourite of the very celebrated scholar <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>; and another elephant is said to have fallen in love with a young soldier in <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>'s army, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=demonym long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracusan</a> named <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>, and whenever it did not see him to have shown its longing for him by refusing food. Also <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a> records a girl selling scent who was loved by an elephant. In all these cases the animals showed their affection by their delight at the sight of the object and their clumsy gestures of endearment, and by keeping the branches given to them by the public and showering them in the loved one's lap. Nor is it surprising that animals possessing memory are also capable of affection. For the same writer records a case of an elephant's recognizing many years later in old age a man who had been its mahout in its youth, and also an instance of a sort of insight in to justice, when King <a href=/people/1442 target=_blank>Bocchus</a> tied to stakes thirty elephants which he intended to punish and exposed them to a herd of the same number, men running out among them to provoke them to the attack, and it proved impossible to make them perform the service of ministering to another's cruelty. </p>                        </div>

For he pitted one survivor against an elephant, and this man, having secured a promise of his freedom if he killed the animal, met it single-handed in the arena and much to the chagrin of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> dispatched it. <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> realized that reports of this encounter would bring the animals into contempt, so he sent horsemen to kill the man as he was departing. Experiences in our battles with <a href=/people/85 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> made it clear that it is very easy to lop off an elephant's trunk. Fenestella states that the first elephant fought in the circus at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> in the curule aedileship of <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> <a href=/people/11027 target=_blank>Pulcher</a> and the consulship of Marcus <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> and Aulus <a href=/people/419 target=_blank>Postumius</a>, 99 BC., and also that the first fight of an elephant against <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> was twenty years later in the curule aedileship of the <a href=/people/4188 target=_blank>Luculli</a>. Also in <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s second consulship, at the dedication of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SVeG class=place long=12.4848 lat=41.8941>Temple</a> of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> Victrix, twenty, or, as some record, seventeen, fought in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCiM class=place long=12.4871 lat=41.8852>Circus</a>, their opponents being <a href=/people/12044 target=_blank>Gaetulians</a> armed with javelins, one of the animals putting up a marvellous fight — its feet being disabled by wounds it crawled against the hordes of the enemy on its knees, snatching their shields from them and throwing them into the air, and these as they fell delighted the spectators by the curves they described, as if they were being thrown by a skilled juggler and not by an infuriated wild animal. There was also a marvellous occurrence in the case of another, which was killed by a single blow, as the javelin striking it under the eye had reached the vital parts of the head. The whole band attempted to burst through the iron palisading by which they were enclosed and caused considerable trouble among the public. Owing to this, when subsequently <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> in his dictatorship was going to exhibit a similar show he surrounded the arena with channels of water; these the emperor <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> removed when adding special places for the Knighthood. But <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s elephants when they had lost all hope of escape tried to gain the compassion of the crowd by indescribable gestures of entreaty, deploring their fate with a sort of wailing, so much to the distress of the public that they forgot the general and his munificence carefully devised for their honour, and bursting into tears rose in a body and invoked curses on the head of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> for which he soon afterwards paid the penalty. Elephants also fought for the dictator <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> in his third consulship, twenty being matched against 500 foot soldiers, and on a second occasion an equal number carrying castles each with a garrison of 60 men, who fought a pitched battle against the same number of infantry as on the former occasion and an equal number of cavalry; and subsequently for the emperors <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> and <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> elephants versus men single-handed, as the crowning exploit of the gladiators' careers. </p>                        </div>

Africa captures elephants by means of pitfalls; when an elephant straying from the herd falls into one of these all the rest at once collect branches of trees and roll down rocks and construct ramps, exerting every effort in the attempt to get it out. Previously for the purpose of taming them the kings used to round them up with horsemen into a trench made by hand so as to deceive them by its length, and when they were enclosed within its banks and ditches they were starved into submission; the proof of this would be if when a man held out a branch to them they gently took it from him. At the present day hunters for the sake of their tusks shoot them with javelins in the foot, which in fact is extremely soft. The Cavemen on the frontier of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, whose only food is elephant meat obtained by hunting, climb up trees near the elephants' track and there keep a look out for the last of the whole column and jump down on to the hind part of its haunches; the tail is grasped in the man's left hand and his feet are planted on the animal's left thigh, and so hanging suspended, with his right hand and with a very sharp axe he hamstrings one leg, and as the elephant runs forward with its leg crippled he strikes the sinews of the other leg, performing the whole of these actions with extreme rapidity. Others employing a safer but less reliable method fix great bows rather deep in the ground, unbent; these are held in position by young men of exceptional strength, while others striving with a united effort bend them, and as the elephants pass by they shoot them with hunting-spears instead of arrows and afterwards follow the tracks of blood. </p>                        </div>

The elephants untie the knots with their trunk. But the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> poke their heads right into the elephants' nostrils, hindering their breathing and at the same time lacerating their tenderest parts; also when caught in the path of the elephants they rear up against them, going specially for their eyes: this is how it comes about that elephants are frequently found blind and exhausted with hunger and wasting misery. </p>                        </div>

Sexual passion is strong in this species, with its consequence of quarrelsomeness in the males; this is most observed in Africa, where the shortage of water makes the animals flock to the few rivers. There are consequently many varieties of hybrids in that country, either violence or lust mating the males with the females of each species indiscriminately. This is indeed the origin of the common saying of Greece that Africa is always producing some novelty. A <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> detects intercourse with a leopard in the case of an adulterous mate by scent, and concentrates his entire strength on her chastisement; consequently this guilty stain is washed away in a stream, or else she keeps her distance when accompanying him. But I notice that there used to be a popular belief that the lioness only bears a cub once, as her womb is wounded by the points of its claws in delivery. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, however, whose authority I feel bound to cite first as I am going in great part to follow him on these subjects, gives a different account. King <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the Great being fired with a desire to know the natures of animals and having delegated the pursuit of this study to <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> as a man of supreme eminence in every branch of science, orders were given to some thousands of persons throughout the whole of Asia and Greece, all those who made their living by hunting, fowling, and fishing and those who were in charge of warrens, herds, apiaries, fishponds and aviaries, to obey his instructions, so that he might not fail to be informed about any creature born anywhere. His enquiries addressed to those persons resulted in the composition of his famous works on zoology, in nearly 50 volumes. To my compendium of these, with the addition of facts unknown to him, I request my readers to give a favourable reception, while making a brief excursion under our direction among the whole of the works of Nature, the central interest of the most glorious of all sovereigns. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> then states that a lioness at the first birth produces five cubs, and each year one fewer, and after bearing a single cub becomes barren; and that the cubs are mere lumps of flesh and very small, at the beginning of the size of weasels, and at six months are scarcely able to walk, not moving at all until they are two months old; also that <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> are found in Europe only between the rivers <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383211WAch class=place long=21.1067 lat=38.3388>Achelous</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418238WNes class=place long=24.771 lat=41.0916>Mestus</a>, but that these far exceed in strength those produced by Africa and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>. </p>                        </div>

The males lift one leg in making water, like <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>. Their smell is disagreeable, and not less their breath. They are infrequent drinkers, and they feed every other day, after a full meal occasionally abstaining from food for three days; when chewing they swallow whole what they can, and when their belly will not contain the result of their gluttony, they insert their clenched claws into their throats and drag it out, so that if they have to run away they may not go in a state of repletion.

Opinion will vary in accordance with each person's as experience has not decided whether it be true or false that even <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a> can be enticed out by song and forced to submit to chastisement. <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lions</a> indicate their state of mind by means of their tail, as <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> do by their ears: for Nature has assigned even these means of expression to all the noblest animals. Consequently the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>'s tail is motionless when he is calm, and moves gently when he wishes to cajole — which is seldom, since anger is more usual; at the onset of which the earth is lashed, and as the anger grows, his back is lashed as if for a mode of incitement. A <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>'s greatest strength is in the chest. Black blood flows from every wound, whether made by claw or tooth. Yet when <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> are glutted they are harmless. The <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>'s nobility of spirit is detected most in dangers, not merely in the way that despising weapons he protects himself for a long time only by intimidation, and protests as it were that he is acting under compulsion, and rises to the encounter not as if forced by danger but as though enraged by madness; but a nobler indication of this spirit is this, that however large a force of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> and hunters besets him, in level plains and where he can be seen he retires contemptuously and constantly halting, but when he has made his way into brushwood and forest he proceeds at top speed, as if aware that the lie of the land conceals his disgrace. When pursuing he advances by leaps and bounds, but he does not use this gait when in flight. When he has been wounded he marks down his assailant in a marvellous way, and knows him and picks him out in however large a him but fails to wound him he seizes and whirling him round flings him on the ground, but does not wound him. It is said that when a mother <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> is fighting in defence of her cubs she fixes the gaze of her eyes upon the ground so as not to flinch from the hunting spears. Otherwise <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> are devoid of craft and suspicion, and they do not look at you with eyes askance and dislike being looked at in a similar way. The belief has been held that a dying <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> bites the earth and bestows a tear upon death. Yet though of such a nature and of such ferocity this animal is frightened by wheels turning round and by empty chariots, and even more by the crested combs and the crowing of cocks, but most of all by fires. The only malady to which it is liable is that of distaste for food; in this condition it can be cured by insulting treatment, the pranks of monkeys tied to it driving it to fury; and then tasting their blood acts as a remedy. </p>                        </div>

In the principate of <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> accident taught a <a href=/people/12044 target=_blank>Gaetulian</a> shepherd a method that was almost one to be ashamed of in the case of a wild animal of this nature: when it charged he flung a cloak against its onset — a feat that was immediately transferred to the arena as a show — the creature's great ferocity abating in an almost incredible manner when its head is covered with even a light wrap, with the result that it is vanquished without showing fight. The fact is that all its strength is concentrated in its eyes, which makes it less remarkable that when <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a> by order of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was shut up in a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>'s cage he succeeded in strangling it.

For his riding in this fashion with the actress <a href=/people/5592 target=_blank>Cytheris</a> at his side was a thing that outdid even the portentous oecnrrences of that disastrous period.

In a similar manner a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a> named <a href=/people/1068 target=_blank>Elpis</a> on landing from a ship in Africa, saw near the coast a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> opening its jaws in a threatening way, and took refuge up a tree, calling on <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Father Liber</a> for help, since the chief occasion for praying is an emergency where there is no room for hope. The beast had not stood in his way when he tried to run away although it might have done, and lying down by the tree began to beg for compassion with the gaping jaws by which it had scared the man. Owing to its biting its food too greedily a bone had stuck in its teeth, and was tormenting it with starvation and not merely with the punishment contained in the actual prickles, as it gazed up and looked as if making a silent prayer for aid — while chance events are not to be relied on in face of a wild animal, and much longer hesitation is caused by surprise than by alarm. But finally he came down and pulled out the bone for the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>, which held out its foot to him and adjusted it at the most necessary angle; and they say that as long as that vessel remained on the coast the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> displayed its gratitude by bringing its catches to its benefactor. This led <a href=/people/1068 target=_blank>Elpis</a> to consecrate in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a> a temple to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Father Liber</a>, to which from that occurrence the Greeks have given the name of Temple of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> with his Mouth Open. After this do not let us be surprised that men's tracks are recognized by wild beasts when they actually hope for assistance from one of the animal race: for why did they not go to other animals, or how do they know of man's healing touch? Unless perchance violent maladies force even wild animals to every expedient. </p>                        </div>

The first result of his compassion therefore was not to be frightened, and the next to give her his attention; and he followed where she drew him by lightly touching his clothes with her claws, and when he understood the cause of her grief and at the same time the recompense due for his own security, he got the cubs out of the pit; and the panther with her young escorted him right to the edge of the desert, guiding him with gestures of delight that made it quite clear that she was expressing gratitude and not reckoning on any recompense, which is rare even in a human being. </p>                        </div>

The <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a> produced in Africa and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> are feeble and small, but those of colder regions are cruel and fierce. We are bound to pronounce with confidence that the story of men being turned into <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a> and restored to themselves again is false — or else we must believe all the tales that the experience of so many centuries has taught us to be fabulous; nevertheless we will indicate the origin of the popular belief, which is so firmly rooted that it classes were<a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a> among persons under a curse. <a href=/people/5661 target=_blank>Evanthes</a>, who holds no contemptible position among the authors of Greece, writes that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a> have a tradition that someone chosen out of the clan of a certain Anthus by casting lots among the family is taken to a certain marsh in that region, and hanging his clothes on an oak-tree swims across the water and goes away into a desolate place and is transformed into a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> and herds with the others of the same kind for nine years; and that if in that period he has refrained from touching a human being, he returns to the same marsh, swims across it and recovers his shape, with nine years' age added to his former appearance; <a href=/people/5661 target=_blank>Evanthes</a> also adds the more fabulous detail that he gets back the same clothes. It is astounding to what lengths Greek credulity will go; there is no lie so shameless as to lack a supporter. Similarly <a href=/people/5443 target=_blank>Apollas</a> the author of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> Victors relates that at the sacrifice which even at that date the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a> used to perform in honour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375220SLyk class=place long=21.9954 lat=37.4484>Lycaean Zeus</a> with a human victim, Daemenetus of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPar class=person long=22.15 lat=37.45>Parrhasia</a> tasted the vitals of a boy who had been offered as a victim and turned himself into a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>, and furthermore that he was restored ten years later and trained himself in athletics for boxing and returned a winner from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=person long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>. Moreover it is popularly believed that even the tail of this animal contains a love-poison in a small tuft of hair, and when it is caught it sheds the tuft, which has not the same potency unless plucked from the animal while it is alive; that the days on which it breeds are not more than twelve in a whole year; also that for it to feed on earth when it is hungry counts as an augury: if it does this in large mouthfuls when barring the path of travellers who come upon it on their right hand side, this is the finest of all omens. Some members of the genus are called stag-<a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a>; a specimen from Gaul was seen in the arena of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> the Great, as we have stated. They say that if this animal while devouring its food looks behind it, however hungry it is, forgetfulness of what it is eating creeps over it and it goes off to look for something else. </p>                        </div>

Although so pestilential, this animal has one emotion or rather affection: they usually roam in couples, male and female, and only live with their consort. Accordingly when either of the pair has been destroyed the other is incredibly anxious for revenge: it pursues the murderer and by means of some mark of recognition attacks him and him only in however large a throng of people, bursting through all obstacles and traversing all distances, and it is only debarred by rivers or by very rapid flight. It is impossible to declare whether Nature has engendered evils or remedies more bountifully. In the first place she has bestowed on this accursed creature dim eyes, and those not in the forehead for it to look straight in front of it, but in the temples — and consequently it is more quickly excited by hearing than by sight; and in the next place she has given it war to the death with the ichneumon. </p>                        </div>

The hippopotamus stands out as an actual master in one department of medicine; for when its unceasing voracity has caused it to overeat itself it comes ashore to reconnoitre places where rushes have recently been cut, and where it sees an extremely sharp stalk it squeezes its body down on to it and makes a wound in a certain vein in its leg, and by thus letting blood unburdens its body, which would otherwise be liable to disease, and plasters up the wound again with mud. </p>                        </div>

Nor is the ibis alone, but many animals have made discoveries destined to be useful for man as well. The value of the herb dittany for extracting arrows was shown by stags when wounded by that weapon and ejecting it by grazing on that herb; likewise stags when bitten by the phalangium, a kind of <a href=/people/10968 target=_blank>spider</a>, or any similar animal cure themselves by eating crabs. There is also a herb that is particularly good for snakebites, with which lizards heal themselves whenever they fight a battle with <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> and are wounded. Celandine was shown to be very healthy for the sight by swallows using it as a medicine for their chicks' sore eyes. The tortoise eats cunila, called <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>-grass, to restore its strength against the effect of snake-bites; the weasel cures itself with rue when it has had a fight with <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mice</a> in hunting them. The stork drugs itself with marjoram in sickness, and <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> use ivy and a diet consisting mostly of crabs thrown up from the sea. When a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a>'s body gets covered with a skin owing to its winter inactivity it sloughs this hindrance to its movement by means of fennel-sap and comes out all glossy for spring; but it begins the process at its head, and takes at least 24 hours to do it, folding the skin backward so that what was the inner side of it becomes the outside. Moreover as its sight is obscured by its hibernation it anoints and revives its eyes by rubbing itself against a fennel plant, but if its scales have become numbed it scratches itself on the spiny leaves of a juniper. A large <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> quenches its spring nausea with the juice of wild lettuce. Barbarian hunters catch leopards by means of meat rubbed over with wolfs bane; their throats are at once attacked by violent pain (in consequence of which some people have given this poison a Greek name meaning choke-leopard), but to cure this the creature doses itself with human excrement, and in general it is so greedy for this that shepherds have a plan of hanging up some of it in a vessel too high for the leopard to be able to reach it by jumping up, and the animal keeps springing up and trying to get it till it is exhausted and finally dies, although otherwise its vitality is so persistent that it will go on fighting for a long time after its entrails have been torn out. When an elephant swallows a chameleon (which is poisonous to it) because it is of the same colour as a leaf, it uses the wild olive as a remedy. When bears have swallowed the fruit of the mandrake they lick up ants. A stag uses wild artichoke as an antidote to poisoned fodder. Pigeons, jays, blackbirds and partridges cure their yearly distaste for food with bay-leaves; doves, turtle-doves and domestic fowls use the plant called helxine, ducks, geese and other water-fowl water-starwort, cranes and the like marsh-rushes. When a raven has killed a chameleon lizard, which is noxious even to its conqueror, it stanches the poisonous infection with bay-leaves. </p>                        </div>

When beset by a pack of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> they fly for refuge of their own accord to a human being, and when giving birth to young are less careful to avoid paths worn by human footprints than secluded places that are advantageous for wild beasts. The mating season is after the rising of <a href=/people/632 target=_blank>Arcturus</a>. Pregnancy lasts eight months, and occasionally they bear twins. After mating the hinds withdraw, but the deserted males rage in a fury of desire, and score the ground with their horns; afterwards their snouts are black till a considerable rainfall washes off the dirt. The females before giving birth use a certain plant called hartwort as a purge, so having an easier delivery. After giving birth they browse on the two plants named dittany and seseli before they return to the young: for some reason or other they desire the sucklings' first draughts of milk to be flavoured with those herbs. When the fawns are born they exercise them in running and teach them to practise escaping, and take them to cliffs and show them how to jump. The males when at last freed from lustful desire greedily seek pasture; when they feel they are too fat, they look for lairs to hide in, showing that they are conscious of inconvenient weight. And on other occasions when running away from pursuit they always stop and stand gazing backward, when the hunters draw near again seeking refuge in flight: this is done owing to pain in the gut, which is so weak that a light blow causes internal rupture. But when they hear the baying of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> they always run away down wind, so that their scent may go away with them. They can be charmed by a shepherd's pipe and by song. Their hearing is very keen when they raise their ears, but dull when they drop them. In other respects the deer is a simple animal and stupefied by surprise at everything — so much so that when a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> or a heifer is approaching they do not notice a huntsman close to them, or if they see him merely gaze in wonder at his bow and arrows. They cross seas swimming in a herd strung out in line with their heads resting on the haunches of the ones in front of them, and taking turns to drop to the rear: this is most noticed when they are crossing from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>; and they do not keep land in sight but swim towards its scent. The males have horns, and alone of animals shed them every year at a fixed time in spring; consequently when the day in question approaches they resort as much as possible to unfrequented places. When they have lost their home they keep in hiding as if disarmed — although these animals also are grudging of their special good: people say that a stag's right horn, which is endowed with some sort of healing drug, is never found; and this must be confessed to be the more surprising in view of the fact that even stags kept in warrens change their horns every year: it is thought that they bury them. The smell of either horn when burnt arrests attacks of epilepsy. They also bear marks of their age in their horns, each year till they are six years old adding one time; though thenceforward the horns grow again like the old ones and the age cannot be told by them. But old age is indicated by the teeth, for the old have either few or none, nor have they tines at the bottom of the horns, though otherwise these usually jut out in front of the brow when they are younger. When stags have been gelded the horns do not fall off nor grow again, but burst out with excrescences that keep springing again, at first resembling dry skin, and then grow up with tender shoots into reedy tufts feathered with soft down. As long as the stags are without them, they go out to graze in the nights. When they are growing again they harden them with the heat of the sun, subsequently testing them on trees, and only go out into the open when satisfied with theft strength; and before now they have been caught with green ivy on their antlers, that has been grafted on the tender horns as on a log of wood as a result of rubbing them against trees while testing them. Stags are sometimes even of a white colour, as Quintus <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a>'s hind is said to have been, which he had persuaded the tribes of Spain to believe prophetic. Even stags are at war with a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a>; they track out their holes and draw them out by means of the breath of their nostrils in spite of their resistance. Consequently the smell made by burning stag's horn is an outstanding thing for driving away <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a>, while a sovereign cure against bites is obtained from the rennet of a fawn killed in its mother's womb. Stags admittedly have a long life, some having been caught a hundred years later with the gold necklaces that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the Great had put on them already covered up by the hide in great folds of fat. This animal is not liable to feverish diseases — indeed it even supplies a prophylactic against their attack; we know that recently certain ladies of the imperial house have made a practice of eating venison every day in the morning and have been free from fevers throughout a long lifetime; though it is thought that this only holds good if the stag has been killed by a single wound. </p>                        </div>

These are a white and shapeless lump of flesh, little larger than <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mice</a>, without eyes or hair and only the claws projecting. This lump the mother bears slowly lick into shape. Nor is anything more unusual than to see a she-bear giving birth to cubs. Consequently the males lie in hiding for periods of forty days, and the females four months. If they have not got caves, they build rainproof dens by heaping up branches and brushwood, with a carpet of soft foliage on the floor. For the first fortnight they sleep so soundly that they cannot be aroused even by wounds; at this period they get fat with sloth to a remarkable degree (the bear's grease is useful for medicines and a prophylactic against baldness). As a result of these days of sleep they shrink in bulk and they live by sucking their fore paws. They cherish their freezing offspring by pressing them to their breast, lying on them just like birds hatching eggs. Strange to say, <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> believes that even boiled bear's flesh, if kept, goes on growing in size for that period; that no evidence of food and only the smallest amount of water is found in the belly at this stage, and that there are only a few drops of blood in the neighbourhood of the heart and none in the rest of the body. In the spring they come out, but the males are very fat, a fact the cause of which is not evident, as they have not been fattened up even by sleep, except for a fortnight as we have said. On coming out they devour a plant called wake-robin to loosen the bowels, which are otherwise constipated, and they rub their teeth on tree-stumps to get their mouths into training. Their eyes have got dim, which is the chief reason why they seek for hives, so that their face may be stung by the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> to relieve that trouble with blood. A bear's weakest part is the head, which is the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>'s strongest; consequently if when hard pressed by an attack they are going to fling themselves down from a rock they make the jump with their head covered with their fore paws, and in the arena are often killed by their head being broken by a buffet. The Spanish provinces believe that a bear's brain contains poison, and when bears are killed in shows their heads are burnt in the presence of a witness, on the ground that to drink the poison drives a man bear-mad. Bears even walk on two feet, and they crawl down trees backward. They tire out <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> with their weight by hanging by all four feet from their mouth and horns; and no other animal's stupidity is more cunning in doing harm. It is noted in the Annals that on 19 September in the consulship of Marcus <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> and Marcus <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messala</a>, <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> <a href=/people/1039 target=_blank>Ahenobarbus</a> as curule aedile provided in the circus a hundred <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=demonym long=3 lat=36>Numidian</a> bears and the same number of Ethiopian huntsmen.

The same animals foretell a change of wind from North to South by retiring to their lair. But when they perceive someone hunting them they draw together their mouth and feet and all their lower part, which has thin and harmless down on it, and roll up into the shape of a ball, so that it may not be possible to take hold of any part of them except the prickles. But when desperate they make water over themselves, which corrodes their hide and damages their spines, for the sake of which they know that people catch them. Hence the scientific way is to hunt them just after they have discharged their water. And then the hide is of particular value, whereas otherwise it is spoiled and fragile, with the spines rotting and falling out, even if the animal escapes by flight and lives. On this account it does not drench itself with this damaging stuff except as a last resort, since even the creatures themselves hate this self-poisoning, sparing themselves and waiting for the final limit so long that usually capture overtakes them beforehand. Afterwards the ball into which they roll up can be made to unroll by a sprinkle of hot water, and to fasten them up by one of the hind feet kills them through starvation when hanging: it is not possible to kill them in any other way and avoid damaging the hide. The animal itself is not, as most of us think, superfluous for the life of mankind, since, if it had not spines, the softness of the hides in <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> would have been bestowed on mortals to no purpose: hedgehog skirt is used in dressing cloth for garments.

The services of the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> kind are undoubtedly bountiful in ploughing as well, but especially in breeding mules. In mules also regard is paid to locality of origin — in Greece the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a> breed is esteemed and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> the Iteatine. The <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> itself is very bad at enduring cold, and consequently is not bred in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Black Sea</a> district; and it is not allowed to breed at the spring equinox like all other <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, but at midsummer. The males make worse sires when not in work. The females breed at two and a half years old at earliest, but regularly from three; they can breed as many times as mares, and in the same months and in a similar way. But the womb cannot retain the genital fluid but discharges it, unless the animal is whipped into a gallop after coupling. It seldom bears twins. When about to bear a foal it shuns the sunlight and seeks the shadow, so as not to be seen by a human being. It breeds through all its lifetime, which is thirty years. It has a very great affection for its young, but a greater dislike for water: she-<a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> will go through fire to their foals, but yet if the smallest stream intervenes they are afraid of merely wetting their hooves. Those kept in pastures will only drink at springs they are used to, and where they can get to drink by a dry track; and they will not go across bridges with interstices in their structure allowing the gleam of the river to be seen through them; and, surprising to say, they may be thirsty and have to be forced or coaxed to drink, if the stream is not the one they are used to. Only a wide allowance of stall-room is safe for them to lie down in, for when asleep they have a variety of dreams and frequently let out with their hooves, which at once causes lameness by hitting timber that is too hard unless they have plenty of room to kick in. The profit made out of she-<a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> surpasses the richest spoils of war. It is known that in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403-29RCel class=place long=-2.9 lat=40.32>Celtiberia</a> their foals have made 400,000 sesterces per dam, especially when mules are bred. They say that in she-<a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> the hair of the ears and the eyelids is an important point, for although the rest of the dam's body is all one colour, the foal reproduces all the colours that were in those places. <a href=/people/1293 target=_blank>Maecenas</a> set the fashion of eating <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>donkey</a> foals at banquets, and they were much preferred to wild <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> at that period; but after his time the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> lost favour as a delicacy.

To breed mules they choose mares not less than four or more than ten years old. Also breeders say that females of either genus refuse stallions of the other one unless as foals they were suckled by females of the same genus as the stallions; for this reason they stealthily remove the foals in the dark and put them to mares' or she-<a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a>' udders respectively. But a mule is also got by a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> out of an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>, though it is unmanageable, slow and obstinate. Also all the foals from old mares are sluggish. It causes miscarriage for a mare in foal by a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> to be put to an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>, but not vice versa. It has been observed that female <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> are best coupled six days after they have borne a foal, and that males couple better when tired. It is noticed that a female that does not conceive before she casts what are called her milk-teeth is barren, as is one that does not begin to produce foals from the first coupling. Male foals of an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> by a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> were in old days called hinnies, while the term mules was used for the foals of a mare by an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>. It has been noticed that the offspring of two different races of animals belong to a third kind and resemble neither parent; and that such hybrids are not themselves fertile: this is the case with all kinds of animals, and is the reason why mules are barren. A number of cases of reproduction by mules are recorded in our Annals, but these were considered portentous. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> states that mules breed commonly in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>, but that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=person long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocian</a> mule is a peculiar species. A mule can be checked from kicking by rather frequent drinks of wine. It is stated in the records of a good many Greeks that a foal has been got from a mare coupled with a mule, called a ginnus, which means a small mule. She-mules bred from a mare and tamed wild-<a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> are swift in pace and have extremely hard hooves, but a lean body and an indomitable spirit. But as a sire the foal of a wild-<a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> and a domestic she-<a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> excels all others. The wild-<a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375324RLyk class=place long=32.4 lat=37.5>Lycaonia</a> are pre-eminent. Africa boasts of their foals as an outstanding table delicacy; the vernacular word for them is lalisio. Records at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> attest a mule's having lived 80 years; for the citizens were so delighted because after it had been put aside owing to old age it encouraged the teams by its company and assistance in their uphill work during the construction of a temple on the citadel, that they made a decree that the corn-dealers were not to keep it away from their stands. </p>                        </div>

But now yearling heifers are called upon for breeding, though they can stand it better at two years, while <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> are made to serve at four. Each <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> serves ten <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> in the same year. It is said that if the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> after coupling go away towards the right hand side the offspring will be males, and if towards the left, females. Conception is effected by one coupling, and if this happens to miss, the female goes to a male again twenty days after. They bear the calf in the tenth month; one produced before is of no use. Some authorities say that they bear on the actual last day of the tenth month. They rarely produce twins. Coupling takes place in the thirty days following the rise of the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphin</a> on January 4, and occasionally in the autumn also, though nations that live on milk spread it out so that there may be a supply of this nutriment at every season of the year. <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>Bulls</a> do not couple more than twice in one day. <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>Oxen</a> are the only animals that graze even while walking backward; indeed among the <a href=/people/9422 target=_blank>Garamantes</a> that is their only way of grazing. The longest life of a <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a> is 15 years and of a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> 20; they grow to full strength at 5. Washing in hot water is said to fatten them, and also cutting a hole in the hide and blowing air into the flesh with a reed. Even the breeds less praised for their appearance are not to be deemed inferior: the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=demonym long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alpine</a> <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> which are the smallest in size give most milk, and do most work, although they are yoked by the head and not the neck. Syrian <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> have no dewlaps, but a hump on the back. Also the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=demonym long=28.7 lat=37.01>Carian</a> breed in a district of Asia is said to be ugly in appearance, with a swelling that projects from the neck over the shoulders and with the horns displaced, but excellent in work — although when black and white in colour they are said to be no good for ploughing; the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> have smaller and thinner horns than the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a>. <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>Oxen</a> should be broken when three years old; after that it is too late and before too early; the best way to train a young bullock is to yoke it with one already broken in. For we possess in this animal a partner in labour and in husbandry, held in such esteem with our predecessors that among our records of punishments there is a case of a man who was indicted for having killed an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> because a wanton young companion said he had never eaten bullock's tripe, and was convicted by the public court and sent into exile just as though he had murdered his farm-labourer. </p>                        </div>

In this animal only of all that have a comparatively long tail, the tail is not of the proper size from birth, as it is in the others; and with it alone the tail grows till it reaches right down to the feet. Consequently the test of victims for sacrifice in the case of a calf is that the tail must reach the joint of the hock; if it is shorter the offering is not acceptable. It has also been noted that calves are not usually acceptable if carried to the altars on a man's shoulders, and also that the gods are not propitiated if the victim is lame or is not of the appropriate sort, or if it drags itself away from the altar. It frequently occurs among the prodigies of old times that an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> spoke, and when this was reported it was customary for a meeting of the senate to be held in the open air. </p>                        </div>

They breed when two years old on both sides, till the age of nine, and in some cases even till ten. The <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> at the first birth are smaller. They all couple from the setting of <a href=/people/632 target=_blank>Arcturus</a>, that is May 13th, to the setting of <a href=/people/2035 target=_blank>Aquila</a>, July 23rd; they carry their <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> 150 days.

Many people prefer winter <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> to spring ones, holding that it is more important for them to be well-established before midsummer than before midwinter, and that this animal alone is advantageously born in winter.

Different methods of dyeing these fleeces are practised by the Gauls and by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> races. Self-felted fleeces make clothing, and also if vinegar is added withstand even steel, nay more even fire, the latest method of cleaning them. In fact fleeces drawn from the coppers of the polishers serve as stuffing for cushions, I believe by a French invention: at all events at the present day it is classified under Gallic names. And I could not easily say at what period this began; for people in old times had bedding of straw, in the same way as in camp now. Frieze cloaks began within my father's memory and cloaks with hair on both sides within my own, as also shaggy body-belts; moreover weaving a broad-striped tunic after the manner of a frieze cloak is coming in for the first time now. Black fleeces will not take dye of any colour; we will discuss the dyeing of the other sorts in their proper places under the head of marine shellfish or the nature of various plants. </p>                        </div>

Hence arose the practice that maidens at their marriage were accompanied by a decorated distaff and a spindle with thread. <a href=/people/3257 target=_blank>Tanaquil</a> first wove a straight tunic of the kind that novices wear with the plain white toga, and newly married brides. The pleated robe was the first among those most in favour; consequently the spotted robe went out of fashion. Fenestella writes that togas of smooth cloth and of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> wool began in the latest times of the late lamented <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>. Togas of closely woven poppy-cloth have a an older source, being noticed as far back as the poet <a href=/people/628 target=_blank>Lucilius</a> in the case of <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>. Bordered robes found their origin with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Etruscans</a>. I find it recorded that striped robes were worn by the kings, and they had embroidered robes as far back as <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, these being the origin of those worn in triumphs. Embroidering with the needle was discovered by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a>, and consequently embroidered robes are called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a>. Gold embroidery was also invented in Asia, by King <a href=/people/90 target=_blank>Attalus</a>, from whom Attalic robes got their name. Weaving different colours into a pattern was chiefly brought into vogue by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, which gave its name to this process. But the fabric called damask woven with a number of threads was introduced by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, and check patterns by Gaul. <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> counts it among the charges against <a href=/people/903 target=_blank>Capito</a> that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=demonym long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonian</a> coverlets were already then sold for 800,000 sesterces, which lately cost the Emperor <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> 4,000,000.

Symptoms of bad health in a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> are when blood is found on the root of a bristle pulled out of its back and when it holds its head on one side in walking. If too fat they experience lack of milk; and they have a smaller number of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> in their first litter. The breed likes wallowing in mud. The tail is curly; also it has been noticed that it is easier to kill them for sacrifice when the tail curls to the right than when to the left. They take 60 days to fatten, but fatten better if feeding up is preceded by three days' fast. The <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> is the most brutish of animals, and there used to be a not unattractive idea that its soul was given it to serve as salt. it is a known fact that some <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> carried off by thieves recognized the voice of their swineherd, crowded to one side of the ship till it capsized and sank, and swam back to shore. Moreover the leaders of a herd in the city learn to go to the market place and to find their way home; and wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>hogs</a> know how to obliterate their tracks by crossing marshy ground, and to relieve themselves when running away by making water. <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>Sows</a> are spayed in the same way as also <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a> are, by being hung up by the fore legs after two days without food and having the matrix cut out; this makes them fatten quicker. There is also a method of treating the liver of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sows</a> as of geese, a discovery of Marcus <a href=/people/2714 target=_blank>Apicius</a> — they are stuffed with dried fig, and when full killed directly after having been given a drink of mead. Nor does any animal supply a larger number of materials for an eating-house: they have almost fifty flavours, whereas all other meats have one each. Hence pages of sumptuary laws, and the prohibition of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>hog</a>'s paunches, sweetbreads, testicles, matrix and cheeks for banquets, although nevertheless no dinner of the pantomime writer Publius after he had obtained his freedom is recorded that did not include paunch — he actually got from this the nickname of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>Pig</a>'s Paunch. </p>                        </div>

The same authority says that the hare is a hermaphrodite and reproduces equally well without a male. Nature has shown her benevolence in making harmless and edible breeds of animals prolific. The hare which is born to be all creatures' prey is the only animal beside the shaggy-footed rabbit that practises superfetation, rearing one leveret while at the same time carrying in the womb another clothed with hair and another bald and another still an embryo. Also the experiment has been made of using the fur of the hare for making clothes, although it is not so soft to the touch as it is when on the animal's skin, and the garments soon come to pieces because of the shortness of the hair. </p>                        </div>

The killer whales therefore burst into their retreats and bite and mangle their calves or the females that have calved or are still in calf, and charge and pierce them like warships ramming. The whales being sluggish in bending and slow in retaliating, and burdened by their weight, and at this season also heavy with young or weakened by travail in giving birth, know only one refuge, to retreat to the deep sea and defend their safety by means of the ocean. Against this the killer whales use every effort to confront them and get in their way, and to slaughter them when cooped up in narrow straits or drive them into shallows and make them dash themselves upon rocks. To spectators these battles look as if the sea were raging against itself, as no winds are blowing in the gulf, but there are waves caused by the whales blowing and thrashing that are larger than those aroused by any whirlwinds. A killer whale was actually seen in the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Ostia</a> in battle with the Emperor <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>; it had come at the time when he was engaged in completing the structure of the harbour, being tempted by the wreck of a cargo of hides imported from Gaul, and in glutting itself for a number of days had furrowed a hollow in the shallow bottom and had been banked up with sand by the waves so high that it was quite unable to turn round, and while it was pursuing its food which was driven forward to the shore by the waves its back projected far above the water like a capsized boat. <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Caesar</a> gave orders for a barrier of nets to be stretched between the mouths of the harbour and setting out in person with the praetorian cohorts afforded a show to the Roman public, the soldiery hurling lances from the vessels against the creatures when they leapt up alongside, and we saw one of the boats sunk from being filled with water owing to a beast's snorting. </p>                        </div>

It is universally admitted that a very few other creatures in the sea also breathe, those whose internal organs include a lung, since it is thought that no animal is able to breathe without one. Those who hold this opinion believe that the fishes possessing gills do not alternately expire and inspire air, and that many other classes even lacking gills do not — an opinion which I notice that <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> a held and supported by many learned researches. Nor do I pretend that I do not myself immediately accept this view of theirs since it is possible that animals may also possess other respiratory organs in place of lungs, if nature so wills, just as also many possess another fluid instead of blood. At all events who can be surprised that this life-giving breath penetrates into water if he observes that it is also given back again from the water, and that it also penetrates into the earth, that much denser element, as is proved by animals that live always in underground burrows, like moles. Undoubtedly to my mind there are additional facts that make me believe that in fact all creatures in the water breathe, owing to the condition of their own nature — in the first place a sort of panting that has often been noticed in fishes during the summer heat, and another form of gasping, so to speak, in calm weather, and also the admission in regard to fishes sleeping made even by those persons who are of the opposite opinion — for how can sleep occur without breathing? — and moreover the bubbles caused on the surface of the water by air rising from below, and the effect of the moon in causing the bodies even of shellfish to increase in size. Above all there is the fact that it will not be doubted that fish have the sense of hearing and smell, both of which are derived from the substance of air: scent indeed could not possibly be interpreted as anything else than an infection of the air. Consequently it is open to every person to form whatever opinion about these matters he pleases. Whales do not possess gills, nor do <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphins</a>. These two genera breathe with a tube that passes to the lung, in the case of whales from the forehead and in the case of <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphins</a> from the back. Also sea-calves, called <a href=/people/10989 target=_blank>seals</a>, breathe and sleep on land, as also do tortoises, about whom more shortly. </p>                        </div>

But nature's foresight contributes delay, because they cannot seize their prey except by turning over on their backs. This fact especially shows their speed; for when spurred by hunger they have chased a fleeing fish into the lowest depths and have held their breath too long, they shoot up like arrows from a bow in order to breathe again, and leap out of the water with such force that they often fly over a ship's sails. They usually roam about in couples, husband and wife; they bear cubs after nine months, in the summer season, occasionally even twins. They suckle their young, as do whales, and even carry them about while weak from infancy; indeed they accompany them for a long time even when grown up, so great is their affection for their offspring. They grow up quickly, and are believed to reach their full size in 10 years. They live as much as 30 years, as has been ascertained by amputating the tail of a specimen for an experiment. They are in retirement for 30 days about the rising of the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-star and hide themselves in an unknown manner, which is the more surprising in view of the fact that they cannot breathe under water.

The <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphin</a>'s tongue, unlike the usual structure of aquatic animals, is mobile, and is short and broad, not unlike a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>'s tongue.

Another <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphin</a> in recent years at <a href=/people/1371 target=_blank>Hippo</a> Diarrhytus on the coast of Africa similarly used to feed out of people's hands and allow itself to be stroked, and play with swimmers and carry them on its back. The Governor of Africa, <a href=/people/4531 target=_blank>Flavianus</a>, smeared it all over with perfume, and the novelty of the scent apparently put it to sleep: it floated lifelessly about, holding aloof from human intercourse for some months as if it had been driven away by the insult; but afterwards it returned and was an object of wonder as before. The expense caused to their hosts by persons of official position who came to see it forced the people of <a href=/people/1371 target=_blank>Hippo</a> to destroy it. Before these occurrences a similar story is told about a boy in the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373276UIas class=place long=27.5846 lat=37.2795>Iasus</a>, with whom a <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphin</a> was observed for a long time to be in love, and while eagerly following him to the shore when he was going away it grounded on the sand and expired; <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the Great made the boy head of the priesthood of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, interpreting the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphin</a>'s affection as a sign of the deity's favour.

At a regular season a countless shoal of mullet rushes out of the narrow mouth of the marsh into the sea, after watching for the turn of the tide, which makes it impossible for nets to be spread across the channel — indeed the nets would be equally incapable of standing the mass of the weight even if the craft of the fish did not watch for the opportunity. For a similar reason they make straight out into the deep water produced by the neighbouring eddies, and hasten to escape from the only place suitable for setting nets. When this is observed by the fishermen — and a crowd collects at the place, as they know the time, and even more because of their keenness for this sport — and when the entire population from the shore shouts as loud as it can, calling for 'Snub-nose' for the denouement of the show, the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphins</a> quickly hear their wishes if a northerly breeze carries the shout out to sea, though if the wind is in the south, against the sound, it carries it more slowly; but then too they suddenly hasten to the spot, in order to give their aid. Their line of battle comes into view, and at once deploys in the place where they are to join battle; they bar the passage on the side of the sea and drive the scared mullet into the shallows. Then the fishermen put their nets round them and lift them out of the water with forks. None the less the pace of some mullets leaps over the obstacles; but these are caught by the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphins</a>, which are satisfied for the time being with merely having killed them, postponing a meal till victory is won. The action is hotly contested, and the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphins</a> pressing on with the greatest bravery are delighted to be caught in the nets, and for fear that this itself may hasten the enemy's flight, they glide out between the boats and the nets or the swimming fishermen so gradually as not to open ways of escape; none of them try to get away by leaping out of the water, which otherwise they are very fond of doing, unless the nets are put below them. One that gets out thereupon carries on the battle in front of the rampart. When in this way the catch has been completed they tear in pieces the fish that they have killed. But as they are aware that they have had too strenuous a task for only a single day's pay they wait there till the following day, and are given a feed of bread mash dipped in wine, in addition to the fish. </p>                        </div>

This size is only produced by the northern ocean and in its westernmost part. For the rest, there are several kinds of mullet. For it feeds on seaweed, bivalves, mud and the flesh of other fish; and it is distinguished by a double beard on the lower lip. The mullet of cheapest kind is called the mud-mullet. This variety is always accompanied by another fish named sea-bream, and it swallows down as fodder mire stirred up by the sea-bream digging. The coast mullet also is not in favour. The most approved kind have the flavour of an oyster. This variety has the name of shoe-mullet, which Fenestella thinks was given it from its colour. It spawns three times a year — at all events that is the number of times that its fry is seen. The leaders in gastronomy say that a dying mullet shows a large variety of changing colours, turning pale with a complicated modification of blushing scales, at all events if it is looked at when contained in a glass bowl. Marcus <a href=/people/2714 target=_blank>Apicius</a>, who had a natural gift for every ingenuity of luxury, thought it specially desirable for mullets to be killed in a sauce made of their companions, garum — for this thing also has procured a designation — and for fish-paste to be devised out of their liver. </p>                        </div>

They swim with their head on one side, this while they are alive being hard as though blown out. Otherwise they remain adhering with a kind of suction, by means of a sort of suckers spread over their arms: throwing themselves backward they hold on so that they cannot be torn away. They do not cling to the bottom of the sea, and have less holding-power when full-grown. They alone of the soft creatures go out of the water on to dry land, provided it has a rough surface: they hate smooth surfaces. They feed on the flesh of shellfish, the shells of which they break by enfolding them with their tentacles; and consequently their lair can be detected by the shells lying in front of it. And though the polyp is in other respects deemed a stupid animal, inasmuch as it swims towards a man's hand, it has a certain kind of sense in its domestic economy: it collects everything into its home, and then after it has eaten the flesh puts out the refuse and catches the little fishes that swim up to it. It changes its colour to match its environment, and particularly when it is frightened.

Polyps go into hiding for periods of two months. They do not live more than two years; but they always die of consumption, the females more quickly and usually as a result of bearing offspring. We must also not pass over the facts as to the polyp ascertained when Lucius <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> was governor of <a href=/people/1366 target=_blank>Baetica</a>, and published by one of his staff, <a href=/people/3984 target=_blank>Trebius</a> <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a>; he says that they are extremely greedy for shell-fish, and that these close their shells at a touch and cut off the polyp's tentacles, so retaliating by obtaining food from their would-be robber. Shell-fish do not possess sight or any other sense except consciousness of food and danger. Consequently the polyps lie in wait for the shell-fish to open, and placing a stone between the shells, not on the fish's body so that it may not be ejected by its throbbing, thus go to work at their ease, and drag out the flesh, while the shell-fish try to shut up, but in vain, as they are wedged open: so clever are even the most stupid of animals. Moreover <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> asserts that no animal is more savage in causing the death of a man in the water; for it struggles with him by coiling round him and swallows him with its sucker-cups and drags him asunder by its multiple suction, when it attacks men that have been shipwrecked or are diving. But should it be turned over, its strength gets feebler; for when polyps are lying on their backs they stretch themselves out. The rest of the facts reported by the same authority may possibly be thought to approximate to the miraculous. In the fishponds at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362000UCar class=place long=-5.4104 lat=36.1832>Carteia</a> a polyp was in the habit of getting into their uncovered tanks from the open sea and there foraging for salted fish — even the smell of which attracts all sea creatures in a surprising way, owing to which even fish-traps are smeared with them — and so it brought on itself the wrath of the keepers, which owing to the persistence of the theft was beyond all bounds. Fences were erected in its way, but it used to scale these by making use of a tree, and it was only possible to catch it by means of the keen scent of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a>. These surrounded it when it was going back at night, and aroused the guards, who were astounded by its strangeness: in the first place its size was unheard of and so was its colour as well, and it was smeared with brine and had a terrible smell; who would have expected to find a polyp there, or who would recognize it in such circumstances? They felt they were pitted against something uncanny, for by its awful breath it also tormented the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>, which it now scourged with the ends of its tentacles and now struck with its longer arms, which it used as clubs; and with difficulty they succeeded in despatching it with a number of three-pronged harpoons. They showed its head to <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> — it was as big as a cask and held 90 gallons, — and (to use the words of <a href=/people/3984 target=_blank>Trebius</a> himself) 'its beards which one could hardly clasp round with both one's arms, knotted like clubs, 30 ft. long, with suckers or cups like basins holding three gallons, and teeth corresponding to its size. Its remains, kept as a curiosity, were found to weigh 700 lbs. <a href=/people/3984 target=_blank>Trebius</a> also states that cuttlefish of both species of the same size have been driven ashore on that coast. In our own seas one kind is taken that measures 7 1/2 ft. in length and the other kind 3 ft. These fish also do not live more than two years. </p>                        </div>

Langoustes stay in retirement for five months in each year; and likewise crabs, which go into hiding at the same season; and both species discard their old age at the beginning of spring in the same way as <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> do, by renewing their skins. All other aquatic species swim, but langoustes float about in the manner of reptiles; if no danger threatens they go forward in a straight course with their horns, which are buttoned by their own rounded ends, stretched out at their sides, but at a moment of alarm they advance slanting sideways with their horns held erect. They use their horns in fighting one another. The langouste is the only animal whose flesh is of a yielding texture with no hardness, unless it is boiled alive its hot water. Langoustes live in rocky places, whereas crabs live on soft mud. In winter they haunt sunny shores, but in summer they retire into the dim depths of the sea. All creatures of this class suffer in winter, but get fat in autumn and spring, and more so at full moon, because the moon mellows them with its warm glow by night. </p>                        </div>

They also have two claws with denticulated nippers; the upper half of the forepart of these moves and the lower half is fixed. The right claw is the larger in every specimen.

It has the cunning to stow itself in empty bivalve shells and to shift into roomier ones as it grows bigger. When alarmed crabs can retreat backwards with equal speed. They fight duels with one another like rams; charging with horns opposed. They afford a remedy against snake-bite.

These, we are told, when stimulated by the generative season of the year gape open as it were and are filled with dewy pregnancy, and subsequently when heavy are delivered, and the offspring of the shells are pearls that correspond to the quality of the dew received: if it was a pure inflow, their brilliance is conspicuous but if it was turbid, the product also becomes dirty in colour. Also if the sky is lowering (they say) the pearl is pale in colour: for it is certain that it was conceived from the sky, and that pearls have more connexion with the sky than with the sea, and derive from it a cloudy hue, or a clear one corresponding with a brilliant morning. If they are well fed in due season, the offspring also grows in size. If there is lightning, the shells shut up, and diminish in size in proportion to their abstinence from food; but if it also thunders they are frightened and shut up suddenly, producing what are called 'wind-pearls,' which are only inflated with an empty, unsubstantial show: these are the pearls' miscarriages. Indeed a healthy offspring is formed with a skin of many thicknesses, so that it may not improperly be considered as a hardening of the body; and consequently experts subject them to a cleansing process. I am surprised that though pearls rejoice so much in the actual sky, they redden and lose their whiteness in the sun, like the human body; consequently sea-pearls preserve a special brilliance, being too deeply immersed for the rays to penetrate; nevertheless even they get yellow from age and doze off with wrinkles, and the rigour that is sought after is only found in youth. Also in old age they get thick and stick to the shells, and cannot be torn out of these except by using a file. Pearls with only one surface, and round on that side but flat at the back, are consequently termed tambourine pearls; we have seen them clustering together in shells that owing to this enrichment were used for carrying round perfumes. For the rest, a large pearl is soft when in the water but gets hard as soon as it is taken out. </p>                        </div>

This is the final outcome of plunder, it was for this that Marcus <a href=/people/1887 target=_blank>Lollius</a> disgraced himself by taking gifts from kings in the whole of the East, and was cut out of his list of friends by Gaius <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a> son of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> and drank poison — that his granddaughter should be on show in the lamplight covered with 40,000,000 sesterces! Now let some one reckon up on one side of the account how much <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a> or <a href=/people/820 target=_blank>Fabricius</a> carried in their triumphs, and picture to himself the spoils they displayed, and on the other side <a href=/people/4586 target=_blank>Lollia</a>, a single little lady reclining at the Emperor's side — and would he not think it better that they should have been dragged from their chariots than have won their victories with this result? Nor are these the topmost instances of luxury. There have been two pearls that were the largest in the whole of history; both were owned by <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, the last of the Queens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> — they had come down to her through the hands of the Kings of the East. When <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was gorging daily at recherche banquets, she with a pride at once lofty and insolent, queenly wanton as she was, poured contempt on all his pomp and splendour, and when he asked what additional magnificence could be contrived, replied that she would spend 10,000,000 sesterces on a single banquet. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was eager to learn how it could be done, although he thought it was impossible. Consequently bets were made, and on the next day, when the matter was to be decided, she set before <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> a banquet that was indeed splendid, so that the day might not be wasted, but of the kind served every day — <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> laughing and expostulating at its niggardliness. But she vowed it was a mere additional douceur, and that the banquet would round off the account and her own dinner alone would cost 10,000,000 sesterces, and she ordered the second course to be served. In accordance with previous instructions the servants placed in front of her only a single vessel containing vinegar, the strong rough quality of which can melt pearls. She was at the moment wearing in her ears that remarkable and truly unique work of nature. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was full of curiosity to see what in the world she was going to do. She took one earring off and dropped the pearl in the vinegar, and when it was melted swallowed it. Lucius <a href=/people/505 target=_blank>Plancus</a>, who was umpiring the wager, placed his hand on the other pearl when she was preparing to destroy it also in a similar way, and declared that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> had lost the battle — an ominous remark that came true. With this goes the story that, when that queen who had won on this important issue was captured, the second of this pair of pearls was cut in two pieces, so that half a helping of the jewel might be in each of the ears of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SPan class=place long=12.4767 lat=41.8986>Pantheon</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. </p>                        </div>

For this reason we will pursue the subject of manufactures as well, so that just as the principle of foodstuffs is learnt in food, so everybody who takes pleasure in the class of things in question may be well-informed on the subject of that which is the prize of their mode of life. Shellfish supplying purple dyes and scarlets — the material of these is the same but it is differently blended — are of two kinds: the whelk is a smaller shell resembling the one that gives out the sound of a trumpet, whence the reason of its name, by means of the round mouth incised in its edge; the other is called the purple, with a channelled beak jutting out and the side of the channel tube-shaped inwards, through which the tongue can shoot out; moreover it is prickly all round, with about seven spikes forming a ring, which are not found in the whelk, though both shells have as many rings as they are years old.

A better kind is the reef-purple, collected on the reefs of the sea, though this also is lighter and softer as well. The pebble-purple is named after a pebble in the sea, and is remarkably suitable for purple dyes; and far the best for these is the melting-purple, that is, one fed on a varying kind of mud. Purples are taken in a sort of little lobster-pot of fine ply thrown into deep water. These contain bait, cockles that close with a snap, as we observe that mussels do. These when half-killed but put back into the sea gape greedily as they revive and attract the purples, which go for them with outstretched tongues. But the cockles when pricked by their spike shut up and nip the creatures nibbling them. So the purples hang suspended because of their greed and are lifted out of the water. </p>                        </div>

But this fact is not known to the dyers' factories, although it is of primary importance. Subsequently the vein of which we spoke is removed, and to this salt has to be added, about a pint for every hundred pounds; three days is the proper time for it to be steeped (as the fresher the salt the stronger it is), and it should be heated in a leaden pot, and with 50 lbs. of dye to every six gallons of water kept at a uniform and moderate temperature by a pipe brought from a furnace some way off. This will cause it gradually to deposit the portions of flesh which are bound to have adhered to the veins, and after about nine days the cauldron is strained and a fleece that has been washed clean is dipped for a trial, and the liquid is heated up until fair confidence is achieved. A ruddy colour is inferior to a blackish one. The fleece is allowed to soak for five hours and after it has been carded is clipped again, until it soaks up all the juice. The whelk by itself is not approved of, as it does not make a fast dye; it is blended in a moderate degree with sea-purple and it gives to its excessively dark hue that hard and brilliant scarlet which is in demand; when their forces are thus mingled, the one is enlivened, or deadened as the case may be, by the other. The total amount of dye-stuffs required for 1,000 lbs. of fleece is 200 lbs. of whelk and 111 lbs. of sea-purple; so is produced that remarkable amethyst colour.

They all grow on rocks, and feed on shells, fish and mud. These creatures manifestly possess intelligence, because when they are aware of a sponge-gatherer they contract and make it much more difficult to detach them.

Very large but very soft thin sponges grow round <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=place long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycia</a>, though those in deep and calm water are softer; the rough kind grows in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Dardanelles</a>, and the close-textured round Cape <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364232LMal class=place long=23.198 lat=36.436>Malea</a>. Sponges decay in sunny places, and consequently the best are found in deep pools. Live sponges have the same blackish colour as sponges in use have when wet. They do not cling to the rock with a particular part nor with their entire surface, for they have certain empty tubes, about four or five in number, running through them, through which it is believed that they take their food. They also have other tubes, but these are closed at the upper end; and it is understood that there is a sort of thin skin on the under side of their roots. It is established that they live a long time.

Divers have fierce fights with the Dogfish; these attack their loins and heels and all the white parts of the body. The one safety lies in going for them and frightening them by taking the offensive; for a Dogfish is as much afraid of a man as a man is of it, and so they are on equal terms in deep water. When they come to the surface, then the man is in critical danger, as the policy of taking the offensive is not available while he is trying to get out of the water, and his only safety Is in his comrades. These haul on the rope tied to his shoulders; this, as he carries on the duel, he shakes with his left hand to give a signal of danger, while his right hand grasps his dagger and is occupied in fighting. Most of the time they haul gently, but when he gets near the boat, unless with a quick heave they suddenly snatch him out of the water, they have to look on while he is made away with. And often when divers have already begun to be hauled up they are snatched out of their comrades' hands, unless they have themselves supplemented the aid of those hauling by curling up into a ball. Others of the crew of course thrust out harpoons, but the vast beast is crafty enough to go under the vessel and so carry on the battle in safety. Consequently divers devote their whole attention to keeping a watch against this disaster; the most reliable token of safety is to have seen some flatfish, which are never found where these noxious creatures are — on account of which divers call them the holy fish. </p>                        </div>

And strange to say, after six months of life they melt invisibly back into mud, and again in the waters of springtime are reborn what they were before, equally owing to some hidden principle of nature, as it occurs every year. Also mussels and scallops are produced by spontaneous generation in sandy waters; fish with harder shells, like the two varieties of purple-fish, are generated by a sticky juice like saliva, as gnats are by moisture turning sour; the anchovy by sea-foam growing warm when rain gets into it; but fish protected by a flinty covering, like oysters, are generated by rotting mud, or by the foam round ships that stay moored for some time, and especially round stakes fixed in the ground, and timber. It has recently been discovered in oyster-beds that a fertilizing moisture flows out of these fish like milk. Eels rub against rocks and the scrapings come to life; this is their only way of breeding.

(2) In the neighbourhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=place long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heraclea</a> and <a href=/people/3570 target=_blank>Cromna</a> and in many parts of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Black Sea</a> there is one kind that frequents the water at the edge of rivers and makes itself caverns in the ground and lives in these, and also in the shore of tidal rivers when left dry by the tide; and consequently they are only dug up when the movement of their bodies shows that they are alive. (3) In the same neighbourhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=place long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heraclea</a> at the outflow of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408365WLyk class=place long=36.517 lat=40.7519>Lycus</a> fishes are born from eggs left in the mud that seek their fodder by flapping with their little gills, and this makes them not need moisture, which is the reason why eels also live comparatively long when taken out of the water, while eggs mature in a dry place, for instance tortoise's eggs. (4) In the same region of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Black Sea</a> the fish most frequently caught in the ice is the goby, which is only made to reveal the movement of life by the heat of the saucepan. These accounts indeed, however marvellous, do nevertheless embody a certain principle. The same authority reports that in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap class=place long=30 lat=41>Paphlagonia</a> earth-fish extremely acceptable for food are dug out of deep trenches in places where there is no overflow from streams; and after himself expressing surprise at their being propagated without coupling, he gives the view that at all events they have a supply of moisture in them similar to that in wells — but as if fish were found in any wells! Whatever the fact is as to this, it certainly makes the life of moles, an underground animal, less remarkable, unless perhaps these fishes also possess the nature of earth-worms. </p>                        </div>

We have mentioned the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362304IChe class=place long=30.4072 lat=36.1771>Swallow Islands</a>, situated off a promontory of Mt. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a> in the rocky sea of Asia; this fish is frequent there, and is quickly caught, in one variety. A fisherman sails out a certain distance in a small boat, wearing clothes that match the boat in colour, and at the same time for several days running, and throws out bait; but if any alteration whatever be made, the prey suspects a trick and avoids the thing that has frightened it. When this has been done a number of times, at last one anthias is tempted by familiarity to try to get the bait. This one is marked down with careful attention as a foundation for hope and as a decoy for a catch; and it is not difficult to mark it, as for several days only this one ventures to come close. At last it finds others as well, and gradually enlarging its company finally brings shoals too big to count, as by this time all the oldest fish have got used to recognizing the fisherman and snatching the bait out of his hand. Then he throws a hook fixed in the bait a little beyond his fingers, and catches or rather rushes them one by one, snatching them with a short jerk away from the shadow of the boat so that the others may not notice it, while another man in the boat receives the catch in some rags so that no flapping or noise may drive away the others. It pays to know the decoy fish for this purpose, so that he may not be caught, as thenceforward the shoal will swim away. There is a story that a disaffected partner in a fishery lay in wait for the leader fish, which was very well known, and caught it, with malicious intent; <a href=/people/1246 target=_blank>Mucianus</a> adds that it was recognized in the market by the partner who was being victimized, and that proceedings for damage were instituted and a verdict given for the prosecution with damages as assessed. Moreover it is said that when these fishes see one of their number hooked they cut the line with the saw — like prickles that they have on their back, while the one held by the line draws it taut so as to enable it to be severed. With the satgus kind however the captive itself rubs the line against the rocks. </p>                        </div>

Violent animosity rages between the mullet and the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>-fish, and between the conger and the lamprey, which gnaw each other's tails. The langouste is so terrified of the polyp that it dies if it merely sees one near to it, and so does the conger if it sees a langouste; while on the other hand congers tear a polyp to pieces. <a href=/people/734 target=_blank>Nigidius</a> states that the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>-fish gnaws at the tail of the mullet, although they are friendly together in certain months, but that all the mullets with their tails amputated in this way continue to live. But on the other hand instances of friendship, in addition to the creatures whose alliance we have mentioned, are the whale and the sea-<a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mouse</a>: because the whale's eyes are overburdened with the excessively heavy weight of its brows the sea-<a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mouse</a> swims in front of it and points out the shallows dangerous to its bulky size, so acting as a substitute for eyes.

It has talons resembling a stag's hooves, which it uses as weapons; they are cloven in two, and are useful for grasping stones which when in flight it flings with its feet against its pursuers. Its capacity for digesting the objects that it swallows down indiscriminately is remarkable, but not less so is its stupidity in thinking that it is concealed when it has hidden its neck among bushes, in spite of the great height of the rest of its body. The eggs of the ostrich are extremely remarkable for their size; some people use them as vessels, and the feathers for adorning the crests and helmets of warriors. </p>                        </div>

Of <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> there are six kinds. The one called by the Greeks the black <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>, and also the hare-<a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> is smallest in size and of outstanding strength; it is of a blackish colour. It is the only <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> that rears its own young, whereas all the others, as we shall describe, drive them away; and it is the only one that has no scream or cry. Its haunt is in the mountains. To the second kind belongs the white-rump <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> found in towns and in level country; it has a whitish tail. To the third the morphnos, which <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> also calls the dusky <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>, and some the plangos and also the duck-<a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>; it is second in size and strength, and it lives in the neighbourhood of lakes. <a href=/people/2648 target=_blank>Phemonoe</a>, who was styled Daughter of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, has stated that it possesses teeth, but that it is mute and voiceless; also that it is the darkest of the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> in colour, and has an exceptionally prominent tail. <a href=/people/1395 target=_blank>Boethus</a> also agrees. It has a clever device for breaking tortoiseshells that it has carried off, by dropping them from a height; this accident caused the death of the poet <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a>, who was trying to avoid a disaster of this nature that had been foretold by the fates, as the story goes, by trustfully relying on the open sky. Next, the fourth class comprises the hawk-<a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>, also called the mountain stork, which resembles a vulture in having very small wings but exceeds it in the size of its other parts, and yet is unwarlike and degenerate, as it allows a <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a> to flog it. It is always ravenously greedy, and keeps up a plaintive screaming. It is the only <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> that carries away the dead bodies of its prey; all the others after killing alight on the spot. This species causes the fifth kind to be called the' true <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>,' as being the genuine kind and the only pure-bred one; it is of medium size and dull reddish colour, and it is rarely seen. There remains the osprey, which has very keen eyesight, and which hovers at a great height and when it sees a fish in the sea drops on it with a swoop and cleaving the water with its breast catches it. The species that we made the third hunts round marshes for water-birds, which at once dive, till they become drowsy and exhausted, when it catches them. The duel is worth watching, the bird making for refuge on the shore, especially if there is a dense reed-bed, and the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> driving it away from the shore with a blow of its wing; and when it is hunting its quarry in a lake, soaring and showing its shadow to the bird swimming under water away from the shore, so that the bird turns back again and comes to the surface at a place where it thinks it is least expected. This is the reason why birds swim in flocks, because several are not attacked at the same time, since they blind the enemy by splashing him with their wings. Often even the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> themselves cannot carry the weight of their catch and are drowned with it. The sea-<a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> only compels its still unfledged chicks by beating them to gaze full at the rays of the sun, and if it notices one blinking and with its eyes watering flings it out of the nest as a bastard and not true to stock, whereas one whose gaze stands firm against the light it rears. Sea-<a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> have no breed of their own but are born from crossbreeding with other <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a>; but the offspring of a pair of sea-<a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> belongs to the osprey genus, from which spring the smaller vultures, and from these the great vultures which do not breed at all. Some people add a species of <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> which they call the bearded <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>, but which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscans</a> call an ossifrage. </p>                        </div>

The stone in question is big with another inside it, which rattles as if in a jar when you shake it. But only those taken from a nest possess the medicinal power referred to. They build their nests in rocks and trees, and lay as many as three eggs at a time, but they shut out two chicks of the brood, and have been seen on occasion to eject even three. They drive out the other chick when they are tired of feeding it: indeed at this period nature has denied food to the parent birds themselves as a precaution, so that the young of all the wild animals should not be plundered; also during those days the birds' talons turn inward, and their feathers grow white from want of food, so that with good reason they hate their own offspring. But the chicks thrown out by these birds are received by the kindred breed, the bearded <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a>, who rear them with their own. However the parent bird pursues them even when grown up, and drives them far away, doubtless because they are competitors in the chase. And apart from this a single pair of <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> in order to get enough food requires a large tract of country to hunt over; consequently they mark out districts, and do not poach on their neighbours' preserves. When they have made a catch they do not carry it off at once, but first lay it on the ground, and only fly away with it after first testing its weight. They meet their end not from old age nor sickness but from hunger, as their upper mandible grows to such a size that it is too hooked for them to be able to open it. They get busy and fly in the afternoon, but in the earlier hours of the day they perch quite idle till the market-places fill with a gathering of people. If <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a>' feathers have the feathers of any other birds mixed with them, they swallow them up. It is stated that this is the only bird that is never killed by a thunderbolt; this, is why custom has deemed the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> to be <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>'s armour-bearer. </p>                        </div>

But the cuckoo is alone among the hawks in not having crooked talons, and also it is not like the other hawks in the head or in anything else but colour: it rather has the general appearance of the pigeon. Moreover a hawk will eat a cuckoo, if ever both have appeared at the same time: the cuckoo is the only one of all the birds that is killed by its own kind. And it also changes its voice. It comes out in the spring and goes into lung at the rising of the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-star, between which dates it lays its eggs in the nests of other birds, usually wood-pigeons, for the most part one egg at a time, as does no other bird; it seldom lays two. Its reason for foisting its chicks on other birds is supposed to be that it knows itself to be hated by the whole of the birds, for even the very small birds attack it; consequently it thinks that a progeny will not be secured for its race unless it has escaped notice, for which reason it makes no nest; it is a timid creature in general. Therefore the brooding hen in the nest thus cuckolded rears the changeling. The young cuckoo being by nature greedy snatches the bits of food away from the rest of the chicks, and so gets fat and attracts the mother bird to itself by its sleek appearance. She delights in its beauty and admires herself for having borne such a child, while in comparison with it she convicts her own chicks of not belonging to her, and lets them be eaten up even under her own eyes, until finally the cuckoo, now able to fly, seizes the mother bird herself as well. At this stage no sort of bird will compare with a young cuckoo for savoury flavour. </p>                        </div>

When praised it spreads out its jewelled colours directly facing the sun, because in that way they gleam more brilliantly; and at the same time by curving its tail like a shell it contrives as it were reflexions of shadow for the rest of its colours, which actually shine more brightly in the dark, and it draws together into a cluster all the eyes of its feathers, as it delights in having them looked at. Moreover when it moults its tail feathers every year with the fall of the leaves, it seeks in shame and sorrow for a place of concealment until others are born again with the spring flowers. It lives for 25 years, but it begins to shed its colours at the age of three. The authorities relate that this creature is not only ostentatious but also spiteful, just as the goose is said to be modest — since some writers have added these characteristics also in that species, though I do not accept them. </p>                        </div>

Their route follows definite resting places. They do not fly in a south wind, doubtless because it is damp and rather heavy, yet they desire to be carded by the breeze, because of the weight of their bodies and their small strength (this is the reason for that mournful cry they give while flying, which is wrung from them by fatigue); consequently they fly mostly in a north wind, a landrail leading the way. The first quail approaching land is seized by a hawk; from the place where this happens they always return and try to get an escort, and the tongue-bird, eared-<a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a> and ortolan are persuaded to make the journey with them. The tongue-bird takes its name from the very long tongue that it puts out of its beak. At the start the charm of travelling lures this bird to sail on eagerly, but in the course of the flight repentance comes to it, no doubt with the fatigue; but it does not like to return unaccompanied, and it goes on following, though never for more than one day — at the next resting place it deserts. But day after day the company find another one, left behind in a similar manner the year before. The ortolan is more persevering, and hurries on actually to complete the journey to the lands which they are seeking; consequently it rouses up the birds in the night and reminds them of their journey. The eared <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a> is smaller than the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>-<a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a> and larger than night-<a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owls</a>; it has projecting feathery ears, whence its name — some give it the Latin name 'axio'; moreover it is a bird that copies other kinds and is a hanger-on, and it performs a kind of dance. Like the night-<a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a> it is caught without difficulty if one goes round it while its attention is fixed on somebody else. If a wind blowing against them begins to hold up a flight of these birds, they pick up little stones as ballast or fill their throat with sand to steady their flight. Quails are very fond of eating poison seed, on account of which our tables have condemned them; and moreover it is customary to spit at the sight of them as a charm against epilepsy, to which they arc the only living creatures that are liable besides man. </p>                        </div>

In the first place there is so loud a voice and so persistent a supply of breath in such a tiny little body; then there is the consummate knowledge of music in a single bird: the sound is given out with modulations, and now is drawn out into a long note with one continuous breath, now varied by managing the breath, now made staccato by checking it, or linked together by prolonging it, or carried on by holding it back; or it is suddenly lowered, and at times sinks into a mere murmur, loud, low, a bass, treble, with trills, with long notes, modulated when this seems good — soprano, mezzo, baritone; and briefly all the devices in that tiny throat which human science has devised with all the elaborate mechanism of the flute, so that there can be no doubt that this sweetness was foretold by a convincing omen when it made music on the lips of the infant <a href=/people/695 target=_blank>Stesichorus</a>. And that no one may doubt its being a matter of science, the birds have several songs each, and not all the same but every bird songs of its own. They compete with one another, and there is clearly an animated rivalry between them; the loser often ends her life by dying, her breath giving out before her song. Other younger birds practise their music, and are given verses to imitate; the pupil listens with close attention and repeats the phrase, and the two keep silence by turns: we notice improvement in the one under instruction and a sort of criticism on the part of the instructress. Consequently they fetch the prices that are given for slaves, and indeed larger prices than were paid for armour-bearers in old days. I know of one bird, a white one it is true, which is nearly unprecedented, that was sold for 600,000 sesterces to be given as a present to the emperor <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>'s consort <a href=/people/720 target=_blank>Agrippina</a>. Frequent cases have been seen before now of nightingales that have begun to sing when ordered, and have sung in answer to an organ, as there have been found persons who could reproduce the birds' song with an indistinguishable resemblance by putting water into slanting reeds and breathing into the holes or by applying some slight check with the tongue. But these exceptional and artistic trills after a fortnight gradually cease, though not in such a way that the birds could be said to be tired out or to have had enough of singing; and later on when the heat has increased their note becomes entirely different, with no modulations or variations. Their colour also changes, and finally in winter the bird itself is not seen. Their tongues do not end in a point like those of all other birds. They lay in early spring, six eggs at most. </p>                        </div>

Swallows build with clay and strengthen the nest with straw; if ever there is a lack of clay, they wet their wings with a quantity of water and sprinkle it on the dust. The nest itself, however, they carpet with soft feathers and tufts of wool, to warm the eggs and also to prevent it from being hard for the infant chicks. They dole out food in turns among their offspring with extreme fairness. They remove the chicks' droppings with remarkable cleanliness, and teach the older ones to turn round and relieve themselves outside of the nest. There is another kind of swallow that frequents the country and the fields, which seldom nests on houses, and which makes its nest of a different shape though of the same material — entirely turned upward, with orifices projecting to a narrow opening and a capacious interior, and adapted with remarkable skill both to conceal the chicks and to give them a soft bed to lie on. In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, at the Heracleotic Mouth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, they block the outflow of the river with an irremovable mole of contiguous nests almost two hundred yards long, a thing that could not be achieved by human labour.

There is a third kind of swallows a that make holes in banks and so construct their nests in the ground. (Their chicks when burnt to ashes are a medicine for a deadly throat malady and many other diseases of the human body.) These birds do not build proper nests, and if a rise of the river threatens to reach their holes, they migrate many days in advance. </p>                        </div>

The bird called the thistle-finch weaves its nest out of flax in the same shape. One of the woodpeckers hangs by a twig at the very end of the boughs, like a ladle on a peg, so that no four-footed animal can get to it. It is indeed asserted that the witwal purposely takes its sleep while hanging suspended by the feet, because it hopes thus to be safer. Again, it is a common practice of them all carefully to choose a flooring of branches to support their nest, and to vault it over against the rain or roof it with a penthouse of thick foliage. In Arabiad a bird called cinnamolgus makes a nest of cinnamon twigs; the natives bring these birds down with arrows weighted with lead, to use them for trade. In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a> a bird of the size of a bustard lays two eggs at a time in a hare-skin, which is always hung on the top boughs of trees. When magpies notice a person observing their nest with special attention, they transfer the eggs somewhere else. It is reported that in the case of these birds, as their claws are not adapted for grasping and carrying the eggs, this is effected in a remarkable manner: they place a sprig on the top of two eggs at a time, and solder it with glue from their belly, and placing their neck under the middle of it so as to make it balance equally on both sides, carry it off somewhere else. </p>                        </div>

The name of <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>-eater is given to a bird that feeds its parents in their lair; its wings are a pale colour inside and dark-blue above, reddish at the tip. It makes its nest in a hole dug in the ground to a depth often feet. Partridges fortify their retreat with thorn and bush in such a way as to be completely entrenched against wild animals; they heap a soft covering of dust on their eggs. and they do not sit on them at the place where they laid them but remove them somewhere else, lest their frequently resorting there should cause somebody to suspect it. Hen partridges in fact deceive even their own mates, because these in the intemperance of their lust break the hens' eggs so that they may not be kept away by sitting on them; and then the cocks owing to their desire for the hens fight duels with each other; it is said that the one who loses has to accept the advances of the victor. <a href=/people/2553 target=_blank>Trogus</a> indeed says this also occurs occasionally with quails and farmyard cocks, but that wild partridges are promiscuously covered by tame ones, and also new-corners or cocks that have been beaten in a fight. They are also captured owing to the fighting instinct caused by the same lust, as the leader of the whole flock sallies out to battle against the fowler's decoy, and when he has been caught number two advances, and so on one after another in succession. Again about breeding time the hens are caught when they sally out against the fowlers' hen to hustle and drive her away. And in no other creature is concupiscence so active. If the hens stand facing the cocks they become pregnant by the afflatus that passes out from them, while if they open their beaks and put out their tongue at that time they are sexually excited. Even the draught of air from cocks flying over them, and often merely the sound of a cock crowing, makes them conceive. And even their affection for their brood is so conquered by desire that when a hen is quietly sitting on her eggs in hiding, if she becomes aware of a fowler's decoy hen approaching her cock she chirps him back to her and recalls him and voluntarily offers herself to his desire. Indeed they are subject to such madness that often with a blind swoop they perch on the fowler's head. If he starts to go towards a nest, the mother bird runs forward to his feet, pretending to be tired or lame, and in the middle of a run or a short flight suddenly falls as if with a broken wing or damaged feet, and then runs forward again, continually escaping him just as he is going to catch her and cheating his hope, until she leads him away in a different direction from the nests. On the other hand if the hen thus scared is free and not possessed with motherly anxiety she lies on her back in a furrow and catches hold of a clod of earth with her claws and covers herself with it. The life of partridges is believed to extend to as much as sixteen years. </p>                        </div>

These possess the greatest modesty, and adultery is unknown to either sex; they do not violate the faith of wedlock, and they keep house in company — unless unmated or widowed a pigeon does not leave its nest. Also they say that the cock pigeon is domineering, and occasionally even unkind, as he is suspicious of adultery although not himself prone to it; in this state his throat is full of complaining and his beak deals savage pecks, and upon his satisfaction there follows billing and fawning with repeated twirlings of his feet during his entreaties for indulgence. Both partners have equal affection for their offspring; this also often gives occasion for chastisement, when the hen is too slack in coming home to the chicks. When she is producing a brood she receives comfort and attendance from the cock. For the chicks at first they collect saltish earth in their throat and disgorge it into their beaks, to get them into proper condition for food.

The cooing of all is alike and the same, composed of a phrase repeated three times and then a sigh at the close; in winter they are silent, but begin singing in spring. <a href=/people/734 target=_blank>Nigidius</a> thinks that a woodpigeon when sitting on her eggs under a roof will leave her nest in answer to her name. They lay after midsummer. Pigeons and turtledoves live eight years. On the other hand the sparrow, their equal in salaciousness, has a very small span of life: the cocks are said not to last longer than a year, the proof being that at the beginning of spring no black colouring is seen on their beak, which begins with summer; but the hens have a rather longer span of life. However pigeons actually possess a certain sense of vanity — you would fancy them to be conscious of their own colours and the pattern of their marking; indeed this can be inferred from their flight — it is observed that they flap their wings in the sky and trace a variety of lines. During this display they expose themselves to the hawk as if fettered, folding their wings with a flapping noise that is only produced from the actual wing joints, though otherwise when flying freely they are much swifter. The highwayman hawk watches concealed in foliage, and seizes the exultant pigeon in the very act of showing off. For that reason the bird called kestrel must be classed with these; for it defends the pigeons, and scares the hawks by its natural powerfulness so much that they fly from sight and sound of it. For this reason woodpigeons have a special love for kestrels, and they say that if kestrels put in new jars with their mouths sealed up are hidden in the four corners of the dovecot the pigeons do not change their abode (a result that some people have also sought to obtain by cutting the joints of their wings with gold, the only way of making a wound that does no harm), although otherwise the pigeon is a bird much given to straying. For they have a trick of exchanging blandishments and enticing other pigeons and coming back with a larger company won by intrigue. </p>                        </div>

All the rest of the animals have one definite and uniform mode of progression peculiar to their particular kind, but birds alone travel in a variety of ways both on land and in the air. Some walk, as <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crows</a>; others hop, as sparrows and blackbirds; run, as partridges and black grouse; throw out their feet in front of them, as storks and cranes.

Some you would think to be flung forward, or again in some cases to fall from a height and in other cases to leap upward. Only ducks and birds of the same kind soar up straight away, and move skyward from the start, and this even from water; and consequently they alone when they have fallen into the pits that we use for trapping wild animals get out again. Vultures and the heavier birds in general cannot fly upward except after a run forward or when launching from a higher eminence; they steer with their tail. Some birds turn their gaze round, others bend their necks; and some eat things they have snatched with their feet. Many do not fly without a cry, others on the contrary are always silent when in flight. They move upward, downward, slanting, sideways, straight forward, and some even with the head bent backward; consequently if several kinds are seen at the same time, they might be thought not to be travelling in the same element. </p>                        </div>

These birds get fond of uttering particular words, and not only learn them but love them, and secretly ponder them with careful reflexion, not concealing their engrossment. It is an established fact that if the difficulty of a word beats them this causes their death, and that their memory fails them unless they hear the same word repeatedly, and when they are at a loss for a word they cheer up wonderfully if in the meantime they hear it spoken. Their shape is unusual, though not beautiful: this bird has enough distinction in its power of imitating the human voice. But they say that none of them can go on learning except ones of the species that feeds on acorns, and among these those with five claws on the feet learn more easily, and not even they themselves except in the two first years of their life. All the birds in each kind that imitate human speech have exceptionally broad tongues, although this occurs in almost all species; <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius Caesar</a>'s consort <a href=/people/720 target=_blank>Agrippina</a> had a thrush that mimicked what people said, which was unprecedented. At the time when I was recording these cases, the young princes a had a starling and also nightingales that were actually trained to talk Greek and Latin, and moreover practised diligently and spoke new phrases every day, in still longer sentences. Birds are taught to talk in private and where no other utterance can interrupt, with the trainer sitting by them to keep on repeating the words he wants retained, and coaxing them with morsels of food. </p>                        </div>

This bird the tenant of the next cobbler's shop killed, whether because of his neighbour's competition or in a sudden outburst of anger, as he tried to make out, because some dirt had fallen on his stock of shoes from its droppings; this caused such a disturbance among the public that the man was first driven, out of the district and later actually made away with, and the bird's funeral was celebrated with a vast crowd of followers, the draped bier being carried on the shoulders of two <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a> and in front of it going in procession a flute-player and all kinds of wreaths right to the pyre, which had been erected on the right hand side of the <a href=/people/1420 target=_blank>Appian</a> Road at the second milestone on the ground called Rediculus's Plain.

Also there was recently a report of one <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a> surnamed Monoceros in the district of <a href=/people/9355 target=_blank>Eriza</a> in Asia hunting with the aid of ravens, to such an extent that he used to carry them down into the forests perched on the crest's of his helmet and on his shoulders; the birds used to track out and drive the game, the practice being carried to such a point that even wild ravens followed him in this way when he left the forest. Certain persons have thought it worth recording that a raven was seen during a drought dropping stones into a monumental urn in which some rain water still remained but so that the bird was unable to reach it; in this way as it was afraid to go down into the urn, the bird by piling up stones in the manner described raised the water high enough to supply itself with a drink. </p>                        </div>

I find this first singled out in the old interdicts dealing with feasts as early as the law of the consul Gaius <a href=/people/1133 target=_blank>Fannius</a> eleven years before the Third Punic War, prohibiting the serving of any bird course beside a single hen that had not been fattened — a provision that was subsequently renewed and went on through all our sumptuary legislation. And a way round so as to evade them was discovered, that of feeding male chickens also with foodstuffs soaked in milk, a method that makes them esteemed as much more acceptable. As for hens, they are not all chosen for fattening, and not unless they have fat skin on the neck. Subsequently came elaborate methods of dressing fowls, so as to display the haunches, so as to split them along the back, so as to make them fill the dishes by spreading them out from one foot. Even the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> bestowed their fashions on our cooks.

Of these kinds the young hens lay more eggs than the old, but smaller ones, and in the same brood those laid first and last are the smallest. But they are so fertile that some even lay eggs sixty times, some lay daily, some twice daily, some so much that they die of exhaustion. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450121UAdr class=place long=12.0554 lat=45.049>Adria</a> birds are most highly spoken of. Pigeons lay ten times a year, some even eleven times, while in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> they even lay in a midwinter month. Swallows and blackbirds and woodpigeons and turtledoves lay twice a year, all other birds as a rule only once. Thrushes build their nests of mud in an almost continuous mass on the tops of trees, and breed in retirement. The eggs grow to full size in the uterus in ten days from pairing, but in the case of the domestic fowl and the pigeon, if the hen is disturbed by having a feather torn out or by some similar damage, it takes longer. In all eggs the middle of the yolk contains a small drop of a sort of blood, which people think is the heart of birds, supposing that the heart is the first part that is produced in every body: in an egg undoubtedly this drop beats and throbs. The animal itself is formed out of the white of the egg, but its food is in the yolk. In all cases at the beginning the head is larger than the whole body, and the eyes, which are pressed together, are larger than the head. As the chick grows in size the white turns to the middle and the yolk spreads round it. If on the twentieth day the egg be moved, the voice of the chick already alive is heard inside the shell. At the same time it begins to grow feathers, its posture being such that it has its head above its right foot but its right wing above its head. The yolk gradually disappears. All birds are born feet first, the opposite way to the remaining animals. Some domestic hens lay all their eggs in pairs, and according to <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/3007 target=_blank>Celsus</a> occasionally hatch twin chicks, one larger than the other; though some assert that twin chicks are never hatched out. They lay down a rule that the hen should not be required to sit on more than 25 eggs at a time. Hens begin to lay at midwinter, and breed best before the spring equinox: chickens born after midsummer do not attain the proper size, and the later they are hatched the more they fall short of it. </p>                        </div>

An odd number should be put under the hen. If three days after they began to be sat on the top of the eggs held in the tips of the fingers against the light shows a transparent colour of a single hue, the eggs are judged to be barren, and others should be substituted for them. They may also be tested in water: an empty egg floats, and consequently people prefer eggs that sink, that is, are full, to put under the hens. But they warn against their being tested by shaking, on the ground that if the vital veins are displaced the eggs are sterile. The ninth's day after a new moon is assigned for starting a hen's sitting, as eggs begun earlier do not hatch out. The chicks are hatched more quickly when the days are warm, and consequently eggs will hatch out in 18 days in summer but 24 in winter. If it thunders while the hen is sitting the eggs die, and if she hears the cry of a hawk they go bad. A remedy against thunder is an iron nail placed under the straw in which the eggs lie, or some earth from the plough.

It was perhaps from this that the method was lately invented of placing eggs in chaff in a warm place and cherishing them with a moderate fire, with somebody to keep turning them over, with the result that all the live brood breaks the shell at once on a fixed day. It is recorded that a certain poultry-keeper had a scientific method of telling which egg was from which hen. It is related also that when a hen has died the cocks of the farmyard have been seen taking on her duties in turn and generally behaving in the manner of a broody hen, and abstaining from crowing.

The hen woodpigeon sits from noon till the next morning and the cock the rest of the time. Pigeons always lay a male and a female egg, the male first and the female a day later. In this species both birds sit, the cock in the daytime and the hen at night. They hatch in about three weeks, and they lay four days after mating.

Rabbits breed in every month of the year, and superfetate, as do hares; after giving birth they pair again at once. They conceive although still suckling their previous litter, but the young are blind. Elephants, as we have said, bear one young one at a time, of the size of a three months old calf. <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>Camels</a> carry their young twelve months; they begin breeding at the age of three, in the spring, and mate again a year after giving birth. Mares on the other hand are believed not to be profitably sired till three years old, and not before a year after their last foaling; when they are unwilling, compulsion is used. It is believed that she-<a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> conceive quite easily even a week after delivery. It is said that mares' manes ought to be clipped to make them submit to allow coupling with <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a>, as having long manes makes them proud and high-spirited. Mares are the only animals that after coupling run in a northerly or southerly direction according as they have conceived a male or a female foal. Immediately afterwards they change the colour of their coat for a deeper red or a darker hue of whatever their colour is: this marks their ceasing to be able to couple, even if willing to do so. Some are not hindered from work by foaling, and are in foal without its being known. We find it on record that a mare in foal belonging to a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> named <a href=/people/3823 target=_blank>Echecratides</a> won a race at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>.

This madness can be reduced by sprinkling the organs with vinegar. It is believed that desire for mating is also stimulated by articles of diet, for instance rocket in the case of a man and onions in the case of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>. It is a remarkable fact that wild species when domesticated refuse to breed, for instance wild geese, and wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> and stags do so reluctantly and only if they have been reared from infancy.

Here an important topic invites us and one fully supplied with arguments on both sides — whether there are certain cases of foreknowledge present in the mind during repose, and what causes them, or whether it is a matter of chance like most things. If the question be argued by instances, these would doubtless be found to be equal on both sides. It is practically agreed that dreams occurring directly after drinking wine and eating food, and those that come in dozing off to sleep a second time, are false; but sleep is really nothing but the retirement of the mind into its innermost self. It is manifest that, beside human beings, <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>, <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> dream; it is consequently believed that, dreams also occur in all viviparous species. As to the oviparous creatures it is uncertain, but it is certain that they sleep. But let us also pass to insects, for these remain creatures of immeasurably minute structure. </p>                        </div>

These are of great number and of many kinds; they have the habits of land-animals and of flying animals, some lacking wings, for instance centipedes, others winged, for instance <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>, others of both kinds, for instance ants, some lacking both wings and feet; and all are rightly termed insects, from the incisions which encircle them in some cases in the region of their necks and in others of their chests and stomach and separate off their limbs, these being only connected by a thin tube, with some however the crease of the incision not entirely encircling them, but only at the belly or higher up, with flexible vertebrae shaped like gutter-tiles — showing a craftsmanship on the part of Nature that is more remarkable than in any other case: inasmuch as in large bodies or at all events the larger. ones the process of manufacture was facilitated by the yielding nature of the material, whereas in these minute nothings what method, what power, what labyrinthine perfection is displayed! Where did Nature find a place in a flea for all the senses? — and other smaller creatures can be mentioned, — but at what point in its surface did she place sight? where did she attach taste? implant that truculent and relatively very loud voice? with what subtlety she attached the wings, extended the legs that carry the feet, placed a ravenous hollow to serve as a stomach, kindled a greedy thirst for blood and especially human blood! Then with what genius she provided a sharp weapon for piercing the skin, and as if working on a large object, although really it is invisibly minute, created it with alternating skill so as to be at once pointed for digging and tubed for sucking! What teeth she attached to the wood-borer for boring through timber, with the accompanying sound as evidence and made its chief nutriment to consist of wood! But we marvel at elephants' shoulders carrying castles, and <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>' necks and the fierce tossings of their heads, at the rapacity of tigers and the manes of <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a>, whereas really Nature is to be found in her entirety nowhere more than in her smallest creations. I consequently beg my readers not to let their contempt for many of these creatures lead them also to condemn to scorn what I relate about them, since in the contemplation of Nature nothing can possibly be deemed superfluous. </p>                        </div>

This gives rise to a long list of questions. For the same people actually say that these creatures have not got a voice, in spite of all the buzzing of <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> and chirping of tree-crickets, and make other statements the value of which will be judged in their places. For when I have observed Nature she has always induced me to deem no statement about her incredible; nor do I see why such creatures should be more able to live without breathing than to breathe without vital organs, which we have proved to occur even in the case of marine creatures in spite of the fact that their breath is barred by the density and depth of the water. At all events that any creatures fly and yet have no capacity of breathing in spite of their living in the very breath of the air, and that they have consciousness of nutrition, generation and work, and even interest in the future, and that although they have no organs to carry the senses as in a vessel, they nevertheless possess hearing, smell, taste, and those outstanding gifts of nature, intelligence, brain, science, into the bargain — who would easily believe this? I admit that they have not got blood, as even land animals have not all got blood of the same kind; but just as in the sea the black fluid of the cuttlefish takes the place of blood, as also does the famous juice of the genus purple-fish that supplies a dye, similarly also whatever is the life-giving fluid possessed by insects, this will be their blood. Finally let each man form his own opinion, but our purpose is to point out the manifest properties of objects, not to search for doubtful causes. </p>                        </div>

And this is all that they possess, and nothing else in addition; they have no internal organs except, in the case of quite a few, a twisted intestine.

No other kind of creature has a greater number of feet, and of this species the ones that have more feet live longer when torn asunder, as we see in the case of the multipede.

Propolis is obtained from the milder gum of vines and poplars, and is made of a denser substance by the addition of flowers, and though not as yet wax it serves to strengthen the combs; with it all approaches of cold or damage are blocked, and besides it has itself a heavy scent, being in fact used by most people as a substitute for galbanum. </p>                        </div>

In all honey the portion that has flowed by itself like must and olive oil — it is called honey-vinegar — is the most commendable. All summer honey is reddish, as it has been made in a comparatively dry period. White honey is not made where there is thyme, but honey made from thyme is thought most suitable for the eyes and for ulcers — it is of a gold colour and has an extremely agreeable taste. The fat honey from violets and the thick kind from rosemary can be seen to condense, but honey that thickens is least praised. Honey from thyme does not condense, and when touched sends out very thin threads, which is the first proof of goodness; it is considered a mark of poor quality for the drops to break off at once and fall back.

It is collected after the first autumn rains, when only the heath is in flower in the woods, and consequently it resembles sandy honey. It is produced mostly by the rise of <a href=/people/632 target=_blank>Arcturus</a> after September 12. Some people advance the summer honey-making to the rise of <a href=/people/632 target=_blank>Arcturus</a>, since that leaves fourteen days to the autumnal equinox, and in the forty-eight days from the equinox to the setting of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> heath is most plentiful. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> name for it is tetralice, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=demonym long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboean</a> sisyrus, and they believe it to be very acceptable to <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>, perhaps because at that season there is no other supply for them. Consequently this honey-gathering is roughly in the period between the end of vintage and the setting of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> on November 13. Reason advises leaving two-thirds of the honey then procured for the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>, and always the parts of the combs that contain <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>-bread. In the sixty days from midwinter to the rising of <a href=/people/632 target=_blank>Arcturus</a> they live on sleep, without any food; in the warmer period from the rising of <a href=/people/632 target=_blank>Arcturus</a> to the spring equinox they now keep awake, but still keep inside the hive and have recourse to the food kept for this time. But in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> they do the same after the rising of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a>, sleeping till then. Some people in taking out the honey weigh the hives, so separating the amount to be left behind. There is indeed a bond of equity even in the case of <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>, and it is said that if the partnership is defrauded the hives perish. Consequently it is one of the first rules that people must wash themselves clean before they take the honey; also <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> hate scurf, and women's menstruation. When honey is being removed it is very useful for the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> to be driven away by smoke, so that they may not get angry or greedily devour it themselves. Also denser smoke is employed to arouse their sloth to their tasks, for if they have not gone on incubating, the combs they make are discoloured. On the other hand excessive smoke kills them, as honey very quickly undergoes deterioration if turned sour by the least touch of moisture; and for this reason among the kinds of honey there is a special sort called by the Greek word meaning 'smokeless.' </p>                        </div>

A majority of authorities have held the view that the offspring are formed in the mouth, by blending together blossoms of the reed and the olive; some think it is by copulation with a single male which in each swarm is called the king; and that this is the only male, and is of exceptional size, so as not to grow weary; and that consequently offspring is not produced without him, and the rest of the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> accompany him as women accompany a husband, not as their leader. This view, though probable on other grounds, is refuted by the production drones; for what reason can there be why the same act of union should engender some perfect offspring and others imperfect? The former opinion would be nearer to the truth, were it not that again another difficulty meets us: it is a fact that sometimes larger <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> are born in the extremities of the combs which drive away all the rest. This mischievous creature is called a gadfly — being born in what possible manner if the female <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> themselves shape it? One certain fact is that they sit on their eggs in the way that hens do. The offspring hatched at first looks like a white maggot, lying crosswise and sticking so closely to the wax that it seems to be part of it. The king is from the start of the colour of honey, as if made from a special blossom chosen out of the whole supply, and is not a maggot but has wings from the start. The remaining throng when they begin to take shape are called pupae, while the sham ones are called sirens or drones. If anybody takes the heads off specimens of either kind before they have wings, they serve as very acceptable food for their mothers. As time goes on they give them drops of food and sit on them, buzzing more than at any other time, with the object, it is thought, of producing the warmth needed for hatching out the grubs, until they break the membranes that enclose each of them like eggshells and the whole band emerges. This was observed at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the suburban estate of a certain ex-consul, who had hives made of the transparent horn of a lantern. The brood grows up in about six weeks. In some hives what is called a wart is formed, a hard lump of bitter wax, when the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> have not produced offspring out of the comb, owing to disease or sloth or natural infertility; this is the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>' form of abortion. But as soon as they are hatched out they get to work with their mothers under some sort of tuition, and the youthful king is escorted by a retinue of his peers. Several kings are begun to be produced, so that there may not be a lack of them; but afterwards, when the offspring sprung from these has begun to be grown up, by a unanimous vote they kill the worst of them so that they may not divide up the forces. They are of two kinds, the better sort red and the inferior kind black or speckled. All of them are always exceptionally well-formed and twice as large as the others; their wings are shorter, their legs straight, their bearing more lofty, and they have a spot on their brow that shines white in a kind of fillet; they also differ from the common herd a great deal by their brilliant colour. </p>                        </div>

Here on a trifling matter connected with our own country-houses, a thing constantly in evidence, there is no agreement among the authorities — the question whether the king <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a> alone has no sting and is armed only with the grandeur of his office, or whether nature has indeed bestowed one upon him but has merely denied him the use of it. It is a well established fact that the ruler does not use a sting. The commons surround him with a marvellous obedience. When he goes in procession, the whole swarm accompanies him and is massed around him to encircle and protect him, not allowing him to be seen. During the rest of the time, while the people are engaged in labour, he himself goes the circuit of the works inside, with the appearance of urging them on, while he alone is free from duty. He is surrounded by certain retainers and lictors as the constant guardians of his authority. He only issues abroad when the swarm is about to migrate; intelligence of this is given long before, as a buzzing noise has been going on for some days in the hive, a sign of their preparation while they are selecting a suitable day. If anybody should cut off one of his wings, the swarm would not run away. When they have started, each one wants to be next him and delights to be seen on duty; when he is tired they support him with their shoulders, and carry him entirely if he is more completely exhausted. Any <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a> that falls out from weariness or happens to stray from the main body, follows on by scent.

The capture of the leader holds up the whole body, and when they have lost him they separate and migrate to other lords; in any case they are unable to be without a king. But when the kings have become too numerous they reluctantly destroy them, and by preference they destroy their homes while they are being born. If a supply of honey is despaired of, then they even drive away the drones. Nevertheless I see that there is a doubt about these also, and that some persons think them to form a breed of their own, like the robber-<a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>, the largest in size among the drones but black and with a broad belly, which have this designation because they steal and devour the honey.

First however, it is said, small butterflies are produced that are bare of down, and then as they cannot endure the cold they grow shaggy tufts of hair and equip themselves with thick jackets against winter, scraping together the down of leaves with the roughness of their feet; this is compressed by them into fleeces and worked over by carding with their claws, and then drawn out into woof-threads, and thinned out as if with a comb, and afterwards taken hold of and wrapped round their body in a coiled nest.

There are several kinds of <a href=/people/10968 target=_blank>spiders</a>, but they need not be described, as they are so well known. The name of phalangium is given to a kind of <a href=/people/10968 target=_blank>spider</a> that has a harmful bite and a small body of variegated colour and pointed shape, and advances by leaps and bounds. A second species of <a href=/people/10968 target=_blank>spider</a> is black, with very long fore legs. All <a href=/people/10968 target=_blank>spiders</a> have legs with two joints. Of the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>-<a href=/people/10968 target=_blank>spiders</a> the smallest do not weave a web, but the larger ones live in the ground and spin tiny ante-rooms in from of their holes. A third kind of the same species is remarkable for its scientific method of construction; it sets up its warp-threads, and its own womb suffices to supply the material needed for this considerable work, whether because the substance of its intestines is thus resolved at a fixed time, as <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> holds, or because it has inside it some power of producing wool: with such careful use of its claw and such a smooth and even thread it spins the warp, employing itself as a weight. It starts weaving at the centre, twining in the woof in a circular round, and entwists the meshes in an unloosable knot, spreading them out at intervals that are always regular but continually grow less narrow. How skilfully it conceals the snares that lurk in its chequered net! How unintentional appears to be the density of the close warp and the plan of the woof, rendered by a sort of scientific smoothing automatically tenacious! How its bosom bellies to the breezes so as not to reject things that come to it! You might think the threads had been left by a weary weaver stretching in front at the top; but they are difficult to see, and, like the cords in hunting-nets, when the quarry comes against them throw it into the bosom of the net. With what architectural skill is the vaulting of the actual cave designed! and how much more hairy it is made, to give protection against cold! How distant it is from the centre, and how its intention is concealed, although it is really so roofed in that it is impossible to see whether somebody is inside or not! Then its strength — when is it broken by the winds? what quantity of dust weighs it down? When the <a href=/people/10968 target=_blank>spider</a> is practising its art and learning to weave, the breadth of the web often reaches between two trees and the length of the thread stretches down from the top of the tree and there is a quick return right up the thread from the ground, and the <a href=/people/10968 target=_blank>spider</a> goes up and brings down the threads simultaneously. But when a catch falls into the web, how watchfully and alertly it runs to it! although it may be clinging to the edge of the net, it always runs to the middle, because in that way it entangles the prey by shaking the whole. When the web is torn it at once restores it to a finished condition by patching it. And <a href=/people/10968 target=_blank>spiders</a> actually hunt young <a href=/people/10983 target=_blank>frogs</a> and lizards, first wrapping up their mouth with web and then finally gripping both lips with their jaws, giving a show worthy of the amphitheatre when it comes off. Also auguries are obtained from the <a href=/people/10968 target=_blank>spider</a>: for instance, when the rivers are going to rise they raise their webs higher; also they weave their web in fine weather and reweave it in cloudy weather, and consequently a number of <a href=/people/10968 target=_blank>spiders</a>' webs is a sign of rain. People think that it is the female that weaves and the male that hunts, and that thus the married pair do equal shares of service. </p>                        </div>

Of this there are two kinds: the smaller ones that come out first and perish latest — these however are mute; subsequent is the flight of those that sing: they are called Singers, and the smaller ones among them grass-hoppers, but the former are more vocal. The males in either class sing, but the females are silent. These creatures are used as food by the Eastward races, even the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> with their abundant resources; they prefer the males before mating and the females afterwards, being seduced by their eggs, which are white. They couple lying on their backs. They have a very sharp prickliness on the back, with which they hollow a place in the ground for their offspring. This is produced first as a grub, and then from this comes what is called the larva; at the period of the solstices they break the shell of this and fly out, always at night; at first they are black and hard. This is the only living creature actually without a mouth; they have instead a sort of row of prickles resembling tongues, this also being on the breast, with which they lick the dew. The breast itself forms a pipe; the singers use this to sing with, as we shall say. For the rest, there is nothing on the belly. When they are disturbed and fly away, they give out moisture, which is the only proof that they live on dew; moreover they are the only creatures that have no aperture for the bodily excreta. Their eyes are so dim that if anybody comes near to them contracting and straightening out a finger, they pass by as if it were a leaf flickering. Some people make two other classes of tree-crickets, the twig-cricket which is the larger, and the corn-cricket, which others call the oat-cricket, because it appears at the same time as the crops begin to dry. Tree-crickets do not occur where trees are scarce — consequently they are not found at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrenae</a> except in the neighbourhood of the town — nor in plains or in chilly or shady woods.

Another kind of them again is one that rolls up backwards with its feet vast balls of mud and nests its brood of little grubs in these against the rigour of winter. Others flutter about with a loud murmur or a shrill noise, and others giving out a buzz bore numerous holes in hearths and walls in the night. Glow worms shine like fires at night time owing to the colour of their sides and loins, now giving a flash of light by opening their wings and now darkened by closing them; they are not much seen before the crops are ripe or after they have been cut. The cockroaches' life on the contrary is a nurseling of the shadows, and they fly the light, being mostly produced in the damp warmth of bathhouses. The reddish and very large beetles of the same kind dig dry earth and mould combs that resemble a small porous sponge and contain poisoned honey. There is a small place near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403234POly class=place long=23.354 lat=40.2963>Olynthus</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> that is fatal to this animal, and is consequently called Beetle-bane. The wings of all insects have no cleft. None has a tail except the scorpion. This is the only insect that has arms, and also a spike in the tail; some of the rest have a sting, for instance the gadfly (or if you like, 'breeze'), and also the gnat and some flies, but with all of these it is in the mouth and settles as a tongue. With some these stings are blunt, and do not serve for pricking but for suction — for instance with a sort of fly, in which the tongue is evidently a tube; and this sort of insect have no teeth. Others, for instance butterflies, have useless little horns projecting in front of their eyes. Some insects, for instance the centipede, have no wings. </p>                        </div>

The eggs last for the winter, but in the ensuing year at the end of spring send out small insects, that are blackish and have no legs, and crawl with their wing-feathers. Consequently spring rains kill the eggs, whereas in a dry spring there are larger broods. Others record that they have two breeding seasons and two seasons when they die off — bearing at the rise of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> and then dying at the rise of the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a>-star, others being born in their place; some say that this second brood is born at the setting of <a href=/people/632 target=_blank>Arcturus</a>. It is certain that the mothers die when they have given birth to a brood, a maggot immediately forming inside them in the region of the throat that chokes them. The males die at the same time. And although dying for such a trifling reason a single locust when it likes can kill a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> by gripping its throat with its teeth. They are born only in places with chinks in them. There are said to be locusts in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> three feet long, with legs and thighs that when they have been dried can be used as saws. They also have another way of dying: they are carried away in swarms by the wind and fall into the sea or a marsh. This happens purely by accident and not, as was believed by ancient writers, owing to their wings being drenched by the dampness of night. The same people indeed have also stated that they do not fly by night because of the cold — not being aware that they cross even wide seas, actually, which is most surprising, enduring several days' continuous hunger, to remedy which they know how to seek fodder abroad. This plague is interpreted as a sign of the wrath of the gods; for they are seen of exceptional size, and also they fly with such a noise of wings that they are believed to be birds, and they obscure the sun, making the nations gaze upward in anxiety lest they should settle all over their lands. In fact their strength does not fail, and as though it were not enough to have crossed the seas, they pass over immense tracts of land and cover them with a cloud disastrous for the crops, scorching up many things with their touch and gnawing away everything with their bite, even the doors of the houses as well. </p>                        </div>

Man however has the largest brain in proportion to his size and the most moist one, and it is the coldest of all his organs; it is wrapped in two membranes above and below, the fracture of either of which is fatal. For the rest a man's brain is larger than a woman's. With all human beings it has no blood or veins, and in some cases no fat. The learned teach that it is distinct from marrow because boiling makes it hard. In the middle of the brain of all species there are tiny little bones. With man alone the brain throbs in infancy, and does not become firm before the child first begins to talk. The brain is the highest of the organs in position, and it is protected by the vault of the head; it has no flesh or blood or refuse. It is the citadel of sense-perception, and the focus to which all the flow of the veins converges from the heart and at which it stops; it is the crowning pinnacle, the seat of government of the mind. But the brain of all animals slopes forward, because our senses also stretch in front of us. It is the source of sleep and the cause of drowsy nodding; species without a brain do not sleep. </p>                        </div>

The sight of many depends on the brilliance of the sun, and they cannot see clearly on a cloudy day or after sunset; others have dimmer sight in the day time but are exceptionally keen-sighted at night. We have already said enough about double pupils, or persons who have the evil eye. Blue-grey eyes see more clearly in the dark. It is stated that <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius Caesar</a> alone of all mankind was so constituted that if he woke up in the night for a short time he could see everything just as in bright daylight, although darkness gradually closed over him. The late lamented <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> had grey eyes like those of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, the whites being larger than usual in a human being, on account of which he used to be angry if people watched his eyes too closely; <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius Caesar</a>'s eyes were frequently bloodshot and had a fleshy gleam at the corners; the Emperor <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Gaius</a> had staring eyes; <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>'s eyes were dull of sight except when he screwed them up to look at objects brought close to them. In the training-school of the Emperor <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Gaius</a> there were 20,000 gladiators, among whom there were only two that did not blink when faced by some threat of danger and were consequently unconquerable: so difficult it is for a human being to stare steadily, whereas for most people it is natural to keep on blinking, and these are traditionally supposed to be more cowardly. Nobody has eyes of only one colour: with everyone the general surface is white but there is a different colour in the middle. No other part of the body supplies greater indications of the mind — this is so with all animals alike, but specially with man — that is, indications of self-restraint, mercy, pity, hatred, love, sorrow, joy. The eyes are also very varied in their look — fierce, stern, sparkling, sedate, leering, askance, downcast, kindly: in fact the eyes are the abode of the mind. They glow, stare, moisten, wink; from them flows the tear of compassion, when we kiss them we seem to reach the mind itself, they are the source of tears and of the stream that bedews the cheek. What is the nature of this moisture that at a moment of sorrow flows so copiously and so promptly? Or where is it in the remaining time? In point of fact it is the mind that is the real instrument of sight and of observation; the eyes act as a sort of vessel receiving and transmitting the visible portion of the consciousness. This explains why deep thought blinds the eyes by withdrawing the vision inward, and why when the mind is clouded during an attack of epilepsy the eyes though open discern nothing. Moreover hares sleep with the eyes wide open, and so do many human beings while in the condition which the Greeks term 'corybantic.' </p>                        </div>

This is the reason why commonly birds when released from men's hands go first of all for their eyes, because they see their own likeness reflected in them and try to reach as it were a desired object that is akin to themselves. Beasts of burden only experience diseases at certain phases of the moon. Man alone is cured of blindness by the emission of fluid from the eye. Many have had their sight restored after 20 years of blindness; some have been blind at birth owing to no defect in the eyes; similarly, many have suddenly lost their sight without any previous injury. The most learned authorities state that the eyes are connected with the brain by a vein; for my own part I am inclined to believe that they are also thus connected with the stomach: it is unquestionable that a man never has an eye knocked out without vomiting. There is a solemn ritual custom among Roman citizens to close the eyes of the dying and to open them again on the funeral pyre, custom having established that it is not right for the eyes to be seen by a human being at the last moment and also wrong for them not to be displayed to the heavens. Man is the only animal whose eyes are liable to distortion, which is the origin of the family names Squint-eye and Blinky. From the eyes also came the name of One-eye that used to be given to persons born blind in one eye, and that of Eyelet given to persons both of whose eyes were small; the One-eye family a received the name of an injury done to one of them. The eyes of night-roaming animals like <a href=/people/556 target=_blank>cats</a> shine and flash in the dark so that one cannot look at them, and those of the wild-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> and the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> gleam and shoot out light; the eyes of the <a href=/people/10989 target=_blank>sea-calf</a> and of the hyena change frequently into a thousand colours; moreover those of many fishes shine out even in the dark, like oak-tree stumps when dry and rotten with age. We have stated that creatures that do not direct their gaze by slanting the eyes but by turning the head round do not wink. It is reported that the chameleon's eyes turn themselves entirely round. Crabs look sideways, having their eyes enclosed in a fragile shell. Lobsters and shrimps mostly have very hard eyes projecting under a protection of the same kind. Creatures with hard eyes have less keen sight than those whose eyes are moist. It is stated that if one removes the eyes of young <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> and swallow chicks, they grow again. The eyes of all insects and of creatures with a covering of shell move like the ears of quadrupeds. Those with fragile coverings have hard eyes. All such creatures, and also fish and insects, have no eyelids and do not close their eyes; withal the eye is covered with a membrane that is transparent like glass. </p>                        </div>

It is said that sexual excess causes them to drop off, not undeservedly. None of the other species have them excepting those with hair on the rest of the body as well, but quadrupeds have them only on the upper lid, birds on the lower, as also do creatures with a soft skin, for instance <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a>, and oviparous quadrupeds, for instance lizards.

Of continuous teeth those that separate the food (incisors), are called the broad or sharp teeth, those that masticate it double teeth, and those between these <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-teeth. The latter are longest in creatures with serrated teeth. Continuous teeth are either in both jaws, as with the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, or else there are no front teeth in the upper jaw, as with <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> and <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and all the ruminants. The <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> has no upper teeth except the pair in front. Species having serrated teeth have no projecting teeth, and a female rarely has them, and when she has them does not use them; consequently though <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> gore, <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sows</a> bite. No species with horns has projecting teeth, but all have curved ones; all the other species have solid teeth. All kinds of fish have serrated teeth except the parrot-fish — this is the only aquatic species that has level teeth. Many of them however have teeth on the tongue and all over the mouth, so as to soften by means of a multiplicity of wounds objects that they are unable to reduce by mastication. Many also have teeth on the palate [and also on the tail] and also turned further into the mouth, so as to prevent morsels of food from falling out, as they have no apparatus for retaining it. </p>                        </div>

The most accurate authorities write that this poison is nothing else than the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a>' gall, and that veins pass from the gall-bladder under the spine to the mouth; certain writers say that it is only one tooth, and that as it is hooked it is sloped backward when it has inflicted a bite; some authorities state that it then falls out and afterwards grows again, as it is very easy to dislodge, and that the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> that we see handled lack this tooth; and that the scorpion has this tooth in its tail — as according to most authorities it has three. The <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>vipers</a>' teeth are concealed in its gum. Their gum is charged with the same poison, and when squeezed by the pressure of the teeth pours out its venom into the bites inflicted. No winged creature except the bat has teeth. The <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camel</a> is the only animal without horns that has not got front teeth in the upper jaw. No horned animal has serrated teeth. Even snails have teeth; this is proved by the fact that even the smallest of them gnaw vetches. But I wonder what possible ground there is for the view that among marine species shell-fish and cartilaginous fish have front teeth, and also that sea-urchins have five. Insects have stings instead of teeth. The monkey has teeth like those of a human being. The elephant has four inner teeth for masticating, and besides these the prominent tusks that are bent backward in the male and slope straight downward in the female. The sea-<a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mouse</a> that swims in front of the whale has no teeth, but instead of them its mouth inside and also its tongue and palate are set with bristles.

With <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> the tongue is extremely slender and three-forked, darting, black in colour, and if drawn out to full length extremely long; with lizards it is cleft in two and hairy, and with <a href=/people/10989 target=_blank>seals</a> also it is double; but with the species above mentioned it is of the fineness of a hair. With the rest it is available for licking round the jaws, but with fish it adheres through a little less than its whole length, and with crocodiles the whole of it. In aquatic species on the other hand the fleshy palate serves instead of the tongue in tasting. With <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a>, leopards, and all the species of that genus, even <a href=/people/556 target=_blank>cats</a>, the tongue is rough and corrugated like a file, and can scrape away the human skin by licking, which provokes even those that have been tamed to madness when their saliva gets through to the blood. We have spoken of the tongues of the purple-fishes. In <a href=/people/10983 target=_blank>frogs</a> the tip of the tongue is attached but the inner part is loose from the throat; it is with this that the males croak, at the time when they are called croakers; this happens at a fixed season, when they are calling the females to mate. In this process they just drop the lower lip and take into the throat a moderate amount of water and let the tongue vibrate in it so as to make it undulate, and a croaking sound is forced out; during this the curves of the cheeks are distended and become transparent, and the eyes stand out blazing with the exertion. Creatures with stings in their hinder part have teeth and a tongue as well, <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> even a very long tongue, and cicalas also a projecting one; but those with a tubular sting in the mouth have neither tongue nor teeth. Some insects have a tongue inside the month, for instance ants; moreover, the elephant's tongue also is particularly little visible. With the rest of the animals according to theft kind the tongue is always quite free, but with man alone it is often so tightly bound by veins that they have to be cut. We find it recorded that the High Priest <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> was so tongue-tied that he is believed to have suffered torture for many months while practising the formula to be spoken in dedicating the Temple of <a href=/people/923 target=_blank>Wealth</a>; but in all other cases of stammering the patient usually contrives to speak distinctly after reaching the age of six. Many people on the other hand are endowed with such skill in using the tongue that they can give imitations of the cries of birds and animals that are indistinguishable from the real thing. With all the other species the tip of the tongue is the seat of taste, but with man this is also situated in the palate. </p>                        </div>

It is stated that at the cremation of persons who have died of heart disease the heart cannot be burnt, and the same is said of persons that have been killed by poison; undoubtedly there is extant a speech of <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> that employs this argument to prove Gnaeus <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> guilty of poisoning, and explicitly uses the evidence that it had been impossible to cremate the heart of <a href=/people/2619 target=_blank>Germanicus</a> Caesaron account of poison.

Indeed provident Nature has enclosed all the principal internal organs with special membranes serving as sheaths; but in the case of this membrane a special cause also was the proximity of the bowels, to prevent the food from pressing down on the vital principle. To this membrane unquestionably is due the subtlety of the intellect; it consequently has no flesh, but is of a spare sinewy substance. In it also is the chief seat of merriment, a fact that is gathered chiefly from tickling the armpits to which it rises, as nowhere else is the human skin thinner, and consequently the pleasure of scratching is closest there. On this account there have been cases in battle and in gladiatorial shows of death caused by piercing the diaphragm that has been accompanied by laughter. </p>                        </div>

On this account species in which the distance from the belly is longer arc greedier for food; moreover those with a very fat abdomen are less clever. Birds also in some eases have two receptacles, one down which food just eaten passes to the throat, the other into which they pass the food from the throat when digested — e.g. hens, ring-doves, pigeons and partridges. Almost all the other species in most cases have not got this, but make use of a more widely opened gullet, for instance jays, ravens and <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crows</a>. Some species treat the food in neither manner, but have the abdomen very near; these are species that have specially long and narrow necks, for instance the sultana-hen. The abdomen of whole-hoofed annuals is rough and hard. In that of some land animals the roughness is denticulated, and in that of others it has a latticed bite. Species that are without teeth in both jaws and that do not ruminate digest their food here and pass it down from here into the belly. This in all species is attached at its middle to the navel; in man at its lower part it resembles the belly of a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>; the Greeks call it the colon; it is the seat of a great cause of pain. In <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> it is extremely narrow, and for this reason they can only relieve it with a violent effort and not without severe pain. The most ravenous animals are those in whom the food passes directly from the abdomen right down the gut; this is the case with lynxes, and among birds cormorants. The elephant has four abdomens, but its other parts resemble those of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a>; its lungs are four times as large as those of an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>.

Whole-hooved species that never have more than two foals all have two dugs, and these always between the thighs. Animals with cloven feet and horns have the dugs in the same place, <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> having four and <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> two. Those that bear large litters and that have toes on the feet have more dugs, and these in a double row the whole length of the belly — for instance <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>, of which the good breeds have twelve dugs and the common ones two less; similarly with <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>. Some species have four dugs in the middle of the belly, for instance leopards, others two, for instance lionesses. The elephant has only two dugs beneath the shoulders and not on the breast but close to it, concealed under the shoulder-blades. None of the species with toes have dugs beneath the thighs. <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>Sows</a> give their first dugs to the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> born first in each litter, these being the dugs nearest to their throats, and each <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> in the litter knows its own dug in the order in which it was born, and gets its food from that one and not at another. If its nurseling is taken away from it the dug at once goes dry and shrivels up, whereas if one out of the whole litter is left the dug that had been assigned to it at birth alone hangs down and does service. She-bears carry four dugs. <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphins</a> only have two nipples at the bottom of the belly, which are not prominent and project slightly sideways; and the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphin</a> is the only animal that gives suck while in motion.

A <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a> does not have milk before calving; and after the first calving there are always biestings, which condense into a sort of foam unless water is mixed with them. <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>Asses</a> in foal begin to give milk at once. Where the pasture is rich it is fatal for their foals to have tasted their mothers' milk in the two days after birth; the name for the illness is biestings-fever. Cheese is not made from species with teeth in both jaws, as their milk does not curdle. <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>Camel</a>'s milk is the thinnest and mares' milk the next thin; <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a>' milk is thickest, so that it is used as a substitute for rennet. <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>Asses</a>' milk is actually thought to contribute something to the whiteness in women's skin; at all events <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>'s wife <a href=/people/3075 target=_blank>Poppaea</a> used to drag five hundred she-<a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> with foals about with her everywhere and actually soaked her whole body in a bathtub with <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>'s milk, believing that it also smoothed out wrinkles. All milk is made thicker by fire and turned into whey by cold. Cow's milk makes more cheese than <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>'s milk, almost as much again from the same quantity.

The rhinoceros is the only solid-hooved animal that has pastern-bones, for <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> are thought to belong to both classes, and consequently their pastern-bones are misshapen. Persons who have thought that a human being has pastern-bones have been easily refuted. Of the animals with toes only the lynx has something resembling a pastern-bone, and the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> a still more twisted one. But the true pastern-bone is at the ankle-joint, projecting with a hollow bulge and attached with a ligature onto the joint. </p>                        </div>

He thinks that flies, <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> and other similar creatures begin and cease to give an audible sound when they begin and cease to fly, as the sound is caused by friction and by the air inside them, not by breathing; and that locusts make a sound by rubbing their wings against their thighs. It is indeed believed that among aquatic creatures scallops similarly make a rushing sound when they fly, but that shell-fish and crustaceans have no voice nor sound of any kind. But the other fishes, although they lack lungs and windpipe, are not entirely devoid of any sound at all — people advance the quibble that their hiss is made with the teeth — and the fish in the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383211WAch class=place long=21.1067 lat=38.3388>Achelous</a> called the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>-fish has a grunt, and so have others about which we have spoken. Oviparous species have a hiss — <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> a long one, tortoises an abrupt one. Frogs have a special kind of voice, as has been said unless in their case also we are to allow some uncertainty, because 'voice' means a sound formed in the month, not in the chest. Still in the case of <a href=/people/10983 target=_blank>frogs</a> the nature of the localities also makes a great deal of difference: the <a href=/people/10983 target=_blank>frogs</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> are reported to be dumb, and also the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a>. Among birds the smaller ones are more talkative, and particularly at the mating season. Some birds, e.g. quails, give a cry when fighting, others, e.g. partridges, before a fight, others, e.g. domestic fowls, when they have won. With the latter the cocks have a crow of their own, but with other birds, for instance the nightingale class, the hens also have the same note. Some birds sing all the year, some at certain seasons, as has been said in dealing with the species separately. The elephant squeezes out a sound like a sneeze from its actual mouth, not through the nostrils, but through the nostrils it emits a harsh trumpet sound. In <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> alone the lowing of the females is louder, but in every other kind of animal the females' voice is not so loud as that of the males, even (in the case of the human race) those that have been castrated. The infant gives no sound at birth until it emerges entirely from the womb. It begins to talk when a year old; but <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> had a son who spoke at six months and while still at the rattle stage, a portent that brought the whole of that realm to downfall. Infants that began to speak quicker are slower in starting to walk. The voice gets stronger at fourteen, but it gets weaker in old age; and it does not alter more often in any other animal. </p>                        </div>

Also it runs along a straight or concave surface of wall and carries words although spoken in a low tone to the other end, if no unevenness of the surface hinders it. In a human being the voice constitutes a large part of the external personality: we recognise a man by it before we see him just in the same way as we recognise him with our eyes; and there are as many varieties of voices as there are mortals in the world, and a person's voice is as distinctive as his face. This is the source of the difference between all the races and all the languages all over the world, and of all the tunes and modulations and inflexions, but before all things of the power of expressing the thoughts that has made us different from the beasts, and has also caused another distinction between human beings themselves that is as wide as that which separates them from the lower animals. </p>                        </div>

In a similar manner among ourselves <a href=/people/2553 target=_blank>Trogus</a>, himself also one of the most critical authorities, has added some outward signs of character which I will append in his own words: 'When the forehead is large it indicates that the mind beneath it is sluggish; people with a small forehead have a nimble mind, those with a round forehead an irascible mind' — as if this were a visible indication of a swollen temper! 'When people's eyebrows are level this signifies that they are gentle, when they are curved at the side of the nose, that they are stern, when bent down at the temples, that they are mockers, when entirely drooping, that they are malevolent and spiteful. If people's eyes are narrow on both sides, this shows them to be malicious in character; eyes that have fleshy corners on the side of the nostrils show a mark of maliciousness; when the white part of the eyes is extensive it conveys an indication of impudence; eyes that have a habit of repeatedly closing indicate unreliability.
