All were of rarest beauty, all clad alike and all in lusty youth, their years of girlish modesty now ended, and maidenhood ripe for the marriage-couch. But as far as <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> by comparison doth surpass the green <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> of the sea, or as <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a> rises taller by head and shoulders than the <a href=/people/952 target=_blank>Naiads</a>, so doth <a href=/people/2043 target=_blank>Deidamia</a>, queen of the lovely choir, outshine and dazzle her fair sisters.

When he beheld her far in advance of her attendant train, the lad, ungentle as he was and heart-whole from any touch of passion, stood spellbound and drank in strange fire through all his frame. Nor does the love he has imbibed lie hidden, but the flame pulsating in his inmost being returns to his face and colours the glow upon his cheeks, and as he feels its power runs o’er his body with a light sweat. As when the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a> darken milk-white bowls with blood-red dye, or ivory is stained with purple, so by varying signs of blush and pallor does the sudden fire betray its presence.

As when a bullock, soon to be the sire and leader of a herd, though his horns have not yet come full circle, perceives a heifer of snowy whiteness, the comrade of his pasture, his spirit takes fire, and he foams at the mouth with his first passion; glad at heart the herdsmen watch him and check his fury. </p>                        </div>
