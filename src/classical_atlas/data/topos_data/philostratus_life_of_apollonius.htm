And they say that he declined to wear apparel made from dead animal products and, to guard his purity, abstained from all flesh diet, and from the offering of animals in sacrifice. For that he would not stain the altars with blood; nay, rather the honey-cake and frankincense and the hymn of praise, these they say were the offerings made to the Gods by this man, who realized that they welcome such tribute more than they do the hecatombs and the knife laid upon the sacrificial basket. For they say that he had of a certainty social intercourse with the gods, and learnt from them the conditions under which they take pleasure in men or are disgusted, and on this intercourse he based his account of nature. For he said that, whereas other men only make conjectures about divinity and make guesses that contradict one another concerning it, — in his own case he said that <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> had come to him acknowledging that he was the god in person; and that <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> and the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> and other gods, whose forms and names men did not yet know, had also consorted with him though without making such acknowledgment. And the followers of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> accepted as law any decisions communicated by him, and honored him as an emissary from <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, but imposed, out of respect for their divine character, a ritual silence on themselves. For many were the divine and ineffable secrets which they had heard, but which it was difficult for any to keep who had not previously learnt that silence also is a mode of speech. <br />Moreover they declare that <a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373136PAkr class=person long=13.5855 lat=37.2906>Acragas</a> had trodden this way of wisdom when he wrote the line <br />Rejoice ye, for I am unto you an immortal God, and no more mortal. <br />And this also: <br />For erewhile, I already became both girl and boy. <br />And the story that he made at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a> a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> of pastry and sacrificed it to the god also shows that he approved of the sentiments of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>. And there is much else that they tell of those sages who observe the rule of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>; but I must not now enter upon such points, but hurry on to the work which I have set myself to complete. </p>                        </div>

For <a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a> and <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> himself and <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> consorted with wizards and uttered many supernatural truths, yet never stooped to the black art; and <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and mingled with his own discourses much of what he heard from the prophets and priests there; and though, like a painter, he laid his own colors on to their rough sketches, yet he never passed for a wizard, although envied above all mankind for his wisdom. For the circumstance that <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> foresaw and foreknew so many things does not in the least justify us in imputing to him this kind of wisdom; we might as well accuse <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> of the same, because, thanks to his familiar spirit, he knew things beforehand, and we might also accuse <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a> because of the many things which he foretold. And indeed who does not know the story of how <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a> in a season when least rain falls came forward wearing a fleece into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216BOSt class=place long=21.63333 lat=37.63924>stadium</a>, by way of predicting rain, and of how he foretold the fall of the house, — and truly, for it did fall; and of how he said that day would be turned into night, and stones would be discharged from heaven round <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403266UAig class=place long=26.611 lat=40.35>Aegospotami</a>, and of how his predictions were fulfilled? Now these feats are set down to the wisdom of <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a> by the same people who would rob <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> of the credit of having predicted things by dint of wisdom, and say that he achieved these results by art of wizardry. <br />It seems to me then that I ought not to condone or acquiesce in the general ignorance, but write a true account of the man, detailing the exact times at which he said or did this or that, as also the habits and temper of wisdom by means of which he succeeded in being considered a supernatural and divine being. <br />And I have gathered my information partly from the many cities where he was loved, and partly from the sanctuaries whose long-neglected and decayed rites he restored, and partly from the accounts left of him by others and partly from his own letters. For he addressed these to kings, sophists, philosophers, to men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=place long=21.374 lat=37.89>Elis</a>, of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a>; and in his letters he dealt with the subjects of the gods, of customs, of moral principles, of laws, and in all these departments he corrected the errors into which men had fallen. But the more precise details which I have collected are as follows. </p>                        </div>

He resorted to <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> in order to study wisdom, and having shared, by his own account, his wanderings abroad, wrote an account of them. And he records his opinions and discourses and all his prophecies. And a certain kinsmen of <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> drew the attention of the empress <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a> to the documents containing these documents hitherto unknown. Now I belonged to the circle of the empress, for she was a devoted admirer of all rhetorical exercises; and she commanded me to recast and edit these essays, at the same time paying more attention to the style and diction of them; for the man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363432UNin class=place long=43.1523 lat=36.3578>Nineveh</a> had told his story clearly enough, yet somewhat awkwardly. And I also read the book of <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358368PAeg class=person long=35.788 lat=36.769>Aegae</a>, which comprised all the life of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358368PAeg class=place long=35.788 lat=36.769>Aegae</a>; and furthermore a will was composed by <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, from which one can learn how rapturous and inspired a sage he really was. For we must not pay attention anyhow to <a href=/people/3428 target=_blank>Moeragenes</a>, who composed four books about <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, and yet was ignorant of many circumstances of his life. That then I combined these scattered sources together and took trouble over my composition, I have said; but let my work, I pray, redound to the honor of the man who is the subject of my compilation, and also be of use to those who love learning. For assuredly, they will here learn things of which as yet they were ignorant. </p>                        </div>

His father was of the same name, and the family descended from the first settlers. It excelled in wealth the surrounding families, though the district is a rich one. To his mother, just before he was born, there came an apparition of <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a>, who changes his form so much in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, in the guise of an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> demon.

Well, I need hardly explain to readers of the poets the quality of <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a> and his reputation as regards wisdom; how versatile he was, and for ever changing his form, and defying capture, and how he had a reputation of knowing both past and future. And we must bear <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a> in mind all the more, when my advancing story shows its hero to have been more of a prophet than <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a>, and to have triumphed over many difficulties and dangers in the moment when they beset him most closely. </p>                        </div>

For just as the hour of his birth was approaching, his mother was warned in a dream to walk out into the meadow and pluck the flowers; and in due course she came there and her maids attended to the flowers, scattering themselves over the meadow, while she fell asleep lying on the grass. Thereupon the swans who fed in the meadow set up a dance around her as she slept, and lifting their wings, as they are wont to do, cried out aloud all at once, for there was somewhat of a breeze blowing in the meadow. She then leaped up at the sound of their song and bore her child, for any sudden fright is apt to bring on a premature delivery. But the people of the country say that just at the moment of the birth, a thunderbolt seemed about to fall to earth and then rose up into the air and disappeared aloft; and the gods thereby indicated, I think, the great distinction to which the sage was to attain, and hinted in advance how he should transcend all things upon earth and approach the gods, and signified all the things that he would achieve. </p>                        </div>

All eyes were turned upon him, for he was, moreover, conspicuous for his beauty. When he reached his fourteenth year, his father brought him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349UTar class=place long=34.897 lat=36.9122>Tarsus</a>, to <a href=/people/329 target=_blank>Euthydemus</a> the teacher from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a>. Now <a href=/people/329 target=_blank>Euthydemus</a> was a good rhetor, and began his education; but, though he was attached to his teacher, he found the atmosphere of the city harsh and strange and little conducive to the philosophic life, for nowhere are men more addicted than here to luxury; jesters and full of insolence are they all; and they attend more to their fine linen than the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> did to wisdom; and a stream called the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349WKyd class=place long=34.92 lat=36.9191>Cydnus</a> runs through their city, along the banks of which they sit like so many water-fowl. Hence the words which <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> addresses to them in his letter: Be done with getting drunk upon your water. He therefore transferred his teacher, with his father's consent, to the town of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358368PAeg class=place long=35.788 lat=36.769>Aegae</a>, which was close by, where he found a peace congenial to one who would be a philosopher, and a more serious school of study and a sanctuary of <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>, where that god reveals himself in person to men. There he had as his companions in philosophy followers of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> and <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> and peripatetic philosophers. And he diligently attended also to the discourses of <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, for he did not despise these either, although it was to those of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> that he applied himself with unspeakable wisdom and ardor. However, his teacher of the <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagorean</a> system was not a very serious person, nor one who practiced in his conduct the philosophy he taught; for he was the slave of his belly and appetites, and modeled himself upon <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>. And this man was <a href=/people/3026 target=_blank>Euxenus</a> from the town of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=place long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heraclea in Pontus</a>, and he knew the principles of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> just as birds know what they learn from men; for the birds will wish you farewell, and say Good day or <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> help you, and such like, without understanding what they say and without any real sympathy for mankind, merely because they have been trained to move their tongue in a certain manner. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, however, was like the young <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> who, as long as they are not fully fledged, fly alongside of their parents and are trained by them in flight, but who, as soon as they are able to rise in the air, outsoar the parent birds, especially when they perceive the latter to be greedy and to be flying along the ground in order to snuff the quarry; like them <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> attended <a href=/people/3026 target=_blank>Euxenus</a> as long as he was a child and was guided by him in the path of argument, but when he reached his sixteenth year he indulged his impulse towards the life of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, being fledged and winged thereto by some higher power. Notwithstanding he did not cease to love <a href=/people/3026 target=_blank>Euxenus</a>, nay, he persuaded his father to present him with a villa outside the town, where there were tender groves and fountains, and he said to him: Now you live there your own life, but I will live that of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>. </p>                        </div>

And having said this he declined to live upon a flesh diet, on the ground that it was unclean, and also that it made the mind gross; so he partook only of dried fruits and vegetables, for he said that all the fruits of the earth are clean. And of wine he said that it was a clean drink because it is yielded to men by so well-domesticated a plant as the vine; but he declared that it endangered the mental balance and system and darkened, as with mud, the ether which is in the soul. After then having thus purged his interior, he took to walking without shoes by way of adornment and clad himself in linen raiment, declining to wear any animal product; and he let his hair grow long and lived in the Temple. And the people round about the Temple were struck with admiration for him, and the god <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a> one day said to the priest that he was delighted to have <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> as witness of his cures of the sick; and such was his reputation that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=ethnic long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicians</a> themselves and the people all around flocked to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358368PAeg class=place long=35.788 lat=36.769>Aegae</a> to visit him. Hence the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=demonym long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilician</a> proverb: Whither runnest thou? Is it to see the stripling?

For an <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> stripling came to <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>, and though he was sick, yet he lived the life of luxury, and being continually drunk, I will not say he lived, rather he was ever dying. He suffered then from dropsy, and finding his pleasure in drunkenness took no care to dry up his malady. On this account then <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a> took no care of him, and did not visit him even in a dream. The youth grumbled at this, and thereupon the god, standing over him, said, If you were to consult <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> you would be easier. He therefore went to <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, and said: What is there in your wisdom that I can profit by? for <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a> bids me consult you. And he replied: I can advise you of what, under the circumstances, will be most valuable to you; for I suppose you want to get well. Yes, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, answered the other, I want the health which <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a> promises, but never gives. Hush, said the other, for he gives to those who desire it, but you do things that irritate and aggravate your disease, for you give yourself up to luxury, and you accumulate delicate viands upon your water-logged and worn-out stomach, and as it were, choke water with a flood of mud. This was a clearer response, in my opinion, than <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heraclitus</a>, in his wisdom, gave. For he said when he was visited by this affection that what he needed was someone to substitute a drought for a rainy weather, a very unintelligible remark, it appears to me, and by no means clear; but the sage restored the youth to health by a clear interpretation of the wise saw. </p>                        </div>

So he went to the priest and said: What is all this; for someone is making a very handsome gift to the god? And the priest replied: You may rather be surprised at a man's offering all this without having first put up a prayer in our fane, and without having stayed with us as long as other people do, and without having gained his health from the god, and without obtaining all the things he came to ask for. For he appears to have come only yesterday, yet he is sacrificing on this lavish scale. And he declares that he will sacrifice more victims, and dedicate more gifts, if <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a> will hearken to him. And he is one of the richest men in existence; at any rate he owns in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> an estate bigger than all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=ethnic long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicians</a> together possess. And he is supplicating the god to restore to him one of his eyes that has fallen out. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> fixed his eyes upon the ground, as he was accustomed to do in later life, and asked: What is his name? And when he heard it, he said: It seems to me, O Priest, that we ought not to welcome this fellow in the Temple: for he is some ruffian who has come here, and that he is afflicted in this way is due to some sinister reason: nay, his very conduct in sacrificing on such a magnificent scale before he has gained anything from the god is not that of a genuine votary, but rather of a man who is begging himself off for the penalty of some horrible and cruel deed. This was what <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said: and <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a> appeared to the priest by night, and said: Send away so and so at once with all his possessions, and let him keep them, for he deserves to lose the other eye as well. The priest accordingly made inquiries about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=demonym long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilician</a> and learned that his wife by a former marriage borne a daughter, and he had fallen in love with the maiden and had seduced her, and was living with her in open sin.

On one occasion several people had flocked to the Temple, not long after the expulsion of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=demonym long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilician</a>, and he took the occasion to ask the priest the following questions: Are then, he said, the gods just? Why, of course, most just, answered the priest. Well, and are they wise? And what, said the other, can be wiser than the godhead? But do they know the affairs of men, or are they without experience of them? Why, said the other, this is just the point in which the gods excel mankind, for the latter, because of their frailty, do not understand their own concerns, whereas the gods have the privilege of understanding the affairs both of men and of themselves. All your answers, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, are excellent, O Priest, and very true. Since then, they know everything, it appears to me that a person who comes to the house of God and has a good conscience, should put up the following prayer: “O ye gods, grant unto me that which I deserve.' For, he went on, the holy, O Priest, surely deserve to receive blessings, and the wicked the contrary. Therefore the gods, as they are beneficent, if they find anyone who is healthy and whole and unscarred by vice, will send him on his way, surely, after crowning him, not with golden crowns, but with all sorts of blessings; but if they find a man branded with sin and utterly corrupt, they will hand him over and leave him to justice, after inflicting their wrath upon him all the more, because he dared to invade their Temple without being pure. And at the same moment he looked towards <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>, and said: O <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>, the philosophy you teach is secret and congenial to yourself, in that you suffer not the wicked to come hither, not even if they pour into your lap all the wealth of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> and <a href=/people/10224 target=_blank>Sardes</a>. For it is not out of reverence for the divinity that they sacrifice these victims and suspend these offerings, but in order to purchase a verdict, which you will not concede to them in your perfect justice.

If you too really care for uprightness, go boldly up to the god and tender what prayer you will. By heaven, I will, said the other, if you will allow me to address you one first. And what prayer, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, can you make to me? A prayer which can only be offered to the beautiful, and which is that they may grant to others participation in their beauty and not grudge their charms.

Now the latter had reached his twenty-third year; <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, on the other hand, was only twenty, and the law subjected him to guardians. He therefore spent afresh some time in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358368PAeg class=place long=35.788 lat=36.769>Aegae</a>, and turned the sanctuary into a Lyceum and Academy, for it resounded with all sorts of philosophical discussions. After that he returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378346PTya class=place long=34.57 lat=37.82>Tyana</a>, by this time grown to manhood and his own master. Someone said to him that it was his duty to correct his brother and convert him from his evil ways; whereupon he answered: This would seem a desperate enterprise; for how can I who am the younger one correct and render wise an older man? but so far as I can do anything, I will heal him of these bad passions. Accordingly he gave to him the half of his own share of the property, on the pretense that he required more than he had, while he himself needed little; and then he pressed him and cleverly persuaded him to submit to the counsels of wisdom, and said: Our father has departed this life, who educated us both and corrected us, so that you are all that I have left, and I imagine, I am all that you have left. If therefore I do anything wrong, please advise me and cure me of my faults; and in turn if you yourself do anything wrong, suffer me to teach you better. And so he reduced his brother to a reasonable state of mind, just as we break in skittish and unruly <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> by stroking and patting them; and he reformed him from his faults, numerous as they were, for he was the slave of play and of wine, and he serenaded courtesans and was vain of his hair, which he dressed up and dyed, strutting about like an arrogant dandy. So when all was well between him and his brother, he at once turned his attention to his other relatives, and conciliated such of them as were in want by bestowing on them the rest of his property, leaving only a trifle to himself; for he said that <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384268PKla class=person long=26.7703 lat=38.3614>Clazomenae</a> kept his philosophy for <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> rather than for men when he abandoned his fields to flocks and <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>, and that <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=person long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>, when he threw his money into the sea benefited neither man nor beast. And as <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> was commended for his saying that a man should have no intercourse except with his own wife, he declared that this was intended by <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> for others than himself, for that he was resolved never to wed nor have any connexion whatever with women. In laying such restraint on himself he surpassed <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>, who only said that in reaching old age he had escaped from a mad and cruel master; but <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> by dint of virtue and temperance never even in his youth was so overcome. While still a mere stripling, in full enjoyment of his bodily vigor, he mastered and gained control of the maddening passion. And yet there are those who accuse him falsely of an addiction to venery, alleging that he fell a victim of such sins and spent a whole year in their indulgence among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, the facts being that he never once visited <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a> nor was ever carried away by such passions. Not even <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a> ever accused the sage of venery, though he traduced him otherwise and composed lying treatises against him, as we shall show when we come to speak of him below. And his quarrel with <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> was that the latter rallied him for doing anything for money and tried to wean him of his love of filthy lucre and of huckstering his wisdom. But these matters I must defer to the times to which they belong. </p>                        </div>

He replied: I have not yet kept silence. And forthwith he began to hold his tongue from a sense of duty, and kept absolute silence, though his eyes and his mind were taking note of very many things, and though most things were being stored in his memory. Indeed, when he reached the age of a hundred, he still surpassed <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> in point of memory, and he used to chant a hymn addressed to memory, in which it is said that everything is worn and withered away by time, whereas time itself never ages, but remains immortal because of memory. Nevertheless his company was not without charm during the period of his silence; for he would maintain a conversation by the expression of his eyes, by gestures of his hands and nodding his head; nor did he strike men as gloomy or morse; for he retained his fondness for company and cheerfulness. This part of his life he says was the most uphill work he knew, since he practiced silence for five whole years; for he says he often had things to say and could not do so, and he was often obliged not to hear things the hearing of which would have enraged him, and often when he was moved and inclined to break out in a rebuke to others, he said to himself: Bear up then, my heart and tongue; and when reasoning offended him he had to give up for the time the refuting of it. </p>                        </div>

Whenever, however, he came on a city engaged in civil conflict (and many were divided into fractions over spectacles of a low kind), he would advance and show himself, and by indicating part of his intended rebuke by manual gesture or by look on his face, he would put an end to all the disorder, and people hushed their voices, as if they were engaged in the mysteries. Well, it is not so very difficult to restrain those who have started a quarrel about dances and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, for those who are rioting about such matters, if they turn their eyes to a real man, blush and check themselves and easily recover their senses; but a city hard pressed by famine is not so tractable, nor so easily brought to a better mood by persuasive words and its passion quelled. But in the case of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, mere silence on his part was enough for those so affected. Anyhow, when he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369312PAsp class=place long=31.172 lat=36.939>Aspendus</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=place long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylia</a> (and this city is built on the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369312WEur class=place long=31.159 lat=36.911>Eurymedon</a>, lesser only than two others about there), he found vetches on sale in the market, and the citizens were feeding upon this and on anything else they could get; for the rich men had shut up all the grain and were holding it up for export from the country. Consequently an excited crowd of all ages had set upon the governor, and were lighting a fire to burn him alive, although he was clinging to the statues of the Emperor, which were more dreaded at that time and more inviolable than the <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>; for they were statues of <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, in whose reign a master is said to have been held guilty of impiety, merely because he struck his own slave when he had on his person a silver drachma coined with the image of <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> then went up to the governor and with a sign of his hand asked him what was the matter; and he answered that he had done no wrong, but was indeed being wronged quite as much as the populace; but, he said, if he could not get a hearing, he would perish along with the populace. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> then turned to the bystanders, and beckoned to them that they must listen; and they not only held their tongues from wonderment at him, but they laid the brands they had kindled on the altars which were there. The governor then plucked up courage and said: This man and that man, and he named several, are to blame for the famine which has arisen; for they have taken away the grain and are keeping it, one in one part of the country and another in another. The inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369312PAsp class=place long=31.172 lat=36.939>Aspendus</a> thereupon passed the word to one another to make for these men's estates, but <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> signed with his head, that they should do no such thing, but rather summon those who were to blame and obtain the grain from them with their consent. And when, after a little time the guilty parties arrived, he very nearly broke out in speech against them, so much was he affected by the tears of the crowd; for the children and women had all flocked together, and the old men were groaning and moaning as if they were on the point of dying by hunger. However, he respected his vow of silence and wrote on a writing board his indictment of the offenders and handed it to the governor to read out aloud; and his indictment ran as follows: <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> to the grain dealers of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369312PAsp class=place long=31.172 lat=36.939>Aspendus</a>. The earth is mother of us all, for she is just; but you, because you are unjust have pretended that she is your mother alone; and if you do not stop, I will not permit you to remain upon her. They were so terrified by these words, that they filled the market-place with grain and the city revived. </p>                        </div>

For they say that <a href=/people/762 target=_blank>Daphne</a>, the daughter of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378218WLad class=place long=21.859 lat=37.682>Ladon</a>, there underwent her metamorphosis, and they have a river flowing there, the <a href=/people/4342 target=_blank>Ladon</a>, and a laurel tree is worshipped by them which they say is the one substituted for the maiden; and cypress trees of enormous height surround the sanctuary, and the ground sends up springs both ample and placid, in which they say <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> purifies himself by ablution. And there it is that the earth sends up a shoot of cypress, they say in honor of <a href=/people/4957 target=_blank>Cyparissus</a>, an <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> youth; and the beauty of the shrub lends credence to the story of his metamorphosis. Well, perhaps I may seem to have fallen into a somewhat juvenile vein to approach my story by such legendary particulars as these, but my interest is not really mythology. What then is the purport of my narrative? <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, when he beheld a sanctuary so charming and yet the home of no serious studies, but only of men half-barbarous and uncultivated, remarked: O <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, change these voiceless ones into trees, so that at least as cypresses they may become vocal. And when he saw the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378218WLad class=place long=21.859 lat=37.682>Ladon</a>, he said: It is not your daughter alone that underwent a change, but you too, so far as one can see, have become a barbarian after being a <a href=/people/1290 target=_blank>Hellene</a> and an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a>. And when he was minded to converse, he avoided the frequented regions and the disorderly, and said, that it was not people he wanted but real men; and he resorted to the more solemn places, and lived in such sanctuaries as were not shut up. At sunrise, indeed, he performed certain rites by himself, rites which he only communicated to those who had disciplined themselves by a four years' spell of silence; but during the rest of the day, in case the city was a Greek one, and the sacred rituals familiar to a Greek, he would call the priests together and talk wisely about the gods, and would correct them, supposing they had departed from the traditional forms. If, however, the rites were barbarous and peculiar, then he would find out who had founded them and on what occasion they were established, and having learnt the sort of cult it was, he would make suggestions, in case he could think of any improvement upon them, and then he would go in quest of his followers and bid them ask any questions they liked. For he said that it was the duty of philosophers of his school to hold converse at the earliest dawn with the gods, but as the day advanced, about the gods, and during the rest of the day to discuss human affairs in friendly intercourse. And having answered all the questions which his companions addressed to him, and when he had enough of their society, he would rise and give himself up for the rest to haranguing the general public, not however before midday, but as far as possible just when the day stood still. And when he thought he had enough of such discussion, he would be anointed and rubbed, and then fling himself into cold water, for he called hot baths the old age of men. At any rate when the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> were shut out of them because of the enormities committed there, he said: The emperor, for your sins, has granted you a new lease of life. And when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=ethnic long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesians</a> wanted to stone their governor because he did not fire up the baths, he said to them: You are blaming your governor because you get such a sorry bath; but I blame you because you take a bath at all. </p>                        </div>

This <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a>'s language, however, was of a mediocre quality, for he had not the gift of expressing himself, having been educated among the barbarians; but to write down a discourse or a conversation and to give impressions of what he heard or saw and to put together a journal of such matters — that he was well able to do, and carried it out as well as the best. At any rate the volume which he calls his scrap-book, was intended to serve such a purpose by <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, who was determined that nothing about <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> should be passed over in silence, nay, that his most casual and negligent utterances should also be written down. And I may mention the answer which he made to one who caviled and found fault with this journal. It was a lazy fellow and malignant who tried to pick holes in him, and remarked that he recorded well enough a lot of things, for example, the opinions and ideas of his hero, but that in collecting such trifles as these he reminded him of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> who pick up and eat the fragments which fall from a feast. <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> replied thus: If banquets there be of gods, and gods take food, surely they must have attendants whose business it is that not even the parcels of ambrosia that fall to the ground should be lost. </p>                        </div>

And as they fared on into <a href=/people/290 target=_blank>Mesopotamia</a>, the tax-gatherer who presided over the Bridge (<a about=https://topostext.org/place/370379UZeu class=place long=37.8768 lat=37.048>Zeugma</a>) led them into the registry and asked them what they were taking out of the country with them. And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> replied: I am taking with me temperance, justice, virtue, continence, valor, discipline. And in this way he strung together a number of feminine nouns or names. The other, already scenting his own perquisites, said: You must then write down in the register these female slaves. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> answered: Impossible, for they are not female slaves that I am taking out with me, but ladies of quality. <br />Now <a href=/people/290 target=_blank>Mesopotamia</a> is bordered on one side by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a>, and on the other by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>, rivers which flow from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a> and from the lowest slopes of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a>; but they contain a tract like a continent, in which there are some cities, though for the most part only villages, and the races that inhabit them are the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> and the Arab. These races are so shut in by the rivers that most of them, who lead the life of nomads, are so convinced that they are islanders, as to say that they are going down to the sea, when they are merely on their way to the rivers, and think that these rivers border the earth and encircle it. For they curve around the continental tract in question, and discharge their waters into the same sea. But there are people who say that the greater part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> is lost in a marsh, and that this river ends in the earth. But some have a bolder theory to which they adhere, and declare that it runs under the earth to turn up in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and mingle itself with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>. Well, for the sake of accuracy and truth, and in order to leave out nothing of the things that <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> wrote, I should have liked to relate all the incidents that occurred on their journey through these barbarous regions; but my subject hurries me on to greater and more remarkable episodes. Nevertheless, I must perforce dwell upon two topics: on the courage which <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> showed, in making a journey through races of barbarians and robbers, which were not at that time even subject to the Romans, and at the cleverness with which after the matter of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabs</a> he managed to understand the language of the animals. For he learnt this on his way through these Arab tribes, who best understand and practice it. For it is quite common for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabs</a> to listen to the birds prophesying like any oracles, but they acquire this faculty of understanding them by feeding themselves, so they say, either on the heart or liver of <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a>. </p>                        </div>

And there was a satrap in command of this post, a sort of Eye of the King, I imagine; for the Mede had just acceded to the throne, and instead of being content to live in security, he worried himself about things real and imaginary and fell into fits of fear and panic. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> then and his party were brought before this satrap, who had just set up the awning on his wagon and was driving out to go somewhere else. When he saw a man so dried up and parched, he began to bawl out like a cowardly woman and hid his face, and could hardly be induced to look up at him. Whence do you come to us, he said, and who sent you? as if he was asking questions of a spirit. And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> replied: I have sent myself, to see whether I can make men of you, whether you like it or not. He asked a second time who he was to come trespassing like that into the king's country, and <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said: All the earth is mine, and I have a right to go all over it and through it. Whereupon the other said: I will torture you, if you don't answer my questions. And I hope, said the other, that you will do it with your own hands, so that you may be tested by the touchstone of a true man. Now the eunuch was astonished to find that <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> needed no interpreter, but understood what he said without the least trouble or difficulty. <br />By the gods, he said, who are you? this time altering his tone to a whine of entreaty. And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> replied: Since you have asked me civilly this time and not so rudely as before, listen, I will tell you who I am: I am <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378346PTya class=person long=34.57 lat=37.82>Tyana</a>, and my road leads me to the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, because I want to acquaint myself with the country there; and I shall be glad to meet your king, for those who have associated with him say that he is no bad fellow, and certainly he is not, if he is this <a href=/people/4330 target=_blank>Vardanes</a> who has lately recovered the empire which he had lost. He is the same, replied the other, O divine <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>; for we have heard of you a long time ago, and in favor of so wise a man as you he would, I am sure, step down off his golden throne and send your party to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, each of you mounted on a <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camel</a>. And I myself now invite you to be my guest, and I beg to present you with these treasures. And at the moment he pointed out a store of gold to him saying: Take as may handfuls as you like, fill your hands, not once, but ten times. And when <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> refused the money he said: Well, at any rate you will take some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=demonym long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonian</a> wine, which the king bestows on us, his ten satraps. Take a jar of it, with some roast steaks of bacon and venison and some meal and bread and anything else you like. For the road after this, for many stades, leads through villages which are ill-stocked with provision. And here the eunuch caught himself up and said: Oh! ye gods, what have I done? For I have heard that this man never eats the flesh of animals, nor drinks wine, and here I am inviting him to dine in a gross and ignorant manner. Well, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, you can offer me a lighter repast and give me bread and dried fruits. I will give you, said the other, leavened bread and palm dates, like amber and of good size. And I will also supply you with vegetables, the best which the gardens of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a> afford. Well, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, the wild herbs which grow free are nicer than those which are forced and artificial. They are nicer, said the satrap, I admit, but our land in the direction of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> is full of wormwood so that the herbs which grow in it are disagreeably bitter. In the end <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> accepted the satrap's offer, and as he was on the point of going away, he said: My excellent fellow, don't keep your good manners to the end another time, but begin with them. This by way of rebuking him for saying that he would torture him, and for the barbaric language which he had heard to begin with. </p>                        </div>

And it really was a marvel; for when it was cur asunder they found eight whelps within it. And the lioness becomes mother in this way. They carry their young for six months, but they bring forth young only three times; and the number of the whelps at the first birth is three and at the second two, and if the mother makes a third attempt, it bears only one whelp, but I believe a very big one and preternaturally fierce. For we must not believe those who say that the whelps of a lioness make their way out into the world by clawing through their mother's womb; for nature seems to have created the relationship of offspring to mother for their nourishment with a view to the continuance of the race. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> then eyed the animal for a long time, with attention, and then he said: O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, the length of our stay with the king will be a year and eight months; for neither will he let us go sooner than that, nor will it be to our advantage to quit him earlier. And you may guess the number of months from that of the whelps, and that of the years from the lioness; for you must compare wholes with wholes. And <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> replied: But what of the sparrows of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, what do they mean, the ones which the dragon devoured in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384236UAul class=place long=23.5925 lat=38.4335>Aulis</a>, which were eight in number, when he seized their mother for a ninth? <a href=/people/662 target=_blank>Calchas</a> surely explained these to signify nine years and predicted that the war with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> would last so long; so take care that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> may not be right and <a href=/people/662 target=_blank>Calchas</a>, too, and that our stay may not extend to nine years abroad. Well, replied <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> was surely quite right in comparing the nestlings to years, for they are already hatched out and in the world; but what I had in mind were incomplete animals that were not yet born, and perhaps never would have been born; how could I compare them to years? For things that violate nature can hardly come to be; and they anyhow quickly pass to destruction, even if they do come to existence.

So he related his vision to him, and feigned as if it foreboded evil. But <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> began to bellow as if he had seen the dream himself, and tried to dissuade <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> from going any further, Lest, he said, we also like fishes get thrown out of our element and perish, and have to weep and wail in a foreign land. Nay, we may even be reduced to straits, and have to go down on our knees to some potentate or king, who will flout us as the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphins</a> did the fishes. Then <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> laughed and said: You've not become a philosopher yet, if you are afraid of this sort of thing. But I will explain to you the real drift of the dream. For this land of <a href=/people/3800 target=_blank>Cissia</a> is habited by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=ethnic long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretrians</a>, who were brought up here from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a> by <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> five hundred years ago, and they are said to have been treated at their capture like the fishes that we saw in the dream; for they were netted in, so they say, and captured one and all. It would seem then that the gods are instructing me to visit them and tend their needs, supposing I can do anything for them. And perhaps also the souls of the Greeks whose lot was cast in this part of the world are enlisting my aid for their land. Let us then go and diverge from the highroad and ask only about the well, hard by where the settlement is. Now this well is said to consist of a mixture of pitch and oil and water, and if you draw up a bucket and pour it out, these three elements divide and part themselves from one another. That he really did visit <a href=/people/3800 target=_blank>Cissia</a>, he himself acknowledges in a letter which he wrote to the sophist of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384268PKla class=place long=26.7703 lat=38.3614>Clazomenae</a>; for he was so kind an loyal, that when he saw the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=ethnic long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretrians</a>, he remembered the sophist and wrote to him an account of what he had seen, and of what he had done for them; and all through this letter he urges the sophist to take pity on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=ethnic long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretrians</a>, and prays him, every time that he is declaiming a discourse about them, not to deprecate even the shedding of tears over their fate. </p>                        </div>

But the soil is drenched with pitch, and is bitter to plant in; and the inhabitants are very short lived, because the pitch in the water forms a sediment in most of their bowels. And they get their sustenance off a bit of rising ground on the confines of their village, where the ground rises above the tainted country; on this they sow their crops and regard it as their land.

But anyhow the men who were brought up numbered about 400, and there were ten women perhaps; but the rest, who had started from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a>, perished as they were marching up. And they managed to open a quarry on the hill; and as some of them understood the art of cutting stone, they built sanctuaries in the Greek style and a market-place large enough for their purpose; and they dedicated various altars, two to <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, and one to <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, and several to <a href=/people/9246 target=_blank>Daridaeus</a>.

And though the letters are Greek, they said that they never yet had seen the like. And there were ships engraved on the tombstones, to show that the various individuals had lived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a>, and engaged either in seafaring trade, or in that of purple, as sailors or as dyers; and they say that they read an Elegiac inscription written over the sepulcher of some sailors and seafarers, which ran thus: <br />Here, we who once sailed over the deep-flowing billows of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381253WAeg class=place long=25.3 lat=38.1>Aegean sea</a><br />Are lying in the midst of the plain of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348485UEcb class=place long=48.5166 lat=34.8054>Ecbatana</a>. <br />Farewell, once-famed fatherland of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=place long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretria</a>, farewell <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, <br />Ye neighbor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a>, farewell thou darling sea. <br />Well, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> says that <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> restored the tombs that had gone to ruin and closed them up, and that he poured out libations and made offering to their inmates, all that religion demands, except that he did not slay or sacrifice any victim; then after weeping and in an access of emotion, he delivered himself of the following apostrophe in their midst: <br />Ye <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=ethnic long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretrians</a>, who by the lot of fortune have been brought hither, ye, even if ye are far from your own land, have at least received burial; but those who cast you hither perished unburied round the shores of your island ten years after yourself; for the gods brought about this calamity in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381245RHol class=place long=24.46 lat=38.14>Hollows</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a>. <br />And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> at the end of his letter to the sophist writes as follows: I also attended, O <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelianus</a>, to your <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=ethnic long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretrians</a>, while I was still a young man; and I gave what help I could both to their dead and their living.

The fortifications of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> extend 480 stadia and form a complete circle, and its wall is three half plethrons high, but less than a plethron [ 1] in breadth. And it is cut asunder by the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>, into halves of similar shape; and there passes underneath the river an extraordinary bridge which joins together by an unseen passage the palaces on either bank. For it is said that a woman, <a href=/people/165 target=_blank>Medea</a>, was formerly queen of those parts, who spanned the river underneath in a manner in which no river was ever bridged before; for she got stones, it is said, and copper and pitch and all that men have discovered for use in masonry under water, and she piled these up along the banks of the river. Then she diverted the stream into lakes; and as soon as the river was dry, she dug down two fathoms, and made a hollow tunnel, which she caused to debouch into the palaces on either bank like a subterranean grotto; and she roofed it on a level with the bed of the stream. The foundations were thus made stable, and also the walls of the tunnel; but as the pitch required water in order to set as hard as stone, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> was let in again on the roof while still soft, and so the junction stood solid. And the palaces are roofed with bronze, and a glitter goes off from them; but the chambers of the women and of the men and the porticos are adorned partly with silver, and partly with golden tapestries or curtains, and partly with solid gold in the form of pictures; but the subjects embroidered on the stuffs are taken by them from Hellenic story, Andromedas being represented, and Amymonae, and you see <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a> frequently. And they delight in <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>, perhaps out of regard for his peaked cap and breeches, for it cannot be for his music or the songs with which he charmed and soothed others. And woven into the pattern you perceive <a href=/people/1263 target=_blank>Datis</a> tearing up <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=place long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxos</a> out of the sea, and <a href=/people/1879 target=_blank>Artaphernes</a> beleaguering <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=place long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretria</a>, and such battles of <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> as he said he won. For there is, of course, the occupation of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388225FThe class=place long=22.536 lat=38.795>Thermopylae</a>, and other pictures still more to the <a href=/people/538 target=_blank>Median</a> taste, such as rivers drained from off the land and a bridge over the sea and the piercing of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402243LAth class=place long=24.327 lat=40.158>Athos</a>. But they say that they also visited a man's apartment of which the roof had been carried up in the form of a dome, to resemble in a manner the heavens, and that it was roofed with lapis lazuli, a stone that is very blue and like heaven to the eye; and there were images of the gods, which they worship, fixed aloft, and looking like golden figures shining out of the ether. And it is here that the king gives judgment, and golden wrynecks are hung from the ceiling, to remind him of <a href=/people/1436 target=_blank>Adrastea</a>, the goddess of justice, and to engage him not to exalt himself above humanity. These figures the <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magi</a> themselves say they arranged; for they have access to the palace, and they call them the tongues of the gods. </p>                        </div>

Now an ambassador coming from the Roman Emperor has not this ceremony imposed upon him, but anyone who comes from the barbarians or just to look at the country, is arrested with dishonor unless he has first paid his respect to this image. Such are the silly duties committed to satraps among the barbarians. When therefore <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> saw the image, he said: Who is that? And on being told that it was the king, he said: This king whom you worship would acquire a great boon, if I merely recommended him as seeming honorable and good to me. And with these words he passed through the gate. But the satrap was astonished, and followed him, and taking hold of his hand, he asked him through an interpreter his name and his family and what was his profession and why he came thither; and he wrote down the answers in a book and also a description of his dress and appearance, and ordered him to wait there. </p>                        </div>

They bade him bring him along, and show him respect without using any violence; and when he came the head of the department asked him what induced him to flout the king, and he answered: I have not yet flouted him. But would you flout him? was the next question. Why, of course I will, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, if on making his acquaintance I find him to be neither honorable nor good. Well, and what presents do you bring for him? <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> answered afresh that he brought courage and justice and so forth. Do you mean, said the other, to imply that the king lacks these qualities? No, indeed, he answered, but I would fain teach him to practice them, in case he possesses them. And surely it was by practicing these qualities, said the other, that he has recovered the kingdom, which you behold, after he had lost it, and has restored his house, — no light task this nor easy. And how many years is it since he recovered his kingdom? <br />This is the third year since, answered the other, which year began about two months ago. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, then as was his custom, upheld his opinion and went on: O bodyguard, or whatever I ought to call you, <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> the father of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> and <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a> was master of these royal domains, I think, for sixty years, and he is said, when he felt that his end was at hand, to have offered a sacrifice to <a href=/people/194 target=_blank>Justice</a> and to have addressed her thus: “O lady mistress, or whosoever thou art.' This shows that he had long loved justice and desired her, but as yet knew her not, nor deemed that he had won her; he brought up his two sons so foolishly that they took up arms against one another, and one was wounded and the other killed by his fellow. Well, here is a king perhaps who does not even know how to keep his seat on the throne, and you would have me believe that he combines already all virtues, and you extol him, though, if he does turn out fairly good, it is you and not I that will gain thereby. <br />The barbarian then glanced at his neighbor and said: Here is a windfall! “tis one of the gods who has brought this man here; for as one good man associating with another improves him, so he will much improve our king, and render him more temperate and gracious; for these qualities are conspicuous in this man. They accordingly ran into the palace and told everybody the good news, that there stood at the king's gates a man who was wise and a <a href=/people/1290 target=_blank>Hellene</a>, and a good counselor. </p>                        </div>

Now my own system of wisdom is that of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, a man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=person long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>, who taught me to worship the gods in the way you see, and to be aware of them whether they are seen or not seen, and to be frequent in my converse with them, and to dress myself in this land-wool; for it was never worn by <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, but is the spotless product of spotless parents, the gift of water and of earth, namely linen. And the very fashion of letting my hair grow long, I have learnt from <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> as part of his discipline, and also it is a result of his wisdom that I keep myself pure from animal food. I cannot therefore become either for you or for anybody else a companion in drinking or an associate in idleness and luxury; but if you have problems of conduct that are difficult and hard to settle, I will furnish you with solutions, for I not only know matters of practice and duty, but I even know them beforehand. Such was the conversation which <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> declares the sage to have held; and <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> himself composed a letter containing them, and has sketched out in his epistles much else of what he said in conversation. </p>                        </div>

Why no, answered the king, unless I had a house to live in that was big enough to accommodate not only my escort and bodyguard, but myself as well, in a handsome manner. Then, said the other, I may use the same argument to you; for if I am housed above my rank, I shall be ill at ease, for superfluity distresses wise men more than deficiency distresses you. Let me therefore be entertained by some private person who has the same means as myself, and I will visit with you as often as you like. The king conceded this point, lest he should be betrayed into doing anything that might annoy him, and <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> took up his quarters with a gentleman of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> of good character and besides high-minded. But before he had finished dinner one of the eunuchs presented himself and addressed him thus: The king, he said, bestows upon you ten presents, and leaves you free to name them; but he is anxious that you should not ask for small trifles, for he wishes to exhibit to you and to us his generosity. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> commended the message, and asked: Then when am I to ask for them? And the messenger replied: To-morrow, and at once went off to all the king's friends and kinsmen and bade them be present when the sage should prefer his demand and receive the honor. But <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> says that he expected him to ask for nothing, because he had studied his character and knew that he offered to the gods the following prayer: O ye gods, grant unto me to have little and to want nothing. However, as he saw him much preoccupied and, as it were, brooding, he determined that he was going to ask and anxiously turning over in his mind, what he should ask. But at eventide: <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, I am thinking over with myself the question of why the barbarians have regarded eunuchs as men sufficiently chaste to be allowed the free entry of the women's apartments. But, answered the other, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, a child could tell you. For inasmuch as the operation has deprived them of the faculty, they are freely admitted into those apartments, no matter how far their wishes may go. But do you suppose the operation has removed their desires or the further aptitude? Both, replied <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, for if you extinguish in a man the unruly member that lashes the body to madness, the fit of passion will come on him no more. After a brief pause, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said: To-morrow, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, you shall learn that even eunuchs are liable to fall in love, and that the desire which is contracted through the eyes is not extinguished in them, but abides alive and ready to burst into a flame; for that will occur which will refute your opinion. And even if there were really any human art of such tyrannical force that it could expel such feelings from the heart, I do not see how we could ever attribute to them any chastity of character, seeing that they would have no choice, having been by sheer force and artificially deprived of the faculty of falling in love. For chastity consists in not yielding to passion when the longing and impulse is felt, and in the abstinence which rises superior to this form of madness. Accordingly <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> answered and said: Here is a thing that we will examine another time, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>; but we had better consider now that answer you can make to-morrow to the king's magnificent offer. For you will perhaps ask for nothing at all, but you should be careful and be on your guard lest you should seem to decline any gift the king may offer, as they say, out of mere empty pride, for you see the land that you are in and that we are wholly in his power. And you must be on your guard against the accusation of treating him with contempt, and understand, that although we have sufficient means to carry us to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, yet what we have will not be sufficient to bring us back thence, and we have no other supply to fall back upon. </p>                        </div>

Moreover they tell of how <a href=/people/670 target=_blank>Eudoxus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=person long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidus</a> once arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and both admitted that he had come there in quest of money, and conversed with the king about the matter. And not to take away more characters, they say that <a href=/people/661 target=_blank>Speusippus</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, was so fond of money, that he reeled off festal songs, when he romped off to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, in honor of <a href=/people/146 target=_blank>Cassander</a>'s marriage, which were frigid compositions, and that he sang these songs in public for the sake of money. Well, I think, O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, that a wise man runs more risk than do sailors and soldiers in action, for envy is ever assailing him, whether he holds his tongue or speaks, whether he exerts himself or is idle, whether he passes by anything or takes care to visit anyone, whether he addresses others or neglects to address them. And so a man must fortify himself and understand that a wise man who yields to laziness or anger or passion, or love of drink, or who commits any other action prompted by impulse and inopportune, will probably find his fault condoned; but if he stoops to greed, he will not be pardoned, but render himself odious with a combination of all vices at once. For surely they will not allow that he could be the slave of money, unless he was already the slave of his stomach or of fine raiment or of wine or of riotous living. But you perhaps imagine that it is a lesser thing to go wrong in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> than to go wrong at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> or at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympian</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> games; and you do not reflect that a wise man finds Hellas everywhere, and that a sage will not regard or consider any place to be a desert or barbarous, because he, at any rate, lives under the eyes of virtue, and although he only sees a few men, yet he is himself looked at by ten thousand eyes. Now if you came across an athlete, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, one of those who practice and train themselves in wrestling and boxing, surely you would require him, in case he were contending in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> games, or went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a>, to be both noble in character and good; nay, more, of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378227SNem class=demonym long=22.7108 lat=37.8085>Nemean</a> contest were going on, you would require him to take care of his physique, because these games are famous and the race-courses are made much of in Hellas; would you then, if <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> were sacrificing with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> rites after capturing certain cities, or if his son <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> were holding games to celebrate his victories, tell the man forthwith to neglect the training of his body and to leave off being keen to win, because the contest was to be held in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403234POly class=place long=23.354 lat=40.2963>Olynthus</a> or in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> or in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, rather than among the Hellenes, and on your native race-courses?

Accordingly he sacrificed and offered his prayer, and then departed, and everyone looked at him and wondered at his bearing. And when he had come within, the king said: I present you with ten gifts, because I consider you such a man as never before has come hither from Hellas. And he answered and said: I will not, O king, decline all your gifts; but there is one which I prefer to may tens of gifts, and for that I will most eagerly solicit.

The king then consented and said: The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=ethnic long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretrians</a> were, until yesterday, the enemies of myself and of my fathers; for they once took up arms against us, and they have been neglected in order that their race might perish; but henceforth they shall be written among my friends, and they shall have, as a satrap, a good man who will judge their country justly. But why, he said, will you not accept the other nine gifts? Because, he answered, I have not yet, O king, made any friends here. And do you yourself require nothing? said the king. Yes, he said, I need dried fruits and bread, for that is a repast which delights me and which I find magnificent. </p>                        </div>

And in fact an eunuch had been caught misbehaving with one of the royal concubines just as if he were an adulterer. The guards of the harem were now dragging him along by the hair in the way they do royal slaves. The senior of the eunuchs accordingly declared that he had long before noticed he had an affection for this particular lady, and had already forbidden him to talk to her or touch her neck or hand, or assist her toilette, though he was free to wait upon all the other members of the harem; yet he had now caught him behaving as if he were the lady's lover. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> thereupon glanced at <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, as if to indicate that the argument they had conducted on the point that even eunuchs fall in love, was now demonstrated to be true; but the king remarked to the bystanders: Nay, but it is disgraceful, gentlemen, that, in the presence of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, we should be enlarging on the subject of chastity rather than he. What then, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, do you urge us to do with him? Why, to let him live, of course, answered <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> to the surprise of them all. Whereon the king reddened, and said: Then you do not think he deserves to die may times for thus trying to usurp my rights? Nay, but my answer, O king, was suggested not by any wish to condone his offense, but rather to mete out to him a punishment which will wear him out. For if he lives with this disease of impotence on him, and can never take pleasure in eating or drinking, nor in the spectacles which delight you and your companions, and if his heart will throb as he often leaps up in his sleep, as they say is particularly the case of people in love, — is there any form of consumption so wasting as this, any form of hunger so likely to enfeeble his bowels? Indeed, unless he be one of those who are ready to live at any price, he will entreat you, O king, before long even to slay him, or he will slay himself, deeply deploring that he was not put to death straight away this very day. Such was the answer rendered on this occasion by <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, one so wise and humane, that the king was moved by it to spare the life of his eunuch. </p>                        </div>

And on one occasion the governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> sent a mission about two villages, which, I think, are close to the Bridge, alleging that these villages had long ago been subject to <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> and <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>, but at present they were under his sway, and belonged to the Romans, and that, whereas the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a> did not disturb these villages, yet the king had traversed so great a distance in order to exploit them, as if they belonged to himself, rather than to the Romans. The king sent the embassy aside, and said: O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, these villages were given to my forefathers by the kings whom I mentioned, that they might sustain the wild animals, which are taken by us in our country and sent to theirs across the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>, and they, as if they had forgotten this fact, have espoused a policy that is new and unjust. What then do you think are the intentions of the embassy? <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> replied: Their attention, O king, is moderate and fair, seeing that they only desire to obtain from you, with your consent, places which, as they are in their territory, they can equally well retain without it. And he added his opinion that it was a mistake to quarrel with the Romans over villages so paltry that probably bigger ones were owned even by private individuals; he also said that it was a mistake to go to war even over large issues. And when the king was ill he visited him, and discoursed so weightily and in such a lofty strain of the soul, that the king recovered, and said to his courtiers, that <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> had so wrought upon him that he now felt a contempt, not only for his kingdom, but also for death. </p>                        </div>

And when the revenues from the subject country came in on one occasion in great quantities at once, the king opened his treasury and showed his wealth to the sage, to induce him to fall in love with wealth; but he admired nothing that he saw and said: This, for you, O king, represents wealth, but to me it is mere chaff. How, then, said the other, and in what manner can I best make use of it? By spending it, he said, for you are king. </p>                        </div>

The king then was more than delighted, and said: For you I will to-morrow make their estate enviable and will see that they have been granted great favors; but since you ask for nothing that is mine, I hope you will at least allow these gentlemen to accept from me money and what else they like, and he pointed to <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> and his companions.

Be it so, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, O king: for they say that the road is a difficult one for him who is not mounted, and moreover this animal is easily fed and finds his pasture easily where there is no herbage. And, methinks, we must lay in a supply of water also, and take it in bottles, like wine. Yes, said the king, for three days the country is waterless, but after that there are plenty of rivers and springs; but you must take the road over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>, for there you will find plenty of the necessities of life and the country is friendly.

In the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>, said he, if wholly I mistake not. Then when were you lower down than you are now? he asked again, and <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> replied: That's a question hardly worth asking. For yesterday we were traveling through the valley below, while today we are close up to heaven. Then you think, said the other, O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, that our road yesterday lay low down, whereas our road today lies high up? Yes, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, he replied, unless at least I'm mad. In what respect then, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, do you suppose that our roads differ from one another, and what advantage has todays' path for you over that of yesterday? Because, said <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, yesterday I was walking along where a great many people go, but today, where are very few. Well, said the other, O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, can you not also in a city turn out of the main street and walk where you will find very few people? I did not say that, replied <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, but that yesterday we were passing through villages and populations, whereas today we are ascending through an untrodden and divine region: for you heard our guide say that the barbarians declare this tract to be the home of the gods. And with that he glanced up to the summit of the mountain. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> recalled his attention to the original question by saying: Can you tell me then, O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, what understanding of divine mystery you get by walking so near the heavens? None whatever, he replied. And yet you ought, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>. When your feet are placed on a platform so divine and vast as this, you ought henceforth to publish more accurate conceptions of the heaven and about the sun and moon, since you think, I suppose, that you will even lay a rod to them as you stand as close to the heavens here. Whatever, said he, I knew about God's nature yesterday, I equally know today, and so far no fresh idea has occurred to me concerning him. <br />So then, replied the other, you are, O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, still below, and have won nothing from being high up, and you are as far from heaven as you were yesterday. And my question which I asked you to begin with was a fair one, although you thought that I asked it in order to make fun of you. The truth is, replied <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, that I thought I should anyhow go down from the mountain wiser than I came up it, because I had heard, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, that <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384268PKla class=person long=26.7703 lat=38.3614>Clazomenae</a> observed the heavenly bodies from the mountain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386265LMim class=place long=26.4695 lat=38.5885>Mimas</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>, and <a href=/people/263 target=_blank>Thales</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=person long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377271LMyc class=place long=27.0833 lat=37.6667>Mycale</a> which was close by his home; and some are said to have used as their observation mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409241LPan class=place long=24.0828 lat=40.9169>Pangaeus</a> and others <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402243LAth class=place long=24.327 lat=40.158>Athos</a>.

Yes, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, said the other, as you have often demonstrated to us. Shall we then, said the other, abstain from the use of a golden drachma and a silver piece, and be proof against temptation by any such coin, although we see not private individuals only, but kings as well, agape for money, and then if anyone offers us a brass coin for a silver coin, or a gilded one and a counterfeit, shall we accept it, merely because it not what it pretends to be, and what the many itch to have? And be sure the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> have coins of orichalcus and black brass, with which, I suppose, all who come the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> haunts must purchase everything; what then? Supposing the nomads, good people as they are, offered us money, would you in that case, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, seeing me decline it, have advised me better and have explained that what is coined by the Romans or by the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a> is really money, whereas this is another sort of stuff polished up among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>? And what would you think of me, if you could persuade me of such things? Would you not think I was a cheat and abandoned my philosophy as thoroughly as cowardly soldiers do their shields? And yet, when you have thrown away your shield you can procure another that is quite as good as the first, in the opinion of <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a>. But how can one who has dishonored and cast away philosophy, ever recover her? And in this case <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> might will pardon one who refuses all wine whatever, but if I chose date wine in preference to that made of grapes, he would be aggrieved, I am sure, and say that this gift had been scorned and flouted. And we are not far away from this god, for you hear the guide saying that the mountain of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000LNys class=place long=33.975 lat=28.539>Nysa</a> is close by, upon which <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> works, I believe, a great many miracles. Moreover, drunkenness, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, invades men not from drinking the wine of grapes alone, for they are equally well roused to frenzy by date wine. Anyhow we have seen a great many <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> overcome by this wine, some of them dancing till they fell, and others singing drowsily, just like the people among us, who end drinking bouts at night and don't go home till dawn. And that you yourself regard this drink as genuine wine, is clear from the fact that you poured out a libation of it to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and offered up the prayers which usually accompany wine. And this, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, is the defense which I have to make of myself against you; for neither do I wish to dissuade you from drinking, nor these companions of ours either; nay, I would allow you also to eat meat; for the abstinence from these things has, I perceive, profited you nothing, though it has profited me in the philosophic profession which I have made from my boyhood. The companions of <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> welcomed this speech and took to their good cheer with a will, thinking that they would find the journey easier if they lived rather better. </p>                        </div>

Well I know that some people will take amiss what I write, because the companions of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> on his campaigns did not write down the truth in reporting this, but I at any rate insist upon the truth, and hold that, if they had respected it more, they would never have deprived <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of the praise due to him in this matter; for, in my opinion, it was a greater thing that he never went up, in order to maintain the sobriety of his army, than that he should have ascended the mountain and have himself held a revel there, which is what they tell you. </p>                        </div>

And when they wondered at the sight, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said: <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, what is the business of a good horseman? Why, what else, he replied, than to sit firm upon the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and then control it, and turn it with the bit, and punish it when it is unruly, and to take care that the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> does not plunge into a chasm or a ditch or a hole, especially when he is passing over a marsh or a clay bog? And shall we require nothing else, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, of a good horseman? said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>. Why, yes, he said, when the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> is galloping up a hill he must slacken the bit; and when he is going down hill he must not let the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> have his way, but hold him in; and he must caress his ears and man; and in my opinion a clever rider is not always whipping, and I should commend any one who rode in this way. And what is needful for a soldier who rides a charger? The same things, he said, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, and in addition the ability to hurl and avoid missiles and to pursue and to retire, and crowd the enemies together without letting his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> be frightened by the rattling of shields or the flashing of the helmets, or by the noise made when the men raise their war-cry and give a whoop; this, I think all belongs to good horsemanship. What then will you say of this boy who is riding on the elephant? He is much more wonderful, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>. For it seems to me a superhuman feat for such a tiny mite to manage so huge an animal and guide it with the crook, which you see him digging into the elephant like an anchor, without fearing either the look of the brute or its height, or its enormous strength; and I would not have believed it possible, I swear by <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, if I had heard another telling it, and had not seen it. Well then, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, if anyone wanted to sell us this boy, would you buy him, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>? Yes, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, he said, and I would give everything I have to possess him. For it seems to me the mark of a liberal and splendid nature, to be able to capture like a citadel the greatest animal which earth sustains, and then govern it as its master. What then would you do with the boy, said the other, unless you bought the elephant as well? I would set him, said <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, to preside over my household and over my servants, and he would rule them much better than I can. And are you not able, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, to rule your own servants? About as able to do so, replied <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, as you are yourself, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>. For I have abandoned my property, and am going about, like yourself, eager to learn and to investigate things in foreign countries. But if you did actually buy the boy, and if you had two <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, one of them a racer, and the other a charger, would you put him, O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, on these <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>? I would perhaps, he answered, upon the racer, for I see others doing the same, but how could he ever mount a war-horse accustomed to carry armor? For he could not either carry a shield, as knights must do; or wear a breast-plate or helmet; and how could he wield a javelin, when he cannot use the shaft of a bolt or of an arrow, but he would in military matters be like a stammerer. Then, said the other, there is, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, something else which controls and guides this elephant, and not the driver alone, whom you admire almost to the point of almost worshipping. <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> replied: What can that be, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>? For I see nothing else upon the animal except the boy. This animal, he answered, is docile beyond all others; and when he has once been broken in to serve man, he will put up with anything at the hands of man, and he makes it his business to be tractable and obedient to him, and he loves to eat out of his hands, in the way little <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> do; and when his master approaches he fondles him with his trunk, and he will allow him to thrust his head into his jaws, and he holds them as wide open as his master likes, as we have seen among the nomads. But of a night the elephant is said to lament his state of slavery, yes by heaven, not by trumpeting in his ordinary way, but by wailing mournfully and piteously. And if a man comes upon him when he is lamenting in this way, the elephant stops his dirge at once as if he were ashamed. Such control, O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, has he over himself, and it is his instinctive obedience which actuates him rather than the man who sits upon and directs him. </p>                        </div>

For indeed they go into battle, saddled with towers big enough to accommodate ten or fifteen <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> all at once; and from these towers the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> shoot their bows and hurl their javelins, just as if they were taking aim from gate towers. And the animal itself regards his trunk as a hand and uses it to hurl weapons. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> elephants are as much bigger as those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, as these are bigger than the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> of <a href=/people/3907 target=_blank>Nisa</a>. And other authorities have dwelt on the age of the animals, and say that they are very long-lived; but our party too say that they came on an elephant near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/337728UTax class=place long=72.8193 lat=33.7462>Taxila</a>, the greatest city in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, who was anointed with myrrh by the natives and adorned with fillets. For, they said, this elephant was one of those who fought on the side of <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> against <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; and, as it had made a brave fight, <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> dedicated it to the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>. And it had, they say, gold rings around its tusks or horns, whichever you call them, and an inscription was on them written in Greek, as follows: <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the son of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> dedicates Ajax to the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>. For he had given this name to the elephant, thinking so great an animal deserved a great name. And the natives reckoned that 350 years had elapsed since the battle, without taking into account how old the elephant was when he went into battle. </p>                        </div>

And when night interrupted the fray the animals which were so marked had, he says, got the worst of it, and fled into Mount <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a>; but he himself 400 years afterwards caught one of the fugitives and found the cavity of the stamp still fresh on the tusk and not yet worn away by time. This <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a> is of opinion that the tusks are horns, because they grow just where the temples are, and there is no grinding of one upon another, and they remain as they grew and do not, like teeth, fall out and then grow afresh. But I cannot accept this view; for horns, if not all, at any rate those of stags, do fall out and grow afresh, but the teeth, although in the case of men those which may fall out, will every one of them grow again, on the other hand there is not a single animal whose tusk or <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-tooth falls out naturally, nor in which, when it has fallen out, it will come again. For nature implants these tusks in their jaws for the sake of defense. And moreover, a circular ridge is formed year by year at the base of the horns, as we see in the case of <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> and <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>; but a tusk grows out quite smooth, and unless something breaks it, it always remains so, for it consists of a material and substance as hard as stone. Moreover the carrying of horns is confined to animals with cloven hoofs, but this animal has five nails and the foot branches into more toes than two, and since these are not squeezed into a hoof, the elephant has a pliable sole. And in the case of all animals that have horns, nature supplies cavernous bones and causes the horn to grow from outwards, whereas she makes the elephant tusk full and equally massive throughout; and when in the lathe you lay bare the interior, you find a very thin tube piercing the center of it, as is the case with teeth. Now the tusks of the marsh elephants are dark in color and porous and difficult to work, because they are hollowed out into many cavities, and often knots are formed in them which oppose difficulties to the craftsman's tool; but the tusks of the mountain kind, though smaller than these, are pretty white and there is nothing about them difficult to work; but best of all are the tusks of the elephants of the plain, for these are very large and very white and so pleasant to turn and carve that the hand can shape them into whatever it likes. <br />If I may also describe the characters of these elephants; those which come from the marshes, and are taken there, are considered to be stupid and flighty by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>; but those which come from the mountains they regard as vicious and treacherous and, unless they want something, not to be relied upon by man; but the elephants of the plain are said to be good and tractable, and fond of learning tricks; for they will write and dance, and will sway themselves to and fro and leap up and down from the ground to the sound of the pipe. </p>                        </div>

Said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>: No one, O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, has instructed them to do this, but they act of their own instinctive wisdom and cleverness; and you see how, like baggage-porters, they have picked up their young, and have them bound fast on, and so carry them along. I see, he said, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, how cleverly and with what sagacity they do this. What then is the sense of this silly speculation indulged in by those who idly dispute whether the affection that men feel for their young is natural or not, when these very elephants, by their conduct, proclaim that it is so, and that it comes to them by nature? For they have certainly not learnt to do so from men, as have other creatures; for these have never yet shared the life of men, but have been endowed by nature with their love of their offspring, and this is why they provide for them and feed their young. And, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, you need not, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, confine your remarks to elephants; for this animal is only second to man, in my opinion, in understanding and foresight; but I am thinking rather of bears, for they are the fiercest of all animals, and yet they will do anything for their whelps; and also of <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a>, among which, although they are so addicted to plunder, yet the female protects its young ones, and the male brings her food in order to save the life of the whelps. And I also equally have in mind the panther, which, from the warmth of its temperament, delights to become a mother, for that is the time when it is determined to rule the male and be mistress of the household; and the male puts up with anything and everything from her, subordinating everything to the welfare of the offspring. And there is also told a story of the lioness, how she will make a lover of the panther and receive him in the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>'s lair in the plain; but when she is going to bring forth her young she flees into the mountains to the haunts of the panthers; for she brings forth young ones that are spotted, and that is why she hides her young and nurses them in winding thickets, pretending that she is spending the day out hunting. For if the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> detected the trick, he would tear the whelps in pieces and claw her offspring as illegitimate. You have read not doubt, also, of one of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a>, and of how he made himself look terrible in behalf of his own whelps and steeled himself to do battle for them. And they say the tigress, although she is the cruelest animal, will in this country and also on the Read Sea approach the ships, to demand back her whelps; and if she gets them back, she goes off mightily delighted; but if the ships sail away, they say that she howls along the sea-coast and sometimes dies outright. And who does not know the ways of birds, how that the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> and the storks will not build their nests until they have fixed in them, the one an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>-stone, and other a stone of light, to help the hatching out of the eggs and to drive away the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a>. And if we look at creatures in the sea, we need not wonder at the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphins</a> loving their offspring, for they are superior creatures; but shall we not admire the whales and seals and the viviparous species? For I once saw a seal that was kept shut up at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358368PAeg class=place long=35.788 lat=36.769>Aegae</a> in the circus, and she mourned so deeply for her whelp, which had died after being born in confinement, that she refused food for three days together, although she is the most voracious of animals. And the whale takes up its young ones into the cavities of its throat, whenever it is fleeing from a creature stronger than itself. And a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>viper</a> has been seen licking the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a> which it had borne, and caressing them with her tongue, which she shoots out for the purpose. But we need not entertain, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, the silly story that the young of <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>vipers</a> are brought into the world without mothers; for that is a thing which is consistent neither with nature nor with experience. <br /><a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> then resumed the conversation by saying: You will allow me then to praise <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, for this iambic line which he puts into the mouth of <a href=/people/902 target=_blank>Andromache</a>: <br />'And in the case of all men, then, their life lay in their children.' <br />I admit, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, that that is said cleverly and divinely; but much cleverer and truer would have been the verse, if it had included all animals. Then you would like, said <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, to rewrite the line so that we might sing it as follows: <br />'And in the case of all animals, then, their life lay in their children.' <br />and I agree with you, for it is better so. </p>                        </div>

Why certainly, he replied, we did say so, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>; for if intelligence did not govern this animal, neither would it subsist, nor the populations among which it lived. Why then, said <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, do they conduct their passage over the river in a way so stupid and inconvenient to themselves? For as you see, the smallest one is leading the way, and he is followed by a slightly larger one, then comes another still larger than he, and the biggest ones come last of all. But surely they ought to travel in the opposite fashion, and make the biggest ones a wall and rampart in front of themselves. But, replied <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, in the first place they appear to be running away from men who are pursuing them, and whom we shall doubtless come across, as they follow the animals' tracks; and they must and ought to use their best strength to fortify their rear against attack, as is done in war; so that you may regard this maneuver as tactically excellent on the part of the brutes. Secondly, as they are crossing a river, if their biggest ones went first, that would not enable the rest of the herd to judge whether the water is shallow enough for all to pass; for the tallest ones would find the passage practicable and easy, but the others would find it dangerous and difficult, because they would not rise above the level of the stream. But the fact that the smallest is able to get across is a sign in itself to the rest that there is no difficulty. And moreover, if the bigger ones went in first, they would deepen the river for the small ones, for the mud is forced to settle down into ruts and trenches, owing to the heaviness of the animal and the thickness of his feet; whereas the larger ones are in no way prejudiced by the smaller ones, crossing in front, because they sink in less deeply. </p>                        </div>

For bronze tablets were nailed into each of its walls on which were engraved the exploits of <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> and <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. But the pattern was wrought with orichalcus and silver and gold and black bronze, of elephants, <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, soldiers, helmets, shields, but spears, and javelins and swords, were all made of iron; and the composition was like the subject of some famous painting by <a href=/people/10969 target=_blank>Zeuxis</a> or <a href=/people/1079 target=_blank>Polygnotus</a> and <a href=/people/1424 target=_blank>Euphranor</a>, who delighted in light and shade; and, they say, here also was an appearance of real life, as well as depth and relief.

For when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> was about to cross the river, and some of <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>' advisers wished him to make an alliance with the kings on the other side of the <a href=/people/2053 target=_blank>Hyphasis</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/38898WGan class=place long=89.8009 lat=23.7818>Ganges</a>, urging that the invader would never face a general coalition against him of the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, he replied: If the temper of my subjects is such that I cannot save myself without allies, then for me it is better not to be king. And when someone announced to him that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had captured <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, he remarked, a king but not a man. And when the mule driver had caparisoned the elephant on which he meant to fight, he replied: Nay, I shall carry him, if I prove myself the same man I used to be. And when they counseled him to sacrifice to the river, and induce it to reject the rafts of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, and make it impassable to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, he said: It ill befits those who have arms to resort to imprecation. And after the battle, in which his conduct struck <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> as divine and superhuman, when one of his relations said to him: If you had only paid homage to him after he had crossed, O <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>, you would not yourself have been defeated in battle, nor would so many <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> have lost their lives, nor would you yourself have been wounded, he said: I knew from my report that <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was so fond of glory that, if I did homage to him, he would regard me as a slave, but if I fought him, as a king. And I much preferred his admiration to his pity, not was I wrong in my calculation. For by showing myself to be such a man as <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> found me, I both lost and won everything that day. Such is the character which historians give to this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a>, and they say that he was the handsomest of his race, and in stature taller than any man since the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> heroes, but that he was quite young, when he went to war with <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. </p>                        </div>

Why yes, he answered, if there be any such thing as truth. And what does this art do? It mixes together, replied <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, all the colors there are, blue with green, and white with black, and red with yellow. And for what reason, said the other, does it mix these? For it isn't merely to get a color, like dyed wax. It is, said <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, for the sake of imitation, and to get a likeness of a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, or a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, or a man, or a ship, or of anything else under the sun; and what is more, you see the sun himself represented, sometimes borne upon a four <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> car, as he is said to be seen here, and sometimes again traversing the heaven with his torch, in case you are depicting the ether and the home of the gods. Then, O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, painting is imitation? And what else could it be? said he: for if it did not effect that, it would voted to be an idle playing with colors. And, said the other, the things which are seen in heaven, whenever the clouds are torn away from one another, I mean the <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>centaurs</a> and stag-antelopes, yes, and the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a> too, and the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, what have you got to say about them? Are we not to regard them as works of imitation? It would seem so, he replied. Then, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, God is a painter, and has left his winged chariot, upon which he travels, as he disposes of affairs human and divine, and he sits down on these occasions to amuse himself by drawing these pictures, as children make figures in the sand. <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> blushed, for he felt that his argument was reduced to such an absurdity. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, on his side, had no wish to humiliate him, for he was not unfeeling in his refutations of people, and said: But I am sure, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, you did not mean that; rather that these figures flit through the heaven not only without meaning, but, so far as providence is concerned, by mere chance; while we who by nature are prone to imitation rearrange and create them in these regular figures. We may, he said, rather consider this to be the case, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, for it is more probable, and a much sounder idea. Then, O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, the mimetic art is twofold, and we may regard the one kind as an employment of the hands and mind in producing imitations, and declare that this is painting, whereas the other kind consists in making likenesses with the mind alone. Not twofold, replied <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, for we ought to regard the former as the more perfect and more complete kind, being anyhow painting and a faculty of making likenesses with the help both of mind and hand; but we must regard the other kind as a department that, since its possessor perceives and imitates with the mind, without having the delineative faculty, and would never use his hand in depicting its objects. Then, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, you mean, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, that the hand may be disabled by a blow or by disease? No, he answered, but it is disabled, because it has never handled pencil nor any instrument or color, and has never learned to draw. Then, said the other, we are both of us, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, agreed that man owes his mimetic faculty to nature, but his power of painting to art. And the same would appear to be true of plastic art. But, methinks, you would not confine painting itself to the mere use of colors, for a single color was often found sufficient for this purpose by our older painters; and as the art advanced, it employed four, and later, yet more; but we must also concede the name of a painting to an outline drawn without any color at all, and composed merely of shadow and light. For in such designs we see a resemblance, we see form and expression, and modesty and bravery, although they are altogether devoid of color; and neither blood is represented, nor the color of a man's hair or beard; nevertheless these compositions in monochrome are likenesses of people either tawny or white, and if we drew one of these <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> with a pencil without color, yet he would be known for a negro, for his flat nose, and his stiff curling locks and prominent jaw, and a certain gleam about his eyes, would give a black look to the picture and depict an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> to the eyes of all those who have intelligence. And for this reason I should say that those who look at works of painting and drawing require a mimetic faculty; for no one could appreciate or admire a picture of a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> or of a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>, unless he had formed an idea of the picture represented. Nor again could one admire a picture of <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>, by the painter <a href=/people/1795 target=_blank>Timomachus</a>, which represents him in a state of madness, unless one had conceived in one's mind first an idea or notion of <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>, and had entertained the probability that after killing the flocks in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> he would sit down exhausted and even meditate suicide. But these elaborate works of <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> we cannot, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, regard as works of brass founding alone, for they are cast in brass; so let us regard them as the chefs d'oeuvre of a man who is both painter and brass-founder at once, and as similar to the work of <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a> upon the shield of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, as revealed in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>. For they are crowded together in that work too men slaying and slain, and you would say that the earth was stained with gore, though it is made of brass. </p>                        </div>

And when a satrap, for the great esteem in which he held the monarch, desired to bind on his brow a golden mitre adorned with various stones, he said: Even if I were an admirer of such things, I should decline them now, and cast them off my head, because I have met with <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>. And how can I now adorn myself with ornaments which I never before deigned to bind upon my head, without ignoring my guest and forgetting myself? <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> also asked him about his diet, and he replied: I drink just as much wine as I pour out in libation to the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>; and whatever I take in the chase I give to others to eat, for I am satisfied with the exercise I get. But my own meal consists of vegetables and of the pith and fruit of date palms, and of all that a well-watered garden yields in the way of fruit. And a great deal of fruit is yielded to me by the trees which I cultivate with these hands. When <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> heard this, he was more than gratified, and kept glancing at <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>. </p>                        </div>

Then he took <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> by the hand, and having bidden the interpreter to depart, he said: You will then, I hope, choose me for your boon companion. And he asked question of him in the Greek tongue. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> was surprised, and remarked: Why did you not converse with me thus, from the beginning? I was afraid, said the king, of seeming presumptuous, seeming, that is, not to know myself and not to know that I am a barbarian by decree of fate; but you have won my affection, and as soon as I saw that you take pleasure in my society, I was unable to keep myself concealed. But that I am quite competent in the Greek speech I will show you amply. Why then, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, did you not invite me to the banquet, instead of begging me to invite you? Because, he replied, I regard you as my superior, for wisdom has more of the kingly quality about it. And with that he led him and his companions to where he was accustomed to bathe. And the bathing-place was a garden, a stade in length, in the middle of which was dug out a pool, which was fed by fountains of water, cold and drinkable; and on each side there were exercising places, in which he was accustomed to practice himself after the manner of the Greeks with javelin and quoit-throwing; for physically he was very robust, both because he was still young, for he was only seven-and-twenty years old, and because he trained himself in this way. And when he had had enough exercise, he would jump into the water and exercised himself in swimming. But when they had taken their bath, they proceeded into the banqueting chamber with wreaths upon their heads; for this is the custom of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, whenever they drink wine in the palace. </p>                        </div>

The king then banquets upon a mattress, and as many as five of his nearest relations with him; but all the rest join in the feast sitting upon chairs. And the table resembles an altar in that it is built up to the height of a man's knee in the middle of the chamber, and allows rooms for thirty to dispose themselves around it like a choir in a close circle. Upon it laurels are strewn, and other branches which are similar to the myrtle, but yield to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> their balm. Upon it are served up fish and birds, and there are also laid upon it whole <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> and gazelles and <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a> and the loins of tigers; for they decline to eat the other parts of this animal, because they say that, as soon as it is born, it lifts up its front paws to the rising <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>. Next, the master of ceremonies rises and goes to the table, and he selects some of the viands for himself, and cuts off other portions, and then he goes back to his own chair and eats his full, constantly munching bread with it. And when they all have had enough, goblets of silver and gold are brought in, each of which is enough for ten banqueters, and out of these they drink, stooping down like animals that are being watered. And while they are drinking, they have brought in performers of various dangerous feats, not undeserving of serious study. For a boy, like one employed by dancing-girls, would be tossed lightly aloft, and at the same moment an arrow is aimed at him, up in the air, and when he was a long way from the ground, the boy would, by a tumblers' leap, raise himself above the weapon, and if he missed his leap, he was sure to be hit. For the archer, before he let fly, went round the banqueters and showed them the point of his weapon, and let them try the missile themselves. Shooting through a ring, too, or hitting a hair with an arrow, or for a man to mark the outline of his own son with arrows, as he stands in front of a board, keeps them occupied at their banquets, and they aim straight, even when they are drinking. </p>                        </div>

For I don't imagine that you owe them to teachers, for it is not likely that there are, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, any who could teach it. The king smiled and said: In old days they would ask men who arrived by sea whether they were <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>, so common did they consider that way of living, hard though it is; but so far as I can make out, you Greeks ask your visitors whether they are not philosophers, so convinced you are that everyone you meet with must needs possess the divinest of human attainments. And that philosophy and <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>piracy</a> are one and the same thing among you, I am well aware; for they say that a man like yourself is not to be found anywhere; but that most of your philosophers are like people who have despoiled another man of his garment and then have dressed themselves up in it, although it does not fit them, and proceed to strut about trailing another man's garment. Nay, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, just as robbers live in luxury, well knowing that they lie at the mercy of justice, so are they, it is said, addicted to gluttony and riotous living and to delicate apparel. And the reason is this: you have laws, I believe, to the effect that if a man is caught forging money, he must die, and the same if anyone illegally enrolls a child upon the register, or there is some penalty, I know not what; but people who utter counterfeit philosophy or corrupt her are not, I believe, restrained among you by any law, nor is there any authority set to suppress them. </p>                        </div>

And by pure I mean, firstly, in respect of his parentage, that no disgraceful deed can be proved against either his father or his mother; next that their parents in turn, and the third generation upwards, are equally pure, that there was no ruffian among them, no debauchee, nor any unjust usurer. And when no scar or reproach can be proved against them, nor any other stain whatever, then it is time narrowly to inspect the young man himself and test him, to see firstly, whether he has a good memory, and secondly, whether he is modest and reserved in disposition, and does not merely pretend to be so, whether he is addicted to drink, or greed, or a quack, or a buffoon, or rash, or abusive, to see whether he is obedient to his father, to his mother, to his teachers, to his school-masters, and above all, if he makes no bad use of his personal attractions. The particulars then of his parents and of their progenitors are gathered from witnesses and from the public archives. For whenever an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> dies, there visits his house a particular authority charged by the law to make a record of him, and of how he lived. And if this officer lies or allows himself to be deceived, he is condemned by the law and forbidden ever to hold another office, on the ground that he has counterfeited a man's life. But the particulars of the youths themselves are duly learnt by inspection of them. For in many cases a man's eyes reveal the secrets of his character, and in many cases there is material for forming a judgment and appraising his value in his eyebrows and cheeks, for from these features the dispositions of people can be detected by wise and scientific men, as images are seen in a looking-glass. For seeing that philosophy is highly esteemed in this country, and it is held in honor by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, it is absolutely necessary that those who take to it should be tested and subjected to a thousand modes of proof.

For he was left quite young and two of his relations were appointed guardians in accordance with the laws of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>. But they did not carry on the king's government honestly on his behalf. No, by the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, but so unfairly that their subjects found their regime oppressive and the government fell into bad repute. A conspiracy then was formed against them by some of the magnates, who attacked them and slew them when they were sacrificing to the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>. The conspirators than seized upon the reins of government and took control of the State. Now my father's kinsmen entertained apprehensions of him, because he was not yet sixteen years of age, so they sent him across the <a href=/people/2053 target=_blank>Hyphasis</a> to the king there. And he has more subjects than I have, and his country is much more fertile than this one. This monarch wished to adopt him, but this my father declined on the ground that he would not struggle with fate that robbed him of his kingdom; but he besought to allow him to take his way to the sages and become a philosopher, for he said that this would make it easier for him to bear the reverses of his house. The king however being anxious to restore him to his father's kingdom, my father said: If you see that I am become a genuine philosopher, then restore me; but if not, let me remain as I am. The king accordingly went in person to the sages, and said that he would lie under great obligation to them if they would take care of a youth who had already showed such nobility of character, and they, discerning in him something out of the common run, were delighted to impart to him their wisdom, and were glad to educate him when they saw how addicted he was to learning. Now seven years afterwards the king fell sick, and at the very moment when he was dying, he sent for my father, and appointed him co-heir in the government with his own son, and promised his daughter in marriage to him as she was already of marriageable age. And my father, since he saw that the king's son was the victim of flatterers and of wine and of such like vices, and was also full of suspicions of himself, said to him: Do you keep all this and swill down the whole Empire as your own; for it is ridiculous that one who could not even gain the kingdom which belonged to him should presume to meddle with one which does not; but give me your sister, for this is all I want of yours. So having obtained her in marriage he lived hard by the sage in seven fertile village which the king bestowed upon his sister as her pin-money. I then am the issue of this marriage, and my father after a Greek education brought me to the sages at an age somewhat too early perhaps, for I was only twelve at the time, but they brought me up like their own son; for any that they admit knowing the Greek tongue they are especially fond of, because they consider that in virtue of the similarity of his disposition he already belongs to themselves. </p>                        </div>

But, alas, my good uncle had already taken away the villages, and didn't even leave me the few acres my father had acquired; for he said that the whole of them belonged to his kingdom, and that I should get more than I deserved if he spared my life. I accordingly raised a subscription among my mother's freedmen, and kept four retainers. And one day when I was reading the play The Children of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, a man presented himself from my own country, bringing a letter from a person devoted to my father, who urged me to cross the river <a href=/people/2109 target=_blank>Hydraotes</a> and confer with him about my present kingdom; for he said there was a good prospect of recovering it, if I did not dawdle. I cannot but think that some god set me on reading this drama at the moment, and I followed the omen; and having crossed the river I learnt that one of the usurpers of the throne was dead, and that the other was besieged in this very palace. Accordingly I hurried forward, and proclaimed to the inhabitants of the villages through which I passed that I was the sons of so and so, naming my father, and that I was come to take possession of my own kingdom; but they received me with open arms and escorted me, recognizing my resemblance to my grandfather, and they had daggers and bows, and our numbers increased from day to day. And when I approached the gates the population received me with such enthusiasm that they snatched up torches off the altar of the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> and came before the gates and escorted me hither with many hymns in praise of my father and grandfather.

Those were the <a href=/people/3919 target=_blank>Oxydracae</a>, he said, and a race that has always been independent and well equipped for war; and they assert that they deal in wisdom, though they know nothing of value.

But if he had crossed the <a href=/people/2053 target=_blank>Hyphasis</a>, and had been able to take the surrounding country, he could certainly never have taken possession of their castle in which they live, not even if he had had ten thousand like <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, and thirty thousand like <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> behind him; for they do not do battle with those who approach them, but they repulse them with prodigies and thunderbolts which they send forth, for they are holy men and beloved of the gods.

It was on that occasion, they say, that <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> lost his golden shield, and the sages dedicated it as an offering, partly out of respect for <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>' reputation, and partly because of the reliefs upon the shield.

For, he said, I don't imagine you are asleep, since you drink water and despise wine. Said the other: Then you don't think that those who drink water go to sleep? Yes, said the king, they sleep, but with a very light sleep, which just sits upon the tips of their eyelids, as we say, but not upon their minds. Nay with both do they sleep, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, and perhaps more with the mind than with the eyelids. For unless the mind is thoroughly composed, the eyes will not admit of sleep either. For note how madmen are not able to go to sleep because their mind leaps with excitement, and their thoughts run coursing hither and thither, so that their glances are full of fury and morbid impulse, like those of the dragons who never sleep. Since then, O king, he went on, we have clearly intimated the use and function of sleep, and what it signifies for men, let us examine whether the drinker of water need sleep less soundly than the drunkard. Do not quibble, said the king, for if you put forward the case of a drunkard, he, I admit, will not sleep at all, for his mind is in a state of revel, and whirls him about and fills him with uproar. All, I tell you, who try to go to sleep when in drink seem to themselves to be rushed up on the roof, and then to be dashed down to the ground, and to fall into a whirl, as they say happened to <a href=/people/729 target=_blank>Ixion</a>. Now I do not put the case of a drunkard, but of a man who has merely drunk wine, but remains sober; I wish to consider whether he will sleep, and how much better he will sleep than a man who drinks no wine. </p>                        </div>

I see it is so, said <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, and perhaps this is what is meant by the phrase “catching a Tartar'. But the argument excites me very much, of which he has delivered himself; so it is time for you to wake up and finish it. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> then raised his head slightly and said: Well I will prove, out of your own lips and following your own argument, how much advantage we who drink water have in that we sleep more sweetly. For you have clearly stated and admitted that the minds of drunkards are disordered and are in a condition of madness; for we see those who are under the spell of drink imagining that they see two moons at once and two suns, while those who have drunk less, even though they are quite sober, while they entertain no such delusions as these, are yet full of exultation and pleasure; and this fit of joy often falls upon them, even though they have not had any good luck, and men in such a condition will plead cases, although they never opened their lips before in a law court, and they will tell you they are rich, although they have not a farthing in their pockets. Now these, O king, are the affections of a madman. For the mere pleasure of drinking disturbs their judgment, and I have known many of them who were so firmly convinced that they were well off, that they were unable to sleep, but leapt up in their slumbers, and this is the meaning of the saying that “good fortune itself is a reason for being anxious.” <br />Men have also devised sleeping draughts, by drinking or anointing themselves with which, people at once stretch themselves out and go to sleep as if they were dead; but when they wake up from such sleep it is with a sort of forgetfulness, and they imagine that they are anywhere rather than where they are. Now these draughts are not exactly drunk, but I would rather say that they drench the soul and body; for they do not induce any sound or proper sleep, but the deep coma of a man half dead, or the light and distracted sleep of men haunted by phantoms, even though they be wholesome ones; and you will, I think, agree with me in this, unless you are disposed to quibble rather than argue seriously. But those who drink water, as I do see things as they really are, and they do not record in fancy things that are not; and they were never found to be giddy, nor full of drowsiness, or of silliness, nor unduly elated; but they are wide awake and thoroughly rational, and always the same, whether late in the evening or early in the morning when the market is crowded; for these men never nod, even though they pursue their studies far into the night. For sleep does not drive them forth, pressing down like a slave-holder upon their necks, that are bowed down by the wine; but you find them free and erect, and they go to bed with a clear, pure soul and welcome sleep, and are neither buoyed up by the bubbles of their own private luck, nor scared out of their wits by any adversity. For the soul meets both alternatives with equal calm, if it be sober and not overcome by either feeling; and that is why it can sleep a delightful sleep untouched by the sorrows which startle others from their couches. </p>                        </div>

Anyhow, the explains of dreams and visions, those whom the poets call interpreters of dreams, will never undertake to explain any vision to anyone without having first asked the time when it was seen. For if it was at dawn and in the sleep of morning tide, they calculate its meaning on the assumption that the soul is then in a condition to divine soundly and healthily, because by then it has cleansed itself of the stains of wine. But if the vision was seen in the first sleep or at midnight, when the soul is still immersed in the lees of wine and muddied thereby, they decline to make any suggestions, and they are wise. And that the gods also are of this opinion, and that they commit the faculty of oracular response to souls which are sober, I will clearly show. There was, O king, a seer among the Greeks called Amphiaros. I know, said the other; for you allude, I imagine, to the son of <a href=/people/1978 target=_blank>Oecles</a>, who was swallowed up alive by the earth on his way back from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>. This man, O king, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, still divines in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, inducing dreams in those who consult him, and the priests take a man who wishes to consult him, and they prevent his eating for one day, and from drinking wine for three, in order that he may imbibe the oracles with his soul in a condition of utter transparency. But if wine were a good drug of sleep, then the wise Amphiaros would have bidden his votaries to adopt the opposite regimen, and would have had them carried into his shrine as full of wine as leather flagons. And I could mention many oracles, held in repute by Greeks and barbarians alike, where the priest utters his responses from the tripod after imbibing water and not wine. So you may consider me also as a fit vehicle of the god, O king, along with all who drink water. For we are rapt by the nymphs and are bacchantic revelers in sobriety. Well, then, said the king, you must make me too, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, a member of your religious brotherhood. I would do so, said the other, provided only you will not be esteemed vulgar and held cheap by your subjects. For in the case of a king a philosophy that is at once moderate and indulgent makes a good mixture, as is seen in your own case; but an excess of rigor and severity would seem vulgar, O king, and beneath your august station; and, what is more, it might be construed by the envious as due to pride. </p>                        </div>

Yes, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, he said, for there is a risk in this case, too, of one who is a judge straying from the right line. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> felt that what he said was true, and asked him again what the suit was which he had to decide; For I see, he said, that you have given your attention to it and are perplexed what verdict to give. I admit, said the king, that I am perplexed; and that is why I want your advice; for one man has sold to another land, in which there lay a treasure as yet undiscovered, and some time afterwards the land, being broken up, revealed a certain chest, which the person who sold the land says belongs to him rather than the other, for that he would never have sold the land, if he had known beforehand that he had a fortune thereon; but the purchaser claims that he acquired everything that he found in land, which thenceforth was his. And, both their contentions are just; and I shall seem ridiculous if I order them to share the gold between them, for any old woman could settle the matter in that way. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> thereupon replied as follows: The fact that they are quarreling about gold shows that these two men are no philosophers; and you will, in my opinion, give the best verdict if you bear this in mind, that the gods attach the first importance and have most care for those who live a life of philosophy together with moral excellence, and only pay secondary attention to those who have committed no faults and were never found unjust. Now they entrust to philosophers the task of rightly discerning things divine and human as they should be discerned, but to those who merely are of good character they give enough to live upon, so hat they may never be rendered unjust by actual lack of the necessaries of life. It seems then to me, O king, right to weight these men in the balance, as it were, and to examine their respective lives; for I cannot believe that the gods would deprive the one even of his land, unless he was a bad man, or that they would, on the other hand, bestow on the other even what was under the land, unless he was better than the man who sold it. The two claimants came back the next day, and the seller was convicted of being a ruffian who had neglected the sacrifices, which it was his bounden duty to sacrifice to the gods on that land [ 1]; but the other was found to be a decent man and a most devout worshipper of the gods. Accordingly, the opinion of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> prevailed, and the better of the two men quitted the court as one on whom the gods had bestowed this boon. </p>                        </div>

The springs of this river well forth out of the plain, and close to its source its streams are navigable, but as they advance they soon become impossible for boats, because spits of rock alternating with one another, rise up just below the surface; round these the current winds of necessity, so rendering the river unnavigable. And in breadth it approaches to the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, and this is allowed to be the greatest of all the rivers which flow through Europe.

By melting down they make an oil, and from this oil, it appears, there is given off a flame such that nothing but glass can contain it.

The spurs then of the mountain bear the cinnamon tree, which resembles the young tendrils of the vine, and the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> gives sure indication of this aromatic shrub; for if you hold out a bit of cinnamon to a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>, she will whine and whimper after your hand like a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, and will follow you when you go away, pressing her nose against it; and if the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> herd drags her away, she will moan as if she were being torn away from the lotus. But on the steeps of this mountain there grow very lofty frankincense trees, as well as many other species, for example the pepper trees which are cultivated by the apes. Nor did they neglect to record the look and appearance of this tree, and I will repeat exactly their account of it. The pepper tree resembles in general the willow of the Greeks, and particularly in regard to the berry of the fruit; and it grows in steep ravines where it cannot be got at by men, and where a community of apes is said to live in the recesses of the mountain and in any of its glens; and these apes are held in great esteem by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, because they harvest the pepper for them, and they drive the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> off them with <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> and weapons. For the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>, when he is sick, attacks the ape in order to get a remedy, for the flesh of the ape stays the course of his disease; and he attacks it when he is grown old to get a meal, for the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> when they are past hunting stags and wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> gobble up the apes, and husband for their pursuit whatever strength they have left. The inhabitants of the country, however, are not disposed to allow this, because they regard these animals as their benefactors, and so make war against the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> in behalf of them. For this is the way they go to work in collecting the pepper; the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> go up to the lower trees and pluck off the fruit, and they make little round shallow pits around the trees, into which they collect the pepper, carelessly tossing it in, as if it had no value and was of no serious use to mankind. Then the monkeys mark their actions from above out of their fastnesses, and when the night comes on they imitate the action of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, and twisting off the twigs of the trees, they bring and throw them into the pits in question; then the <br /><a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> at daybreak carry away the heaps of the spice which they have thus got without any trouble, and indeed during the repose of slumber. </p>                        </div>

But he learnt afterwards that the soil underneath the well was composed of realgar, but that they regarded the water as holy and mysterious, and no one either drank it or drew it up, but it was regarded by the whole land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> all around as binding in oaths. And near this there was a crater, he says, of fire, which sent up a lead-colored flame, though it emitted no smoke or any smell, nor did this crater ever overflow, but emitted just matter enough not to bubble over the edges of the pit. It is here that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> purify themselves of involuntary sins, wherefore the sages call the well, the well of testing, and the fire, the fire of pardon. And they say that they saw there two jars of black stone, of the rains and of the winds respectively. The jar of the rains, they say, is opened in case the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> is suffering from drought, and sends up clouds to moisten the whole country; but if the rains should be in excess they are stopped by the jar being shut up. But the jar of the winds plays, I imagine, the same role as the bag of <a href=/people/289 target=_blank>Aeolus</a>: for when they open this jar ever so little, they let out one of the winds, which creates a seasonable breeze by which the country is refreshed. And they say that they came upon statues of Gods, and they were not nearly so much astonished at finding <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> Gods as they were by finding the most ancient of the Greek Gods, a statue of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> <a href=/people/2067 target=_blank>Polias</a> and of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253SSan class=person long=25.2666 lat=37.4004>Delos</a> and of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SLmn class=place long=23.73547 lat=37.96844>Limnae</a> and another of him of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370224UAmy class=place long=22.4502 lat=37.0363>Amyclae</a>, and others of similar age.

He may indeed be thought to have here written with too much subtlety; but we have anyhow the account of <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> to effect that they made a practice of sleeping the ground, and that they strewed the ground with such grass as they might themselves prefer; and, what is more, he says that he saw them levitating themselves two cubits high from the ground, not for the sake of miraculous display, for they disdain any such ambition; but they regard any rites they perform, in thus quitting earth and walking with the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, as acts of homage acceptable to the God. Moreover, they neither burn upon an altar nor keep in stoves the fire which they extract from the sun's rays, although it is a material fire; but like the rays of sunlight when they are refracted in water, so this fire is seen raised aloft in the air and dancing in the ether. And further they pray to the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> who governs the seasons by his might, that the latter may succeed duly in the land, so that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> may prosper; but of a night they intreat the ray of light not to take the night amiss, but. to stay with them just as they have brought it down. Such then was the meaning of the phrase of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, that the <a href=/people/6301 target=_blank>Brahmans</a> are upon earth and yet not upon earth. And his phrase fortified without fortifications or walls, refers to the air or vapor under which they bivouac, for though they seem to live in the open air, yet they raise up a shadow and veil themselves in it, so that they are not made wet when it rains and they enjoy the sunlight whenever they choose. And the phrase without possessing anything they had the riches of all men, is thus explained by <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>: All the springs which the Bacchanals see leaping up from the ground under their feet, whenever <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> stirs them and earth in a common convulsion, spring up in plenty for these <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> also when they are entertaining or being entertained. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> therefore was right in saying that people provided as they are with all they want offhand and without having prepared anything, possess what they do not possess. And on principle they grow their hair long, as the <br /><a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> did of old and the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397164PTho class=place long=16.49 lat=39.716>Thurium</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>, as well as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367244PMel class=ethnic long=24.4199 lat=36.7389>Melians</a> and all who set store by the fashions of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>; and they bind a white turban on their heads, and their feet are naked for walking and they cut their garments to resemble the exomis [ 1]. But the material of which they make their raiment is a wool that springs wild from the ground, white like that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=ethnic long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylians</a>, though it is of softer growth, and a grease like olive oil distills from off it. This is what they make their sacred vesture of, and if anyone else except these <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> tries to pluck it up, the earth refuses to surrender its wool. And they all carry both a ring and a staff of which the peculiar virtues can effect all things, and the one and the other, so we learn, are prized as secrets. </p>                        </div>

And as <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> showed astonishment at his gift of prescience, he took pains to add that a single letter was missing in the epistle, namely a delta, which had escaped the writer; and this was found to be the case. Then having read the epistle, he said What do you think of us, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>?  Why, replied the latter, how can you ask, when it is sufficiently shown by the fact that I have taken a Jamey to see you which was never till now accomplished by any of the inhabitants of my country. And what do you think we know more than yourself? I, replied the other, consider that your lore is profounder and much more divine than our own; and if I add nothing to my present stock of knowledge while I am with you, I shall at least have learned that I have nothing more to learn. Thereupon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=person long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> replied and said: Other people ask those who arrive among them, who they are that come, and why, but the first display we make of our wisdom consists in showing that we are not ignorant who it is that comes. And you may test this point to begin with. And to suit his word he forthwith recounted the whole story of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>' family both on his father's and his mother's side, and he related all his life in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358368PAeg class=place long=35.788 lat=36.769>Aegae</a>, and how <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> had joined him, and any conversations that they had had on the road, and anything they had found out through the conversation of others with them. All this, just as if he had shared their voyage with them, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> recounted straight off, quite clearly and without pausing for breath. And when <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> was astounded and asked him how he came to know it all, he replied: And you too are come to share in this wisdom, but you are not yet an adept. Will you teach me, then, said the other, all this wisdom? Aye, and gladly, for that is a wiser course than grudging and hiding matters of interest; and moreover, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, I perceive that you are well endowed with memory, a goddess whom we love more than any other of the divine beings. Well, said the other, you have certainly discerned by your penetration my exact disposition. We, said the other, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, can see all spiritual traits, for we trace and detect them by a thousand signs. But as it is nearly midday, and we must get ready our offerings for the Gods, let us now employ ourselves with that, and afterwards let us converse as much as you like; but you must take part in all our religious rites. By <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, I should be wronging the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>, both of which I have crossed in order to reach you, if I did not feast myself on your rites to the full.

Nay more, the ghost of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/38898WGan class=place long=89.8009 lat=23.7818>Ganges</a> drove them forward on their path, a haunting terror to their multitude, and it did not quit them until they atoned to earth by sacrificing the murderers who had shed the king's blood with their hands. Now this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/38898WGan class=place long=89.8009 lat=23.7818>Ganges</a> it seems, was ten cubits high, and in personal beauty excelled any man the world had yet seen, and he was the son of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/38898WGan class=place long=89.8009 lat=23.7818>Ganges</a>; and when his own father inundated <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, he himself turned the flood into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Red Sea</a>, and effected a reconciliation between his father and the land, with the result that the latter brought forth fruits in abundance for him when living, and also avenged him after death.

He on the contrary set himself to found sixty cities, which are the most considerable of those hereabouts — and I would like to know who would regard the destruction of cities as a better title to fame than the rebuilding of them — and he also repulsed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> who once invaded this land across the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>. Surely it is better to prove yourself a good man by liberating your country than to bring slavery upon a city, and that too on behalf of a woman who probably was never really carried off against her will. And he had formed an alliance with the king of the country, over which <a href=/people/2065 target=_blank>Phraotes</a> now rules, although that other had violated every law and principle of morality by carrying of his wife, he yet did not break his oath, and so stable, he said, was his pledged word, that, in spite of the injury he had suffered, he would not do anything to harm that other. </p>                        </div>

The agents of the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> spied out accordingly a rich cargo which I had on board my ship, and having taken me aside in conversation, asked me what was my share in the freight; and I told them that it was a thousand drachmas, for there were four people in command of the ship. “And,” said they, “have you a house?' “A wretched hut,” I replied, “on the Island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299IPha class=place long=29.8856 lat=31.213>Pharos</a>, where once upon a time <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a> used to live.” “Would you like then,” they went on, “to acquire a landed estate instead of the sea, and a decent house instead of your hut, and ten times as much for the cargo as you are going to get now? And to get rid of a thousand misfortunes which beset pilots owing to the roughness of the sea?' I replied that I would gladly do so, but that I did not aspire to become a <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirate</a> just at a time when I had made myself more expert than I ever had been, and had won crowns for my skill in my profession. However they persevered and promised to give me a purse of ten thousand drachmas, if I would be their man and do what they wanted. Accordingly I egged them on to talk by promising not to fail them, but to assist them in every way. Then they admitted that they were agents of the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>, and besought me not to deprive them of a chance of capturing the ship, and instead of sailing away to the city whenever I weighed anchor thence, they arranged that I should cast anchor under the promontory, under the lee of which the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirate</a> ships were riding; and they were willing to swear that they would not only not kill myself, but spare the life of any for whom I interceded. I for my part did not consider it safe to reprehend them, for I was afraid that if they were driven to despair, they would attack my ship on the high seas and then we would all be lost somewhere at sea; accordingly I promised to assist their enterprise, but I insisted upon their taking oath to keep their promise truly. They accordingly made oath, for our interview took place in a sanctuary, and then I said: “You betake yourselves to the ships of the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> at once, for we will sail away by night.” And they found me all the more plausible from the way I bargained about the money, for I stipulated that it must all be paid me in current cash, though not before they had captured the ship. They therefore went off, but I put straight out to sea after doubling the promontory. This then, said <a href=/people/1186 target=_blank>Iarchas</a>, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, you consider the behavior of a just man? Why yes, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, and of a humane one too! for I consider it was a rare combination of virtues for one who was a mere sailor to refuse to sacrifice men's lives, or to betray the interests of merchants, so rising superior to all bribes of money. </p>                        </div>

In the same way do you recommend on such grounds the rulers whose sway you acknowledge, and after decorating them with such praises as you lavish upon slaves, you send them away, objects, as you imagine, of universal admiration. Nay more, your cleverest poets will not give you leave to be just and good, even if you want to. For here was <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a>, a man who exceeded all men in cruelty, and who enslaved with his navies the inhabitants of continent and islands alike, and yet they honor him by placing in his hand a scepter of justice and give him a throne in <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a> to be umpire of spirits; while at the same time they deny food and drink to <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a>, merely because he was a good man and inclined to share with his friends the immortality bestowed upon them by the Gods. And some of them hang stones over him, and rain insults of a terrible kind upon this divine and good man; and I would much rather that they had represented him as swimming in a lake of nectar, for he regaled men with that drink humanely and ungrudgingly. And as he spoke he pointed out a statue which stood upon his left hand, on which was inscribed the name <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a>. Now this statue was four cubits high, and represented a man of fifty years who was clad in the fashion of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374229RArg class=place long=22.9 lat=37.67>Argolis</a>, though he differed in his cloak, that being like a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a>'s, and he held a cup sufficient at least for one thirsty man and drank your health therefrom, and in the goblet was a liquor, an unmixed draught which frothed and foamed, though without bubbling over the edge of the cup. Now I will presently explain what they consider this cup to be, and for what reason they drink from it. In any case, however, we must suppose that <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a> was assailed by the poets for not giving rein to his tongue, but because he shared the nectar with mankind; but we must not suppose that he was really the victim of the gods' dislike, for, had he been hateful to them, he would never have been judged by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> to be a good man, for they are most religious people and never transgress any divine command. </p>                        </div>

From this remark <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> realized that the king in question was not only inferior to <a href=/people/2065 target=_blank>Phraotes</a> in a few details, but in the whole of philosophy; and as he saw that the sages did not bestir themselves to make any preparations or provide for the king's wants, though he was come at midday, he said: Where is the king going to stay? Here, they replied, for we shall discuss by night the objects for which he is come, since that is the best time for taking counsel. And will a table be laid for him when he comes, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>. Why, of course, they answered, a rich table too, furnished with everything which this place provides. Then, said he, you live richly? We, they answered, live in a slender manner, for although we might eat as much as we like, we are contented with little; but the king requires a great deal, for that is his pleasure. But he will not eat any living creature, for it is wrong to do here, but only dried fruits and roots and the seasonable produce of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> land at this time of year, and whatever else the new year's seasons will provide. </p>                        </div>

And just then the king advanced together with his brother and his son, ablaze with gold and jewels. And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> was about to rise and retire, when <a href=/people/1186 target=_blank>Iarchas</a> checked him from leaving his throne, and explained to him that it was not their custom for him to do so. <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> himself says that he was not present on this occasion, because on that day he was staying in the village, but he heard from <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> what happened and wrote it in his book. He says then that when they had sat down, the king extended his hand as if in prayer to the sages and they nodded their assent as if they were conceding his request; and he was transported with joy at the promise, just as if he had come to the oracle of a God. But the brother of the king and his son, who was a very pretty boy, were not more considered than if they had been the slaves of the others, that were mere retainers. After that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> rose from his place, and in a formal speech bade the king take food, and he accepted the invitation and that most cordially. Thereupon four tripods stepped forth like those of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> Temple, but of their own accord, like those which advanced in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s poem, and upon them were cup-bearers of black brass resembling the figures of <br /><a href=/people/1283 target=_blank>Ganymede</a> and of <a href=/people/170 target=_blank>Pelops</a> among the Greeks. And the earth strewed beneath them grass softer than any mattress. And dried fruits and bread and vegetables and the dessert of the season all came in, served in order, and set before them more agreeably that if cooks and waiters had provided it; now two of the tripods flowed with wine, but the other two supplied, the one of them a jet of warm water and the other of cold. Now the precious stones imported from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> are employed in Greece for necklaces and rings because they are so small, but among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> they are turned into decanters and wine coolers, because they are so large, and into goblets of such size that from a single one of them four persons can slake their thirst at midsummer. But the cup-bearers of bronze drew a mixture, he says, of wine and water made in due proportions; and they pushed cups round, just as they do in drinking bouts. The sages, however, reclined as we do in a common banquet, not that any special honor was paid to the king, although great importance would be attached to him among Greeks and Romans, but each took the first place that he chanced to reach. </p>                        </div>

It is no great compliment you have paid him, answered the king, by saying that he has embraced a mode of life which has denied even to <a href=/people/2065 target=_blank>Phraotes</a> the chance of being a noble man. Thereupon <a href=/people/1186 target=_blank>Iarchas</a> remarked: You must judge more reasonably, O king, both about philosophy and about <a href=/people/2065 target=_blank>Phraotes</a>: for as long as you were a stripling, your youth excused in you such extravagances.

Then the other, by way of checking his pride and muzzling him, said: If you were a philosopher, you would not entertain such fancies.

And remarking that the sages were eighteen in number, he again asked <a href=/people/1186 target=_blank>Iarchas</a>, what was the meaning of their being just so many and no more. For, he said, the number eighteen is not a square number, nor is it one of the numbers held in esteem and honor, as are the numbers ten and twelve and sixteen and so forth. Thereupon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=person long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> took him up and said: Neither are we beholden to number nor number to us, but we owe our superior honor to wisdom and virtue; and sometimes we are more in number than we now are, and sometimes fewer. And indeed I have heard that when my grandfather was enrolled among these wise men, the youngest of them all, they were seventy in number but when he reached his 130th year, he was left here all alone, because not one of them survived him at that time, nor was there to be found anywhere in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> a nature that was either philosophic or noble. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> accordingly wrote and congratulated him warmly on being left alone for four years in his tenure of this throne, but he begged them to cease reproaching the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> for the paucity of their sages.

On the other hand would they not make a mistake; if they had made merit the qualification and chosen them by vote? Yes, a parallel one, for if you are on no account to exceed the number ten, there may more than ten just men, and you will deprive some of the rank which their merits entitle them to, while if on the other hand there are not so many as ten, then none will be thought to be really qualified. Wherefore the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378215REle class=ethnic long=21.5 lat=37.8>Eleans</a> would be much wiser-minded if they allowed the number to fluctuate, merely preserving the same standard of justice. </p>                        </div>

And the king by way of insult answered him: Your very question is worthy of a slave, nevertheless I will answer it: a man who runs away is not only a slave but a bad one to boot, and his master would never run away from him, when he can if he likes both torture and card him. In that case, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, O king, <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> has been proved out of your mouth to have been a slave of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, and like a bad slave to have run away from them; for when he was defeated by them in the naval action in the Straits, he was so anxious about his bridge of boats over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a> that he fled in a single ship. Yes, but he anyhow burned <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> with his own hands, said the king. And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> answered: And for that act of audacity, O king, he was punished as never yet was any other man. For he had to run away from those whom he imagined he had destroyed; and when I contemplate the ambitions with which <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> set out on his campaign I can conceive that some were justified in exalting him and saying that he was <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>; but when I contemplate his flight, I arrive at the conviction that he was the most ill-starred of men. For if he had fallen at the hands of the Hellenes, no one would have earned a brighter fame than he. For to whom would the Hellenes have raised and dedicated a loftier tomb? What jousts of armed men, what contests of musicians would not have been instituted in honor of him?

And when <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> arrived, they sat down together, as they were wont to do, and they allowed <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> to ask questions; and he asked them of what they thought the cosmos was composed; but they replied: Of elements. Are there then four? he asked. Not four, said <a href=/people/1186 target=_blank>Iarchas</a>, but five. And how can there be a fifth, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, alongside of water and air and earth and fire? There is the ether, replied the other, which we must regard as the stuff of which gods are made; for just as all mortal creatures inhale the air, so do immortal and divine natures inhale the ether. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> again asked which of the elements came first into being, and <a href=/people/1186 target=_blank>Iarchas</a> answered: All are simultaneous, for a living creature is not born bit by bit. Am I, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, to regard the universe as a living creature? Yes, said the other, if you have a sound knowledge of it, for it engenders all living things. Shall I then, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, call the universe female, or of both the male and the opposite gender? Of both genders, said the other, for by commerce with itself it fulfills the role both of mother and father in bringing forth living creatures; and it is possessed by a love for itself more intense than any separate being has for its fellow, a passion which knits it together into harmony. And it is not illogical to suppose that it cleaves unto itself; for as the movement of an animal dictates the function of its hands and feet, in co-operation with a soul in it by which it is set in motion, so we must regard the parts of the universe also as adapting themselves through its inherent soul to all creatures which are brought forth or conceived. For example, the sufferings so often caused by drought are visited on us in accordance with the soul of the universe, whenever justice has fallen into disrepute and is disowned by men; and this animal shepherds itself not with a single hand only, but with many mysterious ones, which it has at its disposal; and though from its immense size it is controlled by no other, yet it moves obediently to the rein and is easily guided. </p>                        </div>

And he brought forward a poor woman who interceded in behalf of her child, who was, she said, a boy of sixteen years of age, but had been for two years possessed by a devil. Now the character of the devil was that of a mocker and a liar. Here one of the sages asked, why she said this, and she replied: This child of mine is extremely good-looking, and therefore the devil is amorous of him and will not allow him to retain his reason, nor will he permit him to go to school, or to learn archery, nor even to remain at home, but drives him out into desert places. And the boy does not even retain his own voice, but speaks in a deep hollow tone, as men do; and he looks at you with other eyes rather than with his own. As for myself I weep over all this and I tear my cheeks, and I rebuke my son so far as I well may; but he does not know me. And I made my mind to repair hither, indeed I planned to do so a year ago; only the demon discovered himself using my child as a mask, and what he told me was this, that he was the ghost of man, who fell long ago in battle, but that at death he was passionately attached to his wife. Now he had been dead for only three days when his wife insulted their union by marrying another man, and the consequence was that he had come to detest the love of women, and had transferred himself wholly into this boy. But he promised, if I would only not denounce him to yourselves, to endow the child with many noble blessings. As for myself, I was influenced by these promises; but he has put me off and off for such a long time now, that he has got sole control of my household, yet has no honest or true intentions. Here the sage asked afresh, if the boy was at hand; and she said not, for, although she had done all she could to get him to come with her, the demon had threatened her with steep places and precipices and declared that he would kill her son, in case, she added, I haled him hither for trial. Take courage, said the sage, for he will not slay him when he has read this. And so saying he drew a letter out of his bosom and gave it to the woman; and the letter, it appears, was addressed to the ghost and contained threats of an alarming kind. </p>                        </div>

He accordingly told them that for a city to be rightly conducted by its inhabitants, you need a mixture of concord with party spirit; and as this utterance seemed inadmissible and hardly logical, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> realizing that most of them did not follow his argument, added: White and black can never be one and the same, nor can bitter be wholesomely blended with sweet; but concord can be blended with party spirit to secure the safety of the cities. And let us consider my meaning to be somewhat as follows: Far be from your city the factiousness which leads men to draw swords and to stone one another; for in a city we need our children to be brought up properly, and we need laws, and we need inhabitants equally versed in discussion and in deeds. But mutual rivalry between men in behalf of the common weal, and with the object that one should give better advice than another, and that one should discharge better than another the duties of magistrate, and that one should discharge the office of an ambassador or of an aedile more brilliantly than his fellows — here, he said, I think you have a worthy rivalry and a real contention among yourselves in behalf of the common weal. But that one person should practice one thing and another another with a view to benefiting the city seemed of old a foolish thing to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a>, because they only cultivated the arts of war, and because they all strengthened themselves for this end and interested themselves in nothing else; but to me it seems best that each man should do what he understands best and what he best can do. For that city will recline in peace, nay, will rather stand up erect, where one man is admired for his popular influence, and another for his wisdom, and another for his liberal expenditure on public objects, and another for his kindliness, and another for his severity and unbending sternness towards malefactors, and another because his hands are pure beyond suspicion. </p>                        </div>

Because, replied the other, when a great topic suggests itself, which we surely ought rather to be asking about, we are asking questions about these threadbare and antiquated subjects. And what, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, may be this topic which makes you regard all others as superfluous? You have, he answered, had an interview with <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, and probably you have heard him speak at length of many things so far unknown to ourselves; and yet you tell us nothing about these, nor do you describe to us the figure of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, but you fill you conversation with talk of the islands we are sailing round and of ship-building. If you will not accuse me of bragging, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, you shall ear everything. </p>                        </div>

If then we hold the truth, show to us your own form; for you would profit not a little by showing yourself to my eyes, if you should be able to use them to attest your existence.” Thereupon a slight earthquake shook the neighborhood of the barrow, and a youth issued forth five cubits high, wearing a cloak of <br /><a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> fashion; but in appearance he was by no means the braggart figure which some imagine <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> to have been. Though he was stern to look upon, he had never lost his bright look; and it seems to me that his beauty has never received its meed of praise, even though <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> dwelt at length upon it; for it was really beyond the power of words, and it is easier for the singer to ruin his fame in this respect than to praise him as he deserved. At first sight he was of the size which I have mentioned, but he grew bigger, till he was twice as large and even more than that; at any rate he appeared to me to be twelve cubits high just at that moment when he reached his complete stature, and his beauty grew apace with his length. He told me then that he had never at any time shorn off his hair, bit preserved it to inviolate for the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389225WSpe class=place long=22.467 lat=38.856>Spercheus</a>, for this was the river of his first intimacy; but on his cheeks you saw the first down. <br />And he addressed me and said: “I am pleased to have met you, since I have long wanted a man like yourself. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> for a long time past have failed to present their offerings to my tomb, and I do not yet wish to show my wrath against them; for if I did so, they would perish more thoroughly than ever the Hellenes did on this spot; accordingly I resort to gentle advice, and would warn them not to violate ancient custom, nor to prove themselves worse men than the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> here, who though they were robbed of so many of their heroes by myself, yet sacrifice publicly to me, and also give me the tithes of their fruits of season, and olive branch in hand ask for a truce from my hostility. But this I will not grant, for the perjuries which they committed against me will not suffer <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a> ever to resume its pristine beauty, nor to regain the prosperity which yet has favored many a city that was destroyed of old; nay, if they rebuild it, things shall go as hard with them as if their city had been captured only yesterday. In order then to save me from bringing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> polity then to the same condition, you must go as my envoy to their council in behalf of the object I have mentioned.” “I will be your envoy,” I replied, “for the object of my embassy were to save them from ruin. But, O <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, I would ask something of you.” “I understand,” said he, “for it is plain you are going to ask about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> war. So ask me five questions about whatever you like, and that the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> approve of.” I accordingly asked him firstly, if he had obtained burial in accordance with the story of the poets. “I lie here,” he answered, “as was most delightful to myself and <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a>; for you know we met in mere youth, and a single golden jar holds the remains of both of us, as if we were one. But as for the dirges of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> and <a href=/people/590 target=_blank>Nereids</a>, which they say are sung over me, the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, I may tell you, never once came here at all, though the <a href=/people/590 target=_blank>Nereids</a> still resort to the spot.” Next I asked him, if <a href=/people/10611 target=_blank>Polyxena</a> was really slaughtered over his tomb; and he replied that this was true, but that she was not slain by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a>, but that she came of her own free will to the sepulcher, and that so high was the value she set on her passion for him and she for her, that she threw herself upon an upright sword. The third questions was this: “Did <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>, O <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, really come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> or was it <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> that was pleased to make up the story?' “For a long time,” he replied, “we were deceived and tricked into sending envoys to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> and fighting battles in her behalf, in the belief that she was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a>, whereas she really was living in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and in the house of <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a>, whither she had been snatched away by <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a>. But when we became convinced thereof, we continued to fight to win <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> itself, so as not to disgrace ourselves by retreat.” The fourth question which I ventured upon was this: “I wonder,” I said, “that Greece ever produced at any one time so many and such distinguished heroes as <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> says were gathered against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>.' But <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> answered: “Why even the barbarians did not fall far short of us, so abundantly then did excellence flourish all over the earth.” And my fifth question was this: “Why was it that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> knew nothing about <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>, or if he knew him, then kept him out of your story?' “If <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>,' he answered, “never came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, then <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> never existed either. But since this wisest and most warlike hero fell in obedience to <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>' whim, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> does not introduce him into his poems, lest he should have to record the shame of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> in his song.” And withal <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> raised a wail over him as over one who was the greatest and most beautiful of men, the youngest and also the most warlike, one who in sobriety surpassed all others, and had often foregathered with the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. “But you,” he added, “O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, since sages have a tender regard for one another, you must care for his tomb and restore the image of <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> that has been so contemptuously cast aside; and it lies in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390271RAio class=place long=27.1 lat=39>Aeolis</a> close to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394262PMet class=place long=26.1769 lat=39.3692>Methymna</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=place long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbos</a>.'

Now most people neglected the initiation and hung around <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, and thought more of doing that than of being perfected in their religion before they went home; but <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said that he would join them later on, and urged them to attend at once to the rites of the religion, for that he himself would be initiated. But the hierophant was not disposed to admit him to the rites, for he said that he would never initiate a wizard and charlatan, nor open the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235SEle class=demonym long=23.538 lat=38.0411>Eleusinian</a> rite to a man who dabbled in impure rites. Thereupon <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, fully equal to the occasion, said: You have not yet mentioned the chief of my offense, which is that knowing, as I do, more about the initiatory rite than you do yourself, I have nevertheless come for initiation to you, as if you were wiser than I am. The bystanders applauded these words, and deemed that he had answered with vigor and like himself; and thereupon the hierophant, since he saw that his exclusion of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> was not by any means popular with the crowd, changed his tone and said: Be thou initiated, for thou seemest to be some wise man who has come here. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> replied: I will be initiated at another time, and it is so and so, mentioning a name, who will initiate me.

His home was <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer class=place long=19.9156 lat=39.6063>Corcyra</a>, and he traced his pedigree to <a href=/people/1392 target=_blank>Alcinous</a> the <a href=/people/629 target=_blank>Phaeacian</a> who entertained <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> then was talking about libations, and was urging them not to drink out of a particular cup, but to reserve it for the gods, without ever touching it or drinking out of it. But when he also urged them to have handles on the cup, and to pour the libation over the handle, because that is the part at which men are least likely to drink, the youth burst out into loud and coarse laughter, and quite drowned his voice. Then <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> looked up and said: It is not yourself that perpetrates this insult, but the demon, who drives you without your knowing it. And in fact the youth was, without knowing it, possessed by a devil; for he would laugh at things that no one else laughed at, and then would fall to weeping for no reason at all, and he would talk and sing to himself. Now most people thought that it was boisterous humor of youth which led him into excesses; but he was really the mouthpiece of a devil, though it only seemed a drunken frolic in which on that occasion he was indulging. Now, when <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> gazed on him, the ghost in him began to utter cries of fear and rage, such as one hears from people who are being branded or racked; and the ghost swore that he would leave the you man alone and never take possession of any man again. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> addressed him with anger, as a master might a shifty, rascally, and shameless slave and so on, and he ordered him to quit the young man and show by a visible sign that he had done so.

But when the statue began by moving gently, and then fell down, it would defy anyone to describe the hubbub which arose thereat and the way they clapped their hand with wonder. But the young man rubbed his eyes as if he had just woke up, and he looked towards the rays of the sun, and assumed a modest aspect, as all had their attention concentrated on him; for he no longer showed himself licentious, nor did he stare madly about, but he had returned to his own self, as thoroughly as if he had been treated with drugs; and he gave up his dainty dress and summery garments and the rest of his sybaritic way of life, and he fell in love with the austerity of philosophers, and donned their cloak, and stripping off his old self modeled his life and future upon that of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>. </p>                        </div>

And now it seems that the same people are ready to swear to become bacchants and don the thyrsus in behalf of their country; and no one bears a helmet, but disguised as female harlequins, to use the phrase of <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, they shine in shame alone. Nay more, I hear that you turn yourselves into winds, and wave your skirts, and pretend that you are ships bellying their sails aloft. But surely you might at least have some respect for the winds that were your allies and once blew mightily to protect you, instead of turning <a href=/people/208 target=_blank>Boreas</a> who was your patron, and who of all the winds is the most masculine, into a woman; for <a href=/people/208 target=_blank>Boreas</a> would never have become the lover of <a href=/people/2082 target=_blank>Oreithya</a>, if he had seen her executing, like you, a skirt dance. </p>                        </div>

And herein he uttered a prediction of the cutting of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a> which was attempted soon afterwards, when <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> after seven years projected it. For the latter left his imperial palace and came to Hellas, with the intention of submitting himself to the heralds' commands, in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> festivals; and he also won the prize at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230SIst class=place long=22.9932 lat=37.9159>Isthmus</a>, his victories being won in the contest of singing to the harp and in that of the heralds. And he also won the prize for the tragedians at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>. It is said that he then formed the novel project of cutting through the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a>, in order to make a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230ACoC class=place long=22.9686 lat=37.94528>canal</a> of it for ships to sail through and not right round, uniting the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381253WAeg class=place long=25.3 lat=38.1>Aegean</a> with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421170WAdr class=place long=16.95 lat=42.09>Adriatic</a> Sea. So instead of every ship having to round Cape <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364232LMal class=place long=23.198 lat=36.436>Malea</a>, most by passing through the canal so cut could abridge an otherwise circuitous voyage. But mark the upshot of the oracle of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>. They began to dig the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230ACoC class=place long=22.9686 lat=37.94528>canal</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229HLec class=place long=22.8788 lat=37.931>Lechaeum</a>, but they had not advanced more than about four stadia of continuous excavation, when <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> stopped the work of cutting it. Some say because <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> men of science explained him the nature of the seas, and declared that the sea above <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229HLec class=place long=22.8788 lat=37.931>Lechaeum</a> would flood and obliterate the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig class=place long=23.425 lat=37.75>Aegina</a>, and others because he apprehended a revolution in the empire. Such then was the meaning of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>' prediction that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a> would be cut through and would not be cut through. </p>                        </div>

Of him <a href=/people/278 target=_blank>Favorinus</a> in several of his works subsequently made the most generous mention, and his attitude towards <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> was exactly that which they say <a href=/people/436 target=_blank>Antisthenes</a> took up towards the system of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>: for he followed him and was anxious to be his disciple, and was devoted to his doctrines, and converted to the side of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> the more esteemed of his own pupils. Among the latter was <a href=/people/621 target=_blank>Menippus</a> a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=person long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycian</a> of twenty-five years of age, well endowed with good judgment, and of a physique so beautifully proportioned that in mien he resembled a fine and gentlemanly athlete. Now this <a href=/people/621 target=_blank>Menippus</a> was supposed by most people to be loved by a foreign woman, who was good-looking and extremely dainty, and said that she was rich; although she was really, as it turned out, not one of these things, but was only so in semblance. For as he was walking all alone along the road towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230HKen class=place long=22.9925 lat=37.8824>Cenchreae</a>, he met with an apparition, and it was a woman who clasped his hand and declared that she had been long in love with him, and that she was a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> woman and lived in a suburb of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>, and she mentioned the name of the particular suburb, and said: When you reach the place this evening, you will hear my voice as I sing to you, and you shall have wine such as you never before drank, and there will be no rival to disturb you; and we two beautiful beings will live together. The youth consented to this, for although he was in general a strenuous philosopher, he was nevertheless susceptible to the tender passion; and he visited her in the evening, and for the future constantly sought her company as his darling, for he did not yet realize that she was a mere apparition. <br />Then <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> looked over <a href=/people/621 target=_blank>Menippus</a> as a sculptor might do, and he sketched an outline of the youth and examined him, and having observed his foibles, he said: You are a fine youth and are hunted by fine women, but in this case you are cherishing a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>, and a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> cherishes you. And when <a href=/people/621 target=_blank>Menippus</a> expressed his surprise, he added: For this lady is of a kind you cannot marry. Why should you? Do you think that she loves you? Indeed I do, said the youth, since she behaves to me as if she loves me. And would you then marry her? said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>. Why, yes, for it would be delightful to marry a woman who loves you. Thereupon <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> asked when the wedding was to be. Perhaps tomorrow, said the other, for it brooks no delay. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> therefore waited for the occasion of the wedding breakfast, and then, presenting himself before the guests who had just arrived, he said: Where is the dainty lady at whose instance ye are come? Here she is, replied <a href=/people/621 target=_blank>Menippus</a>, and at the same moment he rose slightly from his seat, blushing. And to which of you belong the silver and gold and all the rest of the decorations of the banqueting hall? To the lady, replied the youth, for this is all I have of my own, pointing to the philosopher's cloak which he wore. <br />And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said: Have you heard of the gardens of <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a>, how they exist and yet do not exist? Yes, they answered, in the poems of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, for we certainly never went down to <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>. As such, replied <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, you must regard this adornment, for it is not reality but the semblance of reality. And that you may realize the truth of what I say, this fine bride is one of the vampires, that is to say of those beings whom the many regard as lamias and hobgoblins. These beings fall in love, and they are devoted to the delights of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, but especially to the flesh of human beings, and they decoy with such delights those whom they mean to devour in their feasts. And the lady said: Cease your ill-omened talk and begone; and she pretended to be disgusted at what she heard, and in fact she was inclined to rail at philosophers and say that they always talked nonsense. When, however, the goblets of gold and the show of silver were proved as light as air and all fluttered away out of their sight, while the wine-bearers and the cooks and all the retinue of servants vanished before the rebukes of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, the phantom pretended to weep, and prayed him not to torture her nor to compel her to confess what she really was. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> insisted and would not let her off, and then she admitted that she was a vampire, and was fattening up <a href=/people/621 target=_blank>Menippus</a> with pleasures before devouring his body, for it was her habit to feed upon young and beautiful bodies, because their blood is pure and strong. I have related at length, because it was necessary to do so, this the best-known story of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>; for many people are aware of it and know that he incident occurred in the center of Hellas; but they have only heard in a general and vague manner that he once caught and overcame a lamia in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>, but they have never learned what she was about, nor that he did it to save <a href=/people/621 target=_blank>Menippus</a>, but I owe my own account to <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> and to the work which he wrote. </p>                        </div>

And seeing them to have smooth legs, and sleek hair, and that they did not even wear beards, nay were even dressed in soft raiment, he sent such a letter to the Ephors that the latter issued a public proclamation and forbade the use of pitch plasters in the baths [ 1], and drove out of the city the men who professed to rejuvenate dandies [ 2], and they restored the ancient regime in every respect. The consequence was that the wrestling grounds were filled once more with the youth, and the jousts and the common meals were restored, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemon</a> became once more like herself.

And he also gave them an account of the brazen statue of <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> and explained the attitude of this figure. For this <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> is seen standing on a disk with his two feet close together, and in his left hand he grasps a pomegranate, whole of his right hand the fingers are extended and pressed together as if to pass through a chink. Now among the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a> the story told about this athlete is, that he was so inflexible that he could never be induced to leave the spot on which he stood; and they infer the grip of the clenched fingers from the way he grasps the pomegranate, and that they could never be separated from another, however much you struggled with any one of them, because the intervals between the extended fingers are very close; and they say that the fillet with which his head is bound is a symbol of temperance and sobriety. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> while admitting that this account was wisely conceived, said that the truth was still wiser. In order that you may know, said he, the meaning of the statue of <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>, the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391171PCro class=place long=17.129 lat=39.081>Croton</a> made this athlete a priest of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>. As to the meaning then of this mitre, I need not explain it further than by reminding you that the hero was a priest. But the pomegranate is the only fruit which is grown in honor of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>; and the disk beneath his feet means that the priest is standing on a small shield to offer his prayer to <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>; and this is also indicated by his right hand.

When <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> asked him what he was going to recite, he replied: I have composed a treatise upon <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. And as he said these words he showed, with no little pride at its stoutness, a book which he was carrying under his garments. And, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, what are you going to praise about <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>? Is it the <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> of this fane, and are you going to say that there is nothing like him on the whole earth? <br />Why that, of course, said the other, and a great deal more that comes before that and also follows it. For I shall say how the seasons and how everything on earth and above the earth, and how the winds and all the stars belong to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said: It seems to me that you are a past-master of encomium. Yes, said the other, and that is why I have composed an encomium of gout and of blindness and deafness. And why not of dropsy too, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>; for surely you won't rule out influenza from the sphere of your cleverness, since you are minded to praise such things? And while you are about it, you do as well to attend funerals and detail the praises of the various diseases of which the people died; for so you will somewhat soothe the regrets of the fathers and children and the near relations of the deceased. And as he saw that the effect of his words was to put a bridle on the young man's tongue, he added: My dear author, which is the author of a panegyric likely best to praise, things which he knows or things which he does not? Things which he knows, said the youth. For how can a man praise things which he does not know? I conclude then that you have already written a panegyric of your own father? I wanted to, said the other, but as he appears to me rather a big man and a noble one, and the fairest of men I know, and a very clever housekeeper, and a paragon of wisdom all round, I gave up the attempt to compose a panegyric upon him, lest I should disgrace my father by a discourse which would not do him justice. Thereupon <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> was incensed, as he often was against trivial and vulgar people. Then, said he, <br />you wretch, you are not sure that you can ever sufficiently praise your own father whom you know as well as you do yourself, and yet you set out in this light-hearted fashion to write an encomium of the father of men and of gods and of the creator of everything around us and above us; and you have no reverence for him whom you praise, nor have you the least idea that you are embarking on a subject which transcends the power of man. </p>                        </div>

And he answered: Your question is not one which any <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=person long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a> should put. They asked him also what he thought of their laws, and he replied that they were most excellent teachers, adding that teachers will gain fame in proportion as their disciples are industrious.

A public prosecution, said the other, has been instituted against me, because I go in for seafaring and take no part in public affairs. And was your father or your grandfather a mariner? Of course not, said the other; they were all of them chiefs of the gymnasium and Ephors and public guardians; <a href=/people/1016 target=_blank>Callicratidas</a>, however, my ancestor, was a real admiral of the fleet. I suppose, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, you hardly mean him of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390268IArg class=place long=26.7855 lat=39.007>Arginusae</a> fame? Yes, that fell in the naval action leading his fleet. Then, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, your ancestor's mode of death has not given you any prejudice against a seafaring life? No, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, said the other, for it is not with a view to conducting battles by sea that I set sail. Well, and can you mention any rabble of people more wretched and ill-starred than merchants and skippers? In the first place they roam from sea to sea, looking for some market that is badly stocked; and then they sell and are sold, associating with factors and brokers, and they subject their own heads to the most unholy rate of interest in their hurry to get back to the principal; and if they do well, their ship has a lucky voyage, and they tell you a long story of how they never wrecked it either willingly or unwillingly; but if their gains do not balance their debts, they jump into their long boats and dash their ships on to the rocks, and make no bones as sailors of robbing others of their substance, pretending in the most blasphemous manner that it is an act of God. And even if the seafaring crowd who go on voyages be not so bad as I make them out to be; yet is there any shame worse than this, for a man who is a citizen of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> and the child of forbears who of old lived in the heart of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>, to secrete himself in the hold of a ship, oblivious of <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a> and <a href=/people/751 target=_blank>Iphitus</a>, thinking of nought but of cargoes and petty bills of lading? For if he thinks of nothing else, he might at least bear in mind that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> herself, so long as she stuck to the land, enjoyed a fame reaching to heaven; but when she began to covet the sea, she sank down and down, and was blotted out at last, not only on the sea but on the land as well. The young man was so overcome by these arguments, that he bowed his head to the earth and wept, because he heard he was so degenerate from his fathers; and he sold the ships by which he lived. And when <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> saw that he was restored to his senses and inclined to embrace a career on land, he led him before the Ephors and obtained his acquittal. </p>                        </div>

And he bent his course for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355240PKyd class=place long=24.0187 lat=35.5158>Cydonia</a>, and sailed past that place to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353252PKno class=place long=25.1631 lat=35.2978>Knossus</a>, where a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/351249CLab class=place long=24.9195 lat=35.0752>labyrinth</a> is shown, which, I believe, once on a time, contained the <a href=/people/1317 target=_blank>Minotaur</a>. As his companions were anxious to see this he allowed them to do so, but refused himself to be a spectator of the injustice of <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a>, and continued his course to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/351249UGor class=place long=24.95 lat=35.0594>Gortyna</a> because he longed to visit <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352248LIda class=place long=24.7708 lat=35.2263>Ida</a>. He accordingly climbed up, and after visiting the sacred sites he passed on to the shrine of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/349249PLeb class=place long=24.924 lat=34.932>Lebena</a>. And this is a shrine of <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>, and just as the whole of Asia flocks to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=place long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamon</a>, so the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> flocked to this shrine; and many <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> also cross the sea to visit it, for it faces towards the Libyan sea close to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/351248PPha class=place long=24.8138 lat=35.0512>Phaestus</a>, where the little rock keeps out a might sea. And they say that this shrine is named that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/349249PLeb class=place long=24.924 lat=34.932>Lebena</a>, because a promontory juts out from it which resembles a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>, for here, as often, a chance arrangement of the rocks suggests an animal form; and they tell a story about this promontory, how it was once one of the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> which were yoked in the chariot of <a href=/people/243 target=_blank>Rhea</a>. Here <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> was haranguing on one occasion about midday, and was addressing quite a number of people who were worshipping at the shrine, when an earthquake shook the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> at once, and a roar of thunder was heard to issue not from the clouds but from the earth, and the sea receded about seven stadia. And most of them were afraid that the sea by receding in this way would drag the temple after it, so that they would be carried away. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said: Be of good courage, for the sea has given birth and brought forth land. And they thought that he was alluding to the harmony of the elements, and was urging that the sea would never wreak any violence upon the land; but after a few days some travelers arrived from Cydoniatis and announced that on the very day on which this portent occurred and just at the same hour of midday, an island rose out of the sea in the firth between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364255PThe class=place long=25.477 lat=36.364>Thera</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>.

Now <a href=/people/1054 target=_blank>Philolaus</a> was a polished speaker, but too soft to bear any hardships. He had quitted <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and was virtually a fugitive, and any philosopher he met with he urged to take the same course. He accordingly addressed himself to <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, and urged him to give way to circumstances, and not to proceed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, where philosophy was in such bad odor; and he related to him what had taken place there, and as he did so he kept turning his head round, lest anybody should be listening behind him to what he said. And you, he said, after attaching this band of philosophers to yourself, a thing which will bring you into suspicion and odium, are on your way thither, knowing nothing of the officers set over the gates by <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, who will arrest you and them before ever you enter or get inside. And what, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, O <a href=/people/1054 target=_blank>Philolaus</a>, are the occupations of the autocrat said to be? He drives a chariot, said the other, in public; and he comes forward on the boards of the Roman theaters and sings songs, and he lives with gladiators, and hem himself fights as one and slays his man. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> therefore replied and said: Then, my dear fellow, do you think that there can be any better spectacle for men of education than to see an emperor thus demeaning himself? For if in <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s opinion man is the sport of the gods, what a theme we have here provided for philosophers by an emperor who makes himself the sport of man and sets himself to delight the common herd with the spectacle of his own shame? Yes, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, said <a href=/people/1054 target=_blank>Philolaus</a>, if you could do it with impunity; but if you are going to be taken up and lose your life, and if <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> is going to devour you alive before you see anything of what he does, your interview with him will cost you dear, much dearer than it ever cost <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> to visit the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a> in his home; though he lost many of his comrades in his anxiety to see him, and because he yielded to the temptation of beholding so cruel a monster. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said: So you think that this ruler is less blinded than the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a>, if he commits such crimes?

But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said: Well, of all the blessings which have been vouchsafed to me by the gods, often without my praying for them at all, this present one, I may say, is the greatest that I have ever enjoyed; for chance has thrown in my way a touchstone to test these young men, of a kind to prove most thoroughly which of them are philosophers, and which of them prefer some other line of conduct than that of philosopher. And in fact the knock-kneed among them were detected in no time, for under the influence of what <a href=/people/1054 target=_blank>Philolaus</a> said, some of them declared that they were ill, others that they had no provisions for the journey, others that they were homesick, others that they had been deterred by dreams; and in the result thirty-four companions of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> were willing to accompany him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> were reduced to eight.

I think then that we ought first of all to pray to the gods who have suggested these different courses to you and to them; and then we ought to solicit their direction and guidance, for we have not any succor to rely upon apart from the gods. We must then march forward to the city which is the mistress of so much of the inhabited world; but how can anybody go forward thither, unless the gods are leading him? The more so, because a tyranny has been established in this city so harsh and cruel, that it does not suffer men to be wise. And let not anyone think it foolish so to venture along a path which many philosophers are fleeing from; for in the first place I do not esteem any human agency so formidable that a wise man can ever be terrified by it; and in the second place, I would not urge upon you the pursuit of bravery, unless it were attended with danger. Moreover, in traversing more of the earth than any man yet has visited, I have seen hosts of <a href=/people/275 target=_blank>Arabian</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> wild beasts; but as to this wild beast, which many call a tyrant, <br />I know not either how many heads he has, nor whether he has crooked talons and jagged teeth. In any case, though this monster is said to be a social beast and to inhabit the heart of cities, yet he is also much wilder and fiercer in his disposition than animals of the mountain and forest, that whereas you can sometimes tame and alter the character of <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> and leopards by flattering them, this one is only roused to greater cruelty than before by those who stroke him, so that he rends and devours all alike. And again there is no animal anyhow of which you can say that it ever devours its own mother, but <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> is gorged with such quarry. It is true, perhaps, that the same crime was committed in the case of <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> and <a href=/people/564 target=_blank>Alcmaeon</a>, but they had some excuse for their deeds, in that the father of the one was murdered by his own wife, while the other's had been sold for a necklace; this man, however, has murdered the very mother to whom he owes his adoption by the aged emperor and his inheritance of the empire; for he shipwrecked and so slew her close to land in a vessel built for the express purpose of doing her to death. If, however, anyone is disposed to dread <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> for these reasons, and is led abruptly to forsake philosophy, conceiving that it is not safe for him to thwart his evil temper, let him know that the quality of inspiring fear really belongs to those who are devoted to temperance and wisdom, because they are sure of divine succor. But let him snap his fingers at the threats of the proud and insolent, as he would at those of drunken men; for we regard the latter surely as daft and silly, but not as formidable. Let us then go forward to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, if we are good men and true; for to <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>'s proclamations in which he banishes philosophy, we may well oppose the verse of <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>: <br />'For in no wise was it <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> who made this proclamation unto me,” <br />nor the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> either, nor <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> the god of eloquence. But it may well be that <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> himself knows this iambic line, for he is, they say, addicted to tragedy. <br />This occasion reminds one of the saying of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, that when warriors are knit together with reason, they become as it were a single plume and helmet, and a single shield; and it seems to me that this very sentiment found its application in regard to these heroes; for they were welded together and encouraged by the words of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> to die in behalf of their philosophy, and strengthened to show themselves superior to those who had run away. </p>                        </div>

But at daybreak <a href=/people/2191 target=_blank>Telesinus</a>, one of the consuls, called <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> to him, and said: What is this dress which you wear? And he answered: A pure garment made from no dead matter. And what is your wisdom? An inspiration, answered <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, which teaches men how to pray and sacrifice to the gods. And is there anyone, my philosopher, who does not know that already? Many, said the sage, and if there is here and there a man who understands these matters aright, he will be very much improved by hearing from a man who is wiser than himself that, what he knows, he knows for a certainty. When <a href=/people/2191 target=_blank>Telesinus</a> heard this, for he was a man fairly disposed to worship and religion, he recognized the sage from the rumors which he had long before heard about him; and though he did not think he need openly ask him his name, in case he wished to conceal his identity from anyone, he nevertheless led him on to talk afresh about religion, for he was himself an apt reasoner, and feeling that he was addressing a sage, he asked: What do you pray for when you approach the altars? I, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, for my part pray that justice may prevail, that the laws may not be broken, that the wise may continue to be poor, but that others may be rich, as long as they are so without fraud. Then, said the other, when you ask for so much, do you think you will get it? Yes, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, for I string together all my petitions in a single prayer, and when I reach the altars this is how I pray: “O ye gods, bestow on me whatever is due.” If therefore I am of the number of worthy men, I shall obtain more than I have said; but if the gods rank me among the wicked, then they will send to me the opposite of what I ask; and I shall not blame the gods, because for my demerit I am judged worthy of evil. <a href=/people/2191 target=_blank>Telesinus</a> then was greatly struck by these words, and wishing to show him a favor, he said: You may visit all the temples, and written instructions shall be sent by me to the priests who minister in them to admit you and adopt your reforms. And supposing you did not write, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, would they not admit me? No, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, said he, for that is my own office and prerogative. I am glad, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, that so generous a man as yourself holds such a high office, but I would like you to know this much too about me: I like to live in such temples as are not too closely shut up, and none of the gods object to my presence, for they invite me to share their habitation. So let this liberty too be accorded to me, inasmuch as even the barbarians always permitted it. And <a href=/people/2191 target=_blank>Telesinus</a> said: The barbarians have more to be proud of in this matter than the Romans, for I would that as much could be said of ourselves. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> accordingly lived in the temples, though he changed them and passed from one to another; and when he was blamed for doing so, he said: Neither do the gods live all their time in heaven, but they take journeys to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, as also to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a> and to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402243LAth class=place long=24.327 lat=40.158>Athos</a>, and I think it is a pity that the gods should go roaming around all the nations of men, and yet that men should not be allowed to visit all the gods alike. What is more, though masters would incur no reproach for neglecting slaves, for whom they probably may feel a contempt because they are not good, yet the slaves who did not devote themselves wholly to their masters, would be destroyed by them as cursed wretches and chattels hateful to the gods. </p>                        </div>

Yet he was suspected as I have said, and the suspicion was intensified by words he uttered in connection to a prodigy.

Now the temples were full of people supplicating the gods, because <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> had a swollen throat, and his voice was hoarse. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> vehemently denounced the folly of the crowd, though without rebuking anyone in particular; nay, he even restrained <a href=/people/621 target=_blank>Menippus</a>, who was irritated by such goings on, and persuaded him to moderate his indignation, urging him to pardon the gods if they did show pleasure in the mimes of buffoons. This utterance was reported to <a href=/people/1972 target=_blank>Tigellinus</a>, who immediately sent police to take him to prison, and summoned him to defend himself from the charge of impiety against <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>. And an accuser was retained against him who had already undone a great many people, and won a number of such <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> victories. This accuser too held in his hands a scroll of paper on which the charge was written out, and he brandished it like a sword against the sage, and declared that it was so sharp that it would slay and ruin him. But when <a href=/people/1972 target=_blank>Tigellinus</a> unrolled the scroll, and did not find upon it the trace of a single word or letter, and his eyes fell on a perfectly blank book, he came to the conclusion that he had to do with a demon; and this is said also subsequently to have been the feeling which <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> afterwards entertained towards <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>. <a href=/people/1972 target=_blank>Tigellinus</a> then took his victim apart into a secret tribunal, in which this class of magistrate tries in private the most important charges; and having ordered all to leave the court he plied him with questions, asking who he was. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> gave his father's name and that of his country, and explained his motive in practicing wisdom, declaring that the sole use he had made of it was to gain knowledge of the gods and an understanding of human affairs, for that the difficulty of knowing another man exceeded that of knowing oneself. And about the demons, said <a href=/people/1972 target=_blank>Tigellinus</a>, and the apparitions of specters, how, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, do you exorcise them? In the same way, he answered, as I should murderers and impious men. This was a sarcastic allusion to <a href=/people/1972 target=_blank>Tigellinus</a> himself, for he taught and encouraged in <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> every excess of cruelty and wanton violence. And, said the other, could you prophesy, if I asked you to? How, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, can I, being no prophet? And yet, replied the other, they say that it is you who predicted that some great event would come to pass and yet not come to pass. Quite true, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, is what you heard; but you must not put this down to any prophetic gift, but rather to the wisdom which God reveals to wise men. And, said the other, why are you not afraid of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>? Because, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, the same God who allows him to seem formidable, has also granted to me to feel no fear. And what do you think, said the other, about <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>? And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> answered: Much better than you do; for you think it dignified for him to sing, but I think it dignified for him to keep silent. <a href=/people/1972 target=_blank>Tigellinus</a> was astonished and said: You may go, but you must give sureties for your person. And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> answered: And who can go surety for a body that no one can bind? This answer struck <a href=/people/1972 target=_blank>Tigellinus</a> as inspired and above the wit of man; and as he was careful not to fight with a god, he said: You may go wherever you choose, for you are too powerful to be controlled by me. </p>                        </div>

And the relations of the maiden wanted to present him with the sum of 150,000 sesterces, but he said that he would freely present the money to the young lady by way of dowry. Now whether he detected some spark of life in her, which those who were nursing her had not noticed — for it is said that although it was raining at the time, a vapor went up from her face — or whether her life was really extinct, and he restored it by the warmth of his touch, is a mysterious problem which neither I myself nor those who were present could decide. </p>                        </div>

For in one of his letters to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> he says that the ocean is driven by submarine influences or spirits out of several chasms which the earth afford both underneath and around it, to advance outwards, and to recede again, whenever the influence or spirit, like the breath of our bodies, gives way and recedes. And this theory is confirmed by the course run by diseases in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gadeira</a>; for at the time of high water the souls of the dying do not quit the bodies, and this would hardly happen, he says, unless the influence or spirit I have spoken of was also advancing towards the land.

On one occasion they were sitting in the temple of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> and <a href=/people/621 target=_blank>Menippus</a> gave a laugh, for it happened that <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> had just come to his mind, And what, he said, are we to think of this splendid fellow? In which of the contests has he won wreaths of late? Don't you think that self-respecting Hellenes must shake with laughter when they are on their way to the festivals? And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> replied: As I have heard from <a href=/people/2191 target=_blank>Telesinus</a>, the worthy <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> is afraid of the whips of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378215REle class=ethnic long=21.5 lat=37.8>Eleans</a>; for when his flatterers urged him to win at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a> and to proclaim <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> as the victor, he answered: “Yes, if the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378215REle class=ethnic long=21.5 lat=37.8>Eleans</a> will only not depreciate me, for they are said to use whips and to look down upon me.” And many worse bits of nonsense than this forecast fell from his lips. I however admit that <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> will conquer at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>, for who is bold enough to enter the lists against him? But I deny that he will win at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> festival, because they are not keeping it at the right season. For custom requires that this should have been held last year, but <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> has ordered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378215REle class=ethnic long=21.5 lat=37.8>Eleans</a> to put it off until his own visit, in order that they may sacrifice to him rather than to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. And it is said that he has announced a tragedy and a performance on the harp for people who have neither a theater nor a stage for such entertainments, but only the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216BOSt class=place long=21.63333 lat=37.63924>stadium</a> which nature has provided, and races which are all run by athletes stripped of their clothes. He however is going to take the prize for performances which he ought to have hidden in the dark, for he has thrown off the robes of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> and <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> and has dressed himself up in the garb of an <a href=/people/4061 target=_blank>Amoebeus</a> or a <a href=/people/6983 target=_blank>Terpnus</a>. What can you say of such a record? And then he betrays such a meticulous care in playing the part of <a href=/people/282 target=_blank>Creon</a> and <a href=/people/173 target=_blank>Oedipus</a>, that he is afraid of falling into some error, of coming in by the wrong door, or of wearing the wrong dress, of using the wrong scepter; but he has so entirely forgotten his own dignity and that of the Romans, that instead of carrying on the work of making laws, he has taken to singing, and strolls like a player outside the gates within which the Emperor ought to take his seat on his throne, deciding the fate of land and sea. There are, O <a href=/people/621 target=_blank>Menippus</a>, several troupes in which has inscribed himself as an actor. What next? Supposing any one of these actors quitted the theater after playing <a href=/people/901 target=_blank>Oenomaus</a> or <a href=/people/1142 target=_blank>Cresphontes</a>, so full of his part as to want to rule others, and imagine himself to be a tyrant, what would you say of him? Surely you would recommend a dose of hellebore and the taking of drugs of a kind that clear the intellect? Well, here is the man himself who wields absolute power, throwing in his lot with actors and artists, cultivating a soft voice and trembling before the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=place long=21.374 lat=37.89>Elis</a> or of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>; or if he does not tremble, yet misrepresenting his art so thoroughly as [not] to anticipate he will be whipped by the people over whom he has been set to rule. What will you say of the unhappy people who have to live under such a scum? And in what light do you think the Hellenes regard him? Is it as a <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> burning their houses down or as a <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> singing songs? Think of the supplies they have to collect for his songs, and how they are thrust out of their houses and forbidden to own a decent bit of furniture or slave. Think of how <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> picks out of every other house women and children, to gratify his infamous desires, and of the horrors they will suffer over them, of the crop of prosecutions which will be brought, and without dwelling upon the rest, just fix your attention upon those which will arise out of his theatrical and singing ambitions. This is what you hear: “You did not come to listen to <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>,' or: “You were present, but you listened to him without enthusiasm, “You laughed,” or “You did not clap your hands, “or “You have not offered a sacrifice in behalf of his voice not prayed that it may be more splendid than ever at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> festival.” You can imagine that the Greeks will endure whole Iliads of woe at these spectacles. For I have long ago learned by the revelation of heaven that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a> will be cut through and will not be cut through, and just now, they say, it is being cut. Here <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> took him up and said: As for myself, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, I think this scheme of cutting through the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a> excels all other undertakings of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, for you yourself see how magnificent a project it is. I admit, he said, that it is, O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>; but it will go against him that he never could complete it, that just as he never finished his songs, so he never finished his digging. When I review the career of <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, I am disposed to praise him not because he bridged the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>, but because he got across it; but as for <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, I perceive that he will neither sail his ships through the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a>, nor ever come to an end of his digging; and I believe, unless truth has wholly departed from among men, that he has retired from Hellas in a fit of panic. </p>                        </div>

They greeted one another, and no one knows what they said to one another in an interview from which they excluded the rest of the company; but <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> hazards the opinion that they formed a plot against <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>. For after three days spent in private conversations, the governor went away, after embracing <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, while the latter said: Farewell, and do not forget <a href=/people/1489 target=_blank>Vindex</a>.

For he addressed a speech, inspired by the loftiest sentiments which a man can feel against a tyrant, to the troops which he commanded, and he declared in it that <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> was anything rather than a harpist, and a harpist rather than a sovereign. And he taxed him with madness and avarice and cruelty and wantonness of every kind, though he omitted to tax him with the cruelest of crimes; for he said that he had quite rightly put to death his mother, because she had borne such a monster. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, forecasting how all this must be, had accordingly brought into line with <a href=/people/1489 target=_blank>Vindex</a> the governor of a neighboring province, and so all but took up arms himself in behalf of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. </p>                        </div>

Of the vulgar and stupid interpretations of this prodigy, one was that it signified the impending ruin of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> — for it has three headlands — unless the inhabitants composed their feuds and could live together in peace; for as a matter of fact several of the cities were at variance both with themselves and with one another, and such a thing as orderly life was unknown in the island. Another explanation was that <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a>, a many-headed monster, was threatening <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> with his violence. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said: Go, O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, and look if the child is really made up as they say. For the thing was exposed to public view for the miracle-mongers to exercise their ingenuity upon it. When <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> reported that it was a three-headed creature and of the male sex, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> got together his companions and said: It signifies three emperors of Romans, whom yesterday I called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a>; and not one of them shall enjoy complete dominion, but two of them shall perish after holding sway in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> itself, and the third after doing so in the countries bordering upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; and they shall shuffle off their masks more quickly than if they were tragic actors playing the part of tyrant.

And they say that <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> began the discussion by asking his companions: Is there such a thing as mythology? Yes, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, answered <a href=/people/621 target=_blank>Menippus</a>, and I mean by it that which furnishes poets with their themes. What then do you think of <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>? He is a mythologist and writer of fables and no more. And which set of myths show any wisdom? Those of the poets, he answered, because they are represented in the poems as having taken place. And what then do you think of the stories of <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>? Frogs, he answered, and <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>donkeys</a> and nonsense only fit to be swallowed by old women and children. And yet for my own part, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, I find them more conducive to wisdom than the others. For those others, of which all poetry is so fond, and which deal with heroes, positively destroy the souls of their hearers, because the poet relates stories of outlandish passion and of incestuous marriages, and repeats calumnies against the gods, of how they ate their own children, and committed crimes of meanness, and quarreled with one another; and the affectation and pretense of reality leads passionate and jealous people and miserlike and ambitious persons to imitate the stories. <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> on the other hand had in the first place the wisdom never to identify himself with those who put such stories into verse, but took a line of his own; and in the second, like those who dine well off the plainest dishes, he made use of humble incidents to teach great truths, and after serving up a story he adds to it the advice to do a thing or not to do it. Then, too, he was really more attached to truth than the poets are; for the latter do violence to their own stories in order to make them probable; but he by announcing a story which everyone knows not to be true, told the truth by the very fact that he did not claim to be relating real events. And the poet, after telling his story, leaves a healthy-minded reader cudgeling his brains to know whether it really happened; whereas one who, like <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>, tells a story which is false and does not pretend to be anything else, merely investing it with a good moral, shows that he has made use of the falsehood merely for its utility to his audience. And there is another charm about him, namely, that he puts animals in a pleasing light and makes them interesting to mankind. For after being brought up from childhood with these stories, and after being as it were nursed by them from babyhood, we acquire certain opinions of the several animals and think of some of them as royal animals, of others as silly, of others as witty, and others as innocent. And whereas the poet, after telling us that there are “many forms of heavenly visitation” [1] or something of the kind, dismisses his chorus and departs, <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> adds an oracle to his story, and dismisses his hearers just as they reach the conclusion he wished to lead the up to. </p>                        </div>

Many other people, she said, also resorted to the temple of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> asking for the same gift, and one of them would hang on the altar gold, another silver, another a herald's wand of ivory, and others other rich presents of the kind. Now <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>, she said, was not in a position to own any of these things; but he saved up what he had, and poured a libation of as much milk as a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> would give at one milking in honor of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, and brought a honeycomb and laid it on the altar, big enough to fill the hand, and he thought too of regaling the god with myrtle berries, or perhaps by laying just a few roses or violets at the altar. “For,” said he, “would you, O <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, have me weave crowns for you and neglect my <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>?' Now when on the appointed day they arrived for the distribution of the gifts of wisdom, <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> as the god of wisdom and eloquence and also of gain and profit, said to him who, as you may well suppose, had made the biggest offering: “Here is philosophy for you'; and to him who had made the next handsomest present, he said: “Do you take your place among the orators'; and to others he said: “You shall have the gift of astronomy or you shall be a musician, or you shall be an epic poet and write in heroic metre, or you shall be a writer of iambics.” Now although he was a most wise and accomplished god he exhausted, not meaning to do so, all the various departments of wisdom, and then found that he had quite forgotten <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>. Thereupon he remembered the Hours, by whom he himself had been nurtured on the peaks of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a>, and bethought him of how once, when he was still in swaddling clothes, they had told him a story about the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>, which had a conversation with the man about herself and about the earth, and so set him aflame for the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>. Accordingly he forthwith bestowed upon <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> the art of fable called mythology, for that was all that was left in the house of wisdom, and said: Do you keep what was the first thing I learnt myself. <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> then acquired the various forms of his art from that source, and the issue was such as we have seen in the matter of mythology. </p>                        </div>

And as for the place of the Pious Ones, around whom the fire flowed, we will allow that such exists even here; but at the same time let us not forget that the whole earth affords secure ground for the doers of holiness, and that the sea is safely traversed not only by people in ships but even by people attempting to swim.

When he descended to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Piraeus</a>, he found a ship riding there with its sails set, just about to start for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>; but the owner would not allow him to embark, for he wished to go on a private cruise. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> asked him what his freight consisted of. Of gods, he replied, whose images I am exporting to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>, some made of gold and stone, and others of ivory and gold. And are you going to dedicate them or what? I am going to sell them, he replied, to those who desire to dedicate them. Then you are afraid, my most excellent man, lest we should steal your images on board ship? I am not afraid of that, he answered, but I do not think it proper that they should have to share the voyage with so many people and be defiled by such bad company as you get on board ship. And may I remind you, most worthy man, answered <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, for you appear to me to be an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, that on the ships which your countrymen employed against the barbarians, although they were full of a disorderly naval crowd, the gods embarked along with them, yet had no suspicion of being polluted thereby; you however in your gross ignorance drive men who are lovers of wisdom out of your ship, in whose company as in that of none others the gods delight, and this although you are trafficking in the gods? But the image-makers of old behaved not in this way, nor did they go round the cities selling their gods. All they did was to export their own hands and their tools for working stone and ivory; others provided the raw materials, while they plied their handicraft in the temples themselves; but you are leading the gods into harbors and market places just as if they were wares [ 1] of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370546RHyr class=ethnic long=54.6 lat=37>Hyrcanians</a> and of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> — far be it from me to name these — and so you think you are doing no impiety? It is true that there are babbling buffoons who hang upon their persons images of <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a> or <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, and pretend that they are nurtured by the gods they carry; but as for feeding on the gods themselves as you do, without ever being surfeited on this diet, that is a horrible commerce and one, I should say, savoring of lunacy, even if you have no misgivings of your own about the consequences.

With a favorable wind <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> made the passage and held the following conversation in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>. As he approached the statue of the <a href=/people/12192 target=_blank>Colossus</a>, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> asked him, if he thought anything could be greater than that; and he replied, Yes, a man who loves wisdom in a sound and innocent spirit. At that time <a href=/people/3357 target=_blank>Canus</a> was living in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>, who was esteemed to be the best of all pipe-players of his age. He therefore called him and said: What is the business of a pipe-player? To do, replied the other, everything which his audience wants him to. Well, but many, replied <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, in the audience want to be rich rather than to hear a pipe played; I gather then that what you find them desiring this, namely to be rich, you turn them into rich men. Not at all, replied the other, though I would like to do so. Well, then, perhaps you make the young people in your audience good-looking? For all who are still enjoying youth wish to be handsome. Nor that either, replied the other, although I can play many an air of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> on my instrument. What then is it, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, which you think your audience want? Why, what else, replied <a href=/people/3357 target=_blank>Canus</a>, except that the mourner may have his sorrow lulled to sleep by the pipe, and that they that rejoice may have their cheerfulness enhanced, and the lover may wax warmer in his passion, and that the lover of sacrifice may become more inspired and full of sacred song? This then, he said, O <a href=/people/3357 target=_blank>Canus</a>, would you allow to be the effect of the pipe itself, because it is constructed of gold or brass and of the shin of a stag, or perhaps of the shin of a <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>donkey</a>, or is it something else which has these effects? It is something else, he replied, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>; for the music and the modes and the blending of strains and the easy variations of the pipe and the characters of the harmonies, it is all this that composes the souls of listeners and brings them to such a state of contentment as they want. I understand, he replied, O <a href=/people/3357 target=_blank>Canus</a>, what it is that your art performs; for you cultivate and exhibit to those who come to learn of you the changefulness of your music and the variety of its modes. But as for myself, I think that your pipe wants other resources in addition to those you have mentioned, namely reserves of breath, and a right use of the lips, and manual skill on the part of the player; and facility of breath consists in its being clear and distinct, unmarred by any husky click in the throat, for that would rob the sound of its musical character. And facility with the lips consists in their taking in the reed of the pipe and blowing without blowing out the cheeks; and manual skill I consider very important, for the wrist must not weary from being bent, nor must the fingers be slow in fluttering over the notes, and manual skill is especially shown in the swift transition from mode to mode. If then you have all these facilities, you may play with confidence, O <a href=/people/3357 target=_blank>Canus</a>, for the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> <a href=/people/2973 target=_blank>Euterpe</a> will be with you. </p>                        </div>

Not a farthing, he replied. And how much upon your house? Twelve talents, he replied, and I mean to spend as much again upon it. And what, said the other, is the good of your house to you? Why, as a residence, it is splendidly suited to my bodily training, for there are colonnades in it and groves, and I shall seldom need to walk out into the market place, but people will come in and talk to me with all the more pleasure, just as if they were visiting a temple. And, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, are men to be valued more for themselves or for their belongings? For their wealth, said the other, for wealth has the most influence.

And as the other made no answer, he added: My good boy, it seems to me that it is not you that own the house, but the house rather that owns you.

It is no exaggeration to say that, as he advanced from the ship into the city, they gazed upon him as if he was a god, and made way for him in the alleys, as they would for priests carrying the sacraments. As he was being thus escorted with more pomp than if he had been a governor of the country, he met twelve men who were being led to execution on the charge of being bandits, he looked at them and said: They are not all guilty, for this one, and he gave his name, has been falsely accused and will escape. And to the executioners by whom they were being led, he said: I order you to relax your pace and bring them to the ditch a little more leisurely, and to put this one to death last of all, for he is guiltless of the charge; but you would anyhow act with more piety, if you spared them for a brief portion of the day, since it were better not to slay them at all. And withal he dwelt upon this theme at what was for him unusual length. And the reason for his doing so was immediately shown; for when eight of them had had their heads cut off, a man on horseback rode up to the ditch, and shouted: Spare Pharion; for, he added, he is no robber, but he gave false evidence against himself from fear of being racked, and others of them in their examination under torture have acknowledged that he is guiltless.

For the first autocrat, by whom the Roman state was organized, was succeeded for the space of fifty years by tyrants so harsh and cruel, that not even <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, who reigned thirteen years in the interval between them, could be regarded as a good ruler, and that, although he was fifty years of age when he succeeded to the throne, an age when a man's judgment is most likely to be sane, and though he had the reputation of being fond of culture of all kinds; nevertheless he too in spite of his advanced age committed many youthful follies, and gave up the empire to be devoured, as <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> devour a pasture, by silly women, who murdered him, because he was so indolent that, though he knew beforehand what was in store for him, he would not be on his guard even against what he foresaw. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> no less than <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a> and <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a> rejoiced in the new turn of events; but he did not make use of them as a theme in his public utterances, because he considered such an argument too much in the style of a rhetor. When the autocrat approached the city, the priests met him before the gates, together with the magistrates of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and the representatives of the different provinces into which <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> is divided. The philosophers also were present and all their schools. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> however did not put himself forward in this way, but remained conversing in the temple. The autocrat delivered himself of noble and gentle sentiments, and after making a short speech, said: Is the man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378346PTya class=place long=34.57 lat=37.82>Tyana</a> living here? Yes, they replied, and he has much improved us thereby. Can he then be induced to give us an interview? said the emperor. For I am very much in want of him. He will meet you, said <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a>, at the temple, for he admitted as much to me when I was on my way here. Let us go on, said the king, at once to offer our prayers to the gods, and to meet so noble a man.

The emperor was delighted with this answer, for the crowd too in the temple shouted their agreement with it. What then, said the emperor, did you think of the reign of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>? And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> answered: <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> perhaps understood how to tune a lyre, but he disgraced the empire both by letting the strings go too slack and by drawing them too tight.

I will then communicate to you my reasons for doing so, in order that you may justify my actions to others. For I was never the slave of wealth that I know of, even in my youth; and in the matter of the magistracies and honors in the gift of the Roman sovereign, I bore myself with so much soberness and moderation as to avoid being thought either overbearing or, on the other hand, craven and cowardly. Nor did I cherish any but loyal feelings towards <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>; but, inasmuch as he had received the crown, if not in strict accordance with the law, at any rate from an autocrat, I submitted to him for the sake of <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, who made me consul and sharer of his counsels. And, by <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, I never saw <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> demeaning himself without shedding tears, when I thought of <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, and contrasted with him the wretch who had inherited the greatest of his possessions. And now when I see that even the disappearance from the scene of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> has brought no change for the better in the fortunes of humanity, and that the throne has fallen into such dishonor as to be assigned to <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>, I boldly advance to take it myself; firstly, because I wish to endear myself to men and win their esteem, and secondly, because the man I have to contend with is a mere drunkard. For <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> uses more ointment in his bath than I do water, and I believe that if you ran a sword into him, more ointment would issue from the wound than blood; and his continuous bouts of drinking have made him mad, and one who were he dicing would be full of apprehension lest the pieces should play him false, is yet hazarding the empire in play; and though he is the slave of mistresses, he nevertheless insults married women, and says that he likes to spice his amours with a little danger. His worst excesses I will not mention for I would rather not allude to such matters in your presence. May I then never submit tamely, while the Romans are ruled by such a man as he; let me rather ask the gods to guide me so that I may be true to myself. And this, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, is why I, as it were, make fast my cable to yourself, for they say that you have the amplest insight into the will of the gods, and why I ask you to share with me in my anxieties and aid me in my plans on which rests the safety of sea and land; to the end that, supposing the goodwill of heaven show itself on my side, I may fulfill my task; but if heaven opposes and favors neither myself nor the Romans, that I may not trouble the gods against their wills. </p>                        </div>

Well, today, he went on, my dear <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a>, let us concert some wise conclusions in support of the counsels adopted by me, of a kind to ensure my general policy being honorable and salutary to mankind. For I cannot forget how <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> was the first to degrade the government into an inhuman and cruel system, of how he was followed by Gaius, who filled with Bacchic frenzy, dressed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> fashion, won sham fights and by his disgraceful revels violated all Roman institutions. There followed the worthy <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, and I remember that he was so much the thrall of women as to lose all sense of sovereignty, nay even of self-preservation; for they say he was murdered by them. <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> I hardly need assail, for <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> in brief and terse remarks has exposed the faults of over-indulgence and undue severity by which he disgraced his reign. Nor need I dwell on the system of <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>, who was slain in the middle of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a> in the act of adopting those strumpet sons of his <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a> and <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>. As for <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>, we had rather <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> should come to life again than surrender the empire to him, the most dissolute of all. Perceiving then, my friends, that the throne has fallen into hatred and contempt by reason of the tyrants I have enumerated, I would fain have you advise me how best I can restore it, so that it should not remain what it has become, namely, a stumbling block to mankind. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> replied as follows: There was a first-rate pipe-player, it is said, who used to send his pupils to much worse players than himself, that they might learn how not to pipe. As then you, my sovereign, have learned from these your good-for-nothing predecessors, how not to rule, let us, then, now turn our attention to the problem, how a sovereign ought to rule. </p>                        </div>

But now at last his feelings overcame him, and, raising his voice above its usual pitch, he cried: We must not flatter men's impulses, nor allow ourselves to be carried away against our better judgment by men of unbridled ambition; but we should rather, if we are enamored of wisdom, recall them to the sober facts of life. Here is a policy about the very expediency of which we should first calmly deliberate, and yet you would have us prescribe a way of executing it, before you know if the measures under discussion are desirable. For myself, I quite approve of the deposition of <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>, whom I know to be a ruffian drunk with every sort of profligacy; nevertheless, although I know you to be a worthy man and of pre-eminent nobility of character, I deny that you ought to undertake the correction of <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> without first establishing an ideal for yourself. I need not instruct you in the excesses chargeable to monarchy as such, for you have yourself described them; but this I would have you recognize, that whereas youth leaping into the tyrant's saddle does but obey its own instincts — for playing the tyrant comes natural to young men as wine or women, and we cannot reproach a young man merely for making himself a tyrant, unless in pursuit of his role he shows himself a murderer, a ruffian, or a debauchee — on the other hand when an old man makes himself a tyrant, the first thing we blame in him is that he ever nursed such an ambition. It is no use his showing himself an example of humanity and moderation, for of these qualities we shall give the credit not to himself, but to his age and mature training. And men will believe that he nursed the ambition long before, when he was still a stripling, only that he failed to realize it; and such failures are partly attributed to ill luck, partly to pusillanimity. I mean that he will be thought to have renounced his dream of becoming a tyrant, because he distrusted his own star, or that he stood aside and made way for another who entertained the same ambition and whose superior manliness was dreaded. As for the count of ill luck, I may dismiss it; but as for that of cowardice, how can you avoid it? How escape the reproach of having been afraid of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, the most cowardly and supine of rulers? Look at the revolt against him planned by <a href=/people/1489 target=_blank>Vindex</a>, you surely were the man of the hour, its natural leader, not he! For you had an army at your back, and the forces you were leading against the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, would they not have been more suitably employed in chastising <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>? For the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> have long been in revolt not only against the Romans, but against humanity; and a race that has made its own a life apart and irreconcilable, that cannot share with the rest of mankind in the pleasures of the table nor join in their libations or prayers or sacrifices, are separated from ourselves by a greater gulf than divides us from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus class=place long=48.247 lat=32.191>Susa</a> or <a href=/people/1066 target=_blank>Bactra</a> or the more distant Indies. What sense then or reason was there in chastising them for revolting from us, whom we had better have never annexed? As for <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, who would not have prayed with his own hand to slay a man well-nigh drunk with human blood, singing as he sat amidst the hecatombs of his victims? I confess that I ever pricked up my ears when any messenger from yonder brought tidings of yourself, and told us how in one hand battle you had slain thirty thousand <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> and in the next fifty thousand. In such cases I would take the courier aside and ask him: “But what of the great man? Will he not rise to higher things than this?' Since then you have discovered in <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> an image and ape of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, and are turning your arms against him, persist in the policy you have embraced, for it too is a noble one, only let its sequel be noble too. You know how dear to the Romans are the popular institutions, and how nearly all their conquests were won under a free polity. Put then an end to monarchy, of which you have repeated to us so evil a record; and bestow upon Romans a popular government, and on yourself the glory of inaugurating for them a reign of liberty.

By heaven, I can, answered <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a>, and I should agree in part and in part disagree with his remarks; for I think I have myself told you that you would have been much better employed deposing <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> than setting Jewry to rights. But your anxiety appeared to be never to have him deposed, for anyone who composed the disorder of his affairs merely strengthened the fellow against all the victims in his power. I approve however of the campaign against <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>; for I consider it a greater achievement to prevent a tyranny from ever growing up, than to put an end to it when it is established. And while I welcome the idea of democracy — for though this form of polity is inferior to an aristocracy, nevertheless moderate men will prefer it to tyrannies and oligarchies — I fear lest the servility to which these successive tyrannies have reduced the Romans will render any change difficult to effect; I doubt if they are able to comport themselves as free men or even to lift their eyes to a democracy, any more than people who have been kept in the dark are able to look on a sudden blaze of light. I conclude that <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> ought to be driven from power, and would fain see this effected as quickly and as well as can be; I think however that though you should be prepared for war, yet you yourself instead of declaring war against him, ought rather to threaten him with condign punishment, in case you capture him, as I believe you will easily do, then I would fain see you give the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> the right to choose their own polity, and, if they choose a democracy, allow it them.

If however they accept monarchy, whom can they all possibly decree the throne except yourself?

Were it I that had stepped into such a position of influence as he has, and were I, when taking counsel about what good I could do to the world, treated to such advice as you now give, your arguments would carry some force, for philosophic aphorisms might amend the philosophically-minded of your listeners; but as it is a consul and a man accustomed to rule, whom you pretend to advise, one moreover over whom ruin impends if he fall from power, need we carp, if instead of rejecting the gifts of fortune, he welcomes them when they come, and only deliberates how to make a discreet use of what is his own? Let us take a similar case. Suppose we saw an athlete well endowed with courage and stature, and by his well-knit frame marked out as a winner in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> contest, suppose we approached him when he was already on his way thither from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a>, and, while encouraging him to face his rivals, yet insisted that, in the event of his winning the prize, he must not allow himself to be proclaimed the victor, nor consent to wear the wreath of wild olive — should we not be set down as imbeciles, mocking at another's labors? Similarly when we regard the eminent man before us, and think of the enormous army at his disposal, of the glint of their brazen arms, of his clouds of cavalry, of his own personal qualities, of his generosity, self-restraint, of his fitness to attain his object — ought we not to send him forward on the path that leads to his goal, with favoring encouragement, and with more auspicious pledges for his future than these you have recorded? For there is another thing you have forgotten, that he is the father of two sons who are already in the command of armies, and whose deepest enmity he will incur if he does not bequeath the empire to them. Is he not confronted by the alternative of embroiling himself in hostilities with his own family? If however he accepts the throne, he will have the devoted service of his own children, they will lean on him and he on them, using them as his bodyguard, and, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, as a bodyguard not hired by money, nor levied by force nor feigning loyalty with their faces only, but attached to him by bonds of natural instinct and true affection. <br />For myself I care little about constitutions, seeing that my life is governed by the Gods; but I do not like to see the human flock perish for want of a shepherd at once just and moderate. For just as a single man pre-eminent in virtue transforms a democracy into the guise of a government of a single man who is the best; so the government of one man, of it provides all round for the welfare of the community, is popular government. You did not, we are told, help to depose <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>. And did you, <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a>, or you, <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a>? Did I myself? However, no one finds fault with us for that, nor regards us as cowardly, because, after philosophers have destroyed a thousand tyrannies, we have missed the glory of string a blow for liberty. Not but that, as regards myself, I did take the field against <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, and besides frequent aspersions in my lectures assailed his cut-throat <a href=/people/1972 target=_blank>Tigellinus</a> to his face; and the aid I rendered to <a href=/people/1489 target=_blank>Vindex</a> in the western half of the empire was, I hardly need say, in the nature of a redoubt raised against <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>. But I should not on that account claim for myself the honor of having pulled down that tyrant, any more than I should regard yourselves as falling short of the philosopher's ideal of courage and constancy, because you did nothing of the sort. For a man then of philosophic habit it is enough that he should say what he really thinks; but he will, I imagine, take care not to talk like a fool or a madman. For a consul, on the other hand, who designs to depose a tyrant, the first requisite is plenty of deliberation, with a view to conceal his plans till they are ripe for action; and the second is a suitable pretense to save him from the reproach of breaking his oath. For before he dreams of resorting to arms against the man who appointed him general and whose welfare he swore to safeguard in the council-chamber and on the field, he must surely in self-defense furnish heaven with proof that he perjures himself in the cause of religion. He will also need many friends, if he is not to approach the enterprise unfenced and unfortified, and also all the money he can get so as to be able to win over the men in power, the more so as he attacks a man who commands the resources of the entire earth. All this demands no end of care, no end of time. And you may take all this as you like, for we are not called upon to sit in judgment on ambitions which he may possibly have entertained, but in which fortune resolved to second him, ere ever he came to fight for them. What answer, however, will you make to the following proposition? Here is one who yesterday assumed the throne, who accepted the crown offered by the cities here in the temples around us, whose rescripts are as brilliant as they are ungrudging: do you bid him issue a proclamation today to the effect that for the future he retires into private life, and only assumed the reigns of government in an access of madness? As, if he carries through the policy on which he is resolved, he will confirm the loyalty of the guards relying on whom he first entertained it; so, if he falters and departs from it, he will find an enemy in everyone whom from that moment he must mistrust. </p>                        </div>

However, I will mention you all the things which, if you do them, you will in my opinion do wisely. Look not on that which is laid by as wealth — for how is it better than so much sand drifted no matter whence — nor on what flows into your coffers from populations racked by the tax-gatherer, for gold lacks luster and is mere dross, if it be wrung from men's tears; you will make better use of your wealth than every sovereign did if you employ it in succoring the poor, at the same time that you render their wealth secure for the rich. Tremble before the very absoluteness of your prerogative, for so you will exercise it with the greater moderation. Mow not down the loftier stalks which overtop the rest, for this maxim of <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>'s is unjust; but try rather to pluck disaffection out of men's hearts, as you would tares out of your cornfields; and inspire awe of yourself in revolutionists less by actual punishment than by showing them that they will not go unpunished. Let the law govern you as well as them, O king; for you will be all the wiser as a legislator for so holding the laws in respect. Reverence the gods more than ever before, for you have received great blessings at their hands and have still great ones to pray for. In what appertains to your prerogative, act as a sovereign; in what to your own person, as a private citizen. About dice and drink and dissipation and the necessity of abhorring these vices, why need I tender you any advice, who, they say, never approved of them even in youth. You have, my sovereign, two sons, both, they say, of generous disposition. Let them before all obey your authority, for their faults will be charged to your account. Let your disciplining of them even proceed the to length of threatening not to bequeath them your throne, unless they remain good men and honest; otherwise they will be prone to regard it not as a reward of excellence so much as a mere heritage. As for the pleasures which have made of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> their home and residence — and they are many — I would advise you, my sovereign, to use much discretion in suppressing them; for it is not easy to convert an entire people on a sudden to wisdom and temperance; but you must feel your way and instill order and rhythm in their characters step by step, partly by open, partly by secret correction. Let us put an end to pride and luxury on the part of the freedmen and slaves whom your high position assigns to you, by accustoming them to think all the more humbly of themselves, because their master is so powerful. There remains only one topic to address you on; it concerns the governors sent out to rule the provinces. Of those you will yourself select, I need say nothing, for I am sure you will assign commands by merit; I only refer to those who will acquire them by lot. In their case too, I maintain, those only should be sent out to the various provinces so obtained who are in sympathy, so far as the system of appointing by lot allows of it, with the populations they will rule. I mean, that over Hellenes should be set men who can speak Greek, and Romans over those who speak that language or dialects allied to it. I will tell you what made me think of this. During the period in which I lived in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a> Hellas was governed by a man who knew as little of the Hellenes and their tongue as they understood of his. What was the result? He was in his mistakes as much sinned against as sinner, for his assessors and those who shared with him judicial authority trafficked in justice, and abused his authority as if he had been not their governor but their slave. This, my sovereign, is all that occurs to me today; but if anything else should come into my mind, we can hold another interview. So now apply yourself to the duties of your throne, lest your subjects accuse you of indolence. </p>                        </div>

But, O my sovereign, as henceforth we must address you, I have only one thing left to say, and that is that while you approve and countenance that philosophy which accords with nature, you should have nothing to do with that which affects a secret intercourse with the gods, for we are easily puffed up by the many absurdities this lying philosophy falsely ascribes to providence. The above remark was aimed at <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, who, however, without paying any attention to it, departed with his companions as soon as he had ended his discourses. And <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a> would have taken further liberties with his character, only the emperor noticed it and put him aside by saying: Call in those who have business with the government, and let my council resume its usual form. <br />Thus <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a> failed to see that he only prejudiced himself, and gained with the emperor the reputation of being a jealous and insolent fellow, who aired these sentiments in favor of democracy, not because he really entertained them, but only by way of contradicting the opinions <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> held in regard to the empire. Notwithstanding, the emperor did not cast him off or shew any resentment at his opinions. As for <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a>, he did not cease to be fond of him, though he regretted his seconding the opinions of <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a>. For <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a> was a delightful conversationalist and always declined to quarrel. He moreover imparted to his discourses that sort of charm which exhales from the perfumes at a sacrifice; and he had also, better than any living man, the talent of extempore oratory. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> the emperor nor merely loved for his own sake, but was ever ready to listen to his accounts of antiquity, to his descriptions of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=person long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> <a href=/people/2065 target=_blank>Phraotes</a>, and to his graphic stories of the rivers of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, and of the animals that inhabit it; above all to the forecasts and revelations imparted to him by the gods concerning the future of the empire. On quitting <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, after settling and rejuvenating the country, he invited <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> to share his voyage; but the latter declined, on the ground that he had not yet visited or conversed with the naked sages of that land, whose wisdom he was very anxious to compare with that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>. Nor, he added, have I drunk of the sources of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>. The emperor understood that he was about to set out for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> and said: Will you not bear me in mind?

But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, as if he had a favor to ask, said: And what presents, O king, will you give me? Ten, he replied, now; and when you come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> everything I have. And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> answered: Then I must husband your riches as if they were my own, and squander in the present what is hereafter to be reserved to me in its entirety. But I pray you, O king, to attend rather to these gentlemen here, for they look as if they wanted something. And suiting his words, he pointed to <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a> and his friends. The emperor accordingly pressed them to ask boldly what they desired, whereupon <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a> with a blush said: Reconcile me, O king, with <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> my teacher for that I lately ventured to oppose him in argument; for never till now have I ventured to contradict him. The emperor, approving, said: As long ago as yesterday I asked for this favor, and it is already granted. But do you ask for some gift. <a href=/people/2421 target=_blank>Lasthenes</a>, replied <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a>, of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404289PBry class=place long=28.8827 lat=40.3756>Apamea</a>, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=demonym long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynian</a> city, who was my companion in philosophy, fell in love with the uniform and took to a soldier's life. Now, he says, he longs afresh to wear the sage's cloak, so would you let him out from the service, for that is the extent of his own request; and you will confer on me the privilege of turning him into a saint, and on him the liberty of living as he wishes to. Let him be released, said the emperor, but I confer on him the rights of a veteran, since he is equally fond of wisdom and of yourself. Next the emperor turned to <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a>, who had drawn up a letter embodying his requests, and held it out in expectation that his sovereign would peruse it in private. But the latter was determined to expose him to criticism, so he read it out loud before everyone; and it was found to contain various petitions, some for himself, some for others; and of the presents asked some consisted of cash down and others of credit notes. Whereupon <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> with a laugh remarked: Then your intention of asking a monarch for all this did not prevent you from giving him that good advice in favor of democracy. </p>                        </div>

The fact is, <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> restored the liberties of Hellas with a wisdom and moderation quite alien to his character; and the cities regained their <a href=/people/476 target=_blank>Doric</a> and Attic characteristics, and a general rejuvenescence accompanied the institution among them of a peace and harmony such as not even ancient Hellas ever enjoyed. <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, however, on his arrival in the country took away her liberty, alleging their factiousness with other pretexts hardly justifying such extreme severity. <br />This policy seemed not only to those who suffered by it, but to <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> as well, of a harshness quite out of keeping with a royal temper and character, and accordingly he addressed the following letters to the Emperor: <br /><a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> to the Emperor <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, Greeting: <br />You have, they say, enslaved Hellas, and you imagine you have excelled <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>.

There was a man led a tame <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> about by a string, as if it had been a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>; and the animal not only fawned upon him, but on anyone who approached it. It went collecting alms all around the towns, and was admitted even in the holy places, being a pure animal; for it never licked up the blood of the victims, nor pounced on them when they were being flayed and cut up, but lived upon honeycakes and bread and dried fruits and cooked meat; and you also came on it drinking wine without losing its character. One day it came up to <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> when he was sitting in the sanctuary, and whined and fawned at his knees, and begged of him more earnestly than it had ever done of anybody. The bystanders imagined it wanted some solid reward, but <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> exclaimed: This <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> is begging me to make you understand that a human soul is within him, the soul namely of <a href=/people/424 target=_blank>Amasis</a>, the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> in the province of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/309307USai class=place long=30.7693 lat=30.9666>Sais</a>.

In consequence the priests met and offered sacrifice to <a href=/people/424 target=_blank>Amasis</a>; and having decorated the animal with a collar and ribbons, they conveyed him up country into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> with pipings, hymns and songs composed in his honor. </p>                        </div>

However their respective rivers, the <br /><a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, resemble one another, if we consider their creatures. For they both spread their moisture over the land in the summer season, when the earth most wants it, and unlike all other rivers they produced the crocodile and the river-horse; and the religious rites celebrated over them correspond with one another, for many of the religious invocations of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> are repeated in the case of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>. We have a proof of the similarity of the two countries in the spices which are found in them, also in the fact that the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> and the elephant are captured and confined in both the one and the other. They are also the haunts of animals not found elsewhere, and of black men — a feature not found in other continents — and we meet in them with races of pigmies and of people who bark in various ways instead of talking, and other wonders of the kind. And the griffins of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> and the ants of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a>, though they are dissimilar in form, yet, from what we hear, play similar parts; for in each country they are the guardians of gold, and devoted to the gold reefs of the two countries.

I will explain the meaning of this, for the same custom still survives among ourselves. It was a market place to which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a> bring all the products of their country; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> in their turn take them all away and bring to the same spot their own wares of equal value, so bartering what they have got for what they have not.

What a splendid thing then it would be, if wealth were held in less honor and equality flourished a little more and “if the black iron were left to rust in the ground,” for all men would agree with one another, and the whole earth would be like one brotherhood. </p>                        </div>

He had a stepmother who had fallen in love with him; and when he rejected her overtures, she set upon him and by way of spiting him had poisoned his father's mind against him, condescending to a lower intrigue than ever <a href=/people/953 target=_blank>Phaedra</a> had done, for she accused him of being effeminate, and of finding his pleasure in pederasts rather than in women. He had accordingly abandoned <a about=https://topostext.org/place/309306UNau class=place long=30.5925 lat=30.8972>Naucratis</a>, for it was there that all this happened, and was living in the neighborhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>; and he had acquired and manned a boat of his own and was plying as a waterman on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>. He then, was going down the river when he saw <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> sailing up it; and he concluded that the crew consisted of wise men, because he judged them by the cloaks they wore and the books they were hard at work studying. So he asked them whether they would allow one who was so passionately fond of wisdom as himself to share their voyage; and <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said: This youth is wise, my friends, so let him be granted his request. And he further related the story about his stepmother to those of his companions who were nearest to him in a low tone while the stripling was still sailing towards them. But when the ships were alongside of one another, <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a> stepped out of his boat, and after addressing a word or two to his pilot, about the cargo in his own boat, he greeted the company. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> then ordered him to sit down under his eyes, and said: You stripling of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, for you seem to be one of the natives, tell me what you have done of evil or what of good; for in the one case you shall be forgiven by me, in consideration of your youth; but in the other you shall reap my commendation and become a fellow-student of philosophy with me and with these gentlemen. Then noticing that <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a> blushed and checked his impulse to speak, and hesitated whether to say or not what he had been going to say, he pressed his question and repeated it, just as if he had no foreknowledge of the youth at his command. Then <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a> plucked up courage and said: O Heavens, how shall I describe myself? for I am not a bad boy, and yet I do not know whether I ought to be considered a good one, for there is no particular merit in having abstained from wrong. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> cried: Bravo, my boy, you answer me just as if you were a sage from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>; for this was just the sentiment of the divine <a href=/people/1186 target=_blank>Iarchas</a>. But tell me how you came to form these opinions, and how long ago; for it strikes me that you have been on your guard against some sin. The youth then began to tell them of his stepmother's infatuation for himself, and of how he had rejected her advances; and when he did so, there was a shout in recognition of the divine inspiration under which <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> had foretold these details. <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a>, however, caught them up and said: Most excellent people, what is the matter with you? for my story is one which calls as little for your admiration, I think, as for your ridicule. But <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> said: It was not that we were admiring, but something else which you don't know about yet. As for you, my boy, we praise you because you think that you did nothing very remarkable. And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said: Do you sacrifice to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, my boy? And <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a> answered: Yes, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, every day; for I consider that this goddess has great influence in human and divine affairs. Thereat <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> was delighted beyond measure, and cried: Let us, gentlemen, vote a crown to him for his continence rather than to <a href=/people/560 target=_blank>Hippolytus</a> the son of <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>, for the latter insulted <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>; and that perhaps is why he never fell a victim to the tender passion, and why love never ran riot in his soul; but he was allotted an austere and unbending nature. But our friend here admits that he is devoted to the goddess, and yet did not respond to his stepmother's guilty overtures, but went away in terror of the goddess herself, in case he were not on his guard against another's evil passions; and the mere aversion to any one of the gods, such as <a href=/people/560 target=_blank>Hippolytus</a> entertained in regard to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, I do not class as a form of sobriety; for it is a much greater proof of wisdom and sobriety to speak well of the gods, especially at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, where altars are set up in honor even of unknown gods. So great was the interest which he took in <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a>. Nevertheless he called him <a href=/people/560 target=_blank>Hippolytus</a> for the eyes with which he looked at his stepmother. It seemed also that he was a young man who was particular about his person and enhanced its charms by attention to athletic exercises. </p>                        </div>

He says that he was the son of the <a href=/people/683 target=_blank>Dawn</a>, and that he did not meet his death in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, where indeed he never went; but that he died in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> after ruling the land for five generations. But his countrymen being the longest lived of men, still mourn him as a mere youth and deplore his untimely death. But the place in which his statue is set up resembles, they tell us, an ancient market-place, such as remain in cities that were long ago inhabited, and where we come on broken stumps and fragments of columns, and find traces of walls as well as seats and jambs of doors, and images of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, some destroyed by the hand of man, others by that of time. Now this statue, says <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, was turned towards the sunrise, and was that of a youth still unbearded; and it was made of a black stone, and the two feet were joined together after the style in which statues were made in the time of <a href=/people/310 target=_blank>Daedalus</a>; and the arms of the figure were perpendicular to the seat pressing upon it, for though the figure was still sitting it was represented in the very act of rising up. We hear much of this attitude of the statue, and of the expression of its eyes, and of how the lips seem about to speak; but they say that they had no opportunity of admiring these effects until they saw them realized; for when the sun's rays fell upon the statue, and this happened exactly at dawn, they could not restrain their admiration; for the lips spoke immediately the sun's ray touched them, and the eyes seemed to stand out and gleam against the light as do those of men who love to bask in the sun. Then they say they understood that the figure was of one in the act of rising and making obeisance to the sun, in the way those do who worship the powers above standing erect. They accordingly offered a sacrifice to the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=person long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> and to <a href=/people/1491 target=_blank>Memnon</a> of the <a href=/people/683 target=_blank>Dawn</a>, for this the priests recommended them to do, explaining that one name was derived from the words signifying to burn and be warm [ 1] and the other from his mother. Having done this they set out upon <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a> for the home of the naked philosophers. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a> said: You had better ask me, and not him; for he will never tell you what is the matter with him, because he is ashamed of the plight in which he finds himself; but as for me, I know the poor man and pity him, and I will tell you all about him. For he has slain unwittingly a certain inhabitant of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>, and the laws of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a> prescribe that a person exiled for an involuntary offense of this kind, — and the penalty is exile, — should remain with the naked philosophers until he has washed away the guilt of bloodshed, and then he may return home as soon as he is pure, though he must first go to the tomb of the slain man and sacrifice there some trifling victim. Now until he has been received by the naked philosophers, so long he must roam about these marches, until they take pity upon him as if he were a suppliant. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> therefore put the question to <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a>: What do the naked philosophers think of this particular exile? And he answered: I do not know anything more than that this is the seventh month that he has remained here as a suppliant, and that he has not yet obtained redemption. Said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>: You don't call men wise, who refuse to purify him, and are not aware that <a href=/people/1007 target=_blank>Philiscus</a> whom he slew was a descendant of <a href=/people/2454 target=_blank>Thamus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a>, who long ago laid waste the country of these naked philosophers. Thereat <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a> said in surprise: What do you mean?  I mean, said the other, my good youth, what was actually the fact; for this <a href=/people/2454 target=_blank>Thamus</a> once on a time was intriguing against the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>, and these philosophers detected his plot and prevented him; and he having failed in his enterprise retaliated by laying waste all the land upon which they live, for by his brigandage he tyrannized the country round <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>. I perceive that <a href=/people/1007 target=_blank>Philiscus</a> whom this man slew was the thirteenth in descent from this <a href=/people/2454 target=_blank>Thamus</a>, and was obviously an object of execration to those whose country the latter so thoroughly ravaged at the time in question. Where then is their wisdom? Here is a man that they ought to crown, even if he had slain the other intentionally; and yet they refuse to purge him of a murder which he committed involuntarily on their behalf.. The youth then was astounded and said: Stranger, who are you? And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> replied: He whom you shall find among these naked philosophers. But as it is not allowed me by my religion to address one who is stained with blood, I would ask you, my good boy, to encourage him, and tell him that he will at once be purged of guilt, if he will come to the place where I am lodging. And when the man in question came, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> went through the rites over him which <a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a> and <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> prescribe for the purification of such offenses, and told him to return home, for that he was now pure of guilt. </p>                        </div>

At the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> festival, however, these superfluities are omitted as inappropriate and unworthy of the place; and those who go to the festival are only provided with the show of naked athletes originally instituted by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>. You may see the same contrast between the wisdom of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> and our own. For they, like those who invite others to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> festival, appeal to the crowd with all sorts of charms and wizardry; but we, like the athletes of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>, go naked. Here earth strews for us no couches, nor does it yield us milk or wine as if we were bacchants, nor does the air uplift us and sustain us aloft. But the earth beneath us is our only couch, and we live by partaking of its natural fruits, which we would have it yield to us gladly and without being tortured against its will. But you shall see that we are not unable to work tricks if we like. Heigh! you tree yonder, he cried, pointing to an elm tree, the third in the row from that under which they were talking, just salute the wise <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, will you? And forthwith the tree saluted him, as it was bidden to do, in accents which were articulate and like those of a woman. Now he wrought this sign to discredit the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, and in the belief that by doing so he would wean <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> of his excessive estimate of their powers; for he was always recounting to everybody what the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> said and did. <br />Then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> added these precepts: he said that it is sufficient for the sage to abstain from eating all flesh of living animals, and from the roving desires which mount up in the soul through the eyes, and from envy which ends by teaching injustice to hand and will, and that truth stands not in need of miracle-mongering and sinister arts. For look, he said, at the <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=person long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, who keeps the center of Hellas for the utterance of his oracles. There then, as you probably know yourself, a person who desires a response, puts his question briefly, and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> tells what he knows without any miraculous display. And yet it would be just as easy for him to convulse the whole mountain of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385226LPar class=place long=22.6219 lat=38.5354>Parnassus</a>, and to alter the springs of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225WCas class=demonym long=22.505 lat=38.483>Castalian</a> fountain so that it should run with wine, and to check the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388228WKep class=place long=22.91 lat=38.496>Cephisus</a> and stay its stream; but he reveals the bare truth without any of this show of ostentation. Nor must we suppose that it is by his will, that so much gold and showy offerings enter his treasury, nor that he would care for his temple even if it were made twice as large as it already is. For once on a time this god <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> dwelt in quite a humble habitation; and a little hut was constructed for him to which the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> are said to have contributed their honeycomb and wax, and the birds their feathers. For simplicity is the teacher of wisdom and the teacher of truth; and you must embrace it, if you would have men think you really wise, and forget all your legendary tales that you have acquired among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>. For what need is there to beat the drum over such simple matters as: “Do this, or do not do it,” or “I know it, or I do not know it,” or “It is this and not that'? What do you want with thunder, nay, I would say, What do you want to be thunder-struck for? <br />You have seen in picture-books the representation of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> by <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a>; in it <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> is represented as a youth, who has not yet chosen the life he will lead; and vice and virtue stand in each side of him plucking his garments and trying to draw him to themselves. <a href=/people/12002 target=_blank>Vice</a> is adorned with gold and necklaces and with purple raiment, and her cheeks are painted and her hair delicately plaited and her eyes underlined with henna; and she also wears golden slippers, for she is pictured strutting about in these; but virtue in the picture resembles a woman worn out with toil, with a pinched look; and she has chosen for her adornment rough squalor, and she goes without shoes and in the plainest of raiment, and she would have appeared naked if she had not too much regard for her feminine decency. Now figure yourself, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, as standing between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> wisdom on one side, and our humble wisdom on the other; imagine that you hear the one telling you how she will strew flowers under you when you lie down to sleep, yes, and by Heaven, how she will regale you upon milk and nourish you on honey-comb, and how she will supply you with nectar and wings, whenever you want them; and how she will wheel in tripods, whenever you drink, and golden thrones; and you shall have no hard work to do, but everything will be flung unsought into your lap. But the other discipline insists that you must lie on the bare ground in squalor, and be seen to toil naked like ourselves; and that you must not find dear or sweet anything which you have not won by hard work; and that you must not be boastful, not hunt after vanities and pursue pride; and that you must be on your guard against all dreams and visions which lift you off the earth. If then you really make the choice of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, and steel your will resolutely, neither to dishonor truth, nor to decline the simplicity of nature, then you may say that you have overcome many <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> and have cut off the heads of many <a href=/people/1205 target=_blank>hydras</a> and of monsters like <a href=/people/894 target=_blank>Geryon</a> and <a href=/people/1052 target=_blank>Nessus</a>, and have accomplished all his other labors, but if you embrace the life of a strolling juggler, you will flatter men's eyes and ears, but they will think you no wiser than anybody else, and you will become the vanquished of any naked philosopher of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. </p>                        </div>

But he, after praising the fluency and vigor of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a>, merely said: Have you anything more to say? No, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, said the other, for I have said all I have to say. Then he asked afresh: And has not any one of the rest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> anything to say? I am their spokesman, answered his antagonist, and you have heard them all. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> accordingly paused for a minute and then, fixing his eyes, as it were, on the discourse he had heard, he spoke as follows: You have very well described and in a sound philosophic spirit the choice which <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> declares <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> to have made as a young man; but, ye wise men of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, it does not apply in the least to myself. For I am not come here to ask your advice about how to live, insomuch as I long ago made choice of the life which seemed best to myself; and as I am older than any of you, except <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a>, I myself am better qualified, now I have got here, to advise you how to choose wisdom, if I did not find that you had already made the choice. Being, however, as old as I am, and so far advanced in wisdom as I am, I shall not hesitate as it were to make you the auditors of my life and motives, and teach you that I rightly chose this life of mine, than which no better one has ever suggested itself to me. For I discerned a certain sublimity in the discipline of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, and how a certain secret wisdom enabled him to know, not only who he was himself, but also who he had been; and I saw that he approached the altars in purity, and suffered not his belly to be polluted by partaking of the flesh of animals and that he kept his body pure of all garments woven of dead animal refuse; and that he was the first of mankind to restrain his tongue, inventing a discipline of silence described in the proverbial phrase, An <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> sits upon it. I also saw that his philosophical system was in other respects oracular and true. So I ran to embrace his teachings, not choosing one form of wisdom rather than another of two presented me, as you, my excellent <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a>, advise me to do. For philosophy marshaled before me her various points of view, investing them with the adornment proper to each and she commanded me to look upon them and make a sound choice. Now they were all possessed of an august and divine beauty; and some of them were of such dazzling brightness that you might well have closed your eyes. However I fixed my eyes firmly upon all of them, for they themselves encouraged me to do so by moving towards me, and telling me beforehand how much they would give me. Well, one of them professed that she would shower upon me a swarm of pleasures without any toil on my part and another that she would give me rest after toil; and a third that she would mingle mirth and merriment in my toil; and everywhere I had glimpses of pleasures and of unrestrained indulgence in the pleasures of the table; and it seemed that I had only to stretch out my hand to be rich, and that I needed not to set any bridle upon my eyes, but love and loose desire and such-like feelings were freely allowed me. One of them, however, boasted that she would restrain me from such things, but she was bold and abusive and in an unabashed manner elbowed all others aside; and I beheld the ineffable form of wisdom </p>                        </div>

But I allow him shoes of bark, and he must sleep anywhere and anyhow, and if I find my votaries yielding to sensual pleasures, I have precipices to which justice that waits upon wisdom carries them and pushes them over; and I am so harsh to those who make choice of my discipline that I have bits ready to restrain their tongues. But learn from me what rewards you shall reap by enduring all this: Temperance and justice unsought and at once, and the faculty to regard no man with envy, and to be dreaded by tyrants rather than cringe to them, and to have your humble offerings appear sweeter to the gods than the offerings of those who pour out before them the blood of <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>. And when you are pure I will grant you the faculty of foreknowledge, and I will so fill your eyes with light, that you shall distinguish a god, and recognize a hero, and detect and put to shame the shadowy phantoms which disguise themselves in the form of men.” This was the life I chose, ye wise of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>; it was a sound choice and in the spirit of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, and in making it I neither deceived myself, nor was deceived; for I have become all that a philosopher should become, and all that she promised to bestow upon the philosopher, that is mine. For I have studied profoundly the problem of the rise of the art and whence it draws its first principles; and I have realized that it belongs to men of transcendent religious gifts, who have thoroughly investigated the nature of the soul, the well-springs of whose existence lie back in the immortal and in the unbegotten. <br />Now I agree that this doctrine was wholly alien to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>; for when <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> in their city lifted up his voice and discoursed upon the soul, full of inspiration and wisdom, they caviled against him and adopted opinions of the soul opposed thereto and altogether false. And one may well ask whether there is any city, or any race of men, where not one more and another less, but wherein men of all ages alike, will enunciate the same doctrine of the soul. And I myself, because my youth and inexperience so inclined me, began by looking up to yourselves, because you had the reputation of an extraordinary knowledge of most things; but when I explained my views to my own teacher, he interrupted me, and said as follows: “Supposing you were in a passionate mood and being of an impressionable age were inclined to form a friendship; and suppose you met a handsome youth and admired his looks, and you asked whose son he was, and suppose he were the son of a knight or a general, and that his grand-parents had been furnishers of a chorus — if then you dubbed him the child of some skipper or policeman, do you suppose that you would thereby be the more likely to captivate his affections, and that you would not rather make yourself odious to him by refusing to call him by his father's name, and giving him instead that of some ignoble and spurious parent? </p>                        </div>

It was this which turned my steps to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> rather than to yourselves; for I reflected that they were more subtle in their understanding, because such men as they live in contact with a purer daylight, and entertain truer opinions of nature and of the gods, because they are near unto the latter, and live on the edge and confines of that thermal essence which quickens all unto life. And when I came among them, their message made the same impression upon me as the talent of <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a> is said to have made upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>. For he was a poet of tragedy, and finding the art to be rude and inchoate and as yet not in the least elaborated, he went to work, and curtailed the prolixity of the chorus, and invented dialogues for the actors, discarding the long monodies of the earlier time; and he hit upon a plan of killing people behind the stage instead of their being slain before the eyes of the audience. Well, if we cannot deny his talent in making all these improvements, we must nevertheless admit that they might have suggested themselves equally well to an inferior dramatist. But his talent was twofold. On the one hand as a poet he set himself to make his diction worthy of tragedy, on the other hand as a manager, to adapt his stage to sublime, rather than to humble and groveling themes. Accordingly he devised masks which represented the forms of the heroes, and he mounted his actors on buskins so that their gait might correspond to the characters they played; and he was the first to devise stage dresses, which might convey an adequate impression to the audience of the heroes and heroines they saw. For all these reasons the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> accounted him to be the father of tragedy; and even after his death they continued to invite him to represent his plays at the Dionysiac festival, for in accordance with public decree the plays of <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a> continued to be put upon the stage and win the prize anew. And yet the gratification of a well-staged tragedy is insignificant, for its pleasures last a brief day, as brief as is the season of the Dionysiac festival; but the gratification of a philosophic system devised to meet the requirements of a <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, and also breathing the inspiration in which <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> was anticipated by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, lasts not for a brief time, but for an endless and incalculable period. It is then not unreasonable on my part, I think, to have devoted myself to a philosophy so highly elaborated, and to one which, to use a metaphor from the stage, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> mount, as it deserves to be mounted, upon a lofty and divine mechanism, and then wheel it forth upon the stage. And that I was right to admire them, and that I am right in considering them to be wise and blessed, it is now time to convince you. I beheld men dwelling upon the earth, and yet not upon it, I beheld them fortified without fortifications, I beheld them possessed of nothing, and yet possessed of all things. You will say that I have taken to riddles, but the wisdom of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> allows of this; for he taught us to speak in riddles, when he discovered that the word is the teacher of silence. And there was a time when you yourselves took counsel with <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, and were advocates of this same wisdom; that was in the time when you could say nothing too good of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> philosophy, for to begin with and of old you were <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>. Subsequently because your soil was wrath with you, you came hither; and then ashamed of the reasons owing to which you quitted it, you tried to get men to regard you as anything rather than <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a> who had come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> hither, and you took every pains to efface your past. This is why you stripped yourselves of the apparel in which you came thence, as if you were anxious to doff along with it your Ethiopian nationality. This is why you have resolved to worship the gods in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> rather than in your own fashion, and why you have set yourselves to disseminate unflattering stories of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, as if in maligning them you did not foul your own nest. And in this respect you have not yet altered your tone for the better; for only today you have given here an exhibition of your propensities for abuse and satire, pretending that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> are no better employed than in startling people and in pandering to their eyes and ears. And because as yet you are ignorant of my wisdom, you show yourself indifferent to the fame which crowns it. Well, in defense of myself I do not mean to say anything, for I am content to be what the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> think me; but I will not allow them to be attacked. And if you are so sound and sane as to possess any tincture of the wisdom of the man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380138PHim class=place long=13.8225 lat=37.9708>Himera</a>, who composed in honor of <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> a poem which contradicted a former one and called it a palinode, it is high time for you also to use the words he used and say: “This discourse of ours is not true,” so changing your opinion and adopting one better than you at present entertain about these people. But if you have not the wit to recant, you must at least spare men to whom the gods vouchsafe, as worthy of them, their own prerogatives, and whose possessions they do not disdain for themselves.</p>                        </div>

And the god I believe regarded even this as too humble and below the dignity of wisdom, and therefore desired to have another and yet another temple, big ones these and a hundred feet in breadth; and from one of them it is said that golden figures of the wryneck were hung up which possessed in a manner the charm of the <a href=/people/605 target=_blank>Sirens</a>; and the god collected the most precious of the offerings into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> temple for ornament; nor did he reject works of statuary, when their authors brought him to his temple colossal figures of gods and men, and also of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> and other animals; nor did he refuse the gift of <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucus</a> brought thither of a stand for a goblet, nor the picture of the taking of the citadel of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a> which <a href=/people/1079 target=_blank>Polygnotus</a> painted there. For I imagine he did not consider that the gold of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a> really beautified the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> fane, but he admitted it on behalf of the Hellenes themselves, by way of pointing out to them, I believe, the immense riches of the barbarians, and inducing them to covet that rather than continue to ravage one another's lands. And he accordingly adopted the Greek fashion of art which suited his particular wisdom, and adorned his shrine therewith. And I believe that it was by way of adornment that he also puts his oracles in metrical form. For if he did not wish to make a show in this matter, he would surely make his responses in such forms as the following: “Do this, or do not do that'; and “go, or do not go,” or “choose allies, or do not choose them.” For here are short formulas, or as you call it naked ones. But in order to display his mastery of the grand style, and in order to please those who came to consult his oracle, he adopted the poetical form; and he does not allow that anything exists which he does not know, but claims to have counted the sands of the sea and to know their number, and also to have fathomed the depths of the sea. <br />But I suppose you will call it miracle-monging, that <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> dictates his oracles with such proud dignity and elation of spirit? But if you will not be annoyed, <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a>, at what I say, there are certain old women who go about with sieves in their hands to shepherds, sometimes to <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>-herds, pretending to heal their flocks, when they are sick, by divination, as they call it, and they claim to be called wise women, yea wiser than those who are unfeignedly prophets. It seems to me that you are in the same case, when I contrast your wisdom with that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>; for they are divine, and have trimmed and adorned their science after the matter of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> oracle; but you — however I will say no more, for modesty in speech is as dear to me as it is dear to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, and I would be glad to have it at once to attend upon and to guide my tongue, seeking to compass what is in my power when I am praising those to whom I am so devoted, but leaving alone what is too high for me to attain unto, without bespattering it with petty disapproval. But you no doubt delight in the story which you have read in <br /><a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> about the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclopes</a>, how their land, all unsown and unploughed, nourished the most fearless and lawless of beings; and if it is some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408238UEdo class=ethnic long=23.9 lat=40.9>Edoni</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=ethnic long=28 lat=38.5>Lydians</a> who are conducting bacchic revels, you are quite ready to believe that the earth will supply them with fountains of milk and wine, and give them to drink thereof; but you would deny to these <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, lovers of all wisdom as enthusiastic as ever bacchants were, the unsought bounties which earth offers them. Moreover tripods, gifted with will of their own, attend the banquets of the gods also; and <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>, ignorant and hostile as he was to <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a>, yet never accused him merely for making them; nor is it conceivable that the gods ever listened to such an indictment as this: “You commit an injustice, O <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a>, in adorning the banquet of the gods, and encompassing it with miracles.” Nor was <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a> ever sued for constructing handmaids of gold, nor accused of debasing the metals because he made the gold to breath. For ever art is interested to adorn, and the very existence of the arts was a discovery made in behalf of ornament. Moreover a man who goes without shoes and wears a philosopher's cloak and hangs a wallet on his back is a creature of ornament; nay, more even the nakedness which you affect, in spite of its rough and plain appearance, has for its object ornament and decoration, and it is not even exempt from the proverbial pride of your own sort to match [ 1]. We must judge by their own standard the religion of the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> and the national rites of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> and any cult in which that god delights; for the subterranean gods will always prefer deep trenches and ceremonies conducted in the hollows of the earth, but the air is the chariot of the sun; and those who would sing his praise in a fitting manner must rise from the earth and soar aloft with god; and this everyone would like to do, but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> alone are able to do it. </p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, he says, replied: I should not grudge you anything, for you are ready to listen, as I see, and are ready to welcome wisdom of every kind; but I should not care to pour out the teachings I gathered there upon <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a> or on anyone else who regards the lore of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> as so much nonsense. Whereupon <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a> said: But if you were a merchant or a seafarer, and you brought to us some cargo or other from over there, would you claim, merely because it came from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, to dispose of it untested and unexamined, refusing us either the liberty of looking at it or tasting it? But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> repled as follows: I should furnish it to those who asked for it; but if the moment my ship had reached the harbor, someone came down the beach and began to run down my cargo and abuse myself, and say that I came from a country which produces nothing worth having, and if he reproached me for sailing with a cargo of shoddy goods, and tried to persuade the rest to think like himself, do you suppose that one would, after entering such a harbor, cast anchor or make his cables fast, and not rather hoist his sails and put to sea afresh, entrusting his goods more gladly to the winds than to such undiscerning and inhospitable people? Well, I anyhow, said <a href=/people/1804 target=_blank>Nilus</a>, lay hold on your cables, and entreat you, my skipper, to let me share your goods that you bring hither; and I would gladly embark with you in your ship as a super-cargo and a clerk to check your merchandise. </p>                        </div>

Now I never have had any quarrel of my own with <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a>; I only tried to wean him of his passion for money and cure his propensity to value everything by what he could make out of it; but I found that my advice was not congenial to him, nor in his case practicable; nay he merely takes it as a tacit reproach, and never loses any opportunity of intriguing against me. But since you have found his attacks upon my character so plausible, I may as well tell you that it is you, rather than myself, that he has calumniated. For though, as is clear to me, the victims of calumny incur considerable dangers, since they are, I suppose, sure to be disliked without having done any wrong, yet neither are those who incline to listen to the calumnies free from danger; for in the first place they will be convicted of paying respect to lies and giving them as much attention as they would to the truth, and secondly they are convicted of levity and credulity, faults which it is disgraceful even for a stripling to fall into. And they will be thought envious, because they allow envy to teach them to listen to unjust tittle-tattle; and they expose themselves all the more to calumny, because they think it true of others. For man is by nature inclined to commit a fault which he does not discredit when he hears it related to others. Heaven forbid that a man of these inclinations should become a tyrant, or even president of a popular state; for in his hands even a democracy would become a tyranny; nor let him be made a judge, for surely he will not ever discern the truth. Nor let him be captain of a ship, for the crew would mutiny, nor general of an army, for that would bring luck to the adversary; nor let one of his disposition attempt philosophy, for he would not consider the truth in forming his opinions. But <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a> has deprived you of even the quality of wisdom; for how can those on whom he has imposed with his falsehoods claim wisdom for themselves? have they not deserted from it to take sides with one who has persuaded them of improbabilities? Here <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a> tried to calm him, and remarked: Enough of <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a> and of his small-minded affairs; for we are quite ready even to reconcile you with him, since we consider it the proper work of a sage to be umpire in the disputes of other sages. But, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, who shall reconcile me with you? For the victim of lies must surely be driven into hostility by the falsehood. ... Be it so, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, and let us hold a conversation, for that will be the best way of reconciling us. </p>                        </div>

And I too, said <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a>, long to hear about the wisdom of <a href=/people/2065 target=_blank>Phraotes</a>, for you are said to have brought from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> some examples of his arguments. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> accordingly began by telling them about the events which occurred in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, and told them everything, and they gladly listened to him, spellbound by his words.

It is a delightful gift of hospitality, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, which you bring to us, O youth, in the shape of yourself and your disposition, for you are evidently a philosopher without guile, and an enthusiastic lover of the doctrines of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> and of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>.

But now I intend to put on my heavy armor, and it is your shield that shall adorn me. But, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, I think, my good <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a>, that you will incur the censure of <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a> and his society for two reasons; firstly, that after no further examination and testing of ourselves you have left them, and secondly that you give the preference to our manners and discipline with more precipitancy than is admissible where a man is making choice of how he shall live. I agree with you, said the young man, but if I am to blame for making this choice, I might also be to blame if I did not make it; and anyhow they will be most open to rebuke, if they make the same choice as myself. For it will be more justly reprehensible in them, as they are both older and wiser than myself, not to have made the choice long ago which I make now; for with all their advantages they will have failed to choose what in practice would so much redound to their advantage. A very generous sentiment indeed, my good youth, is this which you have expressed, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>; but beware lest the mere fact of their being so wise and aged should give them an appearance, at any rate, of being right in choosing as they have done, and of having good reason for rejecting my doctrine; and lest you should seem to take up a very bold position in setting them to rights rather than in following them. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> turned short round upon <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> and countering his opinion said: So far as it was right for a young man to agree with his elders, I have been careful to do so; for so long as I thought that these gentlemen were possessed of a wisdom which belonged to no other set of men, I attached myself to them; and the motive which actuated me to do so was the following: My father once made a voyage on his own initiative to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Red Sea</a>, for he was, I may tell you, captain of the ship which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> send to the Indies. And after he had had intercourse with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> of the seaboard, he brought home stories of the wise men of that region, closely similar to those which you have told us. And his account which I heard was somewhat as follows, namely that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> are the wisest of mankind, but that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a> are colonists sent from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, who follow their forefathers in matters of wisdom, and fix their eyes on the institutions of their home. Well, I, having reached my teens, surrendered my patrimony to those who wanted it more than myself, and frequented the society of these naked sages, naked myself as they, in the hope of picking up the teaching of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, or at any rate teaching allied to theirs. And they certainly appeared to me to be wise, though not after the manner of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>; but when I asked them point blank why they did not teach the philosophy of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, they plunged into abuse of the natives of that country very much as you have heard them do in their speeches this very day. Now I was still young, as you see, so they made me a member of their society, because I imagine they were afraid I might hastily quit them and undertake a voyage to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Red Sea</a>, as my father did before me. And I should certainly have done so, yes, by Heaven, I would have pushed on until I reached the hill of the sages, unless someone of the gods had sent you hither to help me and enabled me without either making any voyage over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Red Sea</a> or adventuring to the inhabitants of the Gulf, to taste the wisdom of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>. It is not today therefore for the first time that I shall make my choice, but I made it long ago, though I did not obtain what I hoped to obtain. For what is there to wonder at if a man who has missed what he was looking for, returns to the search? And if I should convert my friends yonder to this point of view, and persuade them to adopt the convictions which I have adopted myself, should I, tell me, be guilty of any hardihood? For you must not reject the claim that youth makes, that in some way it assimilates an idea more easily than old age; and anyone who counsels another to adopt the wisdom and teaching which he himself has chosen, anyhow escapes the imputation of trying to persuade others of things he does not believe himself. And anyone who takes the blessings bestowed upon him by fortune into a corner and there enjoys them by himself, violates their character as blessings, for he prevents their sweetness from being enjoyed by as many as possible. </p>                        </div>

Let us discuss it, answered <a href=/people/1804 target=_blank>Nilus</a>, and do you ask whatever you like. I ask you, he said, to be content with the choice you have made, and not to annoy the naked sages by giving them advice which they will not take.

This then was the substance of their conversation, and when <a href=/people/1804 target=_blank>Nilus</a> at its close asked him how long a time he would stay among the naked sages he replied: So long as the quality of their wisdom justifies anyone in remaining in their company; and after that I shall take my way to the cataracts, in order to see the springs of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, for it will be delightful not only to behold the sources of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, but also to listen to the roar of its waterfalls. </p>                        </div>

They accordingly greeted one another, and sitting down together in the grove they began a conversation in which <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> led as follows: How important it is, said he, not to conceal wisdom, is proved by our conversation of yesterday; for because the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> taught me as much of their wisdom as I thought it proper for me to know, I not only remember my teachers, but I go about instilling into others what I heard from them.

It is about the gods that I would like to ask you a question first, namely, what induced you to impart, as your tradition, to the people of this country forms of the gods that are absurd and grotesque in all but a few cases? In a few cases, do I say? I would rather say that in very few are the gods' images fashioned in a wise and god-like manner, for the mass of your shrines seem to have been erected in honor rather of irrational and ignoble animals than of gods. <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a>, resenting these remarks, said: And your own images in Greece, how are they fashioned? In the way, he replied, in which it is best and most reverent to construct images of the gods. I suppose you allude, said the other, to the statue of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>, and to the image of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> and to that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=demonym long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidian</a> goddess and to that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=demonym long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a> goddess and to other images equally beautiful and full of charm? Not only to these, replied <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, but without exception I maintain, that whereas in other lands statuary has scrupulously observed decency and fitness, you rather make ridicule of the gods than really believe in them. Your artists, then, like <a href=/people/402 target=_blank>Phidias</a>, said the other, and like <a href=/people/688 target=_blank>Praxiteles</a>, went up, I suppose, to heaven and took a copy of the forms of the gods, and then reproduced these by their art or was there any other influence which presided over and guided their molding? There was, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, and an influence pregnant with wisdom and genius. What was that? said the other, for I do not think you can adduce any except imitation. Imagination, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, wrought these works, a wiser and subtler artist by far than imitation; for imitation can only create as its handiwork what it has seen, but imagination equally what it has not seen; for it will conceive of its ideal with reference to the reality, and imitation is often baffled by terror, but imagination by nothing; for it marches undismayed to the goal which it has itself laid down. When you entertain a notion of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> you must, I suppose, envisage him along with heaven and seasons and stars, as <a href=/people/402 target=_blank>Phidias</a> in his day endeavoured to do, and if you would fashion an image of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> you must imagine in your mind armies and cunning, and handicrafts, and how she leapt out of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> himself. But if you make a hawk or an <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a> or a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> or a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, and put it in your temples instead of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> or <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> or <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, your animals and your birds may be esteemed and of much price as likenesses, but the gods will be very much lowered in their dignity. I think, said the other, that you criticize our religion very superficially; for if the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> have any wisdom, they show it by their deep respect and reverence in the representation of the gods, and by the circumstance that they fashion their forms as symbols of a profound inner meaning, so as to enhance their solemnity and august character. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> thereon merely laughed and said: My good friends, you have indeed greatly profited by the wisdom of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, if your <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> and your ibis and your <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> seem particularly august and god-like, for this is what I learn from <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a> the sage. <br />But what is there that is august or awe-inspiring in these images? Is it not likely that perjurers and temple-thieves and all the rabble of low jesters will despise such holy objects rather than dread them; and if they are to be held for the hidden meanings which they convey, surely the gods in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> would have met with much greater reverence, if no images of them had ever been set up at all, and if you had planned your theology along other lines wiser and more mysterious. For I imagine you might have built temples for them, and have fixed the altars and laid down rules about what to sacrifice and what not, and when and on what scale, and with what liturgies and rites, without introducing any image at all, but leaving it to those who frequented the temples to imagine the images of the gods; for the mind can more or less delineate and figure them to itself better than can any artist; but you have denied to the gods the privilege of beauty both of the outer eye and of an inner suggestion. <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a> replied and said: There was a certain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, called <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, a foolish old man like ourselves, who thought that the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> and the goose and the plane tree were gods and used to swear by them. He was not foolish, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, but a divine and unfeignedly wise man; for he did not swear by these objects on the understanding that they were gods, but to save himself from swearing by the gods. </p>                        </div>

Yes, answered the other, as hard, O <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a>, as men can smite them; and it is especially men of noble birth among them that are so treated. Then what do they do to menials, he asked, when they do wrong? They do not kill them nowadays, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, as <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a> formerly allowed, but the same whip is used to them too. And what judgment does Hellas pass upon the matter? They flock, he answered, to see the spectacle with pleasure and utmost enthusiasm, as if to the festival of <a href=/people/2564 target=_blank>Hyacinthus</a>, or to that of the naked boys. Then these excellent Hellenes are not ashamed, either to behold those publicly whipped who erewhile governed them or to reflect that they were governed by men who are whipped by men who are whipped before the eyes of all? And how is it that you did not reform this abuse? For they say that you interested yourself in the affairs of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a>, as of other people. So far as anything could be reformed, I gave them my advice, and they readily adopted it; for they are the freest of the Hellenes; but at the same time they will only listen to one who gives them good advice. Now the custom of scourging is a ceremony in honor of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=person long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, so they say, and was prescribed by oracles, and to oppose the regulations of the gods is in my opinion utter madness. 'Tis a poor wisdom, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, he replied, which you attribute to the gods of the Hellenes, if they countenance scourging as a part of the discipline of freedom. It's not the scourging, he said, but the sprinkling of the altar with human blood that is important, for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> too held the altar to be worthy thereof; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> modified the ceremony of sacrifice because of its implacable cruelty, and turned it into a contest of endurance, undergone without any loss of life, and yet securing to the goddess as first fruits an offering of their own blood. Why then, said the other, do they not sacrifice strangers right out to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> formerly considered right to do? Because, he answered, it is not congenial to any of the Greeks to adopt in full rigor the manners and customs of barbarians. And yet, said the other, it seems to me that it would be more humane to sacrifice one or two of them than to enforce as they do a policy of exclusion against all foreigners. <br />Let us not assail, said the other, O <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a>, the law-giver <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a>; but we must understand him, and then we shall see that his prohibition to strangers to settle in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> and live there was not inspired on his part by mere boorish exclusiveness, but by a desire to keep the institutions of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> in their original purity by preventing outsiders from mingling in her life. Well, said the other, I should allow the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> to be what they claim to be, if they had ever lived with strangers, and yet had faithfully adhered to their home principles; for it was not by keeping true to themselves in the absence of strangers, but by doing so in spite of their presence, that they needed to show their superiority. But they, although they enforced his policy of excluding strangers, corrupted their institutions, and were found doing exactly the same as did those of the Greeks whom they most detested. Anyhow, their subsequent naval program and policy of imposing tribute was modelled entirely upon that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, and they themselves ended by committing acts which they had themselves regarded as a just casus belli against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, whom they had no sooner beaten in the field than they humbly adopted, as if they were the beaten party, their pet institution. And the very fact that the goddess was introduced from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/453343RChe class=place long=34.3 lat=45.3>Taurus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a> was the action of men who embraced alien customs. But if an oracle prescribed this, what want was there of the scourge? What need to feign an endurance fit for slaves? Had they wanted to prove the disdain that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> felt for death, they had I think done better to sacrifice a youth of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> with his own consent upon the altar. For this would have been a real proof of the superior courage of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a>, and would have disinclined Hellas from ranging herself in the opposite camp to them. But you will say that they had to save their young men for the battlefield; well, in that case the law which prevails among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, and sentences all men of sixty years of age to death, would have been more suitably introduced and followed among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> then among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, supposing that they embrace death in its grim reality and not as a mere parade. These remarks of mine are directed not so much against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a>, as against yourself, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>. For if ancient institutions, whose hoary age defies our understanding of their origins, are to be examined in an unsympathetic spirit, and the reason why they are pleasing to heaven subjected to cold criticism, such a line of speculation will produce a crop of odd conclusions; for we could attack the mystery rite of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235PEle class=place long=23.5415 lat=38.0441>Eleusis</a> in the same way and ask, why it is this and not that; and the same with the rites of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405255PSam class=ethnic long=25.5348 lat=40.5039>Samothracians</a>, for in their ritual they avoid one thing and insist on another; and the same with the Dionysiac ceremonies and the phallic symbol, and the figure erected in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379211PKyl class=place long=21.1393 lat=37.94052>Cyllene</a>, and before we know where we are we shall be picking holes in everything. Let us choose, therefore, any other topic you like, but respect the sentiment of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, which is also our own; for it is better, if we can't hold our tongues about everything, at any rate to preserve silence about such matters as these. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> replied and said, If, O <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a>, you had wished to discuss the topic seriously, you would have found that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> have many excellent arguments to advance in favor of their institutions, proving that they are sound and superior to those of other Hellenes; but since you are so averse to continue the discussion, and even regard it as impious to talk about such things, let us proceed to another subject, of great importance, as I am convinced, for it is about justice that I shall now put a question. </p>                        </div>

But lest we should drag in the opinions of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, and so confuse our discussion, and go off without having formed any conclusions, do you first impart to us the views held by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> concerning justice, for you probably examined their views on the spot; and if their opinion is proved to be correct we will adopt it; but if we have something wiser to put in its place, you must adopt our view, for that too is plain justice. Said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>: Your plan is excellent and most satisfactory to me; so do listen to the conversation which I held there. For I related to them how I had once been captain of a large ship, in the period when my soul was in command of another body, and how I thought myself extremely just because, when robbers offered me a reward, if I would betray my ship by running it into roads where they were going to lie in wait for it, in order to seize its cargo, I agreed and made the promise, just to save them from attacking us, but intending to slip by them and get beyond the place agreed upon. And, said <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a>, did the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> agree that this was justice? No, they laughed at the idea, he said, for they said that justice was something more than not being unjust. It was very sensible, said the other, of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> to reject such a view; for good sense is something more than not entertaining nonsense, just as courage is something more than not running away from the ranks; and so temperance is something more than the avoidance of adultery, and no one reserves his praise for a man who has simply shown himself to be not bad. For because a thing, no matter what, is equidistant between praise and punishment, it is not on that account to be reckoned off-hand to be virtue How then. O <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a>, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, are we to crown the just man and for what actions? Could you have discussed justice more completely and more opportunely, said the other, than when the sovereign of so large and flourishing a country intervened in your philosophic discussion of the art of kingship, a thing intimately connected with justice? If it had been <a href=/people/2065 target=_blank>Phraotes</a>, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, who turned up on that occasion, you might rightly blame me for not gravely discussing the subject of justice in his presence. But you from the account which I gave of him yesterday that the man is a drunkard and an enemy of all philosophy. What need therefore was there to inflict on him the trouble? Why should we try to win credit for ourselves in the presence of a sybarite who thinks of nothing but his own pleasures? But inasmuch as it is incumbent upon wise men like ourselves to explore and trace out justice, more so than on kings and generals, let us proceed to examine the absolutely just man. For though I thought myself just in the affair of the ship, and thought others just too because they do not practice injustice, you deny that this in itself constitutes them just or worthy of honor. And rightly so, said the other, for whoever heard of a decree drafted by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> in favor of crowning so and so, because he is not a libertine, or of granting the freedom of the city to so and so, because the temples have not been robbed by him? Who then is the just man and what are is actions? For neither did I ever hear of anyone being crowned merely for his justice, nor of a decree being proposed over a just man to the effect that so and so shall be crowned, because such and such actions of his show him to be just. For anyone who considers the fate of <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> or <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, will discover that even justice is not sure of success among men, for assuredly these men suffered most unjustly being themselves most just. Still they at least were put to death on the score of acts of injustice imputed on them, and the verdict was a distortion of the truth; whereas in the case of <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> the son of <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a>, it was very justice that was the undoing of him, for he in spite of his integrity was banished merely because of his reputation for this very virtue. And I am sure that justice will appear in a very ridiculous light; for having been appointed by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and by the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> to prevent men being unjust to one another, she has never been able to defend herself against injustice. <br />And the history of <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> is sufficient to me to show the difference between one who is nor unjust and one who is really just. For, tell me, is not this the same <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> of whom your Hellenic compatriots when they come here tell us that he undertook a voyage to the islands to fix the tribute of the allies, and after settling it on a fair basis, returned again to his country still wearing the same cloak in which he left it? It is he, answered <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, who made the love of poverty once to flourish. Now, said the other, let us suppose that there were at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> two public orators passing an encomium upon <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a>, just after he had returned from the allies; one of the proposes that he shall be crowned, because he has come back again without enriching himself or amassing any fortune, but the poorest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, poorer than he was before; and the other orator, we will suppose, drafts his motion somewhat as follows: “Whereas <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> has fixed the tribute of the allies according to their ability to pay, and not in excess of the resources of their respective countries; and whereas he has endeavored to keep them loyal to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, and to see that they shall feel it no grievance to pay upon this scale, it is hereby resolved to crown him for justice.” Do you not suppose that <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> himself would have opposed the first of these resolutions, as an indignity to his entire life, seeing that it only honored him for not doing injustice; whereas, he might perhaps have supported the other resolution as a fair attempt to express his intentions and policy? For I imagine it was with an eye to the interest of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> and subject states alike, that he took care to fix the tribute on a fair and moderate basis, and in fact his wisdom in this matter was conclusively proved after his death. For when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> exceeded his valuations and imposed heavier tributes upon the islands, their naval supremacy at once went to pieces, though it more than anything else had made them formidable; on the other hand the prowess of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> passed on to the sea itself; and nothing was left of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> supremacy, for the whole of the subject states rushed into revolution and made good their escape. It follows then, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, that rightly judged, it is not the man who abstains from injustice that is just, but the man who himself does what is just, and also influences others not to be unjust; and from such justice as his there will spring up a crop of other virtues, especially those of the law-court and of the legislative chamber. For such a man as he will make a much fairer judge than people who take their oaths upon the dissected parts of victims, and his legislation will be similar to that of <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> and of <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a>; for assuredly these great legislators were inspired by justice to undertake their work. </p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a> said: A cataract is at hand, gentlemen, the last for those who are descending the river, but the first to meet you on your way up.

And after fifteen stades they heard another cataract which this time was horrible and unbearable to the senses, for it was twice as loud as the first one and it fell from much higher mountains. And <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> relates that his own ears and those of one of his companions were so stunned by the noise, that he himself turned back and besought <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> not to go further; however he, along with <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a> and <a href=/people/1804 target=_blank>Nilus</a>, boldly pressed on to the third cataract, of which he made the following report on their return. Peaks overhang the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, at the most eight stades in height; but the eminence faces the mountains, namely a beetling brow of rocks mysteriously cut away, as if in a quarry, and the fountains of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> cling to the edge of the mountain, till they overbalance and fall on to the rocky eminence, from which they pour into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> as an expanse of whitening billows. But the effect produced upon the senses by this cataract, which is many times greater than the earlier ones, and the echo which leaps up therefrom against the mountains render it impossible to hear what your companion tells you about the river [ 1]. But the further road which leads up to the first springs of the river was impracticable, they tell us, and impossible to think of; for they tell many stories of the demons which haunt it, stories similar to those which <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> in his wisdom puts into verse about the demon whom he sets over these springs to preserve the due proportions of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>. </p>                        </div>

And the latter caught up sticks and stones and anything which came handy, and called upon one another to avenge the insult to their wives. And it appears that for ten months the ghost of a satyr had been haunting the village, who was mad after the women and was said to have killed two of them to whom he was supposed to be specially attached. The companions, then, of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> were frightened out of their wits till <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said: You need not be afraid, for it's only a satyr that is running amuck here. Yes, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, said <a href=/people/1804 target=_blank>Nilus</a>, it's the one that we naked sages have found insulting us for a long time past and we could never stop his jumps and leaps. But, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, I have a remedy against these hell-<a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a>, which <a href=/people/410 target=_blank>Midas</a> is said once to have employed; for <a href=/people/410 target=_blank>Midas</a> himself had some of the blood of satyrs in his veins, as was clear from the shape of his ears; and a satyr once, trespassing on his kinship with <a href=/people/410 target=_blank>Midas</a>, made merry at the expense of his ears, not only singing about them, but piping about them. Well, <a href=/people/410 target=_blank>Midas</a>, I understand, had heard from his mother that when a satyr is overcome by wine he falls asleep, and at such times comes to his senses and will make friends with you; so he mixed wine which he had in his palace in a fountain and let the satyr get at it, and the latter drank it up and was overcome. And to show that the story is true, let us go to the head man of the village, and if the villagers have any wine, we will mix it with water for the satyr and he will share the fate of <a href=/people/410 target=_blank>Midas</a>' satyr. They thought it a good plan, so he poured four <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> jars of wine into the trough out of which the village <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> drank, and then called the satyr by means of some secret rebuke or threat; and though as yet the latter was not visible, the wine sensibly diminished as if it was being drunk up. And when it was quite finished, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said: Let us make peace with the satyr, for he is fast asleep. And with these words he led the villagers to the cave of the nymphs, which was not quite a furlong away from the village; and he showed them a satyr lying fast asleep in it, but he told them not to hit him or abuse him, For, he said, his nonsense is stopped for ever. Such was this exploit of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, and, by heavens, we may call it not an incidental work in passing, but a masterwork of his passing by [ 1]; and if you read the sage's epistle, in which he wrote to an insolent young man that he had sobered even a satyr demon in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, you will perforce call to mind the above story. But we must not disbelieve that satyrs both exist and are susceptible to the passion of love; for I knew a youth of my own age in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=place long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnos</a> whose mother was said to be visited by a satyr, as he well might to judge by this story; for he was represented as wearing in his back a fawn-skin that exactly fitted him, the front paws of which were drawn around his neck and fastened over his chest. But I must not go further into this subject; but, anyhow, credit is due as much to experience of facts as it is to myself. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> indited to him a letter which he sent by the hands of <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> and of which the text was as follows: <br /><a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> sends greetings to Titus the Roman general. Whereas you have refused to be proclaimed for success in war and for shedding the blood of your enemies, I myself assign to you the crown of temperance and moderation, because you thoroughly understand what deeds really merit a crown.

Now though I am only just thirty years of age, I am held worthy of the same privileges which my father only attained at the age of sixty. I am called to the throne and to rule, perhaps before I have learned myself to obey, and I therefore dread lest I am undertaking a task beyond my powers. Thereupon <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, after stroking his neck, said (for had as stout a neck as any athlete in training): And who will force so sturdy a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>-neck as yours under the yoke? He that from my youth up reared me as calf, answered Titus, meaning his own father, and implying that he could only be controlled by the latter, who had accustomed him from childhood to obey himself. I am delighted then, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, in the first place to see you prepared to subordinate yourself to your father, whom without being his natural children so many are delighted to obey, and next to see you rendering to his court a homage in which others will associate yourself. When youth and age are paired in authority, is there any lyre or any flute that will produce so sweet a harmony and so nicely blended? For the qualities of old age will be associated with those of youth, with the result that old age will gain in strength and youth in discipline. </p>                        </div>

Only such rules, replied the other, as you have laid upon yourself; for in so submitting yourself to your father's will, it is, I think, certain that you will grow like him. And I should like to repeat to you on this occasion a saying of <a href=/people/944 target=_blank>Archytas</a>, which is a noble one and worth committing to memory. <a href=/people/944 target=_blank>Archytas</a> was a man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a> who was learned in the lore of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, and he wrote a treatise on the education of children, in which he says: Let the father be an example of virtue to his children, for fathers also will the more resolutely walk in the path of virtue because their children are coming to resemble them. But for myself, I propose to associate with you my own companion <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, who will attend you as much as you like and instruct you in the whole duty of a good ruler. And what sort of wisdom, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, does this person possess? Courage, he replied, to speak the truth unabashed by anyone, for he possesses the constancy and strength of character of a cynic. And as Titus did not seem very pleased to hear the name of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> [ 1], he continued: And yet in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a>, when he was young, required, it appears, two <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>, and the poet sends these to accompany the youth to the market place of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383204UIth class=place long=20.643 lat=38.453>Ithaca</a>, in spite of their being irrational animals; but you will have a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> to accompany you who will bark in your behalf not only at other people, but at yourself in case you go wrong, and he will bark withal wisely, and never irrationally. Well, said the other, give me your <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> to accompany me, and I will even let him bite me, in case he feels I am committing injustice. I will write him a letter, for he teaches philosophy in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. Pray do so, said Titus, and I wish I could get someone to write to you in my behalf, and induce you to share with me my journey to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>.

Pray do so, said the other, and do so all the more readily because the matter is so important. It is about my own life, said the other, and I would feign know whom I ought most to be on my guard against. That is my question, and I hope you will not think me cowardly for already being anxious about it. Nay, you are only cautious, said the other, and circumspect; for a man ought to be more careful about this than about anything else. And glancing at the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> he swore by that god that he had himself intended to address Titus about this matter even if he had not asked him. For, he said, the gods have told me to warn you, so long as your father is alive, to be on your guard against his bitterest enemies, but after his death against your own kith and kin. And, said Titus, in what way am I to die? In the same way, said the other, as <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> is said to have died, for they say that he too met with his death by the sea. <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> interprets the above utterance as follows: Namely, that he was to be on his guard against the cusp of the fish called the trygon, with which they say <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> was wounded. Anyhow, after he had occupied the throne for two years, in succession of his father, he died through eating the fish called the sea-hare; and this fish, according to <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, causes secret humors in the body worse and more fatal than anything else either in the sea or on land. And <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, he says, introduced this sea-hare in his dishes to poison his worst enemies; and so did <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> in order to remove his brother Titus, not because he objected to sharing his throne with his brother, but to sharing it with one who was both gentle and good. Such was their conversation in private, after which they embraced one another in public, and as Titus departed <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> greeted him with these last words: Pray you, my King, overcome your enemies by your arms, but your father by your virtues. </p>                        </div>

But on this occasion they became such devoted admirers of our hero as to regard him as their second founder and the mainstay of their city.

But his subsequent journeys abroad, though they were numerous, were yet not so many as before, nor did he go to fresh districts which he was not already acquainted with; for when he came down from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> he made a long stay on the sea-board of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and then he returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, and to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=place long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaea</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, never failing anywhere to show himself the same as ever. For, hard as it is to know oneself, I myself consider it still harder for the sage to remain always himself; for he cannot ever reform evil natures and improve them, unless he has first trained himself never to alter in his own person. Now about these matters I have discoursed at length in other treatises, and shown those of my readers who were careful and hard students, that a man who is really a man will never alter his nature nor become a slave.

And when he replied, and told him all about his nightingales and his blackbirds, and how he trained the tongues of stone curlews — as he had himself a very uneducated accent — <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said: I think you are spoiling the accents of the birds, in the first place because you don't let them utter their own notes, which are so sweet that not even the best musical instruments could rival or imitate them, and in the second place because you yourself talk the vilest Greek dialects and are only teaching them to stutter like yourself. And what is more, my good youth, you are also wasting your own substance; for when I look at all your hangers-on, and at your get-up, I should say that you are a delicately bred and somewhat wealthy man; but sycophants steal honey from people like yourself, being ready with tongue poised against them for a sting. And what will be the use to you of all this bird-fancying when the time comes? For if you collected all the songbirds in the world, it would not help you to shake off the parasites that cling to you and oppress you; nay you are forced to shower your wealth upon them and cast your gold before them, and you scatter tidbits before <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>; and to stop their barking you must give again and again, until at last you will find yourself reduced to hunger and to poverty. <br />What you want is some splendid diversion which will instantly make some alteration in your character, otherwise you will wake up one day and find that you have been plucked of your wealth as if it were plumage, and that you are a fitter subject to excite the birds to lament than to sing. The remedy you need to effect such a change is not a very great one; for there is in all cities a class of men, whose acquaintance you have never made, but who are called schoolmasters. You give them a little of your substance with the certainty of getting it back with interest; for they will teach you the rhetoric of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a>, and it is not a difficult art to acquire. I may add that, if I had known you as a child, and come across you then, I should have advised you assiduously to attend at the doors of the philosophers and sophists, so as to be able to hedge round your habitation with a wider learning; but, since it is too late for you to manage that, at any rate learn to plead for yourself; for remember, if you had acquired a more complete training and education, you would have resembled a man who is heavy-armed and therefore formidable; yet, if you thoroughly learn this branch, you will at any rate be equipped like a light-armed soldier or a slinger, for you will be able to fling words at your sycophants, as you would stones at <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>. The young man took to heart this advice, and he gave up wasting his time over birds and betook himself to school, much to the improvement both of his judgment and oh his tongue. </p>                        </div>

A certain man was sacrificing to mother <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> in hope of finding a treasure, and he did not hesitate to offer a prayer to <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> with that intent. He, perceiving what he was after, said: I see that you are a formidable man in business. Nay, but an unlucky one, remarked the other, that have nothing except a few pence, and not enough to feed my family. You seem, said the other, to keep a large household of idle servants, for you yourself seem not to be wanting in wits. But the man shed a quiet tear and answered: I have four daughters, who want four dowries, and, when my daughters have had their dowries assigned to them, my capital, which is now only 20,000 drachmas, will have vanished; and they will think that they have got all too little, while I shall perish because I shall have nothing at all. Therefore <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> took compassion on him and said: We will provide for you, myself and mother <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>, for I hear that you are sacrificing to her. With these words he conducted the man into the suburbs, as if he were going to buy some fruit, and there he saw an estate planted with olive-trees; and being delighted with the trees, for they were very good ones and well grown, and there was a little garden in the place, in which he saw <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>-hives and flowers, he went into the garden as if he had important business to examine into, and then, having put up a prayer to <a href=/people/1765 target=_blank>Pandora</a>, he returned to the city. Then he proceeded to the owner of the field, who had amassed a fortune in the most unrighteous manner, by informing against the estates of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a>, and said: For how much did you purchase such and such an estate, and how much labor have you spent upon it? The other replied that he had bought the estate a year before for the sum of 15,000 drachmas, but that as yet he had spent no labor upon it, whereupon <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> persuaded him to sell it to him for 20,000 drachmas, which he did, esteeming the 5,000 a great windfall. Now the man who wanted to find the treasure did not in the least understand the gift that was made him, indeed he hardly considered it a fair bargain, because, whereas he might have kept the 20,000 drachmas that he had in hand, he now reflected that the estate which he purchased for the sum might suffer from frost and hailstorms and from other influences ruinous to the crops. But when he found a jar almost at once in the field containing 3,000 darics, close by the beehive in the little garden, and when he got a very large yield from the olive-trees, when everywhere else the crops had failed, he began to hymn the praises of the sage, and his house was crowded with suitors for the hand of his daughters urging their suits upon him. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, though on other grounds he thought his conduct absurd, yet as the islanders were not averse of the idea, but said that the fame of the goddess would be greatly enhanced if she had a lover, determined to purge the temple of all this nonsense; and when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=ethnic long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidians</a> asked him if he would reform their system of sacrifice or their litanies in any way, he replied: I will reform your eyes, but let the ancestral service of your temple as it is. Accordingly he called to him the languishing lover and asked him if he believed in the existence of the gods: and when he replied that he believed in their existence so firmly that he was actually in love with them, and mentioned a marriage with one of them which he hoped to celebrate shortly, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> replied: The poets have turned your poor head by their talk of unions of <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a> and <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a> and other heroes with goddess; but I know this much about loving and being loved: gods fall in love with gods, and human beings with human beings, and animals with animals, and in a word like with like, and they have true issue of their own kind; but when two beings of different kinds contract a union, there is no true marriage or love. And if only you would bear in mind the fate of <a href=/people/729 target=_blank>Ixion</a>, you would never have dreamed of falling in love with beings so much above you. For he, you remember, is portrayed across the heaven tortured upon a wheel; and you, unless you get out of this shrine, will perish wherever you are upon earth, nor will you be able to say that the gods have been unjust in their sentence upon you. Thus he put a stop to this mad freak, and the man went away who said he was in love, after sacrificing in order to gain forgiveness. </p>                        </div>

A mad <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> had attacked a lad, and as a result of the bite the lad behaved exactly like a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, for he barked and howled and went on all four feet using his hands as such, and ran about in that manner. And he had been ill in this way for thirty days, when <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, who had recently come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349UTar class=place long=34.897 lat=36.9122>Tarsus</a>, met him and ordered a search to be made for the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> which had done the harm. But they said that the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> had not been found, because the youth had been attacked outside the wall when he was practicing with javelins, nor could they learn from the patient what the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> was like, for he did not even know himself any more. Then <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> reflected for a moment and said: O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> is a white shaggy <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>-<a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, as big as an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390212RAmp class=demonym long=21.2 lat=38.95>Amphilochian</a> <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hound</a>, and he is standing at a certain fountain trembling all over, for he is longing to drink the water, but at the same time is afraid of it. Bring him to me to the bank of the river, where there are the wrestling grounds, merely telling that it is I who call him. So <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> dragged the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> along, and it crouched at the feet of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, crying out as a suppliant might do before an altar. But he quite tamed it by stroking it with his hand, and then he stood the lad close by, holding him with his hand; and in order that the multitude might be cognizant of so great a mystery, he said: The soul of <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=person long=28 lat=40>Mysia</a> has been transferred into this boy, and the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> impose the same things upon him as upon <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephus</a>. And with these words he bade the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> lick the wound all round where he had bitten the boy, so that the agent of the wound might in turn be its physician and healer.

I will not say that <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> somewhat lacked wisdom when he set himself to reform the affairs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> rather than those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, or that he was sold in all fairness when, after deceiving others, he found himself deceived, for I fear to offend my readers. But the despotic sway of <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> was not solidly based when Phyton of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=person long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a> made his attempt against him, and in any case he would have been put to death by him, even if the people of that city had not shot their bolts at him; his achievement, then, I think, was by no means wonderful: he only preferred to die in behalf of the liberty of others rather than to endure the death penalty to make himself a slave. And as for <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a>, even today he cannot acquit himself of baseness; for in first commending and then attacking one and the same set of people, he either attacked those whom he felt to be worthy of praise, or he praised those whom he ought to have been openly attacking. Moreover a person who sets himself to abuse good men cannot escape the charge of being envious, while he who flatters the wicked by his very praises of them draws down upon his own head the guilt of their misdeeds, for evil men are only rendered more evil when you praise them. And <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>, if he had addressed <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> in the way he did before the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385228PCha class=place long=22.8416 lat=38.4944>Chaeronea</a> instead of after it, might have preserved him from the guilt of taking up arms against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>; but instead of doing so he waited till harm was done, when he could only reproach him, not reform him. As for <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a>, he must needs incur the censure of every patriot for not seconding <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> in his design of recolonizing <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> had not to fear for any country that was endangered, nor was he in despair of his own life, nor was he reduced to silly and idle speeches, nor was he championing the cause of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=ethnic long=28 lat=40>Mysians</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435268RGet class=ethnic long=26.8 lat=43.5>Getae</a>, nor was he face to face with one who was only sovereign of a single island or of an inconsiderable country, but he confronted one who was master both of sea and land, at a time when his tyranny was harsh and bitter; and he took his stand against the tyrant in behalf of the welfare of the subjects, with the same spirit of purpose as he had taken his stand against <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>. </p>                        </div>

And there are certain braggarts here who foster the tale that it required no great courage to assail a man like <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> who led the life of a female harpist or flautist. But what, I would ask, have they to say about <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>? For he was vigorous in body, and he abjured all those pleasures of music and song which wear away and soften down ferocity; and he took pleasure in the sufferings of others and in any lamentations they uttered. And he was in the habit of saying that distrust is the best safeguard of the people against their tyrants and of the tyrant against the multitude; and though he thought that a sovereign ought to rest from all hard work during the night, yet he deemed it the right season to begin murdering people in. And the result was that while the Senate had all its most distinguished members cut off, philosophy was reduced to cowering in a corner, to such an extent that some of its votaries disguised themselves by changing their dress and ran away to take refuge among the western <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a>, while others fled to the deserts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a>, and others again stooped to compose orations in which his crimes were palliated. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, like <a href=/people/468 target=_blank>Tiresias</a>, who is represented by <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> as addressing to <a href=/people/173 target=_blank>Oedipus</a> the word: <br />'For “tis not in your slavery that I live, but in that of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Loxias</a>,' chose wisdom as his mistress, and escaped scot-free from paying tribute to <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>. Applying to himself, as if it were an oracle, the verse of <a href=/people/468 target=_blank>Tiresias</a> and of <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>, and fearing nothing for himself, but only pitying the fate of others, he set himself to rally round him all the younger men of the Senate, and husband such intelligence as he saw discerned in many of them; and he visited the provinces and in the name of philosophy he appealed to the governors, pointing out to them that the strength of a tyrant is not immortal, and that the very fact of their being dreaded exposes them to defeat. And he also reminded them of the <a href=/people/11002 target=_blank>Panathenaic</a> festival in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, at which hymns are sung in honor of <a href=/people/600 target=_blank>Harmodius</a> and <a href=/people/496 target=_blank>Aristogeiton</a>, and of the sally that was made from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381236DPhy class=place long=23.637 lat=38.14>Phyle</a>, when thirty tyrants at once were overthrown; and he also reminded them of the ancient history of the Romans, and of how they too had been a democracy, after driving out despotism, arms in hand. </p>                        </div>

Now <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> had been intimate with them all the time that Titus shared the throne with his father, and also reigned after his father's death; and he was in constant correspondence with them on the subject of self-control, being anxious to enlist them on the side of the sovereigns whose excellence of character he esteemed. But he did his best to alienate them from <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>, on account of his cruelty, and encouraged them to espouse the cause of the freedom of all. Now it occurred to him that his epistles conveying advice to them were fraught with danger to them, for many of those who were in power were betrayed by their own slaves and friends and womankind, and there was not at the time any house that could keep a secret; accordingly he would take now one and now another of the discreetest of the companions, and say to them: I have a brilliant secret to entrust to you; for you must betake yourself as my agent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to so and so, mentioning the party, and you must hold converse with him and do the utmost I could do to win him over.

And whereas the indictment of <a href=/people/835 target=_blank>Anytus</a> and <a href=/people/746 target=_blank>Meletus</a> ran: <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> commits wrong in corrupting youth and introducing a new religion, we are indicted in such terms as these: So and so commits wrong by being wise and just and gifted with understanding of the gods no less than of men, and with a wide knowledge of the laws. And as for yourself, so far forth as you are cleverer and wiser than the rest of us, so much the more cleverly is the indictment against you drawn up; for <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> intends to implicate you in the charges for which <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> and his associates were banished. But for what crime, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, are they banished? For what is reckoned by the persecutor to be the greatest of latter-day crimes. He says that he has caught these persons in the act of trying to usurp his throne, and accuses you of instigating their attempt by mutilating, I think, a boy. What, as if it were by an eunuch, that I want his empire overthrown? It is not that, he replied, of which we are falsely accused; but they declare that you sacrificed a boy to divine the secrets of futurity which are to be learned from an inspection of youthful entrails; and in the indictment your dress and manner of life are also impugned, and the fact of your being an object of worship to some. This then is what I have heard from our <a href=/people/2191 target=_blank>Telesinus</a>, no less your intimate than mine. What luck, exclaimed <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, if we could meet <a href=/people/2191 target=_blank>Telesinus</a>: for I suppose you mean the philosopher who held consular rank in the reign of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>. The same, he said, but how are we to come across him? For despots are doubly suspicious of any man of rank, should they find him holding communication with people who lie under such an accusation as you do. And <a href=/people/2191 target=_blank>Telesinus</a>, moreover, gave way quietly before the edict which has lately been issued against philosophers of every kind, because he preferred to be in exile as a philosopher, to remain in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> as a consul. I would not have him run any risks on my account anyhow, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, for the risks he runs in behalf of philosophy are serious enough. </p>                        </div>

You had better not trifle, said the other, nor pretend to be afraid when you foresee danger; for if you really thought these accusations terrifying, you would have been away by now and evaded the necessity of defending yourself from them. And would you run away, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, if you were placed in the same danger as myself? I would not, he replied, I swear by <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, if there were someone to judge me; but in fact there is no fair trial, and if I did offer a defense, no one would even listen to me; or if I were listened to, I should be slain all the more certainly because I was known to be innocent. You would not, I suppose, care to see me choose so cold-blooded and lavish a death as that, rather than one which befits a philosopher. And I imagine that it behoves a philosopher to die in the attempt to liberate his city or to protect his parents and children and brothers and other kinsfolk, or to die struggling for his friends, who in the eyes of the wise are more precious than mere kinsfolk, or for favorites that have been purchased by love. But to be put to death not for true reasons, but for fancy ones, and to furnish the tyrant with a pretext for being considered wise, is much worse and more grievous than to be bowed and bent high in the sky on a wheel, as they say <a href=/people/729 target=_blank>Ixion</a> was. But it seems to me the very fact of your coming here will be the beginning of your trial; for though you may attribute your journey hither to your quiet conscience, and to the fact that you would have never ventured upon it if you were guilty, <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> will credit you with nothing of the kind; but will merely believe that you ventured on so hardy a course because you possess some mysterious power. For think, ten days, they say, have not elapsed since you were cited to appear, and you turn up at the court, without even having heard as yet that you were to undergo a trial. Will not that be tantamount to justifying the accusation, for everyone will think that you foreknew the event, and the story of the boy will gain credit therefrom? And take care that the discourse which the say you delivered about the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> and <a href=/people/1281 target=_blank>Necessity</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a> does not come true of yourself; and that, in case destiny has some cruelty in store, you are not marching straight to meet it with your hands tied, just because you won't see that discretion is the better part of valor. And if you have not forgotten the affairs of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>'s reign, you will remember my own case, and that I showed no coward's dread of death. But then one gained some respite: for although <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>'s harp was ill attuned to the dignity that befits a king, and clashed therewith, yet in other ways its music harmonized not unpleasantly with ours, for he was induced thereby to grant a truce to his victims, and stay his murderous hand. At any rate he did not slay me, although I attracted his sword to myself as much by your discourses as by my own, which were delivered against the bath; and the reason why he did not slay me was that just then his voice improved, and he achieved, as he thought, a brilliant melody. But where's the royal nightingale, and where the harp to which we can today make our peace-offerings? For the outlook of today is unredeemed by music, and full of spleen, and this tyrant is as little likely to be charmed by himself, as by other people. It is true that <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> says in praise of the lyre that it charms the savage beast of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> and stays his hand from war; but this ruler, although he has established a musical contest in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and offers a civic crown for those who win therein, nevertheless slew some of them, for whom it was the proverbial swan-sung that they piped or sang. And you should also consider our friends and their safety, for you will certainly ruin them as well as yourself, if you make a show of being brave, or use arguments which will not be listened to. But your life lies within your reach; for here are ships — you see how many there are — some about to sail for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, others for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, others for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, others direct to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>, other still for places beyond <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>. It were best for you to embark on one of these provinces; for the hand of tyranny is less heavy upon these distinguished men, if it perceives that they only desire to live quietly and not put themselves forward. </p>                        </div>

As for me, I am of little account, and if I advised him not to throw somersaults upon naked swords, nor expose himself to risks with tyrants, than whom none were ever yet deemed harsher, he would not listen to me. As a matter of fact I should never have known, if I had not met you, what he meant by his journey hither; for I follow him more readily, more blindly, than another man would follow himself; and if you asked me where I am bound or for what, I should merely excite your laughter by telling you that I was traversing the seas of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and the bays of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Etruria</a>, without knowing in the least why I took ship. And if only I were courting these dangers after I had received open warning, I could then say to those who asked me the question, that <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> was courting death, and that I was accompanying him on board ship because I was his rival in his passion. But as I know nothing of this matter, it's time for me to speak of what I do know; and I will say it in the interests of my master. For if I were put to death, it would not do much harm to philosophy, for I am like the esquire of some distinguished soldier, and am only entitled to consideration because I am his suite. But if someone is going to be set on to slay him, and tyrants find it easy to contrive plots and to remove obstacles from their path, the I think a regular trophy will have been raised over the defeat of philosophy in the person of the noblest of her human representatives; and as there are many people lurking in our path, such as were <a href=/people/835 target=_blank>Anytus</a> and <a href=/people/746 target=_blank>Meletus</a>, writs of information will be scattered from all quarters at once against the companions of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>; one will be accused of having laughed when his master attacked tyranny, another of having encouraged him to talk, a third of having suggested to him a topic to talk about, a fourth of having left his lecture-room with praise on his lips for what he had heard. I admit that one ought to die in the cause of philosophy in the sense of dying for one's temples, one's own walls, and one's sepulchers; for there are many famous heroes who have embraced death in order to save and protect such interests as those; but I pray that neither I myself may die in order to bring about the ruin of philosophy, and that no one else either may die for such an object who loves philosophy and loves <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>. </p>                        </div>

I would indeed have a wise man sacrifice his life for the objects you have mentioned, but any man without being wise should equally die for them; for it is an obligation of law that we should die in behalf of our freedom, and an injunction of nature that we should die in behalf of our kinsfolk or of our friends or darlings. Now all men are the slaves of nature and of law; the willing slaves of nature, as the unwilling ones of law. But it is the duty of the wise in a still higher degree to lay down their lives for the tenets they have embraced. Here are interests which neither law has laid upon us, nor nature planted in us from birth, but to which we have devoted ourselves out of mere strength of character and courage. In behalf therefore of these, should anyone try to violate them, let the wise man pass through fire, let him bare his neck for the axe, for he will not be overcome by any such threats, nor driven to any sort of subterfuge; but he will cleave to all he knows as firmly as if it were a religion in which he had been initiated. As for myself, I am acquainted with more than other human beings, for I know all things, and what I know, I know partly for good men, partly for wise ones, partly for myself, partly for the gods, but for tyrants nothing. But that I am not come on any fool's errand, you can see if you will; for I run no risk of my life myself, nor shall I die at the hands of a despot, however much I might wish to do so; but I am aware that I am gambling with the lives of those whom I bear such relation as the tyrant chooses, whether he count me their leader or their supporter. But if I were to betray them by holding back or by cowardly refusal to face the accusation, what would good men think of me? Who would not justly slay me, for playing with the lives of men to whom was entrusted everything I had besought of heaven? And I would like to point out to you, that I could not possibly escape the reputation of being a traitor. <br />For there are two kinds of tyrants; the one kind put their victims to death without trial, the other after they have been brought before a court of law. <br />The former kind resemble the more passionate and prompt of wild beasts, the other kind resemble the gentle and more lethargic ones. That both kinds are cruel is clear to everybody who takes <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> as an example of the impetuous disposition which does not trouble about legal forms, <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, on the other hand of the tardy and lurking nature; for the former destroyed his victims before they had any suspicion of what was coming, and the other after he had tortured them with long drawn-out terror. For myself I consider those crueler who make a pretense of legal trial, and of getting a verdict pronounced in accordance with the laws; for in reality they set them at defiance, and bring in the same verdict as they would have done without any real trial, giving the name of law to the mere postponement of their own spleen. The very fact of their being put to death in legal form does not deprive the wretches so condemned to death of that compassion on the part of the crowd, which should be tendered like a winding sheet to the victims of injustice. Well, I perceive that the present ruler cloaks his tyranny under legal forms. But it seems to me that he ends by condemnation without trial; for he really sentences men before they enter the court, and then brings them before it as if they had not yet been tried. Now one who is formally condemned by a verdict in court, can obviously say he perished owing to an illegal sentence, but how can he that evades his trial escape the implied verdict against himself? And supposing, now that the fate of such distinguished persons also rests on me, I do manage to run away from the crisis which equally impends over them and myself, what can save me from no matter where I go on all the earth from the brand of infamy? For let us suppose that you have delivered yourself of all these sentiments, and that I have admitted their correctness and acted on them, and that in consequence our friends have been murdered, what prayers could I offer in such a case for a favorable voyage? What haven could I cast anchor in? To whom could I set out on any voyage? For methinks I should have to steer clear of any land over which the Romans rule, and should have to seek men who are my friends, and yet do not live in sight of the tyrant, and that would be <a href=/people/2065 target=_blank>Phraotes</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=demonym long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonian</a>, and the divine <a href=/people/1186 target=_blank>Iarchas</a>, and the noble <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a>. Now supposing I set out for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, what, my excellent friend, could I tell <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a>? For if I concealed this episode, I should prove myself a lover of falsehood, nay worse, a slave; while if I frankly confessed all to him, I could only use such words as these: O <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a>, <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a> slandered me to you and accused me of things that are not on my conscience; for he said that I was a boaster and a miracle-monger, and one that violated wisdom, especially that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>; but while I am none of these things, I am nevertheless a betrayer of my own friends, and their murderer, and utterly unreliable and so forth; and if there is any wreath for virtue, I come to wear it, because I have ruined the greatest of the Roman houses so utterly, that henceforth they are left desolate. You blush, <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, to hear such words; I see that you do so. What then, if you turn from <a href=/people/1682 target=_blank>Thespesion</a> to <a href=/people/2065 target=_blank>Phraotes</a> and imagine me fleeing to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> to take refuge with such a man as he? How should I look him in the face? How should I explain the motive of my flight? Should I not have to say that when I visited him before, I was a gentleman not too faint-hearted to lay down my life for my friends; but that after enjoying his society, I had at your bidding thrown away with scorn this divinest of human privileges. And as for <a href=/people/1186 target=_blank>Iarchas</a>, he surely would not ask me any questions at all when I arrived, but just as <a href=/people/289 target=_blank>Aeolus</a> once bade <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> quit his island with ignominy, because he had made a bad use of the gift of a good wind which he had bestowed on him, so <a href=/people/1186 target=_blank>Iarchas</a>, I imagine, would drive me from his eminence, and tell me that I had disgraced the draught I there had from the cup of <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a>. For they require a man who stoops and drinks of that goblet, to share the dangers of his friends. I know, <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, how clever you are at chopping logic, and this, I believe, is why you will tender me some further advice, such as this: But you must not resort to those you have named, but to men with whom you have never had anything to do, and then your flight will be secure; for you will find it easier to lie hidden among people who do not know you. Well, let me examine this argument too, and see whether there is anything in it. For this is how I regard it: I consider that a wise man does nothing in private nor by himself alone; I hold that not even his inmost thoughts can be so devoid of witness, that he himself at least is not present with himself; and whether the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> inscription was suggested by <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> himself, or by some man who had a healthy conscience, and was therefore minded to publish it as an aphorism for all, I hold that the sage who “knows himself,” and has his own conscience as his perpetual companion, will never cower before things that scare the many, nor venture upon courses which others would engage upon without shame. For being the slaves of despots, they have been ready at times to betray to them even their dearest; because just as they trembled at imaginary terrors, so they felt no fear where they should have trembled. <br />But <a href=/people/603 target=_blank>Wisdom</a> allows of none these things. For beside the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> epigram, she also praises <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> who regarded “conscience in the case of human beings as a disease which works their ruin, whenever they realize that they have done wrong.” For it was such conscience that brought up before <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> and depicted in his imagination the shapes of the <a href=/people/1558 target=_blank>Eumenides</a>, when he had gone mad with wrath against his mother; for whereas reason decides what should be done, conscience revises the resolutions taken by reason. If then reason chooses the better part, conscience forthwith escorts a man to all the temples, into all the by-streets, into all groves of the gods, and into all haunts of mankind, applauding him and singing his praises. She will even hymn his merits as he sleeps, and will weave around him a chorus of angels from the world of dreams; but if the determination of reason trip and fall into evil courses, conscience permits not the sinner to look others in the face, nor to address them freely and boldly with his lips; and she drives him away from temples and from prayer. For she suffers him not even to uplift his hands in prayer to the images, but strikes them down as he lifts them, as the law strikes down those who rebel against it; and she drives such men from every social meeting, and terrifies them in their sleep; and while she turns into dreams and windy forms all that they see by day, and any things they think they hear or say, she lends to their empty and fantastic flutterings of heart truth and substantial reality of well-found terror. I think then that I have clearly shown you, and that truth itself will convince you, that my conscience will convict me wherever I go, whether to people that know me, or to people that do not, supposing I were to betray my friends; but I will not betray even myself, but I will boldly wrestle with the tyrant, hailing him with the words of the noble <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>: <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> is as much my friend as thine. </p>                        </div>

And he led them, <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> says, to where he was lodging; but <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> declined and said: It is now eventide, and about the time of the lighting up of the lamps and I must set out for the port of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, for this is the usual hour at which these ships sail. However we will dine together another time, when my affairs are on a better footing; for just now some charge would be trumped up against yourself of having dined with an enemy of the Emperor. Nor must you come down to the harbor with us, lest you should be accused, merely for having conversed with me, of harboring criminal designs. <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> accordingly consented, and after embracing them he quitted them, though he often turned back to look towards them and wiped tears from his eyes. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> looked at <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> and said: If you are firmly resolved, and as courageous as myself, let us both embark upon the ship; but if you are dispirited it is better for you to remain here, for you can live with <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> during the interval, since he is as much your friend as mine. But <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> took him up and said: What could I think of myself, if after you have so nobly discoursed today about the duty of sharing the dangers of one's friends, when they fall upon them, I let your words fall on deaf ears, and abandoned you in the hour of danger, and this although until now I have never shown cowardice where you are concerned? You speak rightly, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, so let us depart; I will go as I am, but you must needs disguise yourself as a man of the people, nor must you wear your hair long as you do now, and you must exchange your philosopher's cloak for this linen garment, and you must put away the shoes you wear. But I must tell you what my intention is in this; for it were best to hold out as long as we can before the trial: then I do not wish that you should be a sharer of my fate through being detected by your dress, which will certainly betray you and lead to your arrest; but I would rather that you followed me in the guise of one not sworn to my philosophy, but just attached to me for other reasons, and so accompanying me in all I do. This is the reason why <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> put off his <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagorean</a> garb; for he says he did not do it through cowardice, nor through any regret at having worn it, but merely because he approved of a device to which he accommodated himself to suit the expedience of the moment. </p>                        </div>

Now the Emperor's sword was at that time in the keeping of <a href=/people/3752 target=_blank>Aelianus</a>, a person who long ago had been attached to <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, because he once met him in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. And although he said nothing openly in his favor to <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>, for that his office did not allow of his doing — for how could he have praised to his sovereign's face one who was supposed to be an object of detestation any more than he could intercede in his behalf as for a friend of his own? — nevertheless whatever means there were of helping him in an unobtrusive way, he resorted to in his behalf; and accordingly at the time when, before he arrived, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> was being calumniated to <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>, he would say: My sovereign, sophists ar all prattle and flippancy; and their art is all show, and they are so eager to die because they get no good out of life; and therefore they don't wait for death to come of itself, but try to anticipate and draw it on themselves by provoking those who hold the sword. This I think was the reason which weighed with <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> and prevented his being drawn on by <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> into slaying him. For as he saw that he was anxious for death, he let him off not because he wished to pardon him, but because he disdained to put him to death. <br />Moreover in the case of <a href=/people/1297 target=_blank>Musonius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=person long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenian</a>, who opposed his rule in many ways, he only kept him in the island called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376247IGya class=place long=24.732 lat=37.602>Gyara</a>; and Hellenes are so fond of sophists, that at that time they were all making voyages by ship to visit him, as they now do to visit the spring; for until <a href=/people/1297 target=_blank>Musonius</a> went there, there was no water in the island, but he discovered a spring, which the Greeks celebrate as loudly as they do the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383230WHip class=place long=23.031 lat=38.319>horse's spring</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384228LHel class=place long=23.0154 lat=38.3207>Helicon</a>. </p>                        </div>

Then when the accuser was about to say something still more foolish, <a href=/people/1037 target=_blank>Aelian</a> cut him short and said: Leave me the time that will elapse until his trial begins; for I intend to examine the sophist's character privately, and not before yourselves; and if he admits his guilt, then the pleadings in the court can be cut short, and you can depart in peace, but if he denies his guilt, the emperor will try him. He accordingly passed into his secret court where the most important accusations and causes were tried in strict privacy, and said to the company: Do you depart hence, and let no one remain to listen, for such is the will of the Emperor. </p>                        </div>

I was a tribune only then, but the Emperor took me with him because I was already versed in war; while you were so friendly with myself, that when the Emperor was receiving deputations from the cities, you took me aside and told me of what country I was and what was my name and parentage; and you foretold to me that I should hold this office which is accounted by the multitude the highest of all, and superior to all human positions at once, although to myself it means much trouble and much unhappiness. For I am the sentinel of the harshest of tyrants, whom if I betray, I am afraid of the wrath of heaven. But I have shown you how friendly I am towards yourself, for in reminding you how our friendship began, I have surely made it clear to you that it can never cease, as long as we can remember those beginnings ...If I have said I would question you in private about the charges which your accuser has drawn up against you, it was only a good-natured pretext on my part for obtaining an interview with you, in order to assure you of my own good will, and to warn you of the Emperor's designs. Now what his verdict will be in your case I do not know; but his temper is that of people who are anxious to condemn a person, but are ashamed to do so except upon some real evidence, and he wishes to make you an excuse for destroying these men of consular rank. So his wishes you see are criminal, but he observes a certain formality in his actions in order to preserve a semblance of justice.

It was in my power to run away from you to many parts of the earth, where your authority is not recognized, and where I should have found myself among wise men, men much wiser than myself, and where I might have worshipped the gods in accordance with the principles of sound reason. I had only to go to the haunts of men who are more beloved of the gods than are the people of this city, men among whom such things as informers and writs of accusation are unknown, because, since they neither wrong one another nor are wronged, they stand in no need of law-courts. But I am come to offer my defense, because I fear to be branded as a traitor; for, if I ran away instead of stating and defending myself, those who are running risks on my account would be brought to ruin.

But the charge which most appeals to the credulity of the Emperor, although I cannot credit it in the least, for I know that you are opposed even to shedding the blood of victims, is the following: they say that you visited <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> in the country, and that you cut up an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a> boy for him when he was consulting the auspices against the Emperor; and that by such rites as these you roused his ambitions; and that all this was done by night when the moon was already on the wane. This is the accusation as compared with which we need not consider any other, because it far outweighs them all. For if the accuser attacks your dress and your mode of life and your gift of foreknowledge, it is only by way, I assure you, of leading up to this charge; and it was moreover these peculiarities which prompted you to commit the crime of conspiring against the Emperor, so he says, and emboldened you to offer such a sacrifice. You must then be prepared to defend yourself upon these counts, and I would only ask you in what you say to show great respect for the sovereign. And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> replied: That I shall show no disrespect, you may clearly gather from the fact that I am come here to justify myself; and even if my circumstances were such as to embolden me to treat a despot in a haughty manner, I should anyhow submit myself to a man like yourself who also loves me. For though it does not so much matter if you merely fall into the bad <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a> of an enemy — for your enemies will hate you not for reasons which make you an object of public suspicion, but for private causes of offense which you have given them — nothing is graver than to give a friend reason to think ill of you: this is worse than all your enemies put together can effect, for no man can avoid being disliked by the public too for his ill conduct. </p>                        </div>

He accordingly summoned the jailors who had charge of such cases and said: My orders are to detain this man, until the Emperor be informed of his arrival and learn from his lips all he has said to me. And he said this with the air of a man very much enraged; and then he went into the palace and began to attend to the duties of his office. <br />At this point <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> records an incident which in a way resembles and in a way is unlike the episode related of <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> long ago at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. For they were ostracizing <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> because of his virtue, and he had no sooner passed the gates of the city than a rustic came up to him and begged him to fill up his voting sherd against <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a>. This rustic knew no more to whom he was speaking than he knew how to write; he only knew that <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> was detested because he was so just. Now on this occasion a tribune who knew <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> perfectly well, addressed him and asked him in an insolent manner, what had brought him to such a pass. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> replied that he did not know. Well, said the other, I can tell you: for it is allowing yourself to be worshipped by your fellow-men that has led you to be accused of setting yourself on a level with the gods. And who is it, asked the other, that has paid me this worship? I myself, said the other, when I was still a boy in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, at a time when you stayed our epidemic. Lucky it was both for you, and for the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> that was saved. Well this is a reason, said the other, why I have prepared a method of defense for yourself, which will rid you of the charge against you. For let us go outside the gates, and if I cut of your head off with my sword, the accusation will have defeated itself and you will go scot free; but if you terrify me to such an extent that I drop my sword, you must needs be thought a divine being, and then it will be seen that there is a basis of truth in the charges made against you. So much coarser and ruder was this fellow than the man who wished to banish <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a>, and he uttered his words with grimace and mocking laughter, but <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> affected not to have heard him, and went on with his conversation with <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> about the delta, about which they say the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> is divided into two branches. </p>                        </div>

For what else is there for us to do until the time comes when the despot will give me such audience as he desires? Will they not think us babblers, said <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, and bores, if we interrupt them in the preparation of their defense, and moreover, it is a mistake to talk philosophy with men so broken in spirit as they. Nay, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, they are just the people who most want someone to talk to them and comfort them. For you may remember the verses of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> in which he relates how <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> mingled in the bowl of wine certain drugs from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> to drown the heartache of the heroes; well, I think that <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> must have picked up the lore of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, and have sung spells over the dejected heroes through their bowl of wine, so healing them by a blending of words and wine. And that is likely enough, said <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, seeing that she came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and was escorted by <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a>; or, if we prefer <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s account, was well acquainted with Polydamna, the daughter of <a href=/people/3707 target=_blank>Thon</a>. However let us dismiss these topics for the moment, for I want to ask you something. I know, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, what you are going to ask me, for I am sure you wish me to tell you what my conversation was about with the consul, and what he said, and whether he was formidable and severe or gentle to me. And forthwith he told <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> all that had passed. Thereupon <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> prostrated himself before him and said: Now I am ready to believe that <a href=/people/1073 target=_blank>Leucothea</a> did really once give her veil to <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, after he had fallen out of his ship and was paddling himself over the sea with his hands. For we are reduced to just as awful and impossible a plight, when some god, as it seems to me, stretches out his hand over us, that we fall not away from all hope of salvation. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> disapproved of the way he spoke, and said: How long will you continue to cherish these fears, as if you could never understand that wisdom amazes all that is sensible of her, but is herself not amazed by anything. But we, said <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, are brought here before one who is quite insensible, and who not only cannot be amazed by us, but would not allow anything in the world to amaze him. Seest thou not, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, O <br /><a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, that he is maddened with pride and vanity? I see it, how can I not? said the other.

And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> replied: If your wealth was acquired by other than holy methods, for example by <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>piracy</a> and administration of deadly drugs, or by disturbing the tombs of ancient kings which are full of gold and treasure, you deserve not only to be put on your trial, but also to forfeit your life; for these things are wealth no doubt, but of an infamous and inhuman kind. But if you acquired your wealth by inheritance or by commerce such as befits free men and not by petty traffic, who could be so cruel as to deprive you under color of law of what you have acquired with its venerable sanction? My property, said the other, has accrued to me from several of my relations, and has centered itself in my single household; and I use it, not as if it belonged to other people, for it is my own; yet not as my own, for I share it freely with all good men. But the informers accused me of having acquired my wealth to the prejudice of the despot; for they say that, if I attached myself to another as his accomplice, my wealth would weigh heavily in his favor. And there is actually an oracular air about the charges made against us, such as that all excess of wealth engenders insolence, or that more than ordinary wealth makes its owner carry his head too high and rouses in him a spirit of pride; and that it prevents him from being a good subject and obeying the laws and rulers who are sent to the provinces; they say indeed that it is very nearly tantamount to giving them a box on the ears, because they grovel to wealthy men or connive at their crime, on account of the influence which wealth gives. <br />Now when I was a stripling, before I had as much as a hundred talent to call my own, I used to think such apprehensions as ridiculous and I had small anxiety on the score of my property; but when my paternal uncle died and in a single day I came in for a reversion of five hundred talents, my mind underwent such a change as those who break <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> effect, when they cure them of being unruly and intractable. And as my riches increased and flowed in to me by land and by sea, I became so much the slave of anxiety about them, that I poured out my substance, partly upon sycophants whom I had to flatter in order to stop their mouths by means of such blackmail, and partly upon governors whose influence I wished to enlist on my side against those who plotted against me, and partly on my kinsmen, to prevent them being jealous of my wealth, and partly on my slaves for fear they should become worse than they were and complain of being neglected. And I also had to support a magnificent flock of friends, for the latter were full of solicitude for me; and some insisted on helping me with their own hands, and others with their warnings and advice. But although I thus fenced my wealth about, and surrounded myself so securely with fortifications, I now am imperiled by it, and I am not yet sure that I shall escape with my life. And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> answered: Take heart, for you have your wealth to go surety for your life; for if it is your wealth which has led to your being confined in bonds, it is your wealth also which, when it is dissipated, will not only release you from this prison, but from the necessity of cherishing and flattering those sycophants and slaves whose yoke it has imposed upon your neck. </p>                        </div>

So he made it a convenient habitation for himself, for he also brought in water in sufficient quantities for the island from the mainland. In consequence, an accusation was trumped up against him, that he had a guilty conscience, and that it was because he was conscious of having committed crimes beyond description, that he transported himself and quitted all other land, feeling that he polluted it, and at the same time had chosen for himself the same form of release as <a href=/people/564 target=_blank>Alcmaeon</a> the son of Amphiareus had done, when after his mother's murder he went and lived on the delta of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383211WAch class=place long=21.1067 lat=38.3388>Achelous</a>.

Some of them were sick, some of them had given way to dejection, some of them expected death with certainty and with resignation, some of them bewailed and called upon their children and their parents and their wives. Whereupon, O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, affected by the spectacle, it seems to me that these people need the drug which I alluded to when I first entered. Whether it be an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> remedy, or whether it grows in every land and only needs wisdom enough to cut it from its root out of her own gardens, let us administer some of it to these poor people, lest their own feelings destroy them before <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> can do it. Let us do so, said <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, for they seem in need of it. Accordingly <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> called them all together and said: Gentlemen, who are sharing with me the hospitality of this poor roof, I am wrung with pity for you, because I feel that you are undoing yourselves, before you know in the least whether the accuser will undo you. For it seems to me that you are ready to put yourselves to death and anticipate the death sentence which you expect will be pronounced against you; and so you show actual courage where you should feel fear, and fear where you should be courageous. This should not be; but you should bear in mind the words of <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371252PPar class=person long=25.1483 lat=37.0844>Paros</a> who says that the patience under adversity which he called endurance was a veritable discovery of the gods; for it will bear you up in your misery, just as a skillful pilot carries the bow of his ship above the wash of the sea, whenever the billows are raised higher than his bark. Nor should you consider as desperate this situation into which you have been brought against your wills, but I myself of my own accord. <br />For if you admit the charges brought against you, you ought rather to deplore the day when your judgment and impulses betrayed you into unjust and cruel courses of action. But if you, my friend yonder, deny that you took up your residence in the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383211WAch class=place long=21.1067 lat=38.3388>Achelous</a> for the reason which your accuser alleges; and you there, that you ever raised your wealth to the peril and endangering of the sovereignty; and you again that you of set purpose deprived the sovereign of his pretension to be called the son of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, — if, I say, you can prove that the several reasons alleged for your being, each of you, here in such parlous plights, are unfounded, what then is the meaning of all this lamentation about things which have no existence or reality? For instead of crying after your friends and relatives, you ought rather to feel just as much courage as you now feel despair; for such I imagine are the rewards of the endurance I have described. But perhaps you would argue that confinement here and life in a prison are hard to bear in themselves? Or do you look upon them as the mere beginning of what you expect to suffer? Or do you think that they are punishment sufficient in themselves, even if you are exposed to nothing else in the way of penalty? Well, I understand human nature, and I will preach you a sermon which is very unlike the prescriptions of physicians, for I shall implant strength in you and will avert death from you. We men are in a prison all that time which we choose to call life. For this soul of ours, being bound and fettered in a perishable body, has to endure many things, and be the slave of all the affections which visit humanity; and the men who first invented a dwelling seem to me not to have known that they were only surrounding their kind in a fresh prison; for, to tell you the truth, all those who inhabit palaces and have established themselves securely in them, are, I consider, in closer bonds in them than any whom they may throw into bonds. And when I think of cities and walls, it seems to me that these are common prisons, so that the merchants are in chains, in chains no less than the members of the Assembly, and the frequenters also of spectacles, as well as those who organize public processions. Then there are the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> who go about upon wagons; they are just as much in chains as ourselves; for rivers like the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412369WThe class=place long=36.942 lat=41.194>Thermodon</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/473393WTan class=place long=39.336 lat=47.268>Tanais</a> hem them in, and they are very difficult to cross, except when they are hard frozen; and they fix up their houses on their wagons, and they imagine they are driving about, when they are merely cowering in them. And if you don't think it too silly a thing to say, there are those who teach that the ocean also encompasses the earth in order to chain it in. Come, O ye poets, for this is your domain. Recite your rhapsodies to this despondent crowd, and tell them how <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> was once put in bonds by the wiles of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>; and <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>, the most warlike of gods, was first enchained in heaven by <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a>, and later upon earth by the sons of <a href=/people/1864 target=_blank>Aloeus</a>. When we think of these things, and reflect on the many wise and blessed men who have been thrown into prison by wanton mobs, or insulted by despots, let us accept our fate with resignation, that we may not be found inferior to those who have accepted the same before us. Such were the words which he addressed to his companions in the prison, and they had such an effect upon them that most of them took their food and wiped away their tears, and walked in hope, believing that they could never come to harm as long as they were in his company. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, I believe, has recorded them in his anxiety to omit nothing; I only give what is to the point. It was evening, and it was already the fifth day of his imprisonment, when a certain person entered the prison, who spoke the Hellenic tongue, and said: Where is the man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378346PTya class=place long=34.57 lat=37.82>Tyana</a>?

I will keep your secret, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, for it is only <a href=/people/1037 target=_blank>Aelian</a>, I think, who can know so much. Moreover, said the other, word has been given to the chief jailer to supply you with everything which you may want. You are very kind, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, but I lead exactly the same life here as I would outside; for I converse about casual topics, and I do not need anything. And do you not, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, need someone to advise you how to converse with the Emperor? Yes by heaven, he replied, if only he will not try to get me to flatter him. And what if he merely advised you not to slight him nor flout him? He could give no better advice, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, and it is what I have made up my own mind to do. Well, it was about this that I am come, said the other, and I am delighted to find you so sensibly disposed; but you ought to be prepared for the way in which the Emperor speaks, and also for the disagreeable quality of his face; for he talks in a deep voice, even if he is merely engaged in a gentle conversation, and his eyebrows overhang the sockets of his eyes and his cheeks are so bloated with bile, that this distinguishes him more than anything else. We must not be frightened, O man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378346PTya class=place long=34.57 lat=37.82>Tyana</a>, by these characteristics, for they rather belong to nature than to anything else, and they always are the same. And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> replied: <br />If <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> could go into the cave of <a href=/people/882 target=_blank>Polyphemus</a>, without having been informed beforehand either of the giant's size, or what he ate, or of how he thundered with his voice, and yet did not lose his presence of mind, though he was in some trepidation to begin with; and if he left his cave after acquitting himself like a man, I too shall be quite satisfied if I get off with my own life and with that of my companions, in whose behalf I incur this risk. Such were the words that passed between him and his visitor, and after reporting them to <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> he went to sleep. </p>                        </div>

Well, he made these remarks not really about <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> — for we were not interested about how to keep <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> and wild beasts — but he was really supplying a curb and rein for tyrants of such a kind as he thought would in practice keep them within the lines of good sense and moderation.

When he halted at the Palace and beheld the throng of those who were either being courted or were courting their superiors, and heard the din of those who were passing in and out, he remarked: It seems to me, O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, that this place resembles a bath; for I see people outside hastening in, and those within, hastening out; and some of them resemble people who have been thoroughly washed, and others those who have not been washed at all. This saying is the inviolable property of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, and I wish it to be reserved to him and not ascribed to this man and that, for it is so thoroughly and genuinely his, that he has repeated it in one of his letters. There he saw a very old man who was trying to get an appointment, and in order to do so was groveling before the Emperor and fawning upon him. Here is one, he said, O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, whom not even <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> so far has been able to run away from a master who is raging mad. Yes, a master, said <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, that we ourselves, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, have chosen for our own; for that is why we are standing here at such gates as these. It seems to me, O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, said the other, that you imagine <a href=/people/255 target=_blank>Aeacus</a> to be warden of these gates, as he is said to be of the gates of <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>; for verily you look like a dead man. Not dead yet, said <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, but shortly to be so. And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> answered: O <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, you do not seem to me to take very kindly to death, although you have been with me some time, and have studied philosophy from your first youth. But I had imagined that you were prepared for it, and had also acquainted yourself with all the strategy and tactical resources that I have at my command; for just as men in battle, no matter how heavily armed they are, require not merely pluck, but also a knowledge of tactics to interpret to them the right opportunities of battle, so also philosophers must wait for the right opportunities when to die; so that they be not taken off their guard, nor like suicides rush into death, but may greet their enemies upon ground of their own good choosing. But that I made my choice well of a moment to die in and found an occasion worthy of a philosopher, supposing anyone wants to kill him, I have both proved to others before whom I defended myself in your presence, and am tired of teaching yourself the same. </p>                        </div>

And the Emperor was wearing a wreath of olive leaves, for he had just been offering a sacrifice to <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> in the hall of <a href=/people/430 target=_blank>Adonis</a> and this hall was bright with baskets of flowers, such as the Syrians at the time of the festival of <a href=/people/430 target=_blank>Adonis</a> make up in his honor, growing them under their very roofs. Though the Emperor was engaged with his religious rites, he turned round, and was so much struck by <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>' appearance, that he said: O <a href=/people/1037 target=_blank>Aelian</a>, it is a demon that you have introduced to me. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, without losing his composure, made free to comment upon the Emperor's words, and said: As for myself, I imagined that <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> was your tutelary goddess, O sovereign, in the same way as she was <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomede</a>'s long ago in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>; for she removed the mist which dulls the eyes of men from those of <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomede</a>, and endowed him with the faculty of distinguishing gods from men. But the goddess has not yet purged your eyes as she did his, my sovereign; yet it were well, if <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> did so, that you might behold her more clearly and not confuse mere men with the forms of demons. And you, said the Emperor, O philosopher, when did you have this mist cleared away from your eyes? Long ago, said he, and ever since I have been a philosopher. How comes it then, said the Emperor, that you have come to regard as gods persons who are most hostile to myself? And what hostility, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, is there between yourself and <a href=/people/1186 target=_blank>Iarchas</a> or <a href=/people/2065 target=_blank>Phraotes</a>, both of them <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> and the only human beings that I regard as gods and meriting such a title? Don't try to put me off with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, said the Emperor, but just tell me about your darling <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> and his accomplices. Am I to plead his cause, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, or — ? No, you shall not plead it, said the Emperor, for he has been taken red-handed in guilt; but just prove to me, if you can, that you are not yourself equally guilty as being privy to his designs. If, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, you would hear how far I am in his counsel, and privy to his designs, please hear me, for why should I conceal the truth? Now the Emperor imagined that he was going to hear <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> confess very important secrets, and that whatever transpired would conduce to the destruction of the persons in question. </p>                        </div>

And as for his friends, for I suppose you refer to <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a> and Orphitus — these men also are discreet, so far as I know, and averse from wealth, somewhat sluggish to do all they lawfully may; while as for revolution, they are the last people in the world either to plan it or to take part with another who should do so. But the Emperor was inflamed with anger at what he heard and said: Then you mean to say that I am guilty of slander in their cases, since you assert that they are good men, only sluggish, whom I have ascertained to be the vilest of man kind and usurpers of my throne. For I can imagine that they too, if I put the question to them about you, would in their turn deny that you were a wizard and a hot-head and a braggart and a miser, and that you looked down on the laws. And so it is, you accursed rascals, that you all hold together like thieves. But the accusation shall unmask everything; for I know, as well as if I had been present and taken part in everything, all the oaths which you took, and the objects for which you took them, and when you did it, and what was, your preliminary sacrifice. At all this <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> did not even blench, but merely remarked: It is not creditable to you, O sovereign, nor is it congruous with the law, that you should either pretend to try a case affecting persons about whom you have already made up your mind, or should have made it up before ever you have tried them. But if you will have it so, permit me at once to begin and plead my defense. You are prejudiced against me, my sovereign, and you do me a greater wrong than could any false informer, for you take for granted, before you hear them, accusations which he only offers to prove. Begin your defense, said the Emperor, at any point you like, but I know very well where to draw the line, and with what it is best to begin. </p>                        </div>

And as regards his imprisonment in bonds, he remarked: If you think me a wizard, how will you ever fetter me? And if you fetter me, how can you say that I am a wizard?

But he had a more plausible mission; for whereas the first one beat about the bush, this one took up his parable straight from what he saw before him, and said: Heavens, who would ever have thought of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> being thrown into chains? The person who threw him, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, for surely he would not have done so, if he had not thought of it. And who ever thought that his ambrosial locks could be cut off? I myself, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, who wore them. And how can you endure it? said the other. As a man well may bear it who is brought to this pass neither with nor without his will. And how can your leg endure the weight of the fetters? I don't know, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, for my mind is intent upon other matters. And yet the mind, said the other, must attend to what causes pain. Not necessarily, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, for if you are a man like myself, your mind, will either not feel the pain or will order it to cease. And what is it that occupies your mind? The necessity, answered <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, of not noticing such things. Then the other reverted to the matter of his locks and led the conversation round to them again, whereupon <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> remarked, <br />It is lucky for you, young man, that you were not one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a> long ago in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>; for it seems to me that you would have raised a terrible hullabaloo over the locks of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, when he cut them off in honor of <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a>, supposing he really did so, and you would at least have swooned at such a spectacle. For if as you say, you are full of pity for my locks which were all grey and frowzy, what would you not have felt over those of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> which were nicely curled and auburn? <br />The other of course had only made his remarks out of malice, in order to see what would make <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> wince, and, by Heaven, to see whether he would reproach his sovereign on account of his sufferings. But he was so shut up by the answers he got that he said: You have incurred the royal displeasure on several grounds, but in particular on those for which <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> and his friends are being prosecuted, namely of injuring the government. For certain informations have been conveyed to him about your words in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>, when you spoke of him in hostile and embittered tones. But they say that he attaches little importance to that matter, because his anger is whetted by the graver charges, and this although the informer from whom he learnt those first charges is a very distinguished person of great reputation. A new sort of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> winner is this you tell me of, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, that pretends to win distinction by the weightiness of his slanders. But I quite realize that he is <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a>, who, I know, does everything against me which he can; and these are far from being the worst injuries which he has done me. For hearing once on a time that I was about to visit the naked sages of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, he set himself to poison their minds against me and if I had not seen through his malignant designs, I should probably have gone away without even seeing their company. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=demonym long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracusan</a> then, much astonished at this remark, said: Then you think it a much lesser thing to be traduced to the Emperor than to forfeit your good repute in the eyes of the naked sages owing to the insinuations dropped against you by <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a>? Yes, by Heaven, he said, for I was going there as a learner, whereas I am come here with a mission to teach. And what are you going to teach? said the other. That I am, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, a good and honorable man, a circumstance this of which the Emperor is not yet aware. But you can, said the other, get out of your scrape if you only will teach him things, which if you had told him before you came here, you would never have been cast into prison. Now <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> understood that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=demonym long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracusan</a> was trying to drive him into some such admission as the Emperor had tried to get out of him, and that he imagined that out of sheer weariness of his imprisonment he would tell some falsehood to the detriment of his friends, and, accordingly he answered: My excellent friend, if I have been cast into prison for telling <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> the truth, what would happen to me if I refrained from telling it? For he apparently regards truth as something to be punished with imprisonment, just as I regard falsehood. </p>                        </div>

For athletes resort to this art, just as do all who have to undergo a contest in their eagerness to win; and although it contributes nothing to their success, nevertheless these unfortunate people, after winning by mere chance as they generally do, rob themselves of the credit and attribute it to this art of wizardry. Nor does any amount of failure in their enterprises shake their faith in it, they merely say such things as this: If I had only offered this sacrifice or that, if I had only burnt that perfume in place of another, I should not have failed to win. And they really believe what they say. Magic also besieges the doors of merchants no less, for we shall find them too attributing their successes in trade to the wizard or magician, no less than they ascribe their losses to their own parsimony and to their failure to sacrifice as often as they should have done. But is especially lovers who are addicted to this art; for as the disease which they suffer from in any case renders them liable to be deluded, so much so that they go to old hags to talk about it, it is no wonder, I think, that they resort to these impostors and give ear to their quackeries. They will accept from them a magic girdle to wear, as well as precious stones, some of the bits of stone having come from the depths of the earth and others from the moon and stars; and then they are given all the spices which the gardens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> yield; and the cheats exact vast sums of money from them for all this, and yet do nothing to help them at all. For let their favorites only give them the least encouragement, or let the attractions of the lover's presents advance his suit in the very least, and he at once sets out to laud the art as able to achieve anything; while if the experiment does not come off, he is as ready as ever to lay the blame on some omission, for he will say that he forgot to burn the spice, or to sacrifice or melt up that, and that everything turned upon that and it was impossible to do without it. Now the various devices and artifices by which they work signs from heaven and all other miracles on a wide scale, have been actually recorded by certain authors, who laugh outright at the art in question. But for myself I would gladly denounce such arts in order to prevent young men from resorting to its professors, lest they become accustomed to such things even in fun. This digression has led me far enough from my subject; for why should I attack any further a thing which is equally condemned by nature and by law? </p>                        </div>

For he relates that there came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372219PMes class=place long=21.9195 lat=37.1779>Messene</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a> a youth remarkable for his beauty, and found there many admirers, and above all <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>, whose rivals even the former did not scruple to declare themselves, so strong was their attachment. The youth however was too high-principled and respected his honor. Now had it been gold that he scorned or possessions or <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, or such other attractions and lures as sundry persons seek to corrupt young people with, we had no call to praise him, for the seducer can hardly dispense with such preparations. But he was tempted with larger honors than all those put together who ever attracted the glances of sovereigns, yet he disdained them all for himself. In consequence, he was cast into prison by his own admirer's orders. He came up to <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, and made as if he would speak to him, but, being counseled by his modesty to keep silent, did not venture to. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> noticed this and said: You are confined here, and yet are not of an age to be a malefactor, like ourselves who are hardened sinners. Yes, and I shall be put to death, said the other; for by our latter-day laws self-respect is honored with capital punishment. So it was in the time of <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>, answered <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, for <a href=/people/560 target=_blank>Hippolytus</a> was murdered by his own sire for the same reason. And I too, said the other, am my own father's victim. For though I am an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372219PMes class=place long=21.9195 lat=37.1779>Messene</a>, he did not give me an Hellenic education, but sent me here to study law; and when I had come here for that purpose the Emperor cast an evil eye on me. But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> feigned not to understand what he meant and said: Tell me, my boy, surely the Emperor does not imagine you have blue eyes, when you have, as I see, black ones? Or that you have a crooked nose, whereas it is square and regular, like that of a well executed <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>? or has he not made some mistake about your hair? For, methinks, it is sunny and gleaming, and your mouth too is so regular, that whether you are silent or talking, it is equally comely, and you carry your head freely and proudly. Surely the Emperor must be mistaking all these traits for others, or you would not tell me he has cast an evil eye on you. That is just what ruined me, said the other, for he has condescended to favor me and instead of sparing what he praises is prepared to insult me as a woman's lovers might. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> admired the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a> too much to ply him with such question as what he thought of sleeping together, as whether it was disgraceful or not, and others of the sort, as he noticed that he blushed and was not decorous in his language; so he only put to him the question: Have you any slaves in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a>? Why yes, many, replied the lad. What conversation to them, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, do you consider yourself as holding? That, he replied, which the laws assign to me, for I am their master. And must slaves obey their masters or disdain the wishes of those who are masters of their persons? The other discerned the drift of his question and answered: I know indeed how irresistible and harsh is the power of tyrants, for they are inclined to use it to overpower even free men, but I am master of my person and shall guard it inviolate. How can you do that, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, for you have to do with an admirer who is prepared to run amuck of your youth, sword in hand? I shall simply hold out my neck, which is all his sword requires. Whereupon <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> commended him, and said: I perceive you are an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a>. Moreover, he mentions this youth in one of his letters, and gives a much more attractive account of him than I have done in the above, and while praising him for his high principles to his correspondent, adds that he was not put to death by the tyrant. On the contrary, after exciting admiration by his firmness, he returned by ship to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364232LMal class=place long=23.198 lat=36.436>Malea</a>, and was held in more honor by the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a> than the youths who among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> surpass their fellows in their endurance of the scourge. </p>                        </div>

For on his way thither he asked the secretary who was conducting him, where they were going; and when the latter answered that he was leading him to the court, he said: Whom am I going to plead against? Why, said the other, against the accuser of course, and the Emperor will be judge. And, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, who is going to judge between myself and the Emperor? For I shall prove that he is wronging philosophy. And what concern, said the other, has the Emperor for philosophy, even if he does happen to be wrong? Nay, but philosophy, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, is much concerned about the Emperor, that he should govern as he should. The secretary commanded this sentiment, for indeed he was already favorably disposed to <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, as he proved from the very beginning. And how long will your pleading last by the water-clock's reckoning? For I must know this before the trial begins. If, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, I am allowed to plead as long as the necessities of the suit require me to, the whole of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> might run through the meter before I should have done; but if I am only to answer the questions put to me, then it depends on the cross-examiner how long I shall be making my answers. You have cultivated, remarked the other, contrary talents when you thus engage to talk about one and the same matter both with brevity and with prolixity. They are not contrary talents, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, but resemble each other. And moreover there is a mean composed between the two, which I should not myself allege to be a third, but a first requisite for a pleader; and for my own part I am sure that silence constitutes a fourth excellence much required in a law-court.

What induces you, he said, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, to dress yourself differently from everybody else, and to wear this peculiar and singular garb? Because, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, the earth which feeds me also clothes me, and I do not like to bother the poor animals.

The third question related to the plague in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>: What motived, he said, or suggested your prediction to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=ethnic long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesians</a> that they would suffer from a plague? I used, he said, O my sovereign, a lighter diet than others, and so I was the first to be sensible of the danger; and if you like, I will enumerate the causes of pestilences. But the Emperor, fearful, I imagine, lest <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> should reckon among the causes of such epidemics his own wrong-doing, and his incestuous marriage, and his other misdemeanors, replied: Oh, I do not want any such answers as that. And when he came to the fourth question which related to <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> and his friends, instead of hurrying straight on to it, he allowed a certain interval to elapse, and after long reflection, and with the air of one who felt dizzy, he put his question in a way which surprised them all; for they expected him to throw off all disguise and blurt out the names of the persons in question without any reserve, complaining loudly and bitterly of the sacrifice; but instead of putting the question in this way, he beat about the bush, and said: Tell me, you went out of your house on a certain day, and you traveled into the country, and sacrificed the boy — I would like to know for whom? And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> as if he were rebuking a child replied: Good words, I beseech you; for I did leave my house, I was in the country; and if this was so, then I offered sacrifice: and if I offered it, then I ate of it. But let these assertions be proved by trustworthy witnesses. Such a reply on the part of the sage aroused louder applause than beseemed the court of an Emperor; and the latter deeming the audience to have borne witness in favor of the accused, and also not a little impressed himself by the answers he had received, for they were both firm and sensible, said: I acquit you of the charges; but you must remain here until we have had a private interview. Thereat <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> was much encouraged and said: I thank you indeed, my sovereign, but I would fain tell you that by reason of these miscreants your cities are in ruin, and the islands full of exiles, and the mainland of lamentations, and your armies of cowardice, and the Senate of suspicion. Accord me also, if you will, opportunity to speak; but if not, then send someone to take my body, for my soul you cannot take. Nay, you cannot take even my body, <br />For thou shalt not slay me, since — I tell thee — I am not mortal. <br />And with these words he vanished from the court, which was the best thing he could do under the circumstances, for the Emperor clearly intended not to question him sincerely about the case, but about all sorts of irrelevant matters. For he took great credit to himself for not having put <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> to death, nor was the latter anxious to be drawn into such discussions. And he thought that he would best effect his end if he left no one in ignorance of his true nature, but allowed it to be known to all to be such that he had it in him never to be taken prisoner against his own will. Moreover he had no longer any cause for anxiety about his friends; for as the despot had not the courage to ask any questions about them, how could he possibly put them to death with any color of justice upon charges for which no evidence had been presented in court? Such was the account of the proceedings of the trial which I found. </p>                        </div>

For I am well aware, indeed, that those who highly esteem the style of buffoons will find fault in it, as being less chaste and severe in its style than they consider it should be, and as too bombastic in language and tone. However, when I consider that <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> was a sage, it seems to me that he would have unworthily concealed his true character if he had merely studied symmetry of endings, and antithesis, clicking his tongue as if it had been a castanet. For these tricks suit the genius of rhetoricians, though they are not necessary even to them. For forensic art, if it be too obvious, is apt to betray him who resorts to it as anxious to impose upon the judges; whereas if it is well concealed, it is likely to carry off a favorable verdict; for true cleverness consists in concealing from the judges the very cleverness of the pleader. But when a wise man is defending his cause — and I need not say that a wise man will not arraign another for faults which he has the will and strength to rebuke — he requires quite another style than that of the hacks of the law-court; and though his oration must be well-prepared, it must not seem to be so, and it should possess a certain elevation almost amounting to scorn, and he must take care in speaking not to throw himself on the pity of the judges. For how can he appeal to the pity of others who would not condescend to solicit anything? Such an oration will my hero's seem to those who shall diligently study both myself and him; for it was composed by him in the following manner: </p>                        </div>

Since, however, so grave a peril besets us both, I will not hesitate to tender you the advice of whose excellence I am myself convinced. For since the accuser has plunged us into this struggle, the many have been led to form a false opinion of both myself and of you. They have come to imagine that you will listen only to the counsels of anger, with the result that you will even put me to death, whatever death means, and that I in turn shall try to evade this tribunal in some of the ways there are — and they were, my prince, myriad — of escaping from it. Though rumors have reached my ears, I have not contracted any prejudice against you, nor have I done you the injury of supposing you will hear my cause otherwise than in accordance with the strictest principles of equity; for in conformity with the laws I submit myself to their pronouncement. And I would advise you also to do the same; for justice demands that you should neither prejudge the case, nor take your seat on the bench with your mind made up to the belief that I have done you any wrong. If you were told that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=demonym long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonian</a> and other foreign potentates were about to inflict some disaster on you, which must lead to the loss of your empire, you would, I am sure, laugh outright; although they have hosts of cavalry, all kinds of archers, a gold bearing soil and, as I know full well, a teeming population. And yet you distrust a philosopher, naked of means of offense, and are ready to believe he is a menace to the autocrat of the Romans — all this on the mere word of an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> sycophant. Never did you here such tales from <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, whom you allege to be your guardian spirit, unless indeed, great Heavens!, their flattering and falsely accusing others has so increased the influence of these miscreants, that you would pretend that whereas in insignificant matters, such as sore eyes, and avoidance of fevers and inflammation of the bowels, the Gods are your apt advisers, manipulating and healing you after the manner of physicians of anyone of these maladies you may be suffering from, they, nevertheless, in matters which imperil your throne and your life, give you no counsel either as to the persons you should guard against or as to the weapons you should employ against them, but, instead of coming to your aid, leave you to the tender mercies of false accusers, whom you regard as the Aegis of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> or the hand of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, just because they assert that they understand your welfare better even than do the gods, and that they watch over you in the hours of their waking and sleeping, if indeed these wretches can sleep after pouring out such wicked lies and compiling ever and anon whole Iliads such as this one. <br />That they should keep <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and roll theatrically into the forum in chariots drawn by snowy teams, that they should gorge themselves off dishes of silver and gold, parade favorites that cost them two or three myriad sesterces, that they should go on committing adultery as long as they are not found out and then and not before, marry the victims of their lusts when they are caught red-handed, that their splendid successes should be hailed with applause, as often as some philosopher or consul, absolutely innocent, falls into their toils and is put to death by yourself — all this I am willing to concede to the license of these accursed wretches and to their brazen indifference to the public eye and to law; but that they should give themselves the airs of superhuman beings and presume to know better than the gods, I cannot approve or allow; and the mere rumor of it fills me with horror. And if you allow such things to be, they will perhaps accuse even yourself of offending against established religion. I know that my tone is rather that of a censor than that of a defendant; if so, you must pardon me for thus speaking up in behalf of the laws, with the recognition of whose authority by yourself stands and falls that of your own. </p>                        </div>

For if I called upon <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> to help me, under whom I am conscious of having passed my life, they will accuse me of being a wizard and of bringing heaven down to earth. Let us then appeal in this matter to one whom I deny to be dead, although the many assert it, I mean your own father, who held me in the same esteem in which you behold him; for he made you, and was in turn made by me. He, my prince, shall assist my defense, because he knows my character much better than yourself; for he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> before he was raised to the throne, as much to converse with me about the Empire as to sacrifice to the gods of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. And when he found me with my long hair and dressed as I am at this moment, he did not ask me a single question about my costume, because he considered that everything about me was well; but he admitted that he had come thither on my account, and after commending me and saying to me things which he would have said to no one else, and having heard from me what he would have heard from no one else, he departed. I most confirmed him in his aspirations for the throne, when others had already sought to dissuade him, — in no unfriendly spirit, I admit, though you anyhow can not agree with them; for those who tried to persuade him not to assume the reins of Empire were assuredly on their way to deprive you of the succession to him by which you now hold. But by my advice he did not hold himself unworthy, he said, of the kingdom which lay within his grasp and of making you the heirs thereto; and he fully acknowledged the entire wisdom of my advice, and he was raised himself to the pinnacle of greatness, as in turn he raised yourselves. Now if he had looked upon me as a wizard, he would never have taken me into his confidence, for he did not come and say such things as this to me: Compel the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> or compel <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> to appoint me tyrant, or to work miracles and portents in my behalf, and show me the sun rising in the west and setting at the point where he rises. For I should not have thought him a fit person for empire in he had either considered me as an adept in such art, or resorted to such tricks in pursuit of a crown which it behoved him to win by his virtues alone. More than this my conversation with him was held publicly in a temple, and wizards do not affect temples of the gods as their places of reunion; for such places are inimical to those who deal in magic, and they cloak their art under the cover of night and every sort of darkness, so as to preclude their dupes from the use of their eyes and ears. It is true that he also had a private conversation with me, but there were present at it beside myself <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a> and <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a>, one of them my bitter enemy, but the other my firmest friend; for may never come a time when I shall not reckon <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a> among my friends. Now I ask you, who would begin to talk wizardry in the presence of wise men or of men anyhow laying claim to wisdom? And who would not be equally on his guard both among friends and among enemies of betraying his villainy? And moreover our conversation on that occasion was directed against wizards; for you surely will not suppose that your own father when he was aspiring to the throne set more confidence in wizards than in himself, or that he got me to put pressure upon heaven, that he might obtain his object, when, on the contrary, he was confident of winning the crown before ever he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>; and subsequently he had more important matters to talk over with me, namely the laws and the just acquisition of wealth, and how the gods ought to be worshipped, and what blessings they have in store for those monarchs who govern their people in accordance with the laws. These are the subjects which he desired to learn about, and they are all the direct opposite of wizardry; for if they count for anything at all, there will be an end of the black art. </p>                        </div>

The various arts known to mankind, in spite of the differences of their functions and achievements, are yet all concerned to make money, some earning less, some earning more, and some just enough to live upon; and not only the base mechanic arts, but of the rest those which are esteemed liberal [ 1] arts as well as those which only border upon being liberal, and true philosophy is the only exception. And by liberal arts I mean poetry, music, astronomy, the art of the sophist and of the orator, the merely forensic kinds excepted; and by the arts which border upon liberal I mean those of the painter, modeller, sculptor, navigator, agriculturist, in case the latter waits upon the seasons; for these arts are not very inferior to the liberal professions. And on the other hand, my prince, there are the pseudo-liberal arts of jugglers, which I would not have you confuse with divination, for this is highly esteemed, if it be genuine and tell the truth, though whether it is an art, I am not sure. But I anyhow affirm wizards to be professors of a pseudo-liberal art, for they have get men to believe that the unreal is real, and to distrust the real as unreal, and I attribute all such efforts to the imaginative fancy of the dupes; for the cleverness of this art is relative to the folly of the persons who are deceived by them, and who offer the sacrifices they prescribe; and its professors are given up wholly to filthy lucre, for all their parade of skill is devised by them in hope of gain, and they try to persuade people who are passionately attached to something or another that they are capable of getting everything for them. Do you then find me so opulent as to warrant me in supposing that I cultivate the sort of false and illiberal wisdom, the more so as your own father considered me to be above all pecuniary considerations? And to show you that <br />I speak the truth, here is a letter to me from that noble and divine man, who in it praises me more especially for my poverty. It runs thus: <br />The autocrat <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> to <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> the philosopher sends greetings. <br />If all men, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, were disposed to be philosophers in the same spirit as yourself, then the lot no less of philosophy than poverty would be an extremely happy one; for your philosophy is pure and disinterested, and your poverty is voluntary. Farewell. <br />Let this be your sire's pleading in my behalf, when he thus lays stress upon the disinterestedness of my philosophy, and the voluntariness of my poverty. For I have no doubt he had in mind the episode in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, when <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a> and several of those who pretended to be philosophers approached him, and in no obscure language begged for money; whereas I myself not only did not solicit him for money, but repudiated them as impostors for doing so. And I also showed an aversion from money from my first youth; for realizing that my patrimony, and it was a considerable property, was at best but a transitory toy, I gave it up to my brothers and to my friends and to the poorer of my relatives, so disciplining myself from my very home and hearth to want nothing. I will not dwell upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> and the parts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> beyond the Causasus and the river <a href=/people/2053 target=_blank>Hyphasis</a>, through which I journeyed ever true to myself. But in favor of my life here and no less of the fact that I have never coveted money, I will invoke the testimony of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> here; for he accuses me of every sort of evil deed and design, yet we hear nothing from him of how much money I made by these villainies, nor of how much gain I had in view; indeed he thinks me such a simpleton as to practice my wizardry for nothing, and whereas others only commit its crimes for much money, he thinks that I commit them for none at all. It is as if I cried my wares to the public in such terms as the following: Come, O ye Dupes, for I am a wizard; and I practice my art not for money, but free, gratis, and for nothing; and so you shall earn a great reward, for each of you will go off with nothing but dangers and writs of accusation. </p>                        </div>

O divine <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, do thou defend me upon these counts; for we are put upon our trial for a rule of life of which thou wast the discoverer, and of which I am the humble partisan. For the earth, my prince, grows everything for mankind; and those who are pleased to live at peace with the brute creation want nothing, for some fruits they can cull from earth, others they win from her furrows, for she is the nurse of men, as suits the seasons; but these men, as it were deaf to the cries of mother earth, whet their knife against her children in order to get themselves dress and food.

And it was his rule to give up and leave her animals to the earth; but all things which she grows, he declared, were pure and undefiled, and ate of them accordingly, because they were best adapted to nourish both body and soul. But the garments which most men wear made of the hides of dead animals, he declared to be impure; and accordingly clad himself in linen, and on the same principles had his shoes woven of byblus. And what were the advantages which he derived from such purity? Many, and before all the privilege of recognizing his own soul. For he had existed in the age when <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> was fighting about <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>, and he had been the fairest of the sons of <a href=/people/2909 target=_blank>Panthus</a>, and the best equipped of them all, yet he died at so young an age as to excite the lamentations even of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>. Well after that he passed into several bodies according to the decree of <a href=/people/1436 target=_blank>Adrastea</a>, which transfers the soul from body to body, and then he again resumed the form of man, and was born to <a href=/people/4613 target=_blank>Mnesarchides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=person long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>, this time a sage instead of a barbarian, and an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=demonym long=27.3 lat=38>Ionian</a> instead of a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a>, and so immune from death that he did not even forget that he was <a href=/people/1131 target=_blank>Euphorbus</a>.

But surely the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> is not entitled to judge me for this, but rather the dandies with their yellow and well-combed locks; and let them bring dangling along the company of their lovers and the mistresses of their revels. Let them congratulate and compliment themselves upon their locks and on the myrrh which drips from them; but think me everything that is unattractive, and if a lover of anything, of abstention from love. For I am inclined to address them thus: O ye poor wretches, do not falsely accuse an institution of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor class=ethnic long=22.4 lat=38.7>Dorians</a>; for the wearing of your hair long has come down from the Lacedaemonians who affected it in the period when they reached the height of their military fame; and a king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>, <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a>, wore his hair long in token of his bravery, and in order to appear dignified to his friends, yet terrible to his enemies. For these reasons <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> wears her hair long no less in his honor than in that of <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a> and of <a href=/people/751 target=_blank>Iphitus</a>. And let every sage be careful that the iron knife does not touch his hair, for it is impious to apply it thereto; inasmuch as in his head are all the springs of his senses, and all his intuitions, and it is the source from which his prayers issue forth and also his speech, the interpreter of his wisdom. And whereas <a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a> fastened a fillet of deep purple around his hair, and walked proudly about the streets of the Hellenes, composing hymns to prove that he would pass from humanity and become a god, I only wear my hair disheveled, and I have never needed to sing such hymns about it, yet am hailed before the law courts as a criminal. And what shall I say of <a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a>?

For it is one calculated to fill not only you, my prince, but <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> himself with apprehension. For he declares that men regard me as a god, and that those who have been thunderstruck and rendered stark-mad by myself proclaim this tenet in public. And yet before accusing me there are things which they should have informed us of, to wit, by what discourses, or by what miracles of word or deed I induced men to pray to me; for I never talked among Hellenes of the goal and origin of my soul's past and future transformations, although I knew full well what they were; nor did I ever disseminate such opinions about myself; nor came forth with presages and oracular strains, which are the harvest of candidates for divine honors. Nor do I know of a single city in which a decree was passed that the citizens should assemble and sacrifice in honor of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>. And yet I have been much esteemed in the several cities which asked for my aid, whatever the objects were for which they asked it, and they were such as these: that their sick might be healed of their diseases, that both their initiations and their sacrifices might be rendered more holy, that insolence and pride might be extirpated, and the laws strengthened. And whereas the only reward which I obtained in all this was that men were made much better than they were before, they were all so many boons bestowed upon yourself by me. For as <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>-herds, if they get the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> into good order earn the gratitude of their owners, and as shepherds fatten the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> for the owner's profit, and as <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>-keepers remove diseases from the hive, so that the owner may not lose his swarm, so also I myself, I think, by correcting the defects of their polities, improved the cities for your benefit. Consequently if they did regard me as a god, the deception brought profit to yourself; for I am sure they were the more ready to listen to me, because they feared to do that which a god disapproved of. But in fact they entertained no such illusion, though they were aware that there is between man and God a certain kinship, which enables him alone of the animal creation to recognize the Gods, and to speculate both about his own nature and the manner in which it participates in the divine substance. Accordingly man declares that his very form resembles God, as it is interpreted by sculptors and painters; and he is persuaded that his virtues come to him from God, and that those who are endowed with such virtues are near to God and divine. <br />But we need not hail the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> as the teachers of this opinion, because they were the first to apply to men the titles of just and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> beings and the like, though they are too divine, in all probability, to be applicable to man, but we must mention the <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> temple as their author. For when <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> came to his temple, having just penned his code for the regulation of the affairs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemon</a>, <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> addressed him, and weighed and examined the reputation he enjoyed; and at the commencement of his oracle the god declares that he is puzzled whether to call him a god or a man, but as he advances he decides in favor of the former appellation and assigns it to him as being a good man. And yet the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> never forced a lawsuit on this account upon <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a>, nor threatened him on the ground that he claimed to be immortal; for he never rebuked the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> god for so addressing him, but on the contrary the citizens agreed with the oracle, for I believe they were already persuaded of the fact before ever it was delivered. <br />And the truth about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> is the following: The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> falsely accuse the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> of several things and in particular find fault with their ideas of conduct; but though they do so, they yet approve of the account which they have given of the creator of the Universe, and even have taught it to others, though originally it belonged to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>. Now this account recognizes God as the creator of all things, who brought them into being and sustains them; and it declares further that his motive in designing was his goodness. Since then these notions are kindred to one another, I carry the argument further and declare that good men have in their composition something of God. And by the universe which depends upon God the creator we must understand things in heaven and all things in the sea and on earth, which are equally open to all men to partake of, though their fortunes are not equal. But there is also a universe dependent on the good man which does not transcend the limits of wisdom, which I imagine you yourself, my prince, will allow stands in need of a man fashioned in the image of God. And what is the fashion of this universe? There are undisciplined souls which in their madness clutch at every fashion, and in their eyes laws are out of date and vain; and there is no good sense among them, but the honors which they pay to the gods really dishonor them; and they are in love with idle chatter and luxury which breed idleness and sloth, the worst of all practical advisers. And there are other souls which are drunken and rush in all directions at once, and nothing will repress their antics, nor could do so, even if they drank all the drugs accounted, as the Mandragoras is, to be soporific. Now you need a man to administer and care for the universe of such souls, a god sent down by wisdom. For he is able to wean them from the lusts and passions, which they rush to satisfy with instincts too fierce for ordinary society, and from their avarice, which is such that they deny they have anything at all unless they can hold their mouths open and have the stream of wealth flow into it. For perhaps such a man as I speak of could even restrain them from committing murder; however, neither I myself nor even the God who created all things, can wash off them the guilt of that. </p>                        </div>

Here you have a sally-port of barbarians, who refuse to be subject to yourself; let us then suppose that it was about to be destroyed by a pestilence, and that <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> found a remedy and averted it. I imagine that a wise man would be able to defend himself even against such a charge as that, unless indeed the sovereign desires to get rid of his adversaries, not by use of arms, but by plague; for I pray, my prince, that no city may ever be wholly wiped out, either to please yourself or to please me, nor may I ever behold in temples a disease to which those who lie sick should succumb in them. But granted that we are not interested in the affairs of barbarians, and need not restore them to health, since they are our bitter enemies, and not at peace with our race; yet who would desire to deprive <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> of her salvation, a city which took the basis of its race from the purest Attic source, and which grew in size beyond all other cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a>, and stretched herself out to the sea outgrowing the land on which she is built, and is filled with studious people, both philosophers and rhetoricians, thanks to whom the city owes her strength, not to her cavalry, but to the tens of thousands of her inhabitants in whom she encourages wisdom? And do you think that there is any wise man who would decline to do his best in behalf of such a city, when he reflects that <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> once liberated the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410250PAbd class=place long=24.9833 lat=40.95>Abdera</a> from pestilence, and when he bears in mind the story of <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, who is said to have charmed the winds when they were blowing unseasonably, and who has heard how <a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a> stayed a cloud in its course when it would have burst over the heads of the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373136PAkr class=place long=13.5855 lat=37.2906>Acragas</a>? </p>                        </div>

What then will <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> say here of the lore which he declared he learned from his demonic genius? Or what would <a href=/people/263 target=_blank>Thales</a> and <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a>, both <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=ethnic long=27.3 lat=38>Ionians</a>, say, of whom one foretold a plenteous crop of olives, and the other not a few meteorological disturbances? Why, is it not a fact that they were brought before the law-courts upon other charges, but that no one ever heard among their accusations that of their being wizards, because they had the gift of foreknowledge? For that would have been thought ridiculous, and it would not have been a plausible charge to bring against men of wisdom even in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, where the women had a bad reputation for drawing the moon down to earth. <br />How then did I get my sense of the coming disaster at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>? You have listened to the statement made even by my accuser, that instead of living like other people, I keep to a light diet of my own, and prefer it to the luxury of others, and I began by saying so myself. This diet, my king, guards my senses in a kind of indescribable ether or clear air, and forbids them to contract any foul or turbid matter, and allows me to discern, as in the sheen of a looking glass, everything that is happening or is to be. For the sage will not wait for the earth to send up its exhalations, or for the atmosphere to be corrupted, in case the evil is shed from above; but he will notice these things when they are impending, not so soon indeed as the gods, yet sooner than the many. For the gods perceive what lies in the future, and men what is going on before them, and wise men what is approaching. But I would have you, my prince, ask of me in private about the causes of pestilence; for they are secrets of a wisdom which should not be divulged to the many. Was it then my mode of living which alone develops such a subtlety and keenness of perception as can apprehend the most important and wonderful phenomena? You can ascertain the point in question, not only from other considerations, but in particular from what took place in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> in connection with that plague. For the genius of the pestilence — and it took the form of a poor old man — I both detected, and having detected took it captive: and I did not so much stay the disease as pluck it out. And who the god was to whom I had offered my prayers is shown in the sanctuary I set up in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> to commemorate the event, of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> the Averter (Apotropaios), for I chose him to help me, because he is the wise and courageous god, who once purged of the plague the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=place long=21.374 lat=37.89>Elis</a>, by washing away with the river-tide the foul exhalations which the land sent up under the tyranny of <a href=/people/1015 target=_blank>Augeas</a>. <br />Who then do you think, my prince, being ambitious to be considered a wizard, would dedicate his personal achievement to a god? And whom would he get to admire his art, if he gave the credit of the miracle to God? And who offer his prayers to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, if he were a wizard? For in fact these wretches attribute such feats to the trenches they dig and to the gods of the under-earth, among whom we must not class <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, for he is a pure deity and kindly to men. I offered my prayer to him once on a time also in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a>, for there was an apparition of a lamia there too; and it infested the neighborhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a> and devoured good-looking young men. And <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> lent me his aid in my contest with her, without asking of me any wonderful gifts — nothing more than honey-cake and frankincense, and the chance to do a salutary turn to mankind; for in the case of <a href=/people/247 target=_blank>Eurystheus</a> also this was the only guerdon which he thought of for his labors. I would ask you, my prince, not to be displeased at my mention of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>; for <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> had him under her care because he was good and kind and a <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a> of man. </p>                        </div>

It shall set the truth before you. In all my actions I have at heart the salvation of mankind, yet I have never offered a sacrifice in their behalf, nor will I ever sacrifice anything, nor touch sacrifices in which there is blood, nor offer any prayer with my eyes fixed upon a knife or the kind of sacrifice that he means. It is no <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a>, my prince, that you have got before you, nor a native of some savage and inhospitable land; nor did I ever mingle with <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a> or <a href=/people/2942 target=_blank>Taurians</a>, for in that case I should have reformed even them and altered their sacrificial custom. But to what depth of folly and inconsequence should I have descended if, after talking so much about divination and about the conditions under which it flourishes or does not flourish, I, who understand better than anyone that the gods reveal their intentions to holy and wise men even without their possessing prophetic gifts, made myself guilty of bloodshed, by meddling with the entrails of victims, as unacceptable to myself as they are ill-omened? In that case the revelation of heaven would surely have abandoned me as impure. <br />However, if we drop the fact that I have a horror of any such sacrifice, and just examine the accuser in respect to the statements which he made a little earlier, he himself acquits me of this charge. For if, as he says, I could foretell the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=ethnic long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesians</a> the impending pestilence without use of any sacrifice whatever, what need had I of slaying victims in order to discover what lay within my cognizance without offering any sacrifice at all? And what need had I of divination in order to find out things of which I myself was already assured as well as another? For if I am to be put upon my trial on account of <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> and his companions, I shall repeat what I said to you the day before yesterday when you accused me of such matters. For I regard <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> as a man worthy of the highest office and of all the consideration that belongs to a good name and fame, but as one ill-calculated to carry through any difficult plan; for his frame is undermined by a disease which fills his soul with bitterness, and incapacitates him even for his home affairs. As to yourself, certainly he admires your vigor of body no less than he admires your judgment; and in doing so I think he is not singular, because men are by nature more prone to admire what they themselves lack the strength to do. But <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> is also animated towards myself by feelings of respect; and I never saw him in my presence laughing or joking as he is accustomed to do among his friends; but like young men towards their fathers and teachers, he observes a reverence in every thing that he says in my presence, nay he even blushes; and because he knows that I appreciate and set so high a value upon modesty, he therefore so sedulously cultivates that quality, as sometimes to appear even to me humbler than beseems him. Who then can regard it as probable that <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> is ambitious of Empire, when he is only too glad if he can govern his own household; or that a man who has not the nerve to discuss with me the greatest of all, or would concert with me plans which, if he thought like myself, he would not even concert with others? How again could I retain my reputation for wisdom and interpreting a man's judgment, if I believed overmuch in divination, yet wholly distrusted wisdom? As for Orphitus and <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a>, who are just and sensible men though somewhat sluggish, as I well know to be the case, if they that they are under suspicion of aspiring to become despots, I hardly know over which they make the greater mistake, over them or over <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a>; if however they are accused of being his accomplices, then I ask, which you would most readily believe, that <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> was usurping the throne, or that they had conspired with him. </p>                        </div>

For he does not say that I received any money from them, nor that I was tempted by presents to commit these crimes. But let us consider the point whether I might not have advanced great claims, but have deferred their recognition of them until the time came at which they expected to win the throne, when I might have demanded much and have obtained still more as my due. But how can you prove all this? Call to mind, my prince, your own reign and the reigns of your predecessors, I mean of your own brother, and of your father, and of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> under whom they held office; for it was under these princes chiefly that I passed my life before the eyes of all, the rest of my time being spent on my visit to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>. Well, of these thirty-eight years, for such is the period which has elapsed since then up to your own day, I have never come near the court of princes, except that once in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and then it was your father's, though he was not at that time actually Emperor; and he admitted that he came there on my account. Nor have I ever uttered anything base or humiliating either to emperors, or in behalf of emperors to peoples; nor have I made a parade of letters either when princes wrote them to me or otherwise by pretending that they wrote; nor have I ever demeaned myself by flattery of princes in order to win their largess. If then after long consideration of rich and poor, you should ask me in which class I register myself, I should say among the very rich, for the fact that I want nothing is worth to me all the wealth of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a> and of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385281WPac class=place long=28.0628 lat=38.4804>Pactolus</a>. Is it likely then that I who never would take presents from yourself whose throne I regarded as perfectly secure, should either have gone cadging to mere pretenders, and have deferred the receipt of my recompense from them until such time as I thought would find them emperors; or that I should plan a change of dynasty, who never once, for purposes of my advancement, resorted to that which was already established? And yet if you want to know how much a philosopher may obtain by flattery of the mighty, you have only got to look at the case of <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a>. For why do I speak of his having got mere money out of them? Why, he has perfect fountains of wealth, and already at the banks he discusses prices as a merchant might, or a huckster, a tax-gatherer, a low money-changer, for all these roles are his if there is anything to buy or sell; and he clings like a limpet to the doors of the mighty, and you see him standing at them more regularly than any doorkeeper, indeed he has often been shut away by the doorkeepers as greedy <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> are; but he never yet bestowed a farthing upon any philosopher, but he walls up all his wealth within his own house, only supporting this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> out of the money of others, and whetting against me a tongue which ought to have been cut out. </p>                        </div>

What then is it to be, and from what counts is to defend me? In the act of the accusation, my prince, a regular dirge is chanted over an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a> boy, whom I am accused of having cut up by night, perhaps in a dream, for I am sure I do not know. This child is said to be of respectable parentage and to have possessed all the good looks which <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a> wear even in the midst of squalor. They pretend that I massacred him in spite of his entreaties and lamentations, and that after thus imbruing my hands in the blood of this child I prayed the gods to reveal the truth to me. So far they only attack myself in their charges, but what follows is a direct assault upon the gods; for they assert that the gods heard my prayers under such circumstances, and vouchsafed to me victims of good omen, instead of slaying me for my impiety. Need I say, O my prince, it is defiling even to listen to such stuff? <br />But to confine my pleadings to the counts which affect myself, I would ask who is this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a>? For since he was not of nameless parentage, and by no means slave-like in appearance, it is time for you to ask what was the name of those who begot him and of what family he was, and what city in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a> had the honor of rearing him, and from what altars he was dragged away in order to be sacrificed here. My accuser does not supply this information, in spite of his ingenuity in the art of lying. Let us then suppose it was only a slave in whose behalf he accuses me. For by heaven, we surely must class among slaves one who had neither name of his own, nor parentage, nor city, nor inheritance, must we not? For not a name is supplied anywhere. In that case who was the slave merchant who sold him? Who was it that bought him from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a>? For if this breed is specially suitable for the butchering kind of diviners, he must surely have purchased the boy for much money. And some messenger must have sailed straight to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a> in order to fetch this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a> and conduct him to us. For though one can buy here on the spot slaves from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> or <br /><a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a> — for indeed you can meet whole droves of them being conducted hither, since these like other barbarous races have always been subject to foreign masters, and as yet see nothing disgraceful in servitude; anyhow with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a> it is a fashion even to sell their children, and once they are enslaved, they never think any more about them — yet the Hellenes retain their love of liberty, and no man of Hellas will ever sell a slave out of his country; for which reason kidnappers and slave-dealers never resort thither, least of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a>; for in addition to the fact that they are beyond all other Hellenes jealous of liberty, they also require a great number of slaves themselves. For <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a> contains a vast expanse of grass land and of timber, which covers not only the highlands, but all the plains as well. Consequently they require a great many laborers, many <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>-herds and swineherds, and shepherds and drivers either for the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> or for the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>; and there is much need in the land of woodcutters, a craft to which they are trained from boyhood. And even if the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a> were not such as I have described, so that they could in addition afford like other nations to sell their own slaves abroad, what advantage could the wisdom the accuser babbles of derive by getting a child from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a> to murder and cut up? For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a> are not so much wiser than other Hellenes, that their entrails should convey more bowel-lore than those of other people. On the contrary they are the most boorish of men, and resemble <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>hogs</a> in other ways and especially that they can stomach acorns. <br />It is possible that I have conducted my defense on more rhetorical lines than is my custom, in thus characterizing the habits of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a> and digressing into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a>. What however is my right line of defense? This I think: I never sacrificed blood, I do not sacrifice it now, I never touch it, not even if it be shed upon an altar; for this was the rule of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> and likewise of his disciples, and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> also of the <a href=/people/12221 target=_blank>Naked sages</a>, and of the sages of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, from whom these principles of wisdom were derived by <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> and his school. In adhering to this way of sacrifice they do not seem to the gods to be criminal; for the latter suffer them to grow old, sound in body and free from disease, and to increase in wisdom daily, to be free from tyranny of others, to be wanting in nothing. Nor do I think that it is absurd to ask the gods for benefits in exchange for pure sacrifices. For I believe that the gods have the same mind as myself in the matter of sacrifice, and that they therefore place those parts of the earth which grow frankincense in the purest region of the world, in order that we may use their resources for purposes of sacrifice without drawing the knife in their temples or shedding blood upon altars. And yet, it appears, I so far forgot myself and the gods as to sacrifice with rites which are not only unusual with myself, but which no human being would employ. </p>                        </div>

For on that day, the day on which he says I committed this crime, I allow that, if I was in the country, I offered sacrifice, and that if I sacrificed, I ate of the victim. And yet, my prince, you repeatedly ask me if I was not staying in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> at that time? And you too, O best of princes, were staying there; and yet you would not on that account admit you offered such a sacrifice; and my false accuser was there likewise, but he will not own on that account that he committed murder, just because he was living in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>.

Suppose I were yourself and was being asked this question, inasmuch as you are come to ask questions, why then the answer would be this: I was trumping up actions against decent and respectable people, and I was trying to ruin the innocent, and to persuade the Emperor by dint of hard lying, in order that while I myself climbed to fame, I might soil him with the blood of my victims. If again you ask me as a philosopher, I was praising the laughter with which <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> laughed at all human affairs. But if you asked me as being myself, here is my answer: <a href=/people/1007 target=_blank>Philiscus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367244PMel class=person long=24.4199 lat=36.7389>Melos</a>, who was my fellow-pupil in philosophy for four years, was ill at the time; and I was sleeping out at his house, because he was suffering so terribly that he died of his disease. Ah, many are the charms I would have prayed to obtain, if they could have saved his life. Fain would I have known of any melodies of <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>, if any there are, to bring back the dead to us. Nay I verily think I would have made a pilgrimage even to the nether world for his sake, if such things were feasible; so deeply attached was I to him by all his conduct, so worthy of a philosopher and so much in accord with my own ideals. Here are facts, my prince, which you may learn also from <a href=/people/2191 target=_blank>Telesinus</a> the consul; for he too was at the bedside of the man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367244PMel class=place long=24.4199 lat=36.7389>Melos</a>, and nursed him by night like myself. But if you do not believe <a href=/people/2191 target=_blank>Telesinus</a>, because he is of the number of philosophers, I call upon the physicians to bear me witness, and they were the following: <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404279UCyz class=person long=27.8878 lat=40.3895>Cyzicus</a> and <a href=/people/1253 target=_blank>Stratocles</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/336354PSid class=person long=35.371 lat=33.56>Sidon</a>. Ask them whether I tell the truth. And what is more, they had with them over thirty of their disciples, who are ready, I believe, to witness to the same fact; for if I were to summon hither the relatives of <a href=/people/1007 target=_blank>Philiscus</a>, you might probably think that I was trying to interpose delays in the case; for they have lately sailed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367244PMel class=demonym long=24.4199 lat=36.7389>Melian</a> country in order to pay their last sad respects to the dead. Come forward, O ye witnesses, for you have been expressly summoned to give your testimony upon this point. <br />(The witnesses give their evidence.) <br />With how little regard then for the truth this accusation has been drawn up, is clearly proved by the testimony of these gentlemen; for it appears that it was not in the suburbs, but in the city, not outside the wall, but inside a house, not with <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a>, but with <a href=/people/1007 target=_blank>Philiscus</a>, not slaying another, but praying for a man's life, not thinking of matters of State, but of philosophy, not choosing a revolutionist to supplant yourself, but trying to save a man like myself. </p>                        </div>

What becomes of the absurd stories of victims slain? What is the use of urging you to believe such lies? For what never took place will be real, if you decide that it did take place. And how, my prince, are you to rate the improbability of the sacrifice? For of course there have been long ago soothsayers skilled in the art of examining slain victims, for example I can name <a href=/people/2331 target=_blank>Megistias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388210RAka class=person long=21 lat=38.8>Acarnania</a>, <a href=/people/8877 target=_blank>Aristandrus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=person long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycia</a>, and <a href=/people/816 target=_blank>Silanus</a> who was a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392210PAmb class=place long=20.9899 lat=39.155>Ambracia</a>, and of these the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388210RAka class=demonym long=21 lat=38.8>Acarnanian</a> was sacrificer to <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a> the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=demonym long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycian</a> to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=person long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, and <a href=/people/816 target=_blank>Silanus</a> to <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> the Pretender; and supposing there had been found stored in the entrails of a human being some information truer or more profound or surer than usual, such a sacrifice was not difficult to effect; inasmuch as there were kings to preside over it, who had plenty of cup-bearers at their disposal, besides plenty of prisoners of war as victims; and moreover these monarchs could violate the law with impunity, and they had no fear of being accused, in case they committed so small a murder. But I believe, these persons had the same conviction which I also entertain, who am now in risk of my life of such accusation, namely that the entrails of animals which we slay while they are ignorant of death, are for that reason, and just because the animals lack all understanding of what they are about to suffer, free from disturbance. A human being however has constantly in his soul the apprehension of death, even when it does not as yet impend; how therefore is it likely that when death is already present and stares him in the face, he should be able to give any intimation of the future through his entrails, or be a proper subject for sacrifice at all? <br />In proof that my conjecture is right and consonant with nature, I would ask you, my prince, to consider the following points. The liver, in which adepts at this art declare the tripod of their divination to reside, is on the one hand not composed of pure blood, for all unmixed blood is retained by the heart which through the blood-vessels sends it flowing as if through canals over the entire body; the bile on the other hand lies over the liver, and whereas it is excited by anger, it is on the other hand driven back by fear into the cavities of the liver. Accordingly if, on the one hand, it is caused to effervesce by irritants, and ceases to be able to contain itself in its own receptacle, it overflows the liver which underlies it, in which case the mass of bile occupies the smooth and prophetic parts of the bowels; on the other hand, under the influence of fear and panic it subsides, and draws together into itself all the light which resides in the smooth parts; for in such cases even that pure element in the blood recedes to which the liver owes its spleen-like look and distension, because the blood in question by its nature drains away under the membrane which encloses the entrails and floats upon the muddy surface. Of what use then, my prince, is it to slay a human victim, if the sacrifice is going to furnish no presage? And human nature does render such rites useless for purposes of divination, because it has a sense of impending death; and dying men themselves meet their end, if with courage, then also with anger, and, if with despondency, then also with fear. And for this reason the art of divination, except in the case of the most ignorant savages, while recommending the slaying of <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kids</a> and <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a>, because these animals are silly and not far removed from being insensible, does not consider cocks an <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> and <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> worthy vehicles of its mysteries, because these creatures have too much spirit. I realize, my prince, that my accuser chafes at my discourse, because I find so intelligent a listener in yourself, for indeed you seem to me to give your attention to my discourse; and if I have not clearly enough explained any point in it, I will allow you to ask me any questions about it. </p>                        </div>

Well then, whereas he strains every nerve to tell lies about myself, I disdain to do the like about him; and whereas he looks upon you as a despot, I regard you as a constitutional ruler; and while he puts the sword into your hand for use against me, I merely supply you with argument. <br />But he makes the basis of his accusation the discourses which I delivered in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>, and he says that they contain matter much to your disadvantage. And yet what I said concerned the topic of the <br /><a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> and of <a href=/people/1281 target=_blank>Necessity</a>, and I only used as an example of my arguments the affairs of kings, because of your rank is thought to be the highest of human ranks; and I dwelt upon the influence of the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a>, and argued that the threads which they spin are so unchangeable, that, even if they decreed to someone a kingdom which at the moment belonged to another, and even it that other slew the man of destiny, to save himself from ever being deprived by him of his throne, nevertheless the dead man would come to life again in order to fulfill the decree of the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a>. For we employ hyperbole in our arguments in order to convince those who will not believe in what is probable, and it is just as if I had used such an example as this: He who is destined to become a carpenter, will become one even if his hands have been cut off: and he who has been destined to carry off the prize for running in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> games, will not fail to win even if he broke his leg: and a man to whom the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> have decreed that he shall be an eminent archer, will not miss the mark, even though he has lost his eyesight. And in drawing examples from royalty I had reference I believe to the Acrisii and the house of <a href=/people/465 target=_blank>Laius</a>, and to <a href=/people/578 target=_blank>Astyages</a> the Mede, and to many other monarchs who thought that they were well-established in their kingdoms, and of whom some slew their own children as they imagined and others their descendants, and yet were subsequently deprived by them of their thrones when they issued forth from obscurity in accordance with the decrees of fate. Well, if I were inclined to flattery, I should have said that I had your own history in my mind, when you were blockaded in this city by <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>, and the temple of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> was burnt on the brow of the hill overlooking the city, and <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> declared that his own fortune was assured, so long as you did not escape him, this although you were at the time quite a stripling and not the man you are now; and yet, because the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> had decreed otherwise, he was undone with all this counsels, while you are now in possession of his throne. However, since I abhor the concords of flattery, for it seems to me that they are everything that is out of time and out of tune, let me cut the string out of my lyre, and request you to consider that on that occasion I had not your fortunes in my mind, but was talking exclusively of questions of the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> and of <a href=/people/1281 target=_blank>Necessity</a> for it was in speaking of them that they accused me of having assailed yourself. And yet such an argument as mine is tolerated by most of the gods; and even <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> himself is not angry when he hears from the poet in the story of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=place long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycia</a> this language: — <br />'Alas for myself, when <a href=/people/1279 target=_blank>Sarpedon</a> ...' <br />And there are other such strains referring to himself, such as those in which he declares that he yields the cause of his son to the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a>; and in the weighing of souls again the poets tell you that, although after his death he presented <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> the brother of <a href=/people/1279 target=_blank>Sarpedon</a> with a golden scepter, and appointed him judge in the court of <a href=/people/7168 target=_blank>Aidoneus</a>, yet he could not exempt him from the decree of the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a>. And you, my prince, why should you resent my argument when the gods put up with it, whose fortunes are forever fixed and assured, and who never slew poets on that account? For it is our duty to follow the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> and obey them, and not take offense with the changes of fortune, and to believe in <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> when he says: — <br />'For the gods alone there comes no old age, nay, nor even death; but all other things are confounded by all-mastering time...' <br />No man ever put the truth so well. For the prosperity of men runs in a circle, and the span of happiness, my prince, lasts for a single day. My prosperity belongs to another and his to another, and his again to a third; and each in having hath not. Think of this, my prince, and put a stop to your decrees of exile, stay the shedding of blood, and have recourse to philosophy in your wishes and plans; for true philosophy feels no pangs. And in doing so wipe away men's tears; for at present echoes reach us from the sea of a thousand sighs, and they are redoubled from the continents, where each laments over his peculiar sorrows. Thence is bred an incalculable crop of evils, all of them due directly to slanderous tongues of informers, who render all men objects of hatred to yourself, and yourself, O prince, to all. </p>                        </div>

But if I resist your touch, then you shall persuade <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> also that I am both alive and that I have not abandoned my body. They were no longer able to disbelieve, but rose up and threw themselves on his neck and kissed him, and asked him about his defense.

But <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said: I have made my defense, gentlemen, and have gained my cause; and my defense took place this very day not so long ago, for it lasted on even to midday. How then, said <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, have you accomplished so long a journey in so small a fraction of the day? <br />And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> replied: Imagine what you will, flying ram or wings of wax excepted, so long as you ascribe it to the intervention of a divine escort. <br />Well, said <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, I have always thought that your actions and words were providently cared for by some god, to whom you owe your present preservation, nevertheless pray tell us about the defense you made, what it consisted of and what the accusation had to say against you, and about the temper of the judge, and what questions he put, and what he allowed to pass of your pleas and what not — tell us at once in order that I may tell everything in turn to <a href=/people/2191 target=_blank>Telesinus</a>, for he will never leave off asking me about your affairs; for about fifteen days back he was drinking with me in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415126UAnt class=place long=12.6286 lat=41.4552>Antium</a>, when he fell asleep at table, and just as the middle cup in honor of the good genius was being passed round he dreamed a dream; and he saw a fire spreading like a sea over the land, and it enveloped some men, and caught up others as they fled; for it flowed along, he said, exactly like water, but you alone suffered not the fate of the rest, but swam clean through it as it divided to let you through. And in honor of the gods who inspire such happy presages he poured out a libation in consequence of this dream, and he bade me be of good cheer on your account. And <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said: I am not surprised at <a href=/people/2191 target=_blank>Telesinus</a> dreaming about me, for in his vigils, I assure he, he long ago occupied his mind about me; but as regards the trial, you shall learn everything, but not in this place; for it is already evening and it is time for us to proceed to the town; and it is pleasant too to talk as you go along the road, for conversation assists you on your way like an escort. <br />Let us then start and discuss your questions as we go along, and I will certainly tell you of today's events in the court.

But I know exactly in what condition of mind the tyrant is at this moment; hitherto he has never heard anything except the utterances of flatterers, and now he had had to listen to the language of rebuke; such language breaks despotic natures down and enrages them.

And <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> said: <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, my own attitude towards our friend's affairs was such that I tried to dissuade him from taking the journey which he has taken, and I believe you too gave him the same advice, namely that he should not rush of his own accord into dangers and difficulties; but when he was thrown into fetters, as I saw with my own eyes, and I was perplexed and in despair of his case, he told me that it rested with himself to release himself and he freed his leg from the fetters and showed it to me. Well, it was then for the first time that I understood our master to be a divine being, transcending all our poor wisdom and knowledge. Consequently, even if I were called upon to expose myself to still greater risks than these, I should not fear anything, as long as I was under his protection. But since the evening is at hand, let us go into the inn and minister to and take care of him.

Some of them had already made <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>' acquaintance anxious to pick up his wisdom afresh, for they were convinced that there remained much to learn, more striking than what they had so far heard; but those who were not acquainted with him thought it a shame that they should seem never to have heard so great a man discourse. In answer to their questions then, of how he had escaped the clutches of the tyrant, he did not deem it right to say anything boastful; but he merely told them that he had made his defense and got away safely. However when several people arrived from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, who bruited abroad the episode of the lawcourt, the attitude of Hellas came near to that of actual worship; the main reason why they thought him divine was this, that he never made the least parade about the matter. </p>                        </div>

Why yes, he replied, and by heaven there is nothing in the world of men, so agreeable and so dear to the gods. And what is the material of which it is composed? asked <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>; It is as if I asked you about the material of which this image is made, and you answered me that it was composed of gold and ivory. But, said the other, what material, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, can a thing which is incorporeal be composed of? A most important material, replied <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, and most varied in character; for there are sacred precincts in it, and sanctuaries and race-courses and, of course, a scene-building, and tribes of men, some of them from neighboring countries, and others from over the borders, and even from across the sea. Moreover, he added, many arts go to make up such a festival, and many designs, and much true genius, both of poets, and of civil counselors, and of those who deliver harangues on philosophic topics, and contests between naked athletes, and contests of musicians, as is the custom in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> festival. It seems to me, said the other, O <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, that the festival is not only something corporeal, but is made up of more wonderful material than are cities; for there is summoned together into one community on such occasions the best of the best, and the most celebrated of the celebrated. <br />Then, said <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, O <a href=/people/2054 target=_blank>Isagoras</a>, are we to consider the people we meet there in the same light as some people regard walls and ships, or do you need some other opinion of the festival? The opinion, answered the other, which we have formulated, is quite adequate and complete, O man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378346PTya class=place long=34.57 lat=37.82>Tyana</a>, and we had better adhere to it. And yet, said the other, it is neither adequate nor complete to one who considers about is as I do; for it appears to me that ships are in need of men and men of ships, and that men would never have thought about the sea at all if they had not had a ship; and men are kept safe by walls and walls by men; and in the same way I consider a festival to be not only the meeting of human beings, but also the place itself in which they have to meet, and the more so, because walls and ships would never have come into being, unless there had been men's hands to build them, while these places, so far forth as they are deprived of their natural and original characteristics, are by the hands of men spoiled; for it was owing to their natural advantages that they were held worthy of being made their meeting-places; for though the gymnasiums and porticoes and fountains and houses have been all created by human art, just like the walls and the ships, yet this river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376215WAlp class=place long=21.4517 lat=37.6125>Alpheus</a> with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216BOHi class=place long=21.6336 lat=37.637>hippodrome</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216BOSt class=place long=21.63333 lat=37.63924>stadium</a> and the groves, existed, I suppose, before men came here, the one providing water for drinking and for the bath, and the second a broad plain for the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> to race in, and the third provided just the space required for the athletes to raise the dust in as they run along in their races, namely a valley a stadium in length, and the groves supplied wreaths for the winners and served the athletes who were runners as a place to practice in. For I imagine that <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> considered these facts, and because he admired the natural advantages of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>, he found the place worthy of the festival and games which are still held here. </p>                        </div>

And with these words he at once started for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a> attended by every one of his admirers. Now the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384229STro class=place long=22.875 lat=38.4312>cavern</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384229PLeb class=place long=22.875 lat=38.4354>Lebadea</a> is dedicated to <a href=/people/786 target=_blank>Trophonius</a>, the son of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, and it can only be entered by those who resort thither in order to get an oracle, and it is not visible in the sanctuary, but lies a little above it on a mound; and it is shut in by iron spits which surround it, and you descend into it as it were sitting down and being drawn down. Those who enter it are clad in white raiment, and are escorted thither with honey-cakes in their hands to appease the reptiles which assail them as they descend. But the earth brings them to the surface again, in some cases close by, but in other cases a long way off; for they are sent up to the surface beyond <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384222ROzo class=place long=22.2 lat=38.4>Locris</a> and beyond <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=place long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocis</a>, but most of them about the borders of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a>. Accordingly <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> entered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384229STro class=place long=22.875 lat=38.4312>shrine</a> and said: I wish to descend into the cave in the interests of philosophy. <br />But the priests opposed him and though they told the multitude that they would never allow a wizard like him to examine and test the shrine, they pretended to the sage himself that there were forbidden days and days unclean for consulting. So on that day he delivered a discourse at the springs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384229WHer class=place long=22.87489 lat=38.43322>Hercyne</a>, about the origin and conduct of the shrine; for it is the only oracle which gives responses through the person himself who consults it. And when the evening approached, he went to the mouth of the cave with his train of youthful followers, and having pulled up four of the obelisks, which constitute a bar to the passage, he went down below ground wearing his philosopher's mantle, having dressed himself as if he were going to deliver an address upon philosophy — a step which the god <a href=/people/786 target=_blank>Trophonius</a> so thoroughly approved of, that he appeared to the priests and not only rebuked them for the reception they had given <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, but enjoined them all to follow him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384236UAul class=place long=23.5925 lat=38.4335>Aulis</a>, for he said it was there that he would come to surface in such a marvelous fashion as no man before. And in fact he emerged after seven days, a longer period than it had taken anyone of those who until then had entered the oracle, and he had with him a volume thoroughly in keeping with the questions he had asked: for had gone down saying: What, O <a href=/people/786 target=_blank>Trophonius</a>, do you consider the most complete and purest philosophy? And the volume contained the tenets of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, a good proof this, that the oracle was in agreement with this form of wisdom. </p>                        </div>

And, when those who were present asked him what was the matter; Do you not see, said he, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> the sage, how that he is present with us and is listening to our discussion, and is reciting wondrous verses about the soul? But where is he? the others asked, For we cannot see him anywhere, although we would rather do so than possess all the blessings of mankind. And the youth replied: It would seem that he is come to converse with myself alone concerning the tenets which I would not believe. Listen therefore to the inspired argument which he is delivering: <br />The soul is immortal, and “tis no possession of thine own, but of Providence, <br />And after the body is wasted away, like a swift <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> freed from its traces, <br />It lightly leaps forward and mingles itself with the light air, <br />Loathing the spell of harsh and painful servitude which it has endured. <br />But for thee, what use is there in this? Some day, when thou art no more, thou shalt believe it. <br />So why, as long as thou art among living beings, dost thou explore these mysteries? <br />Here we have a clear utterance of <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, established like an oracular tripod, to convince us of the mysteries of the soul, to the end that cheerfully, and with due knowledge of our own true nature, we may pursue our way to the goal appointed by the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a>. With any tomb, however, or cenotaph of the sage I never met, that I know of, although I have traversed most of the earth, and have listened everywhere to stories of his divine quality. And his shrine in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378346PTya class=place long=34.57 lat=37.82>Tyana</a> is singled out and honored with royal officers: for neither have the Emperors denied to him the honors of which they themselves were held worthy. </p>                        </div>
