But the judgment of heaven rode with him!

As soon as he ceased speaking he was seized with a pain in his bowels for which there was no relief and with sharp internal tortures — 6 and that very justly, for he had tortured the bowels of others with many and strange inflictions. 7 Yet he did not in any way stop his insolence, but was even more filled with arrogance, breathing fire in his rage against the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, and giving orders to hasten the journey. And so it came about that he fell out of his chariot as it was rushing along, and the fall was so hard as to torture every limb of his body. 8 Thus he who had just been thinking that he could command the waves of the sea, in his superhuman arrogance, and imagining that he could weigh the high mountains in a balance, was brought down to earth and carried in a litter, making the power of God manifest to all. 9 And so the ungodly man's body swarmed with worms, and while he was still living in anguish and pain, his flesh rotted away, and because of his stench the whole army felt revulsion at his decay. </p>                        </div>

                                            <div class="pSelector" id=15.30>
                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg024:15.30'><b>&sect; 15.30</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the man who was ever in body and soul the defender of his fellow citizens, the man who maintained his youthful good will toward his countrymen, ordered them to cut off <a href=/people/401 target=_blank>Nicanor</a>'s head and arm and carry them to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>. 31 And when he arrived there and had called his countrymen together and stationed the priests before the altar, he sent for those who were in the citadel. 32 He showed them the vile <a href=/people/401 target=_blank>Nicanor</a>'s head and that profane man's arm, which had been boastfully stretched out against the holy house of the Almighty; 33 and he cut out the tongue of the ungodly <a href=/people/401 target=_blank>Nicanor</a> and said that he would give it piecemeal to the birds and hang up these rewards of his folly opposite the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>sanctuary</a>. 34 And they all, looking to heaven, blessed the Lord who had manifested himself, saying, Blessed is he who has kept his own place undefiled. 35 And he hung <a href=/people/401 target=_blank>Nicanor</a>'s head from the citadel, a clear and conspicuous sign to every one of the help of the Lord. 36 And they all decreed by public vote never to let this day go unobserved, but to celebrate the thirteenth day of the twelfth month — which is called <a href=/people/5401 target=_blank>Adar</a> in the Syrian language — the day before <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a>'s day. <br />37 This, then, is how matters turned out with <a href=/people/401 target=_blank>Nicanor</a>. And from that time the city has been in the possession of the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a>. So I too will here end my story. 38 If it is well told and to the point, that is what I myself desired; if it is poorly done and mediocre, that was the best I could do. 39 For just as it is harmful to drink wine alone, or, again, to drink water alone, while wine mixed with water is sweet and delicious and enhances one's enjoyment, so also the style of the story delights the ears of those who read the work. And here will be the end. </p>                        </div>
