For because in these accounts, which he says were begun by Hirtuleius, he misses the assistance of Hirtuleius, I cannot think that he either does wrong himself, or wishes you to do wrong. For I ask you, O Marcus <a href=/people/6828 target=_blank>Plaetorius</a>, whether you will consider our case established, if Marcus <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a>, in the matter respecting which he is now accused by you, has the man whom you praise above all others, namely Hirtuleius, for his example; and if <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a> is found to have done exactly the same as Hirtuleius in the matters in which you commend Hirtuleius? You find fault with the description of payment. The public registers prove that Hirtuleius paid in the same manner. You praise him for having established these peculiar accounts. <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a> established the same, with reference to the same kind of money.

In no account-books is there any hint of such a robbery among all the items contained in them there will not be found one trace of any loss or diminution of such monies. But all those men whom we ever see accused and found fault with by this sort of inquiry, are overwhelmed with witnesses; for it is difficult for him who has given money to a magistrate to avoid being either induced by dislike of him, or compelled by scrupulousness, to mention it; and in the next place, if the witnesses are deterred from appearing by any influence, at all events the account-books remain uncorrupted and honest. Suppose that every one was ever so friendly to <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a>; that such a number of men to whom he was perfectly unknown, and with whom he was utterly unconnected, spared his life, and consulted his character; still, the facts of the case itself, the consideration of the documents, and the composition of the account-books, have this force, that from them, when they are once given in and received, everything that is forged, or stolen, or that has disappeared, is detected. All those men made entries of sums of money having been received for the use of the Roman people; if they immediately either paid or gave to others equally large sums, so that what was received for the Roman people was paid to some one or other, at all events nothing can have been embezzled.

From whom do they say that loans of such sums were procured? From the Gauls? By no means. From whom then? From Roman citizens who are trading in Gaul. Why do we not hear what they have got to say? Why are no accounts of theirs produced? I myself pursue and press the prosecutor, O judges; I pursue him I say, and I demand witnesses. In this cause I am taking more pains and trouble to get them to produce their witnesses, than other advocates for the defence usually take to refute them. I say this boldly, O judges, but I do not assert it rashly. All Gaul is filled with traders, — is full of Roman citizens. No Gaul does any business without the aid of a Roman citizen; not a single sesterce in Gaul ever changes hands without being entered in the account-books of Roman citizens. [12] See how I am descending, O judges, how far I seem to be departing from my ordinary habits, from my usual caution and diligence. Let one set of accounts be produced, in which there is any trace whatever which gives the least hint of money having been given to <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a>; let them produce out of the whole body of traders, of colonists, of publicans, of agriculturists, of graziers, but one witness, and I will allow that this accusation is true. O ye immortal gods! what sort of a cause is this? what sort of a defence? Marcus <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a> was governor of the province of Gaul, which consists of those tribes of men and of cities, some of whom (to say nothing of old times) have in the memory of the present generation carried on bitter and protracted wars with the Roman people; some have been lately subdued by our generals, lately conquered in war, lately made remarkable by the triumphs which we have celebrated over them, and the monuments which we have erected, and lately mulcted, by the senate, of their lands and cities: some, too, who have fought in battle against Marcus <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a> himself, have by his toil and labour been reduced under the power and dominion of the Roman people. [13] There is in the same province <a about=https://topostext.org/place/432030UNar class=place long=3.004 lat=43.181>Narbo</a> <a href=/people/812 target=_blank>Martius</a>, a colony of our citizens, set up as a watch-tower of the Roman people, and opposed as a bulwark to the attacks of those very natives. There is also the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433054PMas class=place long=5.36 lat=43.3>Massilia</a>, which I have already mentioned, a city of most gallant and faithful allies, who have made amends to the Roman people for the dangers to which they have been exposed in the Gallic wars, by their service and assistance; there is, besides, a large number of Roman citizens, and most honourable men. </p>                        </div>

Those who were enemies, he subdued; those who had lately been so, he compelled to depart from the lands of which they had been deprived by the senate. From the rest, who had been often conquered in great wars, on purpose that they might be rendered obedient for ever to the Roman people, he exacted large troops of cavalry to serve in those wars which at that time were being carried on all over the world by the Roman people, and large sums of money for their pay, and a great quantity of corn to support our armies in the Spanish war. [14] The man who has done all these things is now brought before a court of law. You who were not present at the transactions are, with the Roman people, taking cognisance of the cause; those men are our adversaries who were compelled to leave their lands by the command of Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>; those men are our adversaries who having escaped from the war, and the slaughter which was made of them, for the first time dare to stand against Marcus <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a>, now that he is unarmed.

[15] What more shall I say? What is the inclination of the Roman citizens? There is no one of that immense body who does not consider this man to have deserved well of the province, of the empire, of our allies, and of the citizens. </p>                        </div>

[16] What, if I produce also a still greater number of most honourable men to bear testimony to this man's virtue and innocence? Will the unanimity of the Gauls still be of more weight than that of men of such great authority? When <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a> was governor of Gaul, you know, O judges, that there were very large armies of the Roman people in the two Spains, and very illustrious generals. How many Roman knights were there, how many military tribunes, how many ambassadors came to them! what eminent men they were, and how frequently did they come! Besides that, a very large and admirably appointed army of Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> wintered in Gaul while Marcus <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a> was governor. Does not <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> herself appear to have intended that they should be a sufficient number of sufficiently competent witnesses of those things which were done in Gaul while Marcus <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a> was praetor? Out of all that number of men what witness can you produce in this cause? Who is there of all that body of men whose authority you are willing to cite? We will use that very man as our panegyrist and our witness. [17] Will you doubt any longer, O judges, that that which I stated to you at the beginning is most true, that there is another object in this prosecution, beyond causing others, after Marcus <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a> has been overwhelmed by the testimonies of these men, from whom many contributions have been exacted, greatly against their will, for the sake of the republic, to be for the future more lax in governing, when they see these men attacked, who are such men that, if they are crushed, the empire of the Roman people cannot be maintained in safety </p>                        </div>

If all the cities have been compelled to make roads, and if the works of many of them have not been passed, then certainly both charges are false, — the charge that money has been given for exemption, when no one was exempted; and for approval, when many were disapproved of. [18] What if we can shift this charge on other most unimpeachable names? not so as to transfer any blame to others, but to show that these men were appointed to superintend that road-making, who are easily able to show that their duty was performed, and performed well. Will you still urge all these charges against Marcus <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a>, relying on angry witnesses? When Marcus <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a> was hindered by more important affairs of the republic, and when it concerned the republic that the <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> road should be made, he entrusted the business to his lieutenants, men of the highest characters, Caius <a href=/people/1125 target=_blank>Annius</a>, Bellienus, and Caius <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a>.

Elesiodulus exacted only six denarii from those who were taking wine to the enemy.

But I think that the more serious a charge is, which is proved to be false, the greater is the wickedness of that man who invented it; for he wishes by the magnitude of the accusation to prejudice the minds of those who hear it, so that the truth may afterwards find a difficult entrance into them. ***** <br />[ Everything relating to the charge about the wine, to the war with the <a href=/people/12040 target=_blank>Vocontii</a>, and the arrangement of winter quarters, is wanting.] </p>                        </div>

But the circumstances of the case and the force of arguments prove it. Can then a judge refuse belief to witnesses? He not only can, but he ought, if they are covetous men, or angry men, or conspirators, or men utterly void of religion and conscience. In fact, if Marcus <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a> is to be considered guilty just because the Gauls say so, what need have I of a wise judge? what need have I of an impartial judge? what need is there of an intelligent advocate? For the Gauls say so. We cannot deny it. If you think this is the duty of an able and experienced and impartial judge, that he must without the slightest hesitation believe a thing because the witnesses say it; then the Goddess of <a href=/people/2936 target=_blank>Safety</a> herself cannot protect the innocence of brave men. But if, in coming to a decision on such matters, the wisdom of the judge has a wide field for its exercise in considering every circumstance, and in weighing each according to its importance, then in truth your part in considering the case is a more important and serious one than mine is in stating it. [22] For I have only to question the witness as to each circumstance once, and that, too, briefly, and often indeed I have not to question him at all; lest I should seem to be giving an angry man an opportunity of making a speech, or to be attributing an undue weight to a covetous man. You can revolve the same matter over and over again in your minds, you can give a long consideration to the evidence of one witness; and, if we have shown an unwillingness to examine any witness, you are bound to consider what has been our reason for keeping silence. Wherefore; if you think that to believe the witnesses implicitly is enjoined to a judge, either by the law or by his duty, there is no reason at all why one man should be thought a better or a wiser judge than another. For judgment formed by the mere ears is single and simple enough; it is a power given promiscuously to all in common, whether they are fools or wise men. [23] What, then, are the opportunities which wisdom has of distinguishing itself? When can a foolish and credulous auditor be distinguished from a scrupulous and discerning judge? When, forsooth, the statements which are made by the witnesses are committed to his conjectures, to his opinion, as to the authority, the impartiality of mind, the modesty; the good faith, the scrupulousness, the regard for a fair reputation, the care, and the fear with which they are made. </p>                        </div>

[24] Have we seen any man, can we with truth speak of any man, as having been equal in wisdom, in dignity, in consistency, in all other virtues, in all the distinguishing qualities of honour, and genius, and splendid achievements, to Marcus <a href=/people/116 target=_blank>Aemilius</a> <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a>? And yet, though, when he was not on his oath, almost the whole world was governed by his nod, yet, when he was on his oath, his evidence was not believed against Caius <a href=/people/11019 target=_blank>Fimbria</a>, nor against Caius <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>. They, who were the judges, were unwilling that such a road should be opened to enmities, as for every man to be able to destroy by his evidence who ever he hated. Who is there who does not know how great was the modesty, how great the abilities, how great the influence of Lucius <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>? And yet he, whose mere conversation had the authority of evidence, could not, by his actual evidence, establish the things which he had stated against Marcus <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> with hostile feelings. [25] There was — there was in the judges of those times, O judges, a divinely-inspired and singular acuteness, as they thought that they were judges, not only of the defendant, but also of the accuser and of the witness, as to what was invented, what was brought into the case by chance or by the opportunity, what was imported into it through corruption, what was distorted by hope or by fear, what appeared to proceed from any private desire, or any private enmity. And if the judge does not embrace all these considerations in his deliberation, if he does not survey and comprehend them all in his mind, — if he thinks that whatever is said from that witness-box, proceeds from some oracle, then in truth it will be sufficient, as I have said before, for any judge to preside over this court, and to discharge this duty, who is not deaf.

You take pains even so to mould your countenances, that no suspicion of any private motive may be excited; that when you come forward there may be a sort of silent opinion of your modesty and scrupulousness, and that, when you leave the box, that reputation may appear to have been carefully preserved and retained. [29] I suppose Induciomarus, when he gave his evidence, had all these fears and all these thoughts; he, who left out of his whole evidence that most considerate word, to which we are all habituated, “I think,” a word which we use even when we are relating on our oath what we know of our own knowledge, what we ourselves have seen; and said that he knew everything he was stating. He feared, forsooth, lest he should lose any of his reputation in your eyes and in those of the Roman people; lest any such report should get abroad that Induciomarus, a man of such rank, had spoken with such partiality, with such rashness.

[35] But now, when no good man says a word against him, but all your citizens and allies extol him; when those men attack him who have repeatedly attacked this city and this empire; and when the enemies of Marcus <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a> threaten you and the Roman people; when his friends and relations come to you as suppliants, will you hesitate to show not only to your own citizens, who are mainly influenced by glory and praise; but also to foreign tribes and nations, that you, in giving your votes, prefer sparing a citizen to yielding to an enemy? </p>                        </div>

But in that case, if they attempt to make war upon us, we must summon up Caius <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> from the shades below, in order that he may be equal in war to that great man, that threatening and arrogant Induciomarus. Cnaeus <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> and Quintus <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> must be raised from the dead, that they may again subdue and crush the nation of the <a href=/people/11071 target=_blank>Allobroges</a> and the other tribes by their arms; or, since that indeed is impossible, we must beg my friend Marcus <a href=/people/6828 target=_blank>Plaetorius</a> to deter his new clients from making war, and to oppose by his entreaties their angry feelings and formidable violence; or, if he be not able to do so, we will ask Marcus <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a>, his junior counsel, to pacify the <a href=/people/11071 target=_blank>Allobroges</a>, since among their tribe the name of <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> is held in the highest honour, and induce them either to be willing to remain quiet, as defeated and conquered nations usually are, or else to make them understand that they are holding out to the Roman people not a terror of war, but a hope of triumph. <br /> [37] And if, even in the case of an ignoble defendant, it would not be endurable that those men should think they had effected anything by their threats, what do you think you ought to do in the case of Marcus <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a>? concerning whom, O judges, (for I think that I am entitled to say this now, when I have almost come to the termination of two trials,) concerning whom, I say, you have not only not heard any disgraceful charge invented by his enemies, but you have not even heard any really serious reproach. Was ever any defendant, especially when he had moved in such a sphere as this man, as a candidate for honours, as an officer in command, and as a governor, accused in such a way, that no disgraceful act, no deed of violence, no baseness originating either in lust or insolence or audacity, was attributed to him, if not with truth, at least with some suspicious circumstances giving a reasonable colouring to the invention? </p>                        </div>

The orations are extant by which it can be seen that many things are alleged against <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> himself, no doubt falsely; but still they were alleged against him and urged against him by an enemy. How many things were said against <a href=/people/382 target=_blank>Manius</a> <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquilius</a> on his trial? How many against Lucius <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a>? and, lastly, against Publius <a href=/people/1250 target=_blank>Rutilius</a>? who, although he was condemned, still appears to me to deserve to be reckoned among the most virtuous and innocent men. Yet that most upright and temperate man had many things attributed to him on his trial, which involved suspicion of adultery, and great licentiousness. [39] There is an oration extant of a man, by far (in my opinion, that is,) the ablest and most eloquent of all our countrymen, Caius <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a>; in which oration Lucius <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> is accused of many base and wicked actions. What a man to be so accused! A man who was of such virtue and integrity, that even in those most admirable: times, when it was not possible to find a thoroughly worthless man, still he alone was called Thrifty. And when <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a> was ordering him to be summoned before the assembly, and his lictor asked him which <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, because there were many of the name, “You are compelling me,” says he, “to call my enemy, Thrifty.” That very man then, whom even his enemy could not point out with sufficient clearness without first praising him; whose one surname pointed not only who he was, but what sort of man he was; that very man was, nevertheless, exposed to a false and unjust accusation of disgraceful conduct. [40] Marcus <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a> has been accused in two trials, in such a way, that nothing has been alleged against him from which the slightest taint of lust, or caprice, or cruelty, or audacity can be inferred. They not only have not mentioned any atrocious deed of his, but they have not even found fault with any expression used by him. </p>                        </div>

First of all, there is the antiquity of his family, which we are aware proceeds from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>, a most illustrious municipality, and whose fame is engraved and handed down on monuments of the exploits of its members; secondly, there have been continual praetorships in that family, which have been distinguished by every sort of honour, and especially by the credit of unimpeachable innocence; besides that, there is the recent memory of his father, by whose blood, not only the troop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412156UAsc class=place long=15.5615 lat=41.206>Asculum</a>, by whom he was slain, but the whole of that social war has been stained with the deep dye of wickedness; lastly, there is the man himself, honourable and upright in every particular of his life, and in military affairs not only endued with the greatest wisdom, and the most brilliant courage, but also skillful through personal experience in carrying on war, beyond almost any man of the present age. </p>                        </div>

There has been a greater abundance of such men in the republic than there is now; and when there was, people consulted not only their safety, but their honour also. What, then, ought you to do now, when military studies have become obsolete among our youth, and when our best men and our greatest generals have been taken from us, partly by age, and partly by the dissensions of the state and the ill fortune of the republic? When so many wars are necessarily undertaken by us, when so many arise suddenly and unexpectedly, do you not think that you ought to preserve this man for the critical occasions of the republic, and to excite others by his example to the pursuit of honour and virtue? [43] Recollect what lieutenants Lucius <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a>, and Publius <a href=/people/1250 target=_blank>Rutilius</a>, and Lucius <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, and Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> have lately had in war.

Come now, cast your eyes over the senate house, look thoroughly into every part of the republic; do you see no possible event in which you may require men like those? or, if any such event should arise, do you think that the Roman people is at this moment rich in such men? And if you carefully consider all these circumstances, you will rather, O judges, retain at home, for yourselves and for your children, a man energetic in undertaking the toils of war, gallant in encountering its dangers, skillful in its practice and its discipline, prudent in his designs, fortunate and successful in their accomplishment, than deliver him over to nations most hostile to the Roman people, and most cruel, by condemning him. </p>                        </div>

Our first bulwark against their attacks is <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, a province loyal and well affected to the Roman people, which says, that itself and its cities were preserved, not only by the wisdom, but even by the hand of <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a>, and which now repels the attacks and dangers of the Gauls from his head, as it was defended itself from the invasion and desolation of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a>. [45] On the opposite side stands the further Spain, which is able in this case not only to withstand the eagerness of the accusers by its own honest disposition, but which can even refute the perjuries of wicked men by its testimonies and by its panegyrics. And even from Gaul itself most faithful and most important assistance is derived. As an assistance to this unhappy and innocent man, the city of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433054PMas class=ethnic long=5.36 lat=43.3>Massilians</a> has come forward, which is labouring now, not only in order to appear to requite with proper gratitude the exertions of the man by whom it has been preserved, but which also believes that it has been placed in those districts for that very object, and with that express destiny, to prevent those nations from being able to injure our countrymen. [46] The colony of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/432030UNar class=place long=3.004 lat=43.181>Narbonne</a> fights equally on behalf of the safety of Marcus <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a>, which, having been lately delivered from the blockade of the enemy by this man, is now moved at his misery and danger. Lastly, as is right in a Gallic war — as the principles and customs of our ancestors enjoin — there is not one Roman citizen who thinks he requires any excuse for being eager in this man's behalf.

[47] What protection, what comfort, will that unhappy maiden have left, if she loses this her brother? For other women can bring forth protectors for themselves — can have in their homes a companion and a partner in all their fortunes; but to this maiden, what is there that can be agreeable or dear, except her brother? Do not, O judges, allow the altars of the immortal gods, and of our mother <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a>, to be reminded of your tribunal by the daily lamentations of a holy virgin. Beware lest that eternal flame, which is now preserved by the nightly toils and vigils of Fonteia, should be said to have been extinguished by the tears of your priestess.

Consider how dangerous, how arrogant a deed it would be for you to reject her entreaties, when, if the immortal gods were to despise her prayers, all these things which we see around us could not be preserved. Do not you see, O judges, that all of a sudden, Marcus <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a> himself, brave as he is, is moved to shed tears at the mention of his parent and his sister? — he who never has known fear in battle, he who in arms has often thrown himself on the ranks and numbers of the enemy, thinking, while he was facing such dangers, that he left behind him the same consolation to his relatives that his own father had left to him; yet now, for all that, is agitated and alarmed, lest he should not only cease to be an ornament and an assistant to his family, but lest he should even leave them eternal disgrace and ignominy, together with the bitterest grief. [49] Oh how unequal is thy fortune, O Marcus <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a>! If you could have chosen, how much would you have preferred perishing by the weapons of the Gauls rather than by their perjuries! For then virtue would have been the companion of your life, glory your comrade in death; but now, what agony is it for you to endure the sufferings caused by their power and victory over you, at their pleasure, who have before now been either conquered by your arms, or forced to submit against their will to your authority. From this danger, O judges, defend a brave and innocent citizen: take care to be seen to place more confidence in our own witnesses than in foreigners; to have more regard for the: safety of our citizens than for the pleasure of our enemies; to think the entreaties of her who presides over your sacrifices of more importance than the audacity of those men who have waged war against the sacrifices and temples of all nations. Lastly, take care, O judges, (the dignity of the Roman people is especially concerned in this,) to show that the prayers of a <a href=/people/12228 target=_blank>vestal virgin</a> have more influence over you than the threats of Gaul. </p>                        </div>
