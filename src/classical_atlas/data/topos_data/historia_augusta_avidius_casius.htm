His father was Avidius <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a>, the first of the family to hold public office, who at first commanded in the ranks, but later attained to the highest honours of the state. 2 Quadratus mentions him in his history, and certainly with all respect, for he declares that he was a very distinguished man, both indispensable to the state and influential with Marcus himself; 3 for he succumbed to the decrees of fate, it is said, when Marcus had already begun to rule. <br />4 Now <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, sprung, as we have said, from the family of the <a href=/people/7445 target=_blank>Cassii</a> who conspired against Gaius <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Julius</a>, secretly hated the principate and could not brook even the title of emperor, saying that the name of empire was all the more onerous because an emperor could not be removed from the state except by another emperor. 5 In his youth, they say, he tried to wrest the empire from <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a> too, but through his father, a righteous and worthy man, he escaped detection in this attempt to seize the throne, though he continued to be suspected by <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a>' generals. 6 Against <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> he organized a genuine conspiracy, as a letter of <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a>' own, which I append, makes clear. 7 Extract from the letter of <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a>: Avidius <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> is avid for the throne, as it seems to me and as was well-known in the reign of my grandfather, your father; I wish you would have him watched. 8 Everything we do displeases him, he is amassing no inconsiderable wealth, and he laughs at our letters. He calls you a philosophical old woman, me a half-witted spendthrift. Consider what should be done. 9 I do not dislike the man, but look to it lest you take too little heed for yourself and for your children when you keep in active service a man whom the soldiers are glad to hear and glad to see. </p>                        </div>

Remember what your great-grandfather used to say, 'No one ever kills his successor'. And if this is not the case, he will of himself fall into the toils of fate without any act of cruelty on our part. 3 Add that we cannot judge a man guilty whom no one has accused, and whom, as you say yourself, the soldiers love. 4 Furthermore, in cases of treason it is inevitable that even those who have been proved guilty seem to suffer injustice. 5 For you know yourself what your grandfather <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> said, 'Unhappy is the lot of emperors, who are never believed when they accuse anyone of pretending to the throne, until after they are slain'. 6 I have preferred, moreover, to quote this as his, rather than as <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>'s, who is reported to have said it first, for good sayings when uttered by tyrants have not as much weight as they deserve. 7 So let <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> keep his own ways, especially as he is an able general and a stern and brave man, and since the state has need of him. 8 And as for your statement that I should take heed for my children by killing him, by all means let my children perish, if Avidius be more deserving of love than they and if it profit the state for <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> to live rather than the children of Marcus. Thus did <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a>, thus did Marcus, write about <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>. </p>                        </div>

But when the centurions expected a reward because they had slain such a host of the enemy with a very small force while the tribunes were passing their time in indolence and were even ignorant of the whole affair, he had them arrested and crucified, and punished them with the punishment of slaves, for which there was no precedent; It might, he said, have been an ambush, and the barbarians' awe for the Roman Empire might have been lost. 7 And when a fierce mutiny arose in the camp, he issued forth clad only in a wrestler's loin-cloth and said: Strike me if you dare, and add the crime of murder to breach of discipline. 8 Then, as all grew quiet, he was held in well deserved fear, because he had shown no fear himself. 9 This incident so strengthened discipline among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and struck such terror into the barbarians, that they besought the absent <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> for a hundred years' peace, since they had seen even those who conquered, if they conquered wrongfully, sentenced to death by the decision of a Roman general. </p>                        </div>

You know what the good poet says, a line universally quoted: <br />'The state of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> is rooted in the men and manners of the olden time.' <br />8 Do you take care only that provisions are abundantly provided for the legions, for if I have judged Avidius correctly I know that they will not be wasted. The prefect's answer to Marcus runs: 9 You planned wisely, Sire, when you put <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> in command of the Syrian legions. 10 Nothing benefits Grecianized soldiers like a man who is somewhat strict. 11 He will certainly do away with all warm baths, and will strike all the flowers from the soldiers' heads and necks and breasts. 12 Food for the soldiers is all provided; and nothing is lacking under an able general, for but little is either asked or expended. </p>                        </div>

This man was later put to death by the army against the wishes of <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. The army also slew Maecianus, in whose charge <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> had been placed; he had joined <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> in the hope of sharing the sovereignty with him, and he too was slain against the wishes and without the knowledge of <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. <br />5 For all that, <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> was not seriously angered on learning of this revolt, nor did he vent his rage on <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>' children or on his kin. 6 The senate, however, pronounced him a public enemy and confiscated his property. But <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> was unwilling that this should be forfeited to the privy-purse, and so, at the bidding of the senate, it was delivered to the public treasury. 7 And there was no slight consternation at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; for many said that Avidius <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> would advance on the city in the absence of <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, who was singularly loved by all but the profligates, and that he would ravage it like a tyrant, especially because of the senators who had declared him an enemy to the state and confiscated his property. 8 The love felt for <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> was most clearly manifested in the fact that it was with the consent of all save the citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> that Avidius was slain. 9 <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, indeed, did not so much order his execution as suffer it; for it was clear to all that he would have spared him had it been in his power. </p>                        </div>
