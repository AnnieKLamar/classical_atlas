Custom, you know, does not permit girls to attend funerals once they are engaged to be married. However, even then she was dressed in purple, with a transparent veil over her hair, and she had decked herself with gold and precious stones that she might not be a sign of evil omen to her betrothed. Seated upon a chair with double cushions and silver feet, so they say, she railed against the untimeliness of this misfortune, on the ground that <a href=/people/2088 target=_blank>Aeschines</a> should have died either before her wedding or after it, and she was angry with us because we were in grief. Scarcely waiting for the seventh day, on which we had met for the funeral banquet, she mounted her mule car, in company with that talkative old nurse of hers, and, when the forum was thronged, set out on her stately course for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325206UTau class=place long=20.5677 lat=32.539>Taucheira</a> with all her adornments. Next week she is preparing to display herself crowned with fillets, and with a towering head-dress like <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>. <br />[2] We are in no way wronged by this except in the fact, patent to the whole world, that we have relations with very bad taste. The one who has been wronged is Harmonius, the father of her janitor, as <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a> might say, a man who although wise and moderate in all respects in his own life, vied with <a href=/people/447 target=_blank>Cecrops</a> himself on the ground of noble birth. <br />[3] The granddaughter of this man, himself greater than <a href=/people/447 target=_blank>Cecrops</a>, her uncle and janitor <a href=/people/1266 target=_blank>Herodes</a> has now given away to the Sosiae and Tibii. Perchance they are right who extol the future bridegroom to us because of his mother, pointing to his descent from the famous <a href=/people/620 target=_blank>Lais</a>. Now <a href=/people/620 target=_blank>Lais</a> was an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381132UHyk class=person long=13.17 lat=38.16>Hyccarian</a> slave brought from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, according to one historian; whence this mother of fair offspring, who bore the famous man. She of old lived an irregular life with a shipmaster for her owner — afterwards with an orator, who also owned her, and after these in the third instance with a fellow-slave, at first secretly in the town, then conspicuously, and was a mistress of her art. When by reason of oncoming wrinkles she gave up the practice of her art, she trained in her calling the young persons whom she palmed off on strangers. Her son, the orator, asserts that he is dispensed by the law from the duty of supporting a mother who is beyond the pale. Out upon such a law! The mother has been clearly revealed to those thus born: it is only the other parent that is doubtful. All the care that is due to both parents from those born in wedlock should be bestowed by the fatherless on the mother alone. </p>                        </div>

This mishap at the very outset seemed a bad omen, and it might have been wiser to desert a vessel which had been unlucky from the very start. But we were ashamed to lay ourselves open to an imputation of cowardice from you, and accordingly <br />It was no longer granted us to tremble or to withdraw. <br />[2] So now, if misfortune awaits us, we shall perish through your fault. After all, was it so dreadful that you should be laughing and we out of danger? But of <a href=/people/2139 target=_blank>Epimetheus</a> they aver that <br />His prudence was at fault, his repentance never, <br />and that is precisely our own case, for we might easily have saved ourselves in the first instance; whereas now we are lamenting in concert on desert shores, gazing out towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> to our heart’s content, and towards our motherland <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a>; one of these places we willfully deserted, while the other we are unable to reach — all the time having seen and suffered such things as we never thought to happen even in our dreams. <br />[3] Hear my story then, that you may have no further leisure for your mocking wit, and I will tell you first of all how our crew was made up. Our skipper was fain of death owing to his bankrupt condition; then besides him we had twelve sailors, thirteen in all! More than half of them, including the skipper, were <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> — a graceless race and fully convinced of the piety of sending to <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a> as many Greeks as possible. The remainder were a collection of peasants who even as late as last year had never gripped an oar. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly, so long as we were in safety they passed their time in jesting one with another, accosting their comrades not by their real names, but by distinguishing marks of their misfortunes, as to call out the Lame, the Ruptured, the Lefthanded, the Goggle-eyed. Each one had his distinguishing mark, and to us this sort of thing was no small source of amusement. The moment we were in danger, however, it was no laughing matter, but rather did we bewail these very defects. <br />[5] We had embarked to the number of more than fifty, about a third of us being women, most of them young and comely. Do not, however, be quick to envy us, for a screen separated us from them and a stout one at that, the suspended fragment of a recently torn sail, to virtuous men the very wall of <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a>. Nay, <a href=/people/806 target=_blank>Priapus</a> himself might well have been temperate had he taken passage with <a href=/people/4057 target=_blank>Amarantus</a>, for there was never a moment when this fellow allowed us to be free from fear of he uttermost danger. <br />[6] As soon as he had doubled the temple of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, near you, he made straight for <a href=/people/5997 target=_blank>Taphosiris</a>, with all sails spread, to all seeming bent upon confronting <a href=/people/10625 target=_blank>Scylla</a>, over whom we were all wont to shudder in our boyhood when doing our school exercises. This maneuver we detected only just as the vessel was nearing the reefs, and we all raised so mighty a cry that perforce he gave up his attempt to battle with the rocks. All at once he veered about as though some new idea had possessed him, and turned his vessel's head to the open, struggling as best he might against a contrary sea. <br />[7] Presently, a fresh south wind springs up and carries us along, and soon we are out of sight of land and have come into the track of the double-sailed cargo vessels, whose business does not lie with our <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>; they are sailing quite another course. Again we make common cause of complaint, and our grievance now is that we have been forced away far from the shore. Then does this <a href=/people/206 target=_blank>Titan</a> of ours, <a href=/people/4057 target=_blank>Amarantus</a>, fulminate, standing up on the stern and hurling awful imprecations upon us. We shall obviously never be able to fly, he said, How can I help people like you who distrust both the land and the sea? </p>                        </div>

For our own part we had no yearning for <a href=/people/5997 target=_blank>Taphosiris</a>, for we wanted only to live. Moreover, I continued, What do we want of the open sea? Let us rather make for the Pentapolis, hugging the shore; for then, if indeed we have to face one of those uncertainties which, as you admit, are unfortunately only too frequent on the deep, we shall at least be able to take refuge in some neighboring harbor. <br />[9] I did not succeed in persuading him with my talk, for to all of it the outcast only turned a deaf ear; and what is more, a gale commenced to blow from the north, and the violent wind soon raised seas mountains high. This gust falling suddenly on us, drove our sail back, and made it concave in place of its convex form, and the ship was all but capsized by the stern. With great difficulty, however, we headed her in. <br />[10] Then <a href=/people/4057 target=_blank>Amarantus</a> thunders out, See what it is to be master of the art of navigation. I had long foreseen this storm, and that is why I sought the open. I can tack in now, since our sea room allows us to add to the length of our tack. But such a course as the one I have taken would not have been possible had we hugged the shore, for in that case the ship would have dashed on the coast. <br />[11] Well, we were perforce satisfied with his explanation so long as daylight lasted and dangers were not imminent, but these failed not to return with the approach of night, for as the hours passed, the seas increased continually in volume. Now it so happened that this was the day on which the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> make what they term the Preparation, and they reckon the night, together with the day following this, as a time during which it is not lawful to work with one's hands. They keep this day holy and apart from the others, and they pass it in rest from labor of all kinds. </p>                        </div>

We rushed to his assistance and implored him not to give up the last hope yet. Indeed the hugest waves were actually menacing the vessel, and the very deep was at war with itself. Now it frequently happens that when the wind has suddenly relaxed its violence, the billows already set in motion do not immediately subside; they are still under the influence of the wind's force, to which they yield an with which they battle at the same time, and the oncoming waves fight against those subsiding. <br />[14] I have every need of my store of flaming language, so that in recounting such immense dangers I may not fall into the trivial. To people who are at sea in such a crisis, life may be said to hang by a thread only, for if our skipper proved at such a moment to be an orthodox observer of the Mosaic law, what was life worth in the future? Indeed we soon understood why he had abandoned the helm, for when we begged him to do his best to save the ship, he stolidly continued reading his roll. Despairing of persuasion, we finally attempted force, and one staunch soldier — for many <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabs</a> of the cavalry were of our company — one staunch soldier, I say, drew his sword and threatened to behead the fellow on the spot if he did not resume control of the vessel. But the <a href=/people/5098 target=_blank>Maccabaean</a> in very deed was determined to persist in his observances. <br />[15] However, in the middle of the night he voluntarily returned to the helm. For now, he said, We are clearly in danger of death, and the law commands. On this the tumult sprang up afresh, groaning of men and shrieking of women. All called upon the gods, and cried aloud; all called to mind those they loved. <a href=/people/4057 target=_blank>Amarantus</a> alone was in good spirits, for he thought to himself that now at last he would foil his creditors.

On inquiring the reason for this, I learned from them that they regarded it as more honorable to belch out their souls to the winds while still on the deck, than to gape them out to the waves. These men are by nature true descendants of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, I thought, and I entirely approved their view of the matter. <br />[19] Then someone loudly proclaimed that everyone possessing gold should suspend it about the neck, and those who possessed it did so, as well as those who had anything of the value of gold. The women themselves put on their jewelry, and distributed cords to those who needed them: such is the time-honored custom. Now this is the reason for it. It is a matter of necessity that the corpse from a shipwreck should carry with it a fee for burial, inasmuch as whosoever comes across the dead body and profits by it, will fear the laws of <a href=/people/1436 target=_blank>Adrasteia</a>, and will scarcely grudge sprinkling a little sand on the one who has given him so much more in value. </p>                        </div>

I was lamenting, not so much my approaching death, — the god of hospitality be my witness! — as the sum of money which would be lost to this Thracian before whom, even when dying, I should feel shame. I came to the point of regarding it as a luxury to die in the fullest sense of the word, above all to perish in such a way as to escape all consciousness hereafter. <br />[21] Now what made death gape at our feet was the fact that the ship was running with all sails spread, and that there was no means of taking them in, for as often as we attempted this we were thwarted by the ropes, which stuck in the pulleys; and again we had a secret fear lest in the night time, even if we lived out the sea, we should approach land in this sorry plight. <br />[22] But day broke before all this had time to occur, and never, I know, did we behold the sun with greater joy. The wind grew more moderate as the temperature became milder, and thus, as the moisture evaporated, we were able to work the rigging and handle the sails. We were unable, it is true, to replace our sail by a new one, for this was already in the hands of the pawnbroker, but we took it in like the swelling folds of a garment, and lo, in four hours' time we who had imagined ourselves already in the jaws of death, were disembarking in a remote desert place, possessing neither town nor farm near it, only an expanse of open country of one hundred and thirty stadia. <br />[23] Our ship was riding in the open sea, for the spot was not a harbor, and it was riding on a single anchor. The second anchor had been sold. And a third <a href=/people/4057 target=_blank>Amarantus</a> did not possess. When now we touched the dearly beloved land, we embraced the earth as a real living mother. We sent up hymns of gratitude to Providence, as is our custom, and to all this we added a mention of the present good fortune by which we had been saved contrary to all expectation. </p>                        </div>

When, however, we were unable to discover any way out by land, for we could find no one in the country, we decided to try our fortune again at sea. We straightway started at dawn with a wind which blew from the stern all that day and the following one, but towards the end of this second day the wind left us and we were in despair. However, only too soon should we be longing for a calm. <br />[25] It was the thirteenth day of the waning moon, and a great danger was now impending, I mean the conjunction of certain constellations and those well known chance events which no one, they say, ever confronted at sea with impunity. So at the very moment when we should have stayed in harbor, we so far forgot ourselves as to run out again to sea. The storm opened with north winds and with heavy rain during the moonless night, presently the winds raged without measure, and the sea became deeply churned up. <br />[26] As to ourselves, exactly what you might expect at such a crisis took place. I will not dilate a second on the identical sufferings, I will only say that the very magnitude of the storm was helpful. First the sailyard began to crack, and we thought of tightening up the vessel; then it broke in the middle and very nearly killed us all. It seems that this very accident, failing to destroy us, was the means of our salvation. We should never have been able to resist the force of the wind, for again the sail was intractable and defied all our efforts to take it in. Contrary to all prevision we had shaken off the rapacious violence of our enforced run, and we carried along during a day and a night, and at the second crowing of the cock, before we knew it, behold we were on a sharp reef which ran out from the land like a short peninsula. <br />[27] Then a shout went up, for someone passed the word that we should had gone aground on the shore itself. There was much shouting and very little agreement. The sailors were terrified, whereas we through inexperience clapped our hands and embraced each other. We could not sufficiently express our great joy. And yet this was accounted the most formidable of the dangers that had beset us. </p>                        </div>

Finally, he came out to us in a boat with two oars, and this he made fast to our vessel. Then he took over the helm, and our Syrian gladly relinquished to him the conduct of the ship. So after proceeding not more than fifty stadia, he brought her to anchor in a delightful little harbor, which I believe is called Azarium and there disembarked us on the beach. We acclaimed him as our savior and good angel. <br />[29] A little while later, he brought in another ship, and then again another, and before evening had fallen, we were in all five vessels saved by this godsent old man, the very reverse of <a href=/people/1195 target=_blank>Nauplius</a> in his actions, for the latter received the shipwrecked in a vastly different manner. On the following day, other ships arrived, some of which had put out from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> the day before we set sail. So now we are quite a great fleet in a small harbor. <br />[30] Now provisions began to run short. So little accustomed were we to such accidents and so little had we anticipated a voyage of such length, that we had not brought sufficient stock and, what is more, we had not husbanded what we had on board. The old man had a remedy for this also. He did not give us anything himself, and he certainly did not look like one who had possessions. But he pointed out rocks to us where, he said, breakfast and supper were hidden away for those willing to work for it daily. Forthwith we set ourselves to fishing, and we have lived on the produce of our sport now seven days. The more stalwart of our party hunted out eels and lobsters of great size, and the children made a great game of catching gudgeons and shrimps. As to the Roman monk and myself, we fortified ourselves with limpets, a concave shell which attaches itself very firmly on the rocks. <br />[31] In the first stages of this life or ours we fared ill enough. Everyone kept avariciously whatever he could get hold of, and no one gave a present to his neighbor, but now we have abundance, and this is how it all happened. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=demonym long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyan</a> women would have offered even bird's milk to the women of our party. They bestowed upon them all the products of earth and air alike; to wit, cheeses, flour, barley cakes, <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a>, poultry, and eggs; one of them even made a present of a bustard, a bird of very delicious flavor. A yokel would call it at first sight a <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peacock</a>. </p>                        </div>

At present they who go fishing have become generous — a man, a child comes to me one after another, and makes me a present, now a fish caught on the line, invariably some dainty that the rocks produce. To please you I take nothing from the women, that there may be no truce between them and me, and that I may be in no difficulty about denial, when I have to abjure all connection with them. <br />[33] And yet what was to hinder me from rejoicing in necessities? So much comes in from all sides. The kindness of the inhabitants of the country towards their women guests you probably attribute to their virtue alone. Such is not the case; and it is worth while to explain all this to you, particularly as I have so much leisure. The wrath of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, it would seem, lies heavy on the land; the women are as unlucky as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=ethnic long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnians</a>; their breasts are overfull and they have disproportionately large chests, so that the infants obtain nourishment held not by the mother's arm, but by her shoulder, the nipple being turned upwards. <br />[34] One might of course maintain that <a href=/people/577 target=_blank>Ammon</a> and the country of <a href=/people/577 target=_blank>Ammon</a> is as good a nurse of children as of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, and that nature has there endowed <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and humanity alike with fuller and more abundant fountains of milk, and so to that end are ampler breasts and reservoirs needed. Now, when these women hear from men who have had commerce with others beyond the frontier, that all women are not like this, they are incredulous. So when they fall in with a foreign woman, they make up to her in every way until they have gained their object, which is to examine her bosom, and then the woman who has examined the stranger tells another, and they call one another like the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410255RKik class=ethnic long=25.5 lat=41>Cicones</a>, they flock together to the spectacle and bring presents to them. <br />[35] We happened to have with us a young female slave who came from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>. Art and nature had combined to make her more highly chiseled than an ant. All the stir was about this one, and she made much gain from the women, and for the last three days the richest in the neighborhood have been sending for her, and have passed her from one to the other. She was so little embarrassed that she readily exhibited herself in undress. </p>                        </div>

If the crime was committed by you, pray, beg, supplicate, tire not of going down on your knees, even until the moment that judgment shall have been passed upon you, and you shall have been delivered up to an executioner, and shall have paid your penalty. If will be a blessing to you, my dear Joannes, that what has first been purified should so depart to the judges below. <br />[6] Do not think that my warning is a speech with any other sense than this. Do not imagine for a moment I am jesting with you; so may I have profit of sacred Philosophy, and of my own children besides. I should not have given you any such advice, if you had been no friend of mine, for I pray that this lot may not fall even to my enemies. As for them, may they never take the point of view that it is a nobler thing for the culprit voluntarily to undergo his punishment! May they on the contrary never forgo being prosperous in their sins, in order that they may live in them a longer time, and have to account for them all in that place below! <br />[7] For the sake of friendship I feel for you I am running the risk of revealing to you some of the mysteries. There is no resemblance between paying the penalty in this crass body and in paying it in the soul. God is a stronger force than man, and the human order of things is but a shadow of the divine organization. </p>                        </div>

There are demons of purification who treat souls as fullers treat soiled garments. If these garments were endowed with consciousness, what would be their suffering, I ask you, while they were being trampled, washed, and combed in every way? With what pain would the old spots and clinging stains be washed away? I need scarcely say that in many cases the soiling is so deeply ingrained that it is irremovable, and the stuff will disappear before it returns to its proper form, because corruption has come into its nature, either on account of the lapse of time or the very greatness of the corruption. <br />[9] For a soul in such a state, to be perishable would be happiness indeed. But although there are sins which resemble spots that cannot be washed away, the soul is not like the soiled garment whose web does not resist destruction. Eternal as it is, its lot is eternal punishment when it becomes ingrained and incurably soiled with sin; but when it has already undergone punishment in that life in which it has sinned, it has not this [eternal] calamity clinging to it ever present, but as one might say, the soul, newly dyed, is quickly washed again. <br />[10] The penalty therefore ought to be paid as quickly as possible, and at the hands of the men, rather than at those of demons. A certain story is recounted, which persuades me that those who have been sinned against become the masters eventually — masters with power to lengthen or cut short the terms of punishment. Whether one has done a great injury to one, or a slight injury to many, the result will be very much the same, for each victim will put it in his own claims to vengeance, and each one must be satisfied. If a cure is possible, the punishment already undergone by the soul may mollify the Judge, and even incline the victims themselves to indulgence. When then is it likely that the blest soul of <a href=/people/116 target=_blank>Aemilius</a> may be inclined to grant you forgiveness? <br />[11] I think, or rather I know well, that every suppliant has a claim to respect, once he has expiated his errors by punishing himself. Ere now a man has been summoned before me to defend himself for a crime, and by haste in recognizing his guilt and admitting that he deserves punishment has won his acquittal; whereas to revel in one's crime is to turn into a sullen enemy the man whose life or fortune one has attacked.

You will be exposed before the Judgment where we are all alike awaited, you, I, and all such as a public repentance has not first purified. <br />[13] Courage, then, my noble friend, for I wish you to be noble; despise not those pleasures which we purchase by wrong-doing. You must not be ashamed before men, but must confess everything to the magistrate, and endeavor to avert the punishment below by an immediate castigation. For while the greatest good is not to err, the next best is to take punishment for an error. <br />[14] The man who remains unpunished for longstanding sins should be deemed most unfortunate, as one cared for neither by God nor man. <br />[15] Again, look at it from this point of view. If immunity from punishment is recognized as an evil, punishment itself becomes a benefit, for contrary forces, according to all logic, produce contrary results. If I had only been with you, you would not have made difficulties about putting aside your shame and denouncing yourself. I should have directed myself to your defense, and I should have conducted you to the laws as to physicians.

Such men have infernal punishments waiting for them, for not other manner of evil is so abhorred by God as the slanderer who strikes in the dark.

Let him not be condemned in default. Most worthy judges, you might say, because no one has brought a charge against me in open court, it is less your duty to resort to every inquisition to pursue and hunt down the truth?

These men possess iron nails which have the force of learned syllogisms, so that whatever is made manifest when they hold sway, this is truth itself. <br />[21] If such wise you are acquitted as an innocent man, you will then come back from the tribunal victorious and exultant, a shining light, and so regarded.

May these never be handed down by the passage of time, but, as they begin with <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronicus</a>, so may they disappear with him, and may these symbols of this man's rule survive to our posterity as a mere rumor. <br />[6] Now when a man of good birth, not an unjust one, but a man who has been unfortunate only, was tortured by these means, and that too in the full midday sun, that he might die with executioners only for witnesses, and when <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronicus</a> himself became aware that the Church was in sympathy with this man — only because, the moment I heard of the facts, I myself rushed out, as I was, that I might be on the spot and share in bearing the trouble — when he hears of this, he flies into a rage that a bishop has dared to pity a man hated by himself. Then he indulges in all sorts of violent behavior, the boldest of his servants, <a href=/people/533 target=_blank>Thoas</a>, encouraging him, the tool he employs for this public outrages and finally he lets out in madness that most godless voice of his, saying that he has placed his hopes in the Church in vain, and that no one shall be torn from the hands of <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronicus</a>, not even should he be embracing the foot of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> Himself. <br />[7] We must be, both in mind and in body, pure before God. For these reasons the church of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327210UPto class=place long=20.9504 lat=32.709>Ptolemais</a> enjoins her sister churches everywhere in these terms: </p>                        </div>

On this account, I have declined a sad duty, I have forced my body to action, while still under medical treatment, and have just journeyed through the suspected region as if it were unsuspected. I have traversed a country infested by the enemy, and have arrived at Palaebisca and Hydrax. (these are two villages of Pentapolis on the very frontier of arid <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>). Once there, I called together a meeting of the inhabitants; I gave them one letter, and I read to them from the other (one of them was addressed to them, the other, concerning them, addressed to me). I then delivered a speech suited to an election, hoping to induce them to propose the resolution concerning a bishop, or, if the case demanded it, to force them to such a decision; but I could not overcome this people's devotion to the most holy Paul. Believe me, my Father, it was no wish of mine to set out upon this quick and useless journey. I have only offended a people who held me in great honor. <br />[2] Amongst the most prominent citizens some protested with exclamations of wrath, while others, mounting upon any available pedestal to better be heard, addressed themselves at length to the gathering. I at once accused these of bribery and conspiracy, and ordered the ushers to hustle and to expel them from the meeting. I restrained and pacified the turbulent excitement of the crowd. I went through every path of argument; I invoked the sanctity of the Primate's throne, seeking to convince them that slight or honor to you means slight or honor to God. After this their lips pronounced the name of your sacred person with respect. They knelt down, they called upon you with cries and with groans, even as though you had been present. The emotion of these men, even though it was greater than I expected, was slight, but the women, who are proverbially difficult to control, lifted their arms, they raised their infants towards Heaven, they closed their eyes that they might not see the bishop's seat bereft of its accustomed occupant. <br />[3] Indeed, in spite of our policy being the very opposite, they almost compelled us to the same state of feeling. I feared that I should not have the power to resist the contagion, for I felt my inner emotions mastering me; so I dissolved the meeting, and announced that it should assemble again on the fourth day, not, however, without first pronouncing vengeful execrations upon any who by their venal conduct and from motives of purely personal interest, by their complacent attitude or from any other private motive, should use language in opposition to the will of the Church. </p>                        </div>

They did not even wait for a discussion, but straightway all was in an uproar, a confused sound impossible to distinguish. At this moment the heralds of the church proclaimed silence. Their clamor then ended in a dirge, and there was a sullen sound of men groaning, of women wailing, and of children sobbing. One said he mourned a father, another a son, another a brother, each one according to his age divided the titles of relationship. <br />[5] I was just about to speak, when a petition was passed up to me from the midst of the crowd. This someone begged me to read before the assembly. It was an adjuration to me not to attempt to restrain their violence any longer, but to postpone my decision until they were enabled to send to your most blessed presence a decree touching the matter, and an ambassador. They even begged me to send to you a written statement in their behalf, explaining all that I had learned here. <br />[6] Now it was proclaimed in the Synod by the priests and publicly by the people, and the missive went through these very points in order, that these churches belonged to that of Erythrum, according to the Apostolic and patriarchal tradition, but split away under <a href=/people/297 target=_blank>Orion</a> of blessed memory, then in advanced old age and blamed for weakness of character.

This <a href=/people/486 target=_blank>Philo</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=person long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a> was the elder, the uncle, and the namesake of the younger. In other respects he was such as <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>'s teachings had made him, but the moment there was a question of authority on the one hand and obedience on the other, he was more audacious than law-abiding. (I ask forgiveness from the sacred soul of the old man for such a remark.) He arrived on the spot, and took the ordaining of the blessed Siderius into his own hands, and placed him upon the bishop's throne. <br />[9] After all, one must relax the severe letter of the law in times when freedom of speech is impossible. Even the great <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a> himself has been known to yield to the force of circumstances; and some little time after all this, when it was necessary to warm and kindle up the tiny spark of the orthodox faith that still remained in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327210UPto class=place long=20.9504 lat=32.709>Ptolemais</a>, and since Siderius seemed to him fit for so important a mission, he transferred him to this place, that he might govern the metropolitan Church. But old age brought back Siderius to the village churches. There he died, and had no successor in these towns anymore than he had had a predecessor. Palaebisca and Hydrax were put under the old arrangement and came back to their dependency upon Erythrum, and this, they say, was in accordance with the decision of your sacred person. <br />[10] Now the citizens are very strong upon one point, to wit: that this consecration of yours should not be annulled. I asked them for the original document signed by you. They were not able to present it to me, but they produced as witnesses bishops from the council. These said that they proposed Paul to the people in obedience to a letter received from you. As it seemed well to all to make him bishop, they reported the decision, and others succeeded in placing him on the throne. <br />[11] Now, if you will allow me to say so, most revered Father, that was really the moment to look into the matter, for it is more painful to take away a thing than not to grant it; but let that now prevail which seems best to your paternal authority. For if what then seemed right to you was so to them, and they allege this, the fact that it no longer seems so to you deprives it of any justice in the future. It is only in this way that your will becomes identical with justice in the eyes of the people; for obedience is life, and disobedience is death. Therefore they do not raise their hands against you; on the contrary, they supplicate you not to make them orphans while their Father yet lives, for so they declare in their speech. </p>                        </div>

For it is a triumph either of art and power, or of divine grace, so to win men and so to dominate the multitude that for them life is not worth living without him. <br />[13] Your kind nature will therefore give the kindlier decision in their case. I must go back to town, there to await your orders to act. But you shall not be in ignorance of my arrangements during the four days that I passed in this place, and what solution each difficulty found. Do not be surprised if I happen to speak well and ill of the same man, for these comments do not all apply to the same actions, and it is acts that are praised or blamed. It were well that discord should never arise between those who are brothers in <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, but if this does occur, it is well that it should promptly disappear. Moved by all these considerations, as well as in obedience to the instructions you sent, I have undertaken to arbitrate, and I have been listening to a dispute of somewhat the following nature: <br />[14] In the village of Hydrax there is a spot, itself the loftiest part of the village, which formerly was a highly fortified citadel, but God having visited the spot with an earthquake, it has become an abandoned heap of ruins. Up to this day, they have been making other uses of some few of its parts, but these present times of war make it extremely valuable to those who possess it, because it could be fortified anew and return to its old use. <br />[15] Now between our brothers, the most pious bishops Paul [of Erythrum] and Dioscurus [of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328226UDar class=place long=22.6411 lat=32.7635>Darnis</a>], as formerly between others, it was a matter of contention. The Darnite has accused the Erythrite of employing fraudulent means of his own to get possession of that which did not belong to him. He had, forsooth, consecrated to God the property of another, under the pretext of piety. He then defended his villainy with the strong hand; he was the first man to occupy it! The reverend Paul endeavored to advance some counter-arguments, how that he had annexed the fort beforehand, and it had been used as a church long before the reverend Dioscurus had been appointed owner of the site. </p>                        </div>

The fact that a crowd of men have once prayed there by necessity, driven in by a hostile attack of the enemy, does not consecrate a spot, for at that rate all the mountains and all the valleys would be churches, and no fortress would escape being a place of public worship, for in all such places, when the enemy are out for plunder, prayers and celebrations of the Holy Mysteries take place. How many houses in the godless days of the Arians have received prayers and sacred ceremonies! These houses are none the less private property. For that, too, was a case of flight, and they, too, were enemies. <br />[17] Next I inquired into the date of the consecration, and if it had taken place by the gift or agreement of the proprietors. The opposite appeared clearly to be the case. One of the bishops asked for the fort. The other, who was in possession at the time, refused it. Finally one went out with the keys in his pocket, then the other burst in, and bringing with him a table, therewith consecrated a small room, on a broad hill. But nowhere is there access to this small room, except by crossing the whole plateau. <br />[18] Clearly it had been calculated that by this maneuver the hill could be definitely acquired. For my own part, this whole performance seemed to me unworthy, more than unworthy, and I was very angry at this flagrant violation of all sacred laws and civil forms of justice alike. All things become confounded, if on the one hand a new form of confiscation is invented, and if on the other by the holiest things the most abominable should be judged – prayer, the table of the Holy Communion, and the Mystic Veil becoming instruments of a violent attack. No doubt it was on these points that judgment had already been given in the city, for as a matter of fact at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327210UPto class=place long=20.9504 lat=32.709>Ptolemais</a> a meeting of almost all the bishops of the province had then assembled to consider a question of public interest. As they listened they felt hatred of the proceeding, but they hesitated before an act of eviction. <br />[19] I wish to separate superstition from piety, for it is an evil which has taken on the mask of virtue, an evil which philosophy has discovered to be the third degree of godlessness. In my eyes there is nothing sacred or holy except which has come into being in justice and holiness. Nor did it occur to me to shudder at the alleged consecration. For it is not the doctrine of <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> that the Divine presence follows of necessity these mystical matters and sounds, as though these were certain physical attractions. An earthly spirit might be so moved, indeed, but rather is the Divine present with unperturbed dispositions, and those that are proper to God. How could the <a href=/people/1595 target=_blank>Holy Ghost</a> descend into a heart where anger, unreasoning passion, and a contentious spirit are the ruling forces? Nay, if such passions as these enter, even if it has formerly dwelt therein, it takes its departure. I was just about to declare the transference, but he was then proved to have promised this earlier himself, and had clenched his promise with an oath. </p>                        </div>

As I happened to be on the spot because of the ecclesiastical inspection, I felt called upon to cast an eye on the site, and to consider anew the subject under discussion; and again there was present a gathering of bishops from the neighborhood collected for one reason or another. In the presence of all these, and in my own, the boundary stones were shown marking out clearly the territory of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328226UDar class=place long=22.6411 lat=32.7635>Darnis</a>; and the testimony of the old men, and the admissions of those who had up to the moment taken the contrary side, made it evident that the most pious Dioscurus was the owner of the site. <br />[21] On the insistence of Dioscurus' brother, necessity arose that I read publicly the abusive paper that the blessed Paul had written in the shape of a letter addressed to your holiness, an obscene and unpleasant satire directed against his brother, of which the burden of shame fell upon him who had spoken evil, not on him of whom evil had been spoken. <br />[22] But to feel shame is only the second of the virtues. Sinlessness is of the Divine destiny and nature entirely, but one might ascribe to modesty the blush for what has been ill done. By admitting these principles in the present case, the reverend Paul gave evidence of a change of opinion more convincing than any rhetoric, for his confession of error, and the bitter grief manifested as for evils he had voluntarily done, made us all favorably disposed towards him. <br />[23] This was not surprising in our case, but it was remarkable that the reverend bishop Dioscurus yielded to his adversary of his own free will, when he saw that he who had been until now so contentious had come to a more humble frame of mind. Although victorious by the votes of the judges, he was himself conquered by his own sentiment, and it became in the power of the reverend Paul to keep or give up the hill, as he should desire. The splendid Dioscurus was the first to suggest to him various concessions, to not one of which would Paul have listened for a moment before his repentance. Dioscurus suggested him to give up the hill alone, or to give up the whole property in exchange, and many other plans besides he devised, lavishing upon him ways in which a man might anticipate another's pleasure. </p>                        </div>

Paul therefore became the proprietor of the vineyards and the olive groves in addition to the hill. Dioscurus, in place of his possessions, has the possession of magnanimity, a greater one in return for a less, and the honor of remaining within the gospel laws, which have declared the spirit of love to be the most important of its behests. This one thing only was worth commemorating, to wit, the agreement and harmony between the two brothers, passing over the fact that one who is a bishop had been convicted of stumbling, for it is best to allow acts that ought never to have been committed to pass into oblivion. <br />[25] But that Dioscurus should not be unlucky in everything, I have granted his request that I should go through the whole matter very carefully, so that your holiness should be ignorant of nothing. He considers it of the very greatest importance that you should be made acquainted with the facts of the case, and that you should thus realize that he was struggling in no unjust cause. <br />[26] Now I commend the man for other qualities, for he is one after my heart, but I exceedingly admire the feelings of respect by which he is moved for the dignity of your holy office. This I swear by your dear and sacred head: his fellow-poor at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> owe Dioscurus much gratitude, for he helps them to cultivate their lands, and he is ubiquitous, and indefatigable in getting a profit from these even in bad years, and he knows how to turn all available chances to their advantage. <br />[27] Thus the quarrel between the two bishops has come to an end. You also gave me instructions to listen to the complaint of the presbyter <a href=/people/102 target=_blank>Jason</a>, the man who accused one of his colleagues of treating him with much unfairness. The case is somewhat as follows: <a href=/people/102 target=_blank>Jason</a> convicted Lamponian of wrong-doing, but the latter, though he anticipated the sentence by a confession, has his punishment in being debarred from attendance at ecclesiastical synods. Nevertheless he shed tears in repentance, and the people made supplications for his pardon. Notwithstanding all this, I confirmed the decision already rendered and left the right of acquittal to the pontifical seat. </p>                        </div>

If on the other hand he should recover, let him undergo punishment again, and from your divine and charitable spirit alone let him await the token of pardon. After all, <a href=/people/102 target=_blank>Jason</a> himself is not above reproach. He has a quick tongue, and he came up against a man whose hand is quicker, and the result is that, as the proverb says, for a word, the lightest of all things, a sentence the heaviest was his penalty. <br />[29] Now as to the sum of money which I discussed, Lamponian admits that he has it, nor does he desire to be relieved on account of the shipwreck which caused the contract to disappear. He only seeks a favorable moment to sell his crops, and he said indeed that, dismissing all other matters, he was giving his mind to this one thing, how he might make restoration to his poorer creditors. The sum in question amounts to one hundred and fifty seven pieces. <br />[30] Now I must report on an abuse that is spreading amongst us, that it may perforce stop its course. Priests are prosecuting priests for lawless acts, I do not yet say by perjury, but at all events by malice prepense, for their object is not to punish those who are guilty, but to gain some illicit profit from the military chiefs. The burdens of all must needs fall upon my shoulders. Write, therefore, I beg of you, and ordain that it be permitted to no one to do anything of the sort. By so doing, you will confer a favor upon me, and at the same time you will protect the more peaceable and the unfortunate. In a word, you will be doing a much better turn to the evildoers themselves, if it is a greater good to be delivered from a greater evil, and a greater evil to do injustice than to suffer injustice, for the one thing is one's own, the other another's fault. <br />[31] I have not revealed who these men are, and do not you for your part, if you know, convict any of them by name, that I may not be hated by my brethren. God will forgive me for reproving them greatly face to face in private, but do you appear to condemn the offense only in your letter to me. Without wounding anyone, I shall with God's help find means of bringing to an end this unseemly behavior of ours, not to say that of the whole Church. </p>                        </div>

A certain number of discharged men are wandering about our neighborhood. You must forgive me for using something of a foreign word, in order that by the more common vernacular of the country, I may put the wickedness of some more clearly. These men do not wish to have an appointed see, and have left each their own, not so much by necessity as by caprice. They enjoy honors, traveling wherever they find most profit. <br />[33] This, revered Father, is in my opinion the best line of conduct to pursue in regard to them. We ought to forbid every church to those who have renounced their own, and until they go and establish themselves in their own, no one should receive them at the altar, nor invite them to occupy the chief seats; we should overlook them amongst the crowd on the peoples' benches when they burst into the church. They would return quickly to their own posts, if they feared for their dignity, which they now think to enjoy everywhere, rather than in the one place befitting; but they would prefer to enjoy their dignity there, rather than nowhere. <br />[34] Thus, then, they should be treated in public, merely as private citizens, if so it seems well to your sacred throne also, but how to treat them privately in our own homes, we shall know only when an answer comes from your Holiness to that question which, you may remember, I put to you some time ago about <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, by race a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=demonym long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrenean</a>, but ordained bishop in some city in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a>. He was expelled from his own see in troublous times, and now that he is able to return there, he refuses to take up his post again but insists upon remaining in our midst. Concerning this matter I wrote to your Holiness, going into all the details of his case, and I asked you how I ought to comport myself with him. As you did not reply, I do not know whether my letter reached you or whether it was lost. I talked over the whole matter with Dioscurus, that worthy bishop, and he ordered the scribes to hand over the copy of what I wrote beforehand, so that if you do not happen to have received my letter, when you have this document in hand, you can decide upon the merits of the case and send me your answer. <br />[35] Above all, pray for me, for you will be praying for a man abandoned by all, deserted, and in need of such support. I shrink from asking of God anything for myself. All things are turning out quite contrary to my desires, on account of my rash presumption; a sinful man, brought up outside the pale of the Church, and having received an alien training, I grasped at the altars of God. </p>                        </div>

That is to say, they are worthless everywhere. Thus it seems to me that everyone should be thankful to war, for it is an exact touchstone of the blood in the heart of each one of us. It takes away many boasters, and returns them to us more temperate men. In the future, we shall no longer see the guilty Joannes swaggering about the public square, and attacking with kicks and blows men of a peaceable disposition. Indeed, yesterday the proverb, or rather the oracle, received clear information, for you certainly know it as an oracle: There be no long-haired men who are not degenerates? <br />[2] For some days now they have been warning us of the approach of the enemy. I thought that we ought to meet these. The leader of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328218SBal class=ethnic long=21.7157 lat=32.7609>Balagritae</a> drew up his forces, and sallied out with them. Then, having occupied the plain first, we waited. The enemy did not appear. In the evening we went away home each of us, after we had arranged to return upon the following day. <br />[3] During this time, Joannes the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=person long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> was nowhere; at least he was invisible, but he spread rumors in secret, at one moment that he had broken his leg and they had been obliged to amputate it, at another that he was suffering from asthma, later that some other untoward fate had overtaken him. Such tale-bearers kept drifting in from different sides, or so they pretended, the object being, no doubt, that no one should know into what retreat our man had slipped, or where he was concealed. </p>                        </div>

Ah! Now is the moment when we need his generous spirit — strong hands like his. What wonderful things he would have done, how he would have shone! In each case, crying Oh, evil destiny!, they wrung their hands and disappeared. <br />[5] Of course, they all belong to that company which Joannes fed at his table, for no good purpose — men with long hair like himself, base creatures, impudent thieves of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> and <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> and, by the gods, sometimes of women also. Such are the henchmen that he has been preparing for a long time. To be a man amongst them he never attempts. That would be too difficult. He is a cunning fellow withal, and he seeks the best opportunities of appearing a man in the eyes of those who are real man, but methinks fortune has upset all his calculations famously. <br />[6] For five days we had in vain sallied out in arms to find the enemy, but they were always at the frontier places which they were engaged in devastating. Then when Joannes was convinced that the enemy would not dare to come into the heart of the country, he himself appeared and is now turning everything into confusion. <br />[7] He ill? Never! Why, he was even laughing at people who believed such a story. He had come from a great distance, he said, I know not whence. He had been called there to bring assistance, and it was owing to this that the districts which had called on him were saved, for the enemy did not invade, terrified as they were at the mere rumor of the approach of Joannes. Once he had tranquillized everything there, he rushed up, he said, to the menaced province. He is waiting for the barbarians, who may appear at any moment, so long as they are not aware of his presence, and so long as his name is not mentioned. </p>                        </div>

He is claiming to be the general's right hand, he is promising that in no time at all he will teach the art of victory. He is shouting Front form! Fall into line! Form square to the flank! In a word he is using all the words of the military profession without any knowledge of their meaning. <br />[9] Thus some considered him a man of consequence and praised his talents, and were eager to become his pupils. <br />[10] It was now late in the evening. It was time to pursue our attack. When we came down from the mountains, we pushed on to the plain. There four young men — peasants, as their clothes indicated — rushed to us at top speed shouting as loud as they could. No one had need of a diviner to see that they were in terror of the enemy, and that they were in a hurry to find refuge amongst our troops. Before they had time to tell us properly that the enemy was there, we saw some wretched creatures on horseback, men who, to judge from the look of them, had been pushed into battle merely by hunger, and were quite ready to risk their lives in order to possess of our goods. <br />[11] The moment that they saw us, as we also saw them, before they were within javelin throw, they jumped from their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, as is their way, to give battle on foot. I was of the opinion that we ought to do the same thing, for the ground did not lend itself to cavalry maneuvers.

I really do not know which of the two to admire the more, the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> or the rider, for if the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> galloped up hill and down hill and over rough country and smooth alike, cleared ditches and banks at a bound, the horseman for his part, kept his seat in the saddle firm and unshaken. I am sure the enemy thought it a fine sight, and were only too anxious to have many such. <br />[13] We could not give them this satisfaction, but you may imagine that we were disconcerted after having taken the promises of this hirsute beauty so seriously. So we drew up the line of battle to receive the enemy, if he should attack us. But we did not wish to take the initiative in the engagement ourselves. With such an example before us, the bravest of us distrusted his neighbor. Here nothing was a greater abomination than a head of hair, for the possessor seemed the most likely to betray us. <br />[14] However, the enemy did not seem in a hurry to open the attack any more than we were, for they drew up their line of battle and waited for us, in order to drive us back, in case we should take the offensive. On both sides the troops stood watching each other. Finally they drew off to the left and then we to the right, but at a walking pace and without haste, so that the retreat might not have the appearance of a flight. <br />[15] Notwithstanding all these anxieties, we tried to find out where in the world Joannes was. He had galloped without reining up as far as Bombaea, and he remained hidden in the cave there, like a field-<a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mouse</a> in its hole. Bombaea is a mountain full of caverns, where art and nature have combined to form an impregnable fortress. It has been long celebrated, and justly: they often compare it to the subterranean vaults of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. But today everyone admits that there are no walls behind which one could be safer than at Bombaea, since even the most prudent of all men — I am too polite to say the most cowardly, the right word to use — has gone thither to hide himself, as to the surest refuge. The moment one enters this place, one is in a regular labyrinth, hard to get through, so that it by itself could provide places of refuge for Joannes. </p>                        </div>

After having behaved to the inhabitants of the counter in this manner (for as to the foreigners, it was impossible to levy money upon them), he proceeded to extract money from their cities by conducting troops there and moving them, not where there was the greatest military advantage, but where there was most plunder.

They are excellent men. But if they do otherwise, you will then be the wiser, inasmuch as you will not put faith in faithless men. But that I may not uselessly weary my secretary in dictating letters to him that you will never receive, I should like to be sure about this. </p>                        </div>

She will choose the man by whom she wishes it be conveyed, and her choice, I am sure, will fall upon the most trusted messenger. <br />[5] We do not know, my dearest and best friend, if we shall ever have a chance of conversing together again. The cowardice of our generals has delivered up our country to the enemy without a single battle; there are no survivors except those of us who have seized fortified places. Those who have been captured in the plains have been butchered like victims for sacrifice. <br />[6] We are now afraid of a prolonged siege, lest it should compel most of the fortresses to surrender to thirst. This is the reason why I did not answer your counter-charges on the subject of the presents. I had no leisure, for I was taken up with a machine which I am constructing, that we may hurl long-distance missiles from the turrets, stones of really substantial weight. I shall leave you, however, entirely at liberty to send me gifts, for of course Synesius must yield to <a href=/people/3220 target=_blank>Olympius</a>, but they must not be gifts of a luxurious sort. I disapprove of the luxury of the quarters assigned to the company. <br />[7] Send me, then, things that are useful for soldiers, such as bows and arrows, and above all arrows with heads attached to them. As far as the bows are concerned, I can at a pinch buy them elsewhere, or repair those which I have already, but it is not easy to procure arrows, I mean really good ones. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> arrows that we have bulge at the knots and sink in between the knots, so that they deviate from their right course.

At the same time, what is foreign to anyone is difficult of credence. A Syrian will not easily acknowledge the existence of salt from the earth, very much as people here are hard to convince when I answer questions about ships, sails, and the sea. <br />[6] You may remember that once when I was studying philosophy with you, I looked out upon this very thing, the sea, and the great deep lake which stretches from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299IPha class=place long=29.8856 lat=31.213>Pharos</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/313300UCan class=place long=30.0772 lat=31.3107>Canopus</a>.

Even if they admit what is told them about vessels, or only seem to laugh at it, at all events they stoutly refuse to believe that the sea too is able to nourish mankind. According to their idea, this privilege belongs to mother earth alone. <br />[7] On one occasion, when they refused to believe in the existence of fish, I took a certain jar, and dashing it against a stone, showed them plenty of salted fish from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, on which they said they were the bodies of evil <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a>, sprang up and took to flight, for they suspected that the spines were as dangerous as the poison of <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>'s fang. Then the oldest and most intelligent of them all said that he found it difficult to believe that salt water could produce anything good and fit to eat, since spring water, excellent though it be to drink, produces nothing except <a href=/people/10983 target=_blank>frogs</a> and leeches, which not even a madman would taste. And yet their ignorance is natural. </p>                        </div>

For us there is time for philosophy, but no time to do evil. <br />[9] All our meetings are full of comradeship for all, for we depend on each other for farming, for our shepherds and flocks, and for every sort of hunting which the land affords.

He has so eulogized the forum, that makes us poor men shameless and utterly vile, a place in which there is no health, but only railing and skill in contriving evil.

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg2006.tlg001:148.12'><b>&sect; 148.12</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I say? Wild beasts' flesh? Why, they would rather take poison than any such dishes of ours! They seek the lightest wine, the thickest honey, the thinnest olive oil, and the heaviest wheat. They are always singing the praises of places where these products may be obtained, such as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, a certain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379238LHym class=place long=23.815 lat=37.946>Hymettus</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenice</a>, and Barathra. Our country, even if it is inferior to each country that holds the first place in some one particular, surpasses the rest in the rest; and this to hold the first place by virtue of the second places, just as by gaining this distinction, <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a> and <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a> were proclaimed to the Greeks the best of all in all things. <br />[13] We will admit, if you like, that our honey is not as good as the honey of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379238LHym class=place long=23.815 lat=37.946>Hymettus</a>; nevertheless, it is so good that, when you have it, it falls not short of the foreign flavor. As to the olive-oil of this country, it is certainly the best, if one does not listen to people whose taste is depraved, for these persist in judging oil by weight, and the less heavy they hold to be more valuable. With us scales are not forged for oil, but we assert that if this must be done, it would be natural to give preference to the heavier. Moreover, their oil, however famous and costly, when once put into a lamp, is so feeble that it scarcely gives any light at all. But our oil is so good that it gives out a complete flame, and when a lamp is needed, it produces artificial daylight. It is useful for enriching cakes, or to make the sinews of athletes supple. <br />[14] Again, the art of music is especially native to our country. Our Anchemachetae play upon a little shepherd's lyre, a simple thing made by themselves, sweet-toned and fairly masculine in its note, not unworthy for the bringing-up of children in <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s city. For it is not supple, nor does it have the virtue of adaptation to every note. However, our singers accommodate themselves to the simplicity of its strings, for they do not attempt sentimental subjects. One fair subject of song amongst us is praise of a the vigorous ram, and the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> with the lost tail comes in for a eulogy, because I suppose he deserves it for not fearing the hyenas, and strangling the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a>. Then the hunter is not least a subject of song, who brings peace to our pastures and feasts us with every sort of meat. Nor is the twin-bearing ewe deemed unworthy of our lyre, she who rears <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> more numerous than the years. We also often sing with vigor the praises of the fig-tree and the vine, but above all we sing to supplicate Heaven, asking blessings for men, and crops, and <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>. <br />[15] Such are our celebrations, seasonable and of old tradition, the good things of the poor; but as to the emperor, as to the favorites of the emperor, and fortune's dance, which we hear about when we come together, all those mere names which, like flames, are shot up to great height of glory, only to be extinguished — no one, or hardly anyone, speaks of them here. Our ears have rest from such stories. </p>                        </div>

There are people amongst us who suppose that <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, the son of <a href=/people/126 target=_blank>Atreus</a>, is still king, the great king who went against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. From childhood we have heard the king spoken of by this name and no other. He has for a friend, our good herdsman say, a certain <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, a bald man, quite wonderful in dealing with events, and finding a way out of difficulties, and indeed they tell with laughter the story of the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a>, imagining that <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> blinded him only a year ago; and how the old man was conveyed under the belly of a ram, how this outcast mounted guard at the entrance, and imagined that the leader of the flock was bringing up the rear, not from the weight he was carrying, but through sympathy for his master's fortune. <br />[17] Through this letter you have at all events been with us in spirit for a while. You have watched our fields and seen the simplicity of our life, and no doubt you will say to yourself, it was thus that they lived in the time of <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a>, before justice was enslaved. </p>                        </div>

One of them as I was moved thereto by God Himself, the other because of the slander of men. <br />[2] Some of those who wear the white or dark mantle have maintained that I am faithless to philosophy, apparently because I profess grace and harmony of style, and because I venture to say something concerning <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> and concerning the figures of the rhetoricians. In the eyes of such persons one must hate literature in order to be a philosopher, and must occupy himself with divine matters only. No doubt these men alone have become spectators of the knowable. This privilege is unlawful for me, for I spend some of my leisure in purifying my tongue and sweetening my wit. <br />[3] The thing which urged them to condemn me, on the charge that I am fit only for trifling, is the fact that my Cynegetics disappeared from my house, how I know not, and has been received with great enthusiasm by certain young men who make a cult of atticisms and graceful periods. Moreover, some poetical attempts of mine seemed to them the work of an artist who reproduces the antique, as we are wont to say in speaking of statues. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg2006.tlg001:154.4'><b>&sect; 154.4</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain men among my critics whose effrontery is only surpassed by their ignorance, and these are the readiest of all to spin out discussions concerning God. Whenever you meet them, you have to listen to their babble about inconclusive syllogisms. They pour a torrent of phrases over those who stand in no need of them, in which I suppose they find their own profit. The public teachers that one sees in our cities, come from this class. It is a very Horn of <a href=/people/1323 target=_blank>Amalthea</a> which they think themselves entitled to use. You will, I think, recognize this easy-going tribe, which miscalls nobility of purpose. They wish me to become their pupil; they say that in a short time they will make me all-daring in questions of divinity, and that I shall be able to declaim day and night without stopping. <br />[5] The rest, who have more taste, are sophists, much more unfortunate than these. They would like to be famous in the same way, but unfortunately for them they are incapable even of this. You know some who, despoiled by the office of the tax-collector, or urged thereto by some one calamity, have become philosophers in the middle of their lives. Their philosophy consists in a very simple formula, that of calling God to witness, as <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> did, whenever they deny anything or whenever they assert anything. A shadow would surpass these men in uttering anything to the point; but their pretensions are extraordinary. Oh, what proudly arched brows! They support their beards with the hand. They assume a more solemn countenance than the statues of <a href=/people/365 target=_blank>Xenocrates</a>. They are even resolved to shackle us with a law which is altogether to their advantage; to wit, that no one shall be in open possession of any knowledge of the good. They esteem it an exposure of themselves if any one, deemed a philosopher, knows ho to speak, for as they think to hide behind a veil of simulation and to appear to be quite full of wisdom within. <br />[6] These are the two types of men who have falsely accused me with occupying myself in trivial pursuits, one of them because I do not talk the same sort of nonsense as they do, the other because I do not keep my mouth shut, and do not keep the '<a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> on my tongue', as they do. Against these was my treatise composed, and it deals with the loquacity of the one school and the silence of the other. Although it is the latter in particular that it is addressed, namely to the speechless and envious men in question (do you not think with some comeliness of from?), none the less it has found means of dragging in those other men also, and it aims at being not less an exhibition than an encomium of great learning. Nor did I abjure their charges, but for their still great discomfiture I have often courted them. <br />[7] Next, passing as to the choice of a life, the work of praises that of philosophy as being the most philosophic of choices; and what sort of choice it must be regarded, learn from the book itself. Finally, it defends my library, also, which the same men accused, on the ground that it conceals unrevised copies. These spiteful fellows have not kept their hands even off things like these. If each thing is in its proper place; and all things have been handled in season; if the motives behind each part of the undertaking are just; if it has been divided into a number of chapters in the manner of the divine work the <a href=/people/473 target=_blank>Phaedrus</a>, in which <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> discusses the various types of the beautiful; if all the arguments have been devised to converge on the one end proposed; if, moreover, conviction has anywhere quietly come to the support of the flatness of the narrative, and if out of conviction demonstration has resulted, as happens in such cases, and if one thing follows another logically, these results must be gifts of nature and art. </p>                        </div>

But the meanings of those will easily escape others because of their semblance to redundancy, and their appearance as being thrown into the narrative too much by chance, and as it might seem roughly. Epileptics are the only people who feel the cold influences of the moon. On the other hand only those receive the flashes of the emanations of the intellect, for whom in the full health of the mind's eye God kindles a light akin to his own, that light which is the cause of knowledge to the intellectual, and to knowable things the cause of their being known. In the same way, ordinary light connects sight with color. But remove this light, and its power to discern is ineffective. <br />[9] Concerning all of this I shall await your decision. If you decree that I ought to publish my book, I will dedicate it to orators and philosophers together. The first it will please, and to the others it will be useful, provided of course that it is not rejected by you, who are really able to pass judgment. If it does not seem to you worthy of Greek ears, if, like <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, you prize truth more than friendship, a close and profound darkness will overshadow it, and mankind will never hear it mentioned. <br />So much for this matter. <br />[10] The other work [On dreams] God ordained and He gave His sanction to it, and it has been set up as a thank-offering to the imaginative faculties. It contains an inquiry into the whole imaginative soul, and into some other points which have not yet been handled by any Greek philosopher. But why should one dilate on this? This work was completed, the whole of it, in a single night, or rather, at the end of a night, one which also brought the vision enjoining me to write it. There are two or three passages in the book in which it seemed to me that I was some other person, and that I was one listening to myself amongst others who were present. <br />[11] Even now this work, as often as I go over it, produces a marvelous effect upon me, and a certain divine voice envelops me as in poetry. Whether this my experience is not unique, or may happen to another, on all this you will enlighten me, for after myself you will be the first of the Greeks to have access to the work. </p>                        </div>
