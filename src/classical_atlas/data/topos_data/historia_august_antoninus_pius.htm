He was reared at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419123ULor class=place long=12.3008 lat=41.8885>Lorium</a> on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPAu class=place long=12.4614 lat=41.8884>Aurelian Way</a>, where he afterwards built the palace whose ruins stand there to-day. 9 He passed his childhood first with his paternal grandfather, then later with his maternal; and he showed such a dutiful affection toward all his family, that he was enriched by legacies from even his cousins, his stepfather, and many still more distant kin. </p>                        </div>

He possessed all these qualities, moreover, in the proper mean and without ostentation, 2 and, in fine, was praiseworthy in every way and, in the minds of all good men, well deserving of comparison with <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> <a href=/people/1714 target=_blank>Pompilius</a>. 3 He was given the name of <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a> by the senate, either because, when his father-in-law was old and weak, he lent him a supporting hand in his attendance at the senate (which act, indeed, is not sufficient as a token of great dutifulness, since a man were rather undutiful who did not perform this service than dutiful if he did), 4 or because he spared those men whom <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> in his ill-health had condemned to death, 5 or because after <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>'s death he had unbounded and extraordinary honours decreed for him in spite of opposition from all, 6 or because, when <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> wished to make away with himself, by great care and watchfulness he prevented him from so doing, 7 or because he was in fact very kindly by nature and did no harsh deed in his own time. 8 He also loaned money at four per cent, the lowest rate ever exacted, in order that he might use his fortune to aid many. <br />9 As quaestor he was generous, as praetor illustrious, and in the consulship he had as colleague <a href=/people/4471 target=_blank>Catilius</a> <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a>. 10 His life as a private citizen he passed mostly on his estates but he was well-known everywhere. 11 He was chosen by <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> from among the four men of consular rank under whose jurisdiction <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> was placed, to administer that particular part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> in which the greater part of his own holdings lay; from this it was evident that <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> had regard for both the fame and the tranquillity of such a man. </p>                        </div>

But this could not have been the only reason for the adoption, nor ought it to have been, especially since <a href=/people/12361 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> had always done well in his administration of public office, and in his proconsulship had shown himself a man of worth and dignity. 4 At any rate, when <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> announced a desire to adopt him, he was given time for deciding whether he wished to be adopted. 5 This condition was attached to his adoption, that as <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> took <a href=/people/12361 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> as his son, so he in turn should take <a href=/people/809 target=_blank>Marcus Antoninus</a>, his wife's nephew, and Lucius <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a>, thenceforth called <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, the son of that <a href=/people/499 target=_blank>Aelius</a> <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> whom <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> had previously adopted. 6 He was adopted on the fifth day before the Kalends of March, while returning thanks in the senate for <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>'s opinion concerning him, 7 and he was made colleague to his father in both the proconsular and the tribunician power. 8 It is related as his first remark, that when he was reproved by his wife because he was not sufficiently generous to his household in some trifling matter, he said: Foolish woman, now that we have gained an empire, we have lost even what we had before. 9 To the people he gave largess on his own account 10 and also paid the moneys that his father had promised. He contributed a large amount of money, too, to <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>'s public works, and of the crown-gold which had been presented to him on the occasion of his adoption, he returned all of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>'s share, and half of their share to the provinces. </p>                        </div>

Of everything that he did he rendered an account, both in the senate and by proclamation. <br />4 He died in the seventieth year of his age, but his loss was felt as though he had been but a youth. They say his death was somewhat as follows: after he had eaten too freely some Alpine cheese at dinner he vomited during the night, and was taken with a fever the next day. 5 On the second day, as he saw that his condition was becoming worse, in the presence of his prefects he committed the state and his daughter to <a href=/people/809 target=_blank>Marcus Antoninus</a>, and gave orders that the golden statue of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, which was wont to stand in the bed-chamber of the emperor, be given to him. 6 Then he gave the watchword to the officer of the day as Equanimity, and so, turning as if to sleep, gave up the ghost at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419123ULor class=place long=12.3008 lat=41.8885>Lorium</a>. 7 While he was delirious with fever, he spoke of nothing save the state and certain kings with whom he was angry. 8 To his daughter he left his private fortune, and in his will he remembered all his household with suitable legacies. </p>                        </div>

His voice was hoarse and resonant, yet agreeable. <br />3 He was deified by the senate, while all men vied with one another to give him honour, and all extolled his devoutness, his mercy, his intelligence, and his righteousness. All honours were decreed for him which were ever before bestowed on the very best of emperors. 4 He well deserved the flamen and games and temple and the Antonine priesthood. Almost alone of all emperors he lived entirely unstained by the blood of either citizen or foe so far as was in his power, and he was justly compared to <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a>, whose good fortune and piety and tranquillity and religious rites he ever maintained. </p>                        </div>
