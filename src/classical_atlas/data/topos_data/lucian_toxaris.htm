They are shades now, so their goodwill can be no object. <br />TOX: Why, as to that, I think it may be just as well to have a good understanding even with shades. But that is not all: in honouring the dead we consider that we are also doing the best we can for the living.

They were strangers to you: strangers, did I say? they were enemies! Why, when they were shipwrecked on your coast, and your ancestors laid hands on them, and took them off to be sacrificed to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, they assaulted the gaolers, overpowered the garrison, slew the king, carried off the priestess, laid impious hands on the Goddess herself, and so took ship, snapping their fingers at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a> and her laws. If you honour men for this kind of thing, there will be plenty of people to follow their example, and you will have your hands full. You may judge for yourselves, from ancient precedent, whether it will suit you to have so many Oresteses and Pyladeses putting into your ports. It seems to me that it will soon end in your having no religion left at all: God after God will be expatriated in the same manner, and then I suppose you will supply their place by deifying their kidnappers, thus rewarding sacrilege with </p>                        </div>

Now please do not be angry with me, in the name of all your Gods: but I am going to mention a few points I have observed during my stay in this country. I can see that you are all admirably well qualified to talk about friendship: but when it comes to putting your words into practice, there is a considerable falling off; it is enough for you to have demonstrated what an excellent thing friendship is, and somehow or other, at the critical moment, you make off, and leave your fine words to look after themselves. Similarly, when your tragedians represent this subject on the stage, you are loud in your applause; the spectacle of one friend risking his life for another generally brings tears to your eyes: but you are quite incapable of rendering any such signal services yourselves; once let your friends get into difficulties, and all those tragic reminiscences take wing like so many dreams; you are then the very image of the silent mask which the actor has thrown aside: its mouth is open to its fullest extent, but not a syllable does it utter. It is the other way with us: we are as much superior to you in the practice of friendship, as we are inferior in expounding the theory of it.

The story is well known in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>. This <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a> was a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>, and lived not many years ago.

For some time <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a> — little as he cared for such a life — played his convivial part with the rest, <a href=/people/1367 target=_blank>Dinias</a> making no distinction between him and the parasites. Finally, however, he took to finding fault with his friend's conduct, and gave great offence: his continual allusions to <a href=/people/1367 target=_blank>Dinias</a>'s ancestry, and his exhortations to him to husband the fortune which had cost his father such labour to acquire, seemed to his friend to be in indifferent taste. He gave up asking <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a> to join in his revels, contented himself with the company of his parasites, and sought to elude his friend's observation.

But by his side (he was just driving away on a journey) sat his wife, a woman of most repulsive appearance; all her right side was withered; she had lost one eye; in short, she was a positive fright.

The sentence was in itself a heavy blow to <a href=/people/733 target=_blank>Menecrates</a>, and it was aggravated by the sudden change from wealth to poverty and from honour to dishonour. But most of all he was troubled about this daughter: she was now eighteen years old, and it was time that he found her a husband; yet with her unfortunate appearance it was not probable that any one, however poor or obscure, would have taken her, even with all the wealth her father had possessed previous to his sentence; it was said, too, that she was subject to fits at every increase of the moon.

His attempts to clear himself of the charge of sacrilege only served to set him in the light of a hardened offender, and materially to increase the detestation in which he was held. His health was beginning to give way under the strain, and no wonder: his bed was the bare ground, and all night he was unable so much as to stretch his legs, which were then secured in the stocks; in the daytime, the collar and one manacle sufficed, but at night he had to submit to being bound hand and foot. The stench, too, and the closeness of the dungeon, in which so many prisoners were huddled together gasping for breath, and the difficulty of getting any sleep, owing to the clanking of chains, — all combined to make the situation intolerable to one who was quite unaccustomed to endure such hardships.

As soon as they were inside, and the guards had withdrawn, <a href=/people/3200 target=_blank>Lonchates</a> drew his sword, and putting his left hand on the king's mouth to prevent his crying out, plunged it into his breast; then, cutting off his head, he went out from the temple carrying it under his cloak; affecting all the time to be speaking to the king, and promising that he would not be long, as if the king had sent him on some errand.

Observe: this did not take place in <a href=/people/5753 target=_blank>Machlyene</a>, nor yet in Alania; there is no lack of witnesses to the truth of the story this time; many an Amastrian here in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> would remember the fight of <a href=/people/2932 target=_blank>Sisinnes</a>. </p>                        </div>

With him also was his friend <a href=/people/6512 target=_blank>Gyndanes</a>, who was still suffering from the effects of a wound he had received on the journey: they had been attacked by some robbers, and <a href=/people/6512 target=_blank>Gyndanes</a> in resisting them had been stabbed in the thigh, and was still unable to stand on account of the pain. One night they were all asleep in the upper story, when a tremendous fire broke out; the whole building was wrapped in flames, and every means of exit blocked. <a href=/people/6152 target=_blank>Abauchas</a> started up, and leaving his sobbing children, and shaking off his wife, who clung to him and implored him to save her, he caught up his friend in his arms, and just managed to force his way down without being utterly consumed by the flames. His wife followed, carrying the boy, and bade the girl come after her; but, scorched almost to a cinder, she was compelled to drop the child from her arms, and barely succeeded in leaping through the flames; the little girl too only just escaped with her life. <a href=/people/6152 target=_blank>Abauchas</a> was afterwards reproached with having abandoned his own wife and children to rescue <a href=/people/6512 target=_blank>Gyndanes</a>. 'I can beget other children easily enough,' said he: 'nor was it certain how these would turn out: but it would be long before I got such another friend as <a href=/people/6512 target=_blank>Gyndanes</a>; of his affection I have been abundantly satisfied by experience.'

Who is umpire? <br />MNE: Umpire we have none; we forgot that. I tell you what: we have wasted our arrows this time, but some other day we will appoint an arbitrator, and submit other friendships to his judgement; and then off shall come your hand, or out shall come my tongue, as the case may be. Perhaps, though, this is rather a primitive way of doing things. As you seem to think a great deal of friendship, and as I consider it to be the highest blessing of humanity, what is there to prevent our vowing eternal friendship on the spot? We shall both have the satisfaction of winning then, and shall get a substantial prize into the bargain: two right hands each instead of one, two tongues, four eyes, four feet; — everything in duplicate. The union of two friends — or three, let us say — is like <a href=/people/894 target=_blank>Geryon</a> in the pictures: a six-handed, three-headed individual; my private opinion is, that there was not one <a href=/people/894 target=_blank>Geryon</a>, but three Geryons, all acting in concert, as friends should. </p>                        </div>
