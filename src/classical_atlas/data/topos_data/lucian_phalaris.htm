Such being our errand, it remains for us to deliver his message, which is as follows: 'It is my desire above all things, men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, to appear to the Greeks as I really am, and not in that character in which <a href=/people/1036 target=_blank>Envy</a> and Malice, availing themselves of the ignorance of their hearers, have represented me: and if to the Greeks in general, then most of all to you, who are holy men, associates of the God, sharers (I had almost said) of his hearth and home. If I can clear myself before you, if I can convince you that I am not the cruel tyrant I am supposed to be, then I may consider myself cleared in the eyes of all the world. For the truth of my statements, I appeal to the testimony of the God himself. Methinks he is not likely to be deceived by lying words. It may be an easy matter to mislead men: but to escape the penetration of a God — and that God <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> — is impossible. </p>                        </div>

In my political conduct I was ever public-spirited, in my private life mild and unassuming; no unseemly act, no deed of violence, oppression, or headstrong insolence was ever laid to my charge in those early days. But our city at that time was divided into factions: I saw myself exposed to the plots of my political opponents, who sought to destroy me by every means: if I would live in security, if I would preserve the city from destruction, there was but one course open to me — to seize upon the government, and thereby baffle my opponents, put an end to their machinations, and bring my countrymen to their senses. There were not a few who approved my design: patriots and men of cool judgement, they understood my sentiments, and saw that I had no alternative. With their help, I succeeded without difficulty in my enterprise. From that moment, the disturbances ceased. </p>                        </div>

From executions and banishments and confiscations I abstained, even in the case of those who had plotted against my life. Such strong measures are indeed never more necessary than at the commencement of a new rule: but I was sanguine; I proposed to treat them as my equals, and to win their allegiance by clemency, mildness, and humanity. My first act was to reconcile myself with my enemies, most of whom I invited to my table and took into my confidence. 'I found the city in a ruinous condition, owing to the neglect of the magistrates, who had commonly been guilty of embezzlement, if not of wholesale plunder. I repaired the evil by means of aqueducts, beautified the city with noble buildings, and surrounded it with walls. The public revenues were easily increased by proper attention on the part of the fiscal authorities. I provided for the education of the young and the maintenance of the old; and for the general public I had games and spectacles, banquets and doles. As for rape and seduction, tyrannical violence or intimidation, I abhorred the very name of such things. </p>                        </div>

The cares of government and public business had begun to weigh upon me; I found my position as burdensome as it was invidious. But it was still a question, how to render the city independent of such assistance for the future. And whilst I — honest man! — was busied with such thoughts, my enemies were even then combining against me, and debating the ways and means of rebellion; conspiracies were forming, arms and money were being collected, neighbour states were invited to assist, embassies were on their way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. The torments that were in store for me, had I fallen into their hands, I afterwards learnt from their public confession under torture, from which it appeared that they had vowed to tear me limb from limb with their own hands.

From that day to this, I have consulted my own safety by punishing conspiracy as often as it has shown itself. 'And men call me cruel! They do not stop to ask who was the aggressor; they condemn what they think the cruelty of my vengeance, but pass lightly over the provocation, and the nature of the crime.

Yet we must harden our hearts, smite them off as they grow, and — like <a href=/people/502 target=_blank>Iolaus</a> — sear the wounds; thus only shall we hold our own. The man who has once become involved in such a strife as this must play the part that he has undertaken; to show mercy would be fatal. Do you suppose that any man was ever so brutal, so inhuman, as to rejoice in torture and groans and bloodshed for their own sake, when there was no occasion for punishment? Many is the time that I have wept while others suffered beneath the lash, and groaned in spirit over the hard fate that subjected me to a torment more fierce and more abiding than theirs. For to the man who is benevolent by nature, and harsh only by compulsion, it is more painful to inflict punishment than it would be to undergo it. </p>                        </div>

If I had to choose between punishing innocent men, and facing death myself, believe me, I should have no hesitation in accepting the latter alternative. But if I am asked, whether I had rather die an undeserved death than give their deserts to those who plotted against my life, I answer no; and once more, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225PDel class=ethnic long=22.5056 lat=38.4806>Delphians</a>, I appeal to you: which is better — to die when I deserve not death, or to spare my enemies who deserve not mercy? No man surely can be such a fool that he would not rather live than preserve his enemies by his death. Yet in spite of this how many have I spared who were palpably convicted of conspiring against me; such were <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404239PAka class=place long=23.888 lat=40.392>Acanthus</a>, <a href=/people/250 target=_blank>Timocrates</a>, and his brother <a href=/people/2238 target=_blank>Leogoras</a>, all of whom I saved out of regard for our former intercourse.

My messengers are waiting for them in every port, to inquire after their names and cities, that they may not go away without receiving due honour at my hands.

It was but lately that I received a visit from the sage <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>.

For it was by no instructions of mine that the statuary made this <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>: far be it from me to aspire to the possession of such works of art! A countryman of my own, one <a href=/people/8563 target=_blank>Perilaus</a>, an admirable artist, but a man of evil disposition, had so far mistaken my character as to think that he could win my regard by the invention of a new form of torture; the love of torture, he thought, was my ruling passion. He it was who made the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> and brought it to me. I no sooner set eyes on this beautiful and exquisite piece of workmanship, which lacked only movement and sound to complete the illusion, than I exclaimed: Here is an offering fit for the God of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>: to him I must send it. And what will you say, rejoined <a href=/people/8563 target=_blank>Perilaus</a>, who stood by, when you see the ingenious mechanism within it, and learn the purpose it is designed to serve? He opened the back of the animal, and continued: When you are minded to punish any one, shut him up in this receptacle, apply these pipes to the nostrils of the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>, and order a fire to be kindled beneath. The occupant will shriek and roar in unremitting agony; and his cries will come to you through the pipes as the tenderest, most pathetic, most melodious of bellowings.

He consented; and when he was inside I closed the aperture, and ordered a fire to be kindled. Receive, I cried, the due reward of your wondrous art: let the music-master be the first to play.

It is as the poets say: we sow not, we plough not, yet all things grow for our use; for a God is our husbandman, and gives us not the good things of Greece only; all that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>, all that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a>, all that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, <a href=/people/454 target=_blank>Assyria</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and the far North can yield, — all comes to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>.
