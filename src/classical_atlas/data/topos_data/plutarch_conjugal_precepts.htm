For among the variety of musical moods and measures there is one which is called Hippothoros, a sort of composition to the flute and hautboy, made use of to encourage and provoke stallions to cover mares. But philosophy being furnished with many noble and profitable discourses, there is not any one subject that deserves a more serious study than that of wedlock, whereby they who are engaged in a long community of bed and board are more steadfastly united in affection, and made more pliable one to another in humor and condition. To this purpose, having reduced under several short heads and similes some certain instructions and admonitions which you, as tutored up in philosophy, have frequently already heard, I send you the collection as a present, beseeching the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> so with their presence to assist the Goddess <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, that the harmony of your mutual society and complacency in domestic diligences may outcry the melodious concords of lute or harp, while you live united together by reason and philosophy. Therefore it was that the ancients placed the statue of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> by that of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, to signify that the pleasures of matrimony chiefly consist in the sweetness of conversation. They also set the <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a> and <a href=/people/656 target=_blank>Peitho</a>, the goddess of persuasion, together, to show that the married couple were to act only by persuasion, and not to use the violences of wrangling and contention. <br /><a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> advised that the bride should eat a quince before she entered the nuptial sheets; intimating thereby, in my opinion, that the man was to expect his first pleasures from the breath and speech of his new-married bed-fellow. </p>                        </div>

And indeed such husbands who cannot bear with the little disdains and first froppishness of imprudent youth are like to those that choose the sour grapes and leave to others the ripe delicious clusters. On the other side, those young ladies that take a disdain to their husbands by reason of their first debates and encounters may be well compared to those that patiently endure the sting but fling away the honey. </p>                        </div>

From whence a discreet mistress of a family may likewise learn to avoid all manner of over-nice curiosity and squeamish affectation, all excess of jollity savoring of the courtesan, and every thing tending to profuse pomp; but she will rather employ all her wit and art in exhibiting to her husband all the <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a> of life and character, accustoming him to honesty and decency joined with pleasure and delight.

Thus it is with women, who in honoring and submitting to their husbands win for themselves honor and respect, but when they strive to get the mastery, they become a greater reproach to themselves than to those that are so ignominiously henpecked.

Thus, where people wed for pure affection, that marriage may be said to resemble those bodies whose parts are solidly fixed together. They who marry for the sake of great portions, or else desirous of offspring, are like to bodies whose parts are contiguous and cleave close to one another; and they who only bed together, if there be any such, resemble bodies whose parts are distinct and without dependency. Now, as physicians say that liquids are the only bodies which most easily intermix without any difference of propriety or respect one with another; so should it be said of people joined together in matrimony, that there is a perfect mixture of bodies and estates, of friends and relations.

But more sacred than all these is the nuptial ploughing and sowing, in order to the procreation of children.

For which reason it highly imports both the man and the woman, when bound together by the holy tie of wedlock, to abstain from all unlawful and forbidden copulation, and from ploughing and sowing where they never desire to reap any fruit of their labor, or, if the harvest come to perfection, they conceal and are ashamed to own it. </p>                        </div>

But when it is not their husbands' perfuming themselves, but their lascivious wandering after lewd and extravagant women, that disturbs and disorders their wives, it is a great piece of injustice, for the tickling pleasure of a few minutes, to afflict and disquiet a virtuous woman. For since they who are conversant with <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> will often abstain from women, to prevent the persecution of those little but implacable enemies of unclean dalliance, much rather ought a man to be pure from the pollutions of harlotry, when he approaches his chaste and lawful wife. </p>                        </div>

And do you, Pollianus, never believe that women will be weaned from those toys and curiosities wherein they take a kind of pride, and which serve for an alleviation of their domestic solitude, while you yourself admire the same things in other women, and are taken with the gayety of golden beakers, magnificent pictures for your houses, and rich trappings for your mules and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. For it were a strange moroseness to debar a woman those ornamental vanities which naturally her sex admire, nor will it easily be endured without regret, where she sees the man much more indulgent to his own humor. Since then thou art arrived at those years which are proper for the study of such sciences as are attained by reason and demonstration, endeavor to complete this knowledge by conversing with persons that may be serviceable to thee in such a generous design. And as for thy wife, like the industrious <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>, gather everywhere from the fragrant flowers of good instruction, replenish thyself with whatever may be of advantage to her, and impart the same to her again in loving and familiar discourse, both for thy own and her improvement. For father thou and mother art to her; She now is thine, and not the parent's care. Nor is it less to thy commendation to hear what she returns: And you, my honored husband, are my guide And tutor in philosophy beside, From whose instructions I at once improve The fruits of knowledge and the sweets of love. For such studies as these fix the contemplations of women upon what is laudable and serious, and prevent their wasting time upon impertinent and pernicious vanity. For that lady that is studious in geometry will never affect the dissolute motions of dancing. And she that is taken with the sublime notions of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> and <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> will look with disdain upon the charms and enchantments of witches and sorcerers; and if any ridiculous astrologer promises to pull the moon down from the sky, she will laugh at the ignorance and folly of the women who believe in him, being herself well grounded in astronomy, and having heard about Aganice, the daughter of <a href=/people/7746 target=_blank>Hegetor</a>, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=person long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> lord, who understanding the reason of the eclipses of the moon, and knowing beforehand the time of her being obscured by the shadow of the earth, made the credulous women believe that it was she who at those times unhinged the moon and removed her from the sky. True it is, that never any woman brought forth a perfect child without the assistance and society of man, but there are many whose imaginations are so strongly wrought upon by the sight or bare relation of monstrous spectacles, that they bring into the world several sorts of immature and shapeless productions. Thus, unless great care be taken by men to manure and cultivate the inclinations of their wives with wholesome and virtuous precepts, they often breed among themselves the false conceptions of extravagant and loose desires. But do thou, <a href=/people/1047 target=_blank>Eurydice</a>, make it thy business to be familiar with the learned proverbs of wise and learned men, and always to embellish thy discourse with their profitable sentences, to the end thou mayst be the admiration of other women, that shall behold thee so richly adorned without the expense or assistance of jewels or embroideries. For pearls and diamonds are not the purchase of an ordinary purse; but the ornaments of <a href=/people/1487 target=_blank>Theano</a>, Cleobuline, <a href=/people/2412 target=_blank>Gorgo</a> the wife of King <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a>, <a href=/people/3476 target=_blank>Timoclea</a> the sister of <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, the ancient Roman <a href=/people/1822 target=_blank>Claudia</a>, or <a href=/people/858 target=_blank>Cornelia</a> the daughter of <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, — already so celebrated and renowned for their virtues, — will cost but little, yet nothing will set thee out more glorious or illustrious to the world, or render thy life more comfortable and happy. For if <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a>, only because she could compose an elegant verse, had the confidence to write to a haughty and wealthy dame in her time: Dead thou shalt lie forgotten in thy tomb, Since not for thee <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402225RPie class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.2>Pierian</a> roses bloom, why may it not be much more lawful for thee to boast those great perfections that give thee a greater privilege, not only to gather the flowers, but to reap the fruits themselves, which the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> bestow upon the lovers and real owners of learning and philosophy? </p>                        </div>
