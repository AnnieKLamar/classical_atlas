She was later given to <a href=/people/809 target=_blank>Marcus</a>, however, as we have related in his life, because <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> seemed too much her junior in years, 4 while <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> took to wife <a href=/people/809 target=_blank>Marcus</a>' daughter <a href=/people/11061 target=_blank>Lucilla</a>. He was reared in the House of <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, 5 and received instruction from the Latin grammarian Scaurinus (the son of the <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> who had been <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>'s teacher in grammar), the Greeks <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephus</a>, <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestio</a>, Harpocratio, the rhetoricians <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, <a href=/people/1657 target=_blank>Caninius</a> <a href=/people/1743 target=_blank>Celer</a>, <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes Atticus</a>, and the Latin <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/1561 target=_blank>Fronto</a>, his teachers in philosophy being <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> and Sextus. 6 For all of these he cherished a deep affection, and in return he was beloved by them, and this despite his lack of natural gifts in literary studies. 7 In his youth he loved to compose verses, and later on in life, orations. And, in truth, he is said to have been a better orator than poet, or rather, to be strictly truthful, a worse poet than speaker. 8 Nor are there lacking those who say that he was aided by the wit of his friends, and that the things credited to him, such as they are, were written by others; and in fact it is said that he did keep in his employ a number of eloquent and learned men. 9 <a href=/people/349 target=_blank>Nicomedes</a> was his tutor. He was devoted to pleasure, too care-free, and very clever, within proper bounds, at every kind of frolic, sport, and raillery. 10 At the age of seven he passed into the Aurelian family, and was moulded by the manners and influence of <a href=/people/809 target=_blank>Marcus</a>. He loved hunting and wrestling, and indeed all the sports of youth. 11 And at the age of three and twenty he was still a private citizen in the imperial household. </p>                        </div>

And although he was weakened by such follies of debauchery and extravagance, nevertheless <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a> retained him as a son, for the reason, it seems, that <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>, wishing to call the youth his grandson, had ordered <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a> to adopt him. Towards <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a>, so far as it appears, <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> showed loyalty rather than affection. 7 <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a>, however, loved the frankness of his nature and his unspoiled way of living, and encouraged Marcus to imitate him in these. 8 When <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a> died, Marcus bestowed all honours upon <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a>, even granting him a share in the imperial power; he made him his colleague, moreover, when the senate had presented the sovereignty to him alone. </p>                        </div>

This was the first banquet, it is said, at which couches were placed for twelve, although there is a very well-known saying about the proper number of those present at a banquet that seven make a dinner, nine make a din. 2 Furthermore, the comely lads who did the serving were given as presents, one to each guest; carvers and platters, too, were presented to each, and also live animals either tame or wild, winged or quadruped, of whatever kind were the meats that were served, 3 and even goblets of murra or of Alexandrine crystal were presented to each man for each drink, as often as they drank. Besides this, he gave golden and silver and even jeweled cups, and garlands, too, entwined with golden ribbons and flowers out of season, golden vases with ointments made in the shape of perfume-boxes, 4 and even carriages, together with mules and muleteers, and trappings of silver, wherewith they might return home from the banquet. 5 The estimated cost of the whole banquet, it is reported, was six million sesterces. 6 And when Marcus heard of this dinner, they say, he groaned and bewailed the fate of the empire. 7 After the banquet, moreover, they diced until dawn. 8 And all this was done after the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> war, whither Marcus had sent him, it is said, either that he might commit his debaucheries away from the city and the eyes of all citizens, or that he might learn economy by his travels, or that he might return reformed through the fear inspired by war, or, finally, that he might come to realize that he was an emperor. 9 But how much good all this did is shown not only by the rest of his life, but also by this banquet of which we have just told. </p>                        </div>

The chief of these was <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>, on whom he bestowed the name <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a>. 8 Furthermore, he built an exceedingly notorious villa on the <a href=/people/4124 target=_blank>Clodian</a> Way, and here he not only reviled himself for many days at a time in boundless extravagance together with his freedmen and friends of inferior rank in whose presence he felt no shame, but he even invited Marcus. 9 Marcus came, in order to display to his brother the purity of his own moral code as worthy of respect and imitation, and for five days, staying in the same villa, he busied himself continuously with the examination of law-cases, while his brother, in the meantime, was either banqueting or preparing banquets. 10 <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> maintained also the actor Agrippus, surnamed Memphius, whom he had brought with him from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, almost as a trophy of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> war, and named Apolaustius. 11 He had brought with him, too, players of the harp and the flute, actors and jesters from the mimes, jugglers, and all kinds of slaves in whose entertainment <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> find pleasure, and in such numbers, indeed, that he seemed to have concluded a war, not against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, but against actors. </p>                        </div>
