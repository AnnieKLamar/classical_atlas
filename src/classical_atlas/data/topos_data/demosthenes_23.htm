First he was maltreating <a href=/people/11030 target=_blank>Cephisodotus</a>; then he stopped, because he was afraid of <a href=/people/692 target=_blank>Athenodorus</a>. Another time he tried to maltreat <a href=/people/406 target=_blank>Chabrias</a>; changed his mind, and agreed with <a href=/people/462 target=_blank>Chares</a>. He always acted inconsistently, ever like an honest, straightforward man. </p>                        </div>

When a man has suffered this misfortune, the law enjoins that satisfaction be first claimed.
