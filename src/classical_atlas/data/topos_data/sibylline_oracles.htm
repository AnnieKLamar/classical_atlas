It seemed good to me, therefore, to set forth in one connected and orderly series the so-called <a href=/people/12187 target=_blank>Sibylline</a> Oracles, which are found scattered and in a confused condition, but which are helpful to the reading and understanding of those (Holy Scriptures), so that being easily brought together under the eye of the readers they may bring to these (readers) by way of reward the advantage that is to be derived from them, setting forth not a few necessary and useful things, and also rendering their study more valuable and varied. For (these oracles) also speak clearly of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, the sacred and life-originating Trinity, and of the incarnate dispensation of our Lord and God and <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a> Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, I mean his birth from a virgin without emanation, and of the acts of healing performed by him, as also of his life giving passion, and of his resurrection from the dead on the third day, and of the judgment to come, and of recompense for what we all have done in this life; furthermore (these oracles) distinctly set forth what is made known in the Mosaic, writings and in the books of the prophets concerning the creation of the world, and the formation of man, and his expulsion from the garden and of his now formation hereafter. With regard to certain things which have been or perhaps are yet to be, they prophesy in various ways; and in a word, they are able in no small measure to profit their readers. </p>                        </div>

There was first the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a>, or rather the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> (<a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibyl</a>), whose proper name is <a href=/people/8263 target=_blank>Sambethe</a>. She was of the family of the most blessed <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a>, and is said to have foretold the exploits of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=person long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedon</a>; <a href=/people/401 target=_blank>Nicanor</a>, who wrote the life of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, mentions her. The second was the Libyan, of whom <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> makes mention in the preface of (his play) the <a href=/people/694 target=_blank>Lamia</a>. The third was the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphian</a>, born at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, and spoken of by <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> in his book on divination. The fourth was the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a>, in <a href=/people/6359 target=_blank>Cimmerium</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, whose son <a href=/people/686 target=_blank>Evander</a> founded in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> the shrine of <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a> which is called the <a href=/people/12178 target=_blank>Lupercal</a>. The fifth was the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384265PEry class=person long=26.4808 lat=38.3828>Erythraean</a>, who predicted the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> war, and of whom <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384265PEry class=person long=26.4808 lat=38.3828>Erythraean</a> bears positive testimony. The sixth was the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=demonym long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samian</a>, whose proper name is <a href=/people/8176 target=_blank>Phyto</a>, of whom <a href=/people/132 target=_blank>Eratosthenes</a> wrote. The seventh was the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=demonym long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumaean</a>, called <a href=/people/1323 target=_blank>Amalthea</a>, also <a href=/people/12007 target=_blank>Herophile</a>, and in some places <a href=/people/10351 target=_blank>Taraxandra</a>.

But having been disdain fully treated, and not even questioned as to what they were, she committed three of them to the fire. Again, in another audience with the king she brought forward the six remaining books, and still demanded the same amount. But not being deemed worthy of attention, again she burned three more. Then a third time bringing the three that were left, and asking the same price, she said that if he would not procure them, she would burn these also. Then, it is said, the king examined them and was astonished, and gave for them a hundred pieces of gold, took them in charge and made request for the others. But she declared that neither had she the like of those that were burned nor had she any such knowledge apart from inspiration, but that certain persons from various cities and countries had at times excerpted what was esteemed by them necessary and useful, and that out of these excerpts a collection ought to be made. And this (the Romans) did as quickly as possible. For that which was given from God, though truly laid up in a corner, did not escape their search. And the books of all the Sibyls were deposited in the capitol of ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>.

But those that were written by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384265PEry class=person long=26.4808 lat=38.3828>Erythraean</a> <a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibyl</a> have the name that was given her from the place; while the other books are without inscription to mark who is the author of each, but are without distinction (of authorship). </p>                        </div>

His forcible exposition is in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> tongue, but the <a href=/people/12187 target=_blank>Sibylline</a> verses were published in the Greek language. And that this may not appear incredible, I will produce the testimony of the man before mentioned, which is after this manner: <br />Inasmuch as the <a href=/people/12187 target=_blank>Sibylline</a> Oracles which are found in our city not only, as being very plentiful, are held in low esteem by those of the Greeks who are cognizant of them (for it is things which are rare that are held in honor), but also since not all of the verses keep to the precision of the meter, their credit is lower. But this is the fault not of the prophetess, but of the shorthand writers who could not keep up with the rush of the <a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibyl</a>'s words, or who were uneducated; for her remembrance of the things she had spoken ceased with the spell of inspiration. Which fact <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> also had in view when he said that (the prophets) treat correctly many and great matters while they know nothing, of the things of which they speak. <br />We shall, accordingly, from those oracles which were brought to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> by the ambassadors (of <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquin</a>), produce, as much as possible. Now, concerning the God who is without beginning one declared these things: <br />One God, who rules alone, immense, unborn. <br />But God alone is one, highest of all, <br />Who made the heaven and sun and stars and moon, <br />Fruit-bearing earth and billows of the sea. <br />He only is God, Maker uncontrolled; <br />He fixed the pattern of the human form, <br />And did the nature of all mortals mix <br />Himself, the generator of (all) life. <br />This (the <a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibyl</a>) has said either on the ground that being joined together (husband and wife) become one flesh, or with the thought that out of the four elements which are opposite to each other God fashioned both the world and man. </p>                        </div>
