They say that the beast is in general character like an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>, but that it is larger and stronger, and also more hairy: for it has a mane on its neck like a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, stretching down very thickly, and spreading from its brow to its eyes. Its horns are not like those of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, but are turned downwards, and come to a sharp point by the ears; each of these holds more than three pints and is pitch black, but they shine as though they were peeled. But when the hide is skinned it covers the space of eight couches. But when the beast is hit it flees, and even if incapacitated continues to do so; its flesh is sweet. It protects itself by kicking and voiding excrement over a distance of forty feet; it easily and often employs this form of defence, which scorches so fiercely that it will scrape off a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>'s hair. They say that it has this effect when the animal is disturbed, but that it does not scorch when it is undisturbed. When they bring forth their young they meet in large numbers, and collecting in a herd all the biggest bring forth young and void excrement in a circle. For the beast voids a great deal of such excrement. </p>                        </div>

For the waves from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409115WTyr class=place long=11.5 lat=40.9>Tyrrhenian sea</a> are borne with much surge to both the promontories, the one on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> side and the other on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> side called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=place long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a>, and being carried from the great sea into a narrow one are compressed. When this happens the wave is carried high in the air with a loud noise over a wide space upwards, so that, when hurled high in the air, it can be seen by those who are a long way off, not like the high travel of the sea but white and foamy, and like the tracks which are made by violent storms. Sometimes the waves crash against each other on both promontories and come together with a crash impossible to describe, and unbearable to look at; and sometimes, when they have parted after dashing against each other, so deep and terrifying is the appearance to those who are forced to see it that many cannot control themselves, but grow dizzy and fall down from fear. But when the wave falling on either of the spots, and flung as high as the promontories, dashes back again into the sea flowing below, with a vast roar and with huge swift eddies the sea boils up and is hurled high, seething from the depths and changing to every kind of colour; sometimes it appears black and sometimes blue, and then again purple. No beast can bear either to hear or to see the race and length of it, and in addition to this the upward flow, but all flee to the foot of the mountain. When the wave ceases, the eddies are carried up into the air and make such varied whirlings that the movements look like the coils of sea-<a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a>, or some other huge <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a>. </p>                        </div>
