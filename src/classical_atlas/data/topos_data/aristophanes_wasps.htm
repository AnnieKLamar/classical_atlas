Perhaps he has a tumour in his groin. He was the hardest of us all; he alone never allowed himself to be moved.

Some groan over their poverty and they exaggerate the truth in order to make their troubles equal to my own. Others tell us anecdotes or some comic story from <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>. Others, again, cut jokes; they fancy I shall be appeased if I laugh. If we are not even then won over, why, then they drag forward their young children by the hand, both boys and girls, who prostrate themselves and whine with one accord, and then the father, trembling as if before a god, beseeches me not to condemn him out of pity for them, If you love the voice of the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a>, have pity on my son's; and because I am fond of little <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sows</a>, I must yield to his daughter's prayers.

What a crowd of kinglets have come swooping down here! <br />BDELYCLEON: Come, come, my poor father, you will have to measure yourself against them. <br />PHILOCLEON: Have pickle prepared for seasoning them, if I am bound to prove the victor. <br />CHORUS: Let us stand out of the way a little, so that they may twirl at their ease. Come, illustrious children of this inhabitant of the briny, brothers of the shrimps, skip on the sand and the shore of the barren sea; show us the lightning whirls and twirls of your nimble limbs. Glorious offspring of <a href=/people/456 target=_blank>Phrynichus</a>, let fly your kicks, so that the spectators may be overjoyed at seeing your legs so high in air. Twist, twirl, tap your bellies, kick your legs to the sky. Here comes your famous father, the ruler of the sea, delighted to see his three lecherous kinglets. Go on with your dancing, if it pleases you, but as for us, we shall not join you. Lead us promptly off the stage, for never a Comedy yet was seen where the Chorus finished off with a dance. </p>                        </div>
