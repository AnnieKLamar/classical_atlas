He then restored it once more, if indeed we may say that it was restored when it gave up its freedom. 2 Nevertheless, in some way or other, though mourning at home, it enjoyed great fame among nations abroad. Next, after enduring so many of the house of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, it reared its head again under <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, 3 and though having no joy from all the good fortune of <a href=/people/3477 target=_blank>Titus</a> and bleeding from <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>'s brutality, it was happier than had been its wont under <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> and <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> and his successors as far as Marcus, but was sorely stricken by the madness and cruelty of <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>. 4 Thereafter, save for the diligent care of <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, it knew naught that was good until <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, the son of <a href=/people/5762 target=_blank>Mamaea</a>. 5 All that ensued thereafter is too long to relate; for it was not permitted to enjoy the rule of <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> and it endured <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> for fifteen years. 6 Then <a href=/people/11041 target=_blank>Claudius</a> was begrudged a long-lasting rule by <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, which loves a change and is almost always a foe to justice. 7 For in such wise was <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> slain and <a href=/people/3256 target=_blank>Tacitus</a> carried off by disease and <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a> put to death, that it became clear that <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> takes pleasure in nothing so much as in changing, by means of a varied succession of events, all that pertains to the public business. 8 To what end, however, do we dwell on such lamentations and the misfortunes of the times? Let us, rather, pass on to <a href=/people/3552 target=_blank>Carus</a>, a mediocre man, so to speak, but one to be ranked with the good rather than the evil princes, yet a better ruler by far, had he not left <a href=/people/11052 target=_blank>Carinus</a> to be his heir. </p>                        </div>

Our forefathers, those great men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, in choosing their legates observed the following principle, namely, to display a sample of their own characters in those to whom they delegated the conduct of public affairs. 7 And even if this were not so, I myself should not do otherwise; and, indeed, I have not done otherwise, if by your aid I shall make no mistake. Wherefore look to it that we may not be found to differ from our forefathers, that is, the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. <br />8 You see that throughout his letter he wishes it to be understood that his forefathers were native <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. </p>                        </div>

Wherefore we will do our best that no foreigner shall seem to be a better man than one of yourselves. 3 This passage also makes it sufficiently clear that he wished to be thought a Roman, that is, one born in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. <br />4 He, then, after rising through the various civil and military grades, as the inscriptions on his statues show, was made prefect of the guard by <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a>, and he won such affection among the soldiers that when <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a>, that great emperor, was slain, he alone seemed wholly worthy of the imperial power. </p>                        </div>

For suddenly, after an especially violent peal which had terrified all, it was shouted that the emperor was dead. 7 It came to pass, in addition, that the chamberlains, grieving for the death of their prince, fired his tent; and the rumour arose, whatever its source, that he had been killed by the lightning, whereas, as far as we can tell, it seems sure that he died of his illness. </p>                        </div>

Then he defiled himself by unwonted vices and inordinate depravity, 3 he set aside all the best among his friends and retained or picked out all the vilest, and he appointed as city-prefect one of his doorkeepers, a baser act than which no one can conceive or relate. 4 He slew the prefect of the guard whom he found in office 5 and put in his place Matronianus, one of his clerks and an old procurer, whom he had always kept with him as accomplice and assistant in debaucheries and lusts. 6 He appeared in public as consul contrary to his father's wish. He wrote arrogant letters to the senate, and he even promised the senate's property to the mob of the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, as though it, forsooth, were the Roman people. 7 By marrying and divorcing he took nine wives in all, and he put away some even while they were pregnant. He filled the Palace with actors and harlots, pantomimists, singers and pimps. 8 He had such an aversion for the signing of state-papers that he appointed for signing them a certain filthy fellow, with whom he used always to jest at midday,b and then he reviled him because he could imitate his writing so well. </p>                        </div>

He granted favours most of all to the base, and always invited them to banquets. 3 At one of his banquets he often served one hundred pounds of birds, one hundred of fish, and one thousand of meat of different kinds, and he lavished on his guests vast quantities of wine. He swam about among apples and melons and strewed his banqueting-halls and bedrooms with roses from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Milan</a>. 4 The baths which he used were as cold as the air of rooms that are under the ground, and his plunge-baths were always cooled by means of snow. 5 Once, when he came in the winter to a certain place in which the spring-water was very tepid — its wonted natural temperature during the winter — and he had bathed in it in the pool, he shouted to the bath-attendants, it is said, This is water for a woman that you have given me; and this is reported as his most famous saying. 6 When his father heard of all that he did, he exclaimed, He is no son of mine, and at last he determined to appoint <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> — afterwards made Caesar but at that time serving as governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a> — in the place of <a href=/people/11052 target=_blank>Carinus</a>, for the reason that no one even then seemed to be better, and he even planned, as Onesimus relates, to put <a href=/people/11052 target=_blank>Carinus</a> to death. 7 It would be too long to tell more, even if I should desire to do so, about his excesses.

And so, he remarked, <a href=/people/3552 target=_blank>Carus</a> caused great laughter during his rule. 3 In fact, when <a href=/people/1446 target=_blank>Diocletian</a> himself presented spectacles, after inviting all nations thereto, he was most sparing in his liberality, declaring that there should be more continence in games when a censor was looking on. <br />4 I should like this passage to be read by <a href=/people/514 target=_blank>Junius</a> <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a>, with whom I will dare to find fault frankly.
