I shall say the more concerning this general, because most of his acts are but little known, and because the undertakings that were attended with success to him, were accomplished, not by vastness of force, but by sagacity, in which he surpassed all ofthat age; and unless the manner of his proceedings be set forth, his merits cannot be fully understood. <br /><a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a>, son of a father named <a href=/people/7427 target=_blank>Camissares</a>, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=demonym long=28.7 lat=37.01>Carian</a> by nation, and of a mother a native of Scythia, served first of all among the soldiers who were guards of the palace to <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a>. His father <a href=/people/7427 target=_blank>Camissares</a>, having been found undaunted in fight, active in command, and faithful on many occasions to the king, was granted as a province that portion of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> which borders on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>, and which the Leucosyrians inhabit. <br /><a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a> first showed what sort of man he was, when engaged in military service, in the war which the king carried on against the <a href=/people/9077 target=_blank>Cardusii</a>; for in this enterprise, after several thousands of the king's troops were killed, his exertions proved of great value. Hence it happened that, as <a href=/people/7427 target=_blank>Camissares</a> lost his life in the war, his father's province was conferred upon him. </p>                        </div>

In consequence of this success, he began to be appointed over more important affairs. At that time <a href=/people/4726 target=_blank>Thyus</a> was prince of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap class=place long=30 lat=41>Paphlagonia</a>, a man of ancient family, descended from that <a href=/people/12074 target=_blank>Pylaemenes</a> whom <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> states to have been killed by <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a> in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> war. This prince paid no respect to the king's commands. The king, in consequence, determined to make war upon him, and gave the command of the enterprise to <a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a>, who was a near relative of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap class=demonym long=30 lat=41>Paphlagonian</a>, for they were sons of a brother and a sister. <a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a>, on this account, was desirous, in the first place, to try every means to bring back his kinsman to his duty without having recourse to arms. But going to confer with him without a guard, as he apprehended no treachery from a friend, he almost lost his life, for <a href=/people/4726 target=_blank>Thyus</a> had resolved to assassinate him secretly. <a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a> was however accompanied by his mother, the aunt of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap class=demonym long=30 lat=41>Paphlagonian</a>, who discovered what was going on, and gave her son warning of it. <a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a> escaped the danger by flight, and declared open war against <a href=/people/4726 target=_blank>Thyus</a>, in which, though he was deserted by <a href=/people/642 target=_blank>Ariobarzanes</a>, the satrap of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>, and all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>, he nevertheless vigorously persevered, and succeeded in taking <a href=/people/4726 target=_blank>Thyus</a> alive with his wife and children. </p>                        </div>

He adorned him also with a chain and bracelets of gold, and other royal ornaments, while he himself was dressed in a coarse thick cloak, and rough coat, having a hunter's cap upon his head, a club in his right hand, and in his left a chain, with which he drove <a href=/people/4726 target=_blank>Thyus</a> secured before him, as if he were bringing along a wild beast that he had taken. While the people were all gazing at him, on account of the strangeness of his attire, and his person being unknown to them, and a great crowd was in consequence gathered round him, it happened that there was somebody in it who knew <a href=/people/4726 target=_blank>Thyus</a>, and went off to tell the king, The king at first did not believe the account, and therefore sent <a href=/people/172 target=_blank>Pharnabazus</a> to make inquiry. Learning from him what had been done, he ordered <a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a> to be instantly admitted, being extremely delighted both with his success and the dress of his captive, rejoicing especially that that eminent prince had fallen into his hands when he scarcely expected it. He therefore sent <a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a>, after bestowing magnificent presents upon him, to the army which was then assembling, under the command of <a href=/people/172 target=_blank>Pharnabazus</a> and Tithraus tes, to make war upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and directed that he should have equal authority with them.

Aspis, occupying a woody country, defended with fortresses, not only refused to obey the king's orders, but ravaged the neighbouring provinces, and intercepted whatever was being conveyed to the king. <a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a>, though he was far distant from those parts, and was drawn off from a greater matter, yet thought it necessary to yield to the king's wish. He therefore went on board a ship with a few brave followers, thinking (what really happened) that he would more easily overcome him, when unaware of his approach and unprepared, than when ready to meet him, though with ever so great an army. Sailing in this vessel to the coast of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, landing there, and marching day and night, he passed Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a>, and arrived at the part to which he had directed his course. He inquired where Aspis was, and learned that he was not far off, and was gone to hunt. While he was watching for his return, the cause of his coming became known, and Aspis prepared the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=ethnic long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidians</a>, and the attendants that he had with him, to offer resistance. When <a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a> heard this, he took up his arms, and ordered his men to follow him; he himself, setting spurs to his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, rode on to meet the enemy. Aspis, seeing him, from a distance, advancing upon him, was struck with fear, and, being deterred from his resolution to resist, delivered himself up. <a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a> consigned him in chains to <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, to be conducted to the king. </p>                        </div>

But before this messenger arrived at the place to which he was sent, he met upon the road the party that were leading Aspis. <br />Though <a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a>, by this celerity, gained great favour from the king, he incurred no less dislike on the part of the courtiers, because they saw that he alone was more valued than all of them; and on this account they all conspired to ruin him. Pandates, the keeper of the king's treasury, a friend to <a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a>, sent him an account of this state of things in writing, in which he told him that he would be in great peril if any ill-success should fall out while he commanded in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, for such was the practice of kings, that they attributed adverse occurrences to other men, but prosperous ones to their own good fortune; and hence it happened that they were easily inclined to the ruin of those under whose conduct affairs were said to have been ill-managed; and that he would be in so much the greater danger as he had those for his bitterest enemies to whom the king chiefly gave ear. <a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a>, having read this letter, after he had arrived at the army at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329351UPto class=place long=35.0817 lat=32.9278>Ace</a>, resolved, as he was aware that what was written was true, to leave the king's service. He did nothing, however, that was unworthy of his honour; for he appointed <a href=/people/3205 target=_blank>Mandrocles</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385275UMag class=person long=27.4294 lat=38.6103>Magnesia</a> to command the army, while he himself went off with his adherents into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>, and took possession of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap class=place long=30 lat=41>Paphlagonia</a>, that bordered upon it, concealing what his feelings were towards the king. He then privately made a league with <a href=/people/642 target=_blank>Ariobarzanes</a>, raised a force, and assigned the fortified towns to be defended by his own troops. </p>                        </div>

He heard that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=ethnic long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidians</a> were raising some forces to oppose him, and sent his son <a href=/people/1217 target=_blank>Aridaeus</a> with a detachment against them. The young man fell in battle, and the father marched away to the scene of his death with but a small number of followers, concealing how great a loss he had sustained, for he wished to reach the enemy before the report of his ill-success should become known to his men, lest the spirits of the soldiers should be depressed by hearing of the death of his son. He arrived at the spot to which he had directed his course, and pitched his camp in such a position that he could neither be surrounded by the superior number of the enemy, nor be hindered from keeping his forces always ready to engage. There was with him <a href=/people/2899 target=_blank>Mithrobarzanes</a>, his father-in-law, commander of the cavalry, who, despairing of the state of his son-in-law's affairs, went over to the enemy. When <a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a> heard this, he was sensible that if it should go abroad among the multitude that he was deserted by a man so intimately connected with him, it would happen that others would follow his example. He therefore spread a report throughout the camp that <a href=/people/2899 target=_blank>Mithrobarzanes</a> had gone off as a deserter by his direction, in order that, being received as such, he might the more easily spread destruction among the enemy. It was not right therefore, he added, that he should be left unsupported, but that they ought all to follow without delay, and, if they did so with spirit, the consequence would be that their foes would be unable to resist, as they would be cut to pieces within their ramparts and without. This exhortation being well received, he led forth his troops, pursued <a href=/people/2899 target=_blank>Mithrobarzanes</a>, and, almost at the moment that the latter was joining the enemy, gave orders for an attack. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=ethnic long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidians</a>, surprised by this new movement, were led to believe that the deserters were acting with bad faith, and by arrangement with <a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a>, in order that, whan received into the camp, they might do them the greater mischief; they therefore attacked them first. The deserters, as they knew not what was in agitation, or why it took place, were compelled to fight with those to whom they had deserted, and to act on the side of those whom they had quitted; and, as neither party spared them, they were quickly cut to pieces. <a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a> then set upon the rest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=ethnic long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidians</a> who offered resistance, repelled them at the first onset, pursued them as they fled, killed a great number of them, and captured their camp. By this stratagem he at once both cut off the traitors, and overthrew the enemy, and turned to his preservation what had been contrived for his destruction, We have nowhere read, on the part of any commander, any device more ingeniously conceived than this, or more promptly executed. </p>                        </div>

But he was unable to collect his troops with sufficient expedition, and being obliged to desist from his attempt, he took up, with the force which he had got together, a position of such a nature, that he could neither be surrounded by the enemy, nor could the enemy pass beyond him without being incommoded by difficulties on both sides; while, if he wished to engage with them, the numbers of his opponents could not greatly damage his own smaller force. </p>                        </div>

He had twenty thousand barbarian cavalry, a hundred thousand infantry, whom they call <a href=/people/6328 target=_blank>Cardaces</a>, and three thousand slingers of the same class. He had besides eight thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=ethnic long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocians</a>, ten thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a>, five thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap class=ethnic long=30 lat=41>Paphlagonians</a>, ten thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a>, five thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=ethnic long=28 lat=38.5>Lydians</a>, about three thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369312PAsp class=ethnic long=31.172 lat=36.939>Aspendians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=ethnic long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidians</a>, two thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=ethnic long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicians</a>, as many Captianians, three thousand hired men from Greece, and a very large number of light-armed troops. Against this force all <a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a>'s hopes rested on himself and the nature of his ground, for he had not the twentieth part of his enemy's numbers. Trusting to himself and his position, therefore, he brought on a battle, and cut off many thousands of the enemy, while there fell of his own army not more than a thousand men; on which account he erected a trophy the next day on the spot where they had fought the day before.

For instance, when it was told him that some, who were reckoned in the number of his friends, were laying a plot for him (concerning whom, as their enemies were the informers, he thought that the intimation was neither entirely to be believed nor utterly disregarded), he resolved to make trial whether what had been told him was true or false. He accordingly went forward on the road on which they had stated that an ambush would be laid for him; but he selected a man closely resembling himself in person and stature, gave him his own attire, and ordered him to ride on in that part of the line where he himself had been accustomed to go, while <a href=/people/849 target=_blank>Datames</a> himself, in the equipments and dress of a common soldier, prepared to march among his own body-guard.
