So, many-footed creatures of the sea will make their lairs in me and black seals their dwellings undisturbed, because I lack people.

But he kept shaking the black ship every way and make the timbers quiver. So they sat silent in their craft for fear, and did not loose the sheets throughout the black, hollow ship, nor lowered the sail of their dark-prowed vessel, but as they had set it first of all with oxhide ropes, so they kept sailing on; for a rushing south wind hurried on the swift ship from behind. First they passed by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364232LMal class=place long=23.198 lat=36.436>Malea</a>, and then along the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconian</a> coast they came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364225STai class=place long=22.4867 lat=36.4018>Taenarum</a>, sea-garlanded town and country of <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Helios</a> who gladdens men, where the thick- fleeced <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> of the lord <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Helios</a> feed continually and occupy a glad-some country. There they wished to put their ship to shore, and land and comprehend the great marvel and see with their eyes whether the monster would remain upon the deck of the hollow ship, or spring back into the briny deep where fishes shoal.

There came on them a strong, clear west-wind by ordinance of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and blew from heaven vehemently, that with all speed the ship might finish coursing over the briny water of the sea.
