His father's father was Macer, his mother's father <a href=/people/152 target=_blank>Fulvius</a> <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a>. 3 He himself was born six days before the Ides of April, in the first consulship of <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> and the second of <a href=/people/12124 target=_blank>Erucius</a> <a href=/people/12125 target=_blank>Clarus</a>. 4 While still a child, even before he had been drilled in the Latin and Greek literatures (with which he was very well acquainted), he would engage in no game with the other children except playing judge, and on such occasions he would have the rods and axes borne before him, and, surrounded by the throng of children, he would take his seat and thus give judgments. 5 In his eighteenth year he delivered an oration in public. Soon after, in order to continue his studies, he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; and with the support of his kinsman <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Septimius Severus</a>, who had already been consul twice, he sought and secured from the Deified Marcus the broad stripe. <br />6 Soon after he had come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> he fell in with a stranger who at that very moment was reading the life of the Emperor <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>, and he snatched at this incident as an omen of future prosperity. 7 He had still another omen of empire: for once, when he was invited to an imperial banquet and came wearing a cloak, when he should have worn his toga, he was lent an official toga of the emperor's own. 8 And that same night he dreamed that he tugged at the udders of a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>, like <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a> and <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>. 9 He sat down, furthermore, in the emperor's chair, which a servant had carelessly left accessible, being quite unaware that this was not allowed. 10 And once, while he was sleeping in a tavern, a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> coiled about his head, and when his friends awoke from their sleep and shouted at it, it departed without doing him any harm. </p>                        </div>

At the expiration of his quaestorship he was allotted the province of <a href=/people/1366 target=_blank>Baetica</a>, and from there he crossed over to Africa in order to settle his domestic affairs, for his father had meanwhile died. 4 But while he was in Africa, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a> was assigned him in place of <a href=/people/1366 target=_blank>Baetica</a>, because the latter was being ravaged by the Moors. 5 He therefore served his quaestorship in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>, and afterwards was appointed aide to the proconsul of Africa. 6 While he was in this office, a certain fellow-townsman of his, a plebeian, embraced him as an old comrade, though the fasces were being carried before him; whereupon he had the fellow beaten with clubs and then ordered a proclamation to be made by the herald to this effect: Let no plebeian embrace without due cause a legate of the Roman people. 7 On account of this incident, legates, who had previously gone on foot, thereafter rode in carriages. 8 About this time, also, being worried about the future, he had recourse to an astrologer in a certain city of Africa. The astrologer, when he had cast the horoscope, saw high destinies in store for him, but added: Tell me your own nativity and not that of another man. 9 And when <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> swore an oath that it was really his, the astrologer revealed to him all the things that did later come to pass. </p>                        </div>

Afterwards, however, while emperor, he erected statues in her honour. 3 In the thirty-second year of his life Marcus appointed him praetor, although he was not one of the Emperor's candidates but only one of the ordinary crowd of competitors. 4 He was thereupon sent to Spain, and here he had a dream, first that he was told to repair the temple of Augustus at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411013UTar class=place long=1.259 lat=41.1147>Tarraco</a>, which at that time was falling into ruin, 5 and then that from the top of a very high mountain he beheld <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and all the world, while the provinces sang together to the accompaniment of the lyre and flute.

Here he suffered certain wrongs at the hands of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>; and on that account he became their foes, and afterwards, as emperor, took vengeance on them by curtailing their rights. 8 After this he was appointed to the province of <a href=/people/7889 target=_blank>Lugdunensis</a> as legate. 9 He had meanwhile lost his wife, and now, wishing to take another, he made inquiries about the horoscopes of marriageable women, being himself no mean astrologer; and when he learned that there was a woman in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> whose horoscope predicted that she would wed a king (I mean <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a>, of course), he sought her for his wife, and through the mediation of his friends secured her.

At <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, meanwhile, he was presented with a second son. 3 While he was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> he was indicted for consulting about the imperial dignity with seers and astrologers, but, because <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> was now beginning to be detested, he was acquitted by the prefects of the guard to whom he had been handed over for trial, while his accuser was crucified. 4 He now served his first consulship, having <a href=/people/2034 target=_blank>Apuleius</a> <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a> for his colleague — an office to which <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> appointed him from among a large number of aspirants.

And when his father reproved him, saying: Be more sparing; for you have not the riches of a king, the five-year-old child replied: No, but I shall have. 7 On coming to <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a>, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> conducted himself in this office in such a manner as to increase a reputation which was already illustrious. </p>                        </div>

and it was even believed that he had been slain by a blow with a ball of lead, and the army almost elected another emperor. 3 It was at this time that <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, on reading the resolutions passed by the senate in praise of <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> <a href=/people/7456 target=_blank>Celsinus</a>, who was a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358106UHad class=place long=10.6387 lat=35.8258>Hadrumetum</a> and <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>' kinsman, became highly incensed at the senate, as though it had recognized <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> by this act, and issued a decree that <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> should be placed among the deified, as though he could take vengeance on the senate by this sort of thing. 4 He proclaimed the deification of <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> to the soldiers first, and then announced it to the senate in a letter, to which he added a discourse on his own victory. 5 Next, he gave orders that the bodies of the senators who had been slain in the battle should be mutilated. 6 And then, when <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>' body was brought before him, he had him beheaded while still half alive, gave orders that his head should be taken to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and followed up the order with a letter. 7 <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> was defeated on the eleventh day before the Kalends of March. <br /> The rest of <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>' body was, by <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>' order, laid out in front of his own home, and kept there for a long time exposed to view. 8 Furthermore, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> himself rode on horseback over the body, and when the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> shied, he spoke to it and loosed the reins, that it might trample boldly. 9 Some add that he ordered <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>' body to be cast into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437046WRho class=place long=4.5989 lat=43.6544>Rhone</a>, and also the bodies of his wife and children. </p>                        </div>

And he bestowed upon the Roman people, without cost, a most generous daily allowance of oil in perpetuity. <br />4 He was implacable toward the guilty; at the same time he showed singular judgment in advancing the efficient. 5 He took a fair interest in philosophy and oratory, and showed a great eagerness for learning in general. 6 He was relentless everywhere toward brigands. He wrote a trustworthy account of his own life, both before and after he became emperor, in which the only charge that he tried to explain away was that of cruelty. 7 In regard to this charge, the senate declared that <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> either should never have been born at all or never should have died, because on the one hand, he had proved too cruel, and on the other, too useful to the state. 8 For all that, he was less careful in his home-life, for he retained his wife <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a> even though she was notorious for her adulteries and also guilty of plotting against him. 9 On one occasion, when he so suffered from gout as to delay a campaign, his soldiers in their dismay conferred on his son <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a>, who was with him at the time, the title of Augustus. <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, however, had himself lifted up and carried to the tribunal, summoned 10 all the tribunes, centurions, generals, and cohorts responsible for this occurrence, and after commanding his son, who had received the name Augustus, to stand up, gave orders that all the authors of this deed, save only his son, should be punished. When they threw themselves before the tribunal and begged for pardon, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> touched his head with his hand and said, Now at last you know that the head does the ruling, and not the feet. 11 And even after fortune had led him step by step through the pursuits of study and of warfare even to the throne, he used to say: Everything have I been, and nothing have I gained. </p>                        </div>

His beard was long; his hair was grey and curly, his face was such as to inspire respect. His voice was clear, but retained an African accent even to his old age. 10 After his death he was much beloved, for then all envy of his power or fear of his cruelty had vanished. </p>                        </div>

Even <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> was deceived when he chose for his heir his fellow-townsman and nephew. 4 But let us except sons by adoption, lest our thoughts turn to those two guardian spirits of the state, <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a> and <a href=/people/809 target=_blank>Marcus Antoninus</a>, and let us proceed to sons by birth. 5 What could have been more fortunate for Marcus than not to have left <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> as his heir? 6 What more fortunate for <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Septimius Severus</a> than not to have even begotten <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a>? — a man who speedily charged his brother with contriving plots against him — a murderous falsehood — and put him to death; 7 who took his own stepmother to wife — stepmother did I say? — nay rather the mother on whose bosom he had slain <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>, her son; 8 who slew, because he refused to absolve him of his brother's murder, <a href=/people/11055 target=_blank>Papinian</a>, a sanctuary of law and treasure-house of jurisprudence, who had been raised to the office of prefect that a man who had become illustrious through his own efforts and his learning might not lack official rank. 9 In short, not to mention other things, I believe that it was because of this man's character that <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, a gloomier man in every way, nay even a crueller one, was considered righteous and worthy of the worship of a god. 10 Once indeed, it is said, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, when laid low by sickness, sent to his elder son that divine speech in <a href=/people/926 target=_blank>Sallust</a> in which <a href=/people/3893 target=_blank>Micipsa</a> urges his sons to the ways of peace.

And while he was being snatched up, he counted out the numbers eighty and nine, and beyond this number of years he did not live so much as one, for he was an old man when he came to the throne. 2 And then, after he had been placed in a huge circle in the air, for a long time he stood alone and desolate, until finally, when he began to fear that he might fall headlong, he saw himself summoned by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> and placed among the Antonines. 3 Again, on the day of the circus-games, when three plaster figures of <a href=/people/335 target=_blank>Victory</a> were set up in the customary way, with palms in their hands, the one in the middle, which held a sphere inscribed with his name, struck by a gust of wind, fell down from the balcony in an upright position and remained on the ground in this posture; while the one on which <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>'s name was inscribed was dashed down and completely shattered, and the one which bore <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a>' name lost its palm and barely managed to keep its place, such was the whirling of the wind. 4 On another occasion, when he was returning to his nearest quarters from an inspection of the wall at Luguvallum in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>, at a time when he had not only proved victorious but had concluded a perpetual peace, just as he was wondering what omen would present itself, an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=demonym long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopian</a> soldier, who was famous among buffoons and always a notable jester, met him with a garland of cypress-boughs. 5 And when <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> in a rage ordered that the man be removed from his sight, troubled as he was by the man's ominous colour and the ominous nature of the garland, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=demonym long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopian</a> by way of jest cried, it is said, You have been all things, you have conquered all things, now, O conqueror, be a god. 6 And when on reaching the town he wished to perform a sacrifice, in the first place, through a misunderstanding on the part of the rustic soothsayer, he was taken to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SBel class=place long=12.4798 lat=41.8924>Temple</a> of <a href=/people/1127 target=_blank>Bellona</a>, and, in the second place, the victims provided him were black. 7 And then, when he abandoned the sacrifice in disgust and betook himself to the Palace, through some carelessness on the part of the attendants the black victims followed him up to its very doors. </p>                        </div>
