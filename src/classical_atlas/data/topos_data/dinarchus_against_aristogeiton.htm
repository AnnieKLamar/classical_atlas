The worst character in the city, I should say in the whole world, <a href=/people/945 target=_blank>Aristogiton</a>, has come to pit himself in law against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=place long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagus</a> on the subject of truth and justice; and the council which has made the report is now in greater danger than this man who takes bribes against you and who sold for twenty minas the right of free speech in the cause of justice. </p>                        </div>

While he has been in debt to the state he has prosecuted men with citizen rights, though not entitled to do so, and has committed numerous other offences of which you have a more exact knowledge than I. It is a most shameful and monstrous thing for this council to be suspected of making a false report against <a href=/people/945 target=_blank>Aristogiton</a> and for him to be considered among you as having more justice on his side than it has. </p>                        </div>

He has often undergone all sorts of suffering short of death, which, if God so wills it and you are wise, he will undergo today. For you must assume, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, that there will be no improvement in him if he is pardoned by you now, and that in future he will not abstain from taking bribes against you if you now acquit him.
