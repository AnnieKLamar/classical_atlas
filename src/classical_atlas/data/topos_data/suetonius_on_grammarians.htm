The beginnings of the subject, too, were humble, for the earliest teachers, who were also both poets and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> Greeks (I refer to <a href=/people/330 target=_blank>Livius</a> and <a href=/people/337 target=_blank>Ennius</a>, who gave instruction in both tongues at home and abroad, as is well known), did no more than interpret the Greeks or give readings from whatever they themselves had composed in the Latin language. For while some tell us that this same <a href=/people/337 target=_blank>Ennius</a> published a book On Letters and Syllables and another On Metres, Lucius <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a> is right in maintaining that these were not the work of the poet, but of a later <a href=/people/337 target=_blank>Ennius</a>, who is also the author of the volumes On the Science of Augury. </p>                        </div>

He was sent to the senate by king <a href=/people/90 target=_blank>Attalus</a> between the second and third Punic wars, at about the time when <a href=/people/337 target=_blank>Ennius</a> died; and having fallen into the opening of a sewer in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LPal class=place long=12.4884 lat=41.8896>Palatine</a> quarter and broken his leg, he held numerous and frequent conferences during the whole time both of his embassy and of his convalescence, at which he constantly gave instruction, and thus set an example for our countrymen to imitate. Their imitation, however, was confined to a careful criticism of poems which had as yet but little circulation, either those of deceased friends or others that met with their approval, and to making them known to the public by reading and commenting on them. For example, Gaius <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a> Lampadio thus treated the Punic War of <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>, which was originally written in a single volume without a break, but was divided by Lampadio into seven books. At a later time Quintus Vargunteius took up the Annals of <a href=/people/337 target=_blank>Ennius</a>, which he expounded on set days to large audiences; and <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a> <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> and <a href=/people/1359 target=_blank>Vettius</a> Philocomus the satires of their friend <a href=/people/628 target=_blank>Lucilius</a>, which <a href=/people/2890 target=_blank>Lenaeus</a> <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> prides himself on having read with <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>, and <a href=/people/141 target=_blank>Valerius</a> <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> with Philocomus. </p>                        </div>

Unable to endure the pain, he applied a poisonous drug to his feet, which finally killed him, after he had lived for a time with that part of his body as it were prematurely dead. <br />After this the science constantly grew in favour and popularity, so much so that even the most eminent men did not hesitate to make contributions to it, while at times there are said to have been more than twenty well-attended schools in the city. The grammarians too were so highly esteemed, and their compensation was so ample, that <a href=/people/1512 target=_blank>Lutatius</a> <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a>, whom <a href=/people/4577 target=_blank>Laevius</a> <a href=/people/1224 target=_blank>Melissus</a>, punning on his name, often called the darling of <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a>, is known to have been bought for seven hundred thousand sesterces and soon afterwards set free, while Lucius <a href=/people/2716 target=_blank>Appuleius</a> was hired for four hundred sesterces a year by Eficius <a href=/people/1989 target=_blank>Calvinus</a>, a wealthy Roman knight, to teach a large school. <br />In fact, Grammar even made its way into the provinces, and some of the most famous teachers gave instruction abroad, especially in Gallia <a href=/people/7007 target=_blank>Togata</a>, including <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a> <a href=/people/361 target=_blank>Teucer</a>, <a href=/people/11051 target=_blank>Pescennius</a> Iaccus and <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a> <a href=/people/462 target=_blank>Chares</a>; indeed the last named taught until the very end of his life, when he could no longer walk, or even see. </p>                        </div>

That these were also called litteratores is shown by <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messala</a> <a href=/people/1991 target=_blank>Corvinus</a> in one of his letters, in which he says: I am not concerned with <a href=/people/463 target=_blank>Furius</a> Bibaculus, nor with Ticidas either, or with the litterator <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>. For he unquestionably refers to <a href=/people/141 target=_blank>Valerius</a> <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, who was famous both as a poet and as a grammarian. Some however make a distinction between litteratus and litterator, as the Greeks do between grammaticus and grammatista, using the former of a master of his subject, the latter of one moderately proficient. Orbilius too supports this view by examples, saying: In the days of our forefathers, when anyone's slaves were offered for sale, it was not usual except in special cases to advertise any one of them as litteratus but rather as litterator, implying that he had a smattering of letters, but was not a finished scholar. <br />The grammarians of early days taught rhetoric as well, and we have treatises from many men on both subjects. It was this custom, I think, which led those of later times also, although the two professions had now become distinct, nevertheless either to retain or to introduce certain kinds of exercises suited to the training of orators, such as problems, paraphrases, addresses, character sketches and similar things; doubtless that they might not turn over their pupils to the rhetoricians wholly ignorant and unprepared. But I observe that such instruction is now given up, because of the lack of application and the youth of some of the pupils; for I do not believe that it is because the subjects are underrated. I remember that at any rate when I was a young man, one of these teachers, Princeps by name, used to declaim and engage in discussion on alternate days; and that sometimes he would give instruction in the morning, and in the afternoon remove his desk and declaim. I used to hear, too, that within the memory of our forefathers some passed directly from the grammar school to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a> and took their place among the most eminent advocates. <br />The following list includes about all the distinguished teachers of the subject, at least those of whose life I am able to give any account. </p>                        </div>

The well-known jurist <a href=/people/1740 target=_blank>Ateius</a> <a href=/people/903 target=_blank>Capito</a> says that he was a rhetorician among grammarians and a grammarian among rhetoricians. <a href=/people/11078 target=_blank>Asinius Pollio</a>, too, in the book in which he criticizes the writings of <a href=/people/926 target=_blank>Sallust</a>, as marred by an excessive effort for archaism, writes as follows: He was especially abetted in this by <a href=/people/1740 target=_blank>Ateius</a> <a href=/people/4278 target=_blank>Praetextatus</a>, a famous Latin grammarian, afterwards a critic and famous teacher of declamation, and finally self-styled Philologus. <a href=/people/1740 target=_blank>Ateius</a> himself wrote to <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a> Hermas that he had made great progress in Greek letters and some in Latin, had been a pupil of <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> Gnipho * * *, and afterwards a teacher; further, that he had given instruction to many eminent young men, including the brothers <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> and <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> <a href=/people/11027 target=_blank>Pulcher</a>, whom he had also accompanied to their province. He seems to have assumed the title Philologus, because like <a href=/people/132 target=_blank>Eratosthenes</a>, who was first to lay claim to that surname, he regarded himself as a man of wide and varied learning. And that he was such is evident from his commentaries, though very few of them survive; but he gives some idea of their number in a second letter to the aforesaid Hermas: Remember to recommend my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385233UHyl class=place long=23.312 lat=38.447>Hyle</a> to others; as you know, it consists of material of every kind, collected in eight hundred books.

This makes me wonder all the more that <a href=/people/685 target=_blank>Asinius</a> believed that <a href=/people/1740 target=_blank>Ateius</a> used to collect archaic words and expressions for <a href=/people/926 target=_blank>Sallust</a>; for he knows that the grammarian's strongest recommendation to him was to use familiar, unassuming, natural language, especially avoiding <a href=/people/926 target=_blank>Sallust</a>'s obscurity and his bold figures of speech. </p>                        </div>

For to stimulate the efforts of his pupils, he used to pit those of the same advancement against one another, not only setting the subject on which they were to write, but also offering a prize for the victor to carry off. This was some old book, either beautiful or rare. He was therefore chosen by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> as the tutor of his grandsons and he moved to the Palace with his whole school, but with the understanding that he should admit no more pupils. He gave instruction in the hall of the house of <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>, which at that time formed part of the Palace, and was paid a hundred thousand sesterces a year. He died at an advanced age under <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>. His statue stands at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418129UPra class=place long=12.8924 lat=41.8399>Praeneste</a> in the upper part of the forum near the hemicycle, on which he exhibited the calendar which he had arranged and inscribed upon its marble walls. </p>                        </div>

At the emperor's appointment he undertook the task of arranging the library in the Colonnade of <a href=/people/722 target=_blank>Octavia</a>.

He was afterwards set free, and became a teacher at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, where he held a leading rank among the grammarians, in spite of the fact that he was notorious for every kind of vice, and that <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> and later <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> openly declared that there was no one less says fitted to be trusted with the education of boys or young men. But he caught men's fancy by his remarkable memory, as well as by his readiness of speech; for he even extemporized poems. He wrote too in various uncommon metres. He was so presumptuous that he called Marcus <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>hog</a>; declared that letters were born with him and would die with him; and that it was no accident that his name appeared in the Bucolics, but because <a href=/people/118 target=_blank>Vergil</a> divined that one day a <a href=/people/10896 target=_blank>Palaemon</a> would be judge of all poets and poems. He boasted too that brigands once spared him because of the celebrity of his name. He was so given to luxurious living that he went to the bath several times a day, and could not live within his income, although he received four hundred thousand sesterces a year from his school and almost as much from his private property. To the latter he gave great attention, keeping shops for the sale of ready made clothing and cultivating his fields with such care that it is common talk that a vine which he grafted himself yielded three hundred and sixty bunches of grapes. But he was especially notorious for acts of licentiousness with women, which he carried to the point of disgracing his mouth; and they say that he was held up to scorn by the witty remark of a man who met him in a crowd and being unable to escape his kiss, although he tried to avoid it, cried: Master, every time you see someone in a hurry you want to lick away at them? </p>                        </div>

He had read some early writers with an elementary teacher in one of the provinces; for the memory of those writers still lingers there and is not wholly lost, as it is in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. When he took these up again with greater care, and sought to extend his acquaintance to others of the same period, although he perceived that they were all held in contempt and brought rather reproach to those who read them than honour and profit, he nevertheless persisted in his purpose. After getting together a large number of copies, he gave his attention to correcting and punctuating them, and furnishing them with critical notes, devoting himself to this branch of grammar to the exclusion of all others. He had a few followers, rather than pupils; for he never taught in such a way as to assume the rôle of a master. He used to receive one or two, or at most three or four, in the afternoon hours, when he would lie upon a couch and in the course of long and general conversations would read some few things, though very rarely. He published a few slight works on divers minute points, and also left a good sized Grove of Observations on our Early Language. </p>                        </div>
