At this time <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> was emperor of the Romans, and <a href=/people/4462 target=_blank>Caisus</a> chief of the <a href=/people/11026 target=_blank>Saracens</a>. This <a href=/people/4462 target=_blank>Caisus</a> was the grandson of <a href=/people/1421 target=_blank>Arethas</a>, himself a chief, to whom <a href=/people/3645 target=_blank>Nonnosus</a>'s grandfather was sent as ambassador, during the reign of <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a>, to conclude a treaty of peace. <a href=/people/3645 target=_blank>Nonnosus</a>'s father Abrames had in like manner been sent on an embassy to <a href=/people/12248 target=_blank>Alamundarus</a>, chief of the <a href=/people/11026 target=_blank>Saracens</a>, during the reign of <a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a>, and was successful in procuring the release of <a href=/people/8433 target=_blank>Timostratus</a> and John, two Roman generals who were prisoners of war. <a href=/people/4462 target=_blank>Caisus</a>, to whom <a href=/people/3645 target=_blank>Nonnosus</a> was sent, was chief of two of the most illustrious <a href=/people/11026 target=_blank>Saracen</a> tribes, the Chindeni and Maadeni. Before <a href=/people/3645 target=_blank>Nonnosus</a> was appointed ambassador, his father had been sent to this same <a href=/people/4462 target=_blank>Caisus</a> by <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, and had concluded a treaty of peace, on condition that <a href=/people/4462 target=_blank>Caisus</a>'s son Mavias should be taken as a hostage to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. After this, <a href=/people/3645 target=_blank>Nonnosus</a> was entrusted with a threefold mission: to <a href=/people/4462 target=_blank>Caisus</a>, to induce him, if possible, to visit the emperor, to Elesbaas, king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/141387UAxu class=ethnic long=38.719 lat=14.1315>Axumites</a>, and to the <a href=/people/8787 target=_blank>Amerites</a>. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/141387UAxu class=place long=38.719 lat=14.1315>Axumis</a> is a very large city, and may be considered the capital of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Aethiopia</a>; it lies more south and east than the Roman empire. <a href=/people/3645 target=_blank>Nonnosus</a>, in spite of the treacherous attacks of tribesmen, perils from wild beasts, and many difficulties and dangers on the journey, successfully accomplished his mission, and returned in safety to his native land. </p>                        </div>

He was accused by <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> of having misconducted an embassy, but was not convicted, since the demagogue <a href=/people/392 target=_blank>Eubulus</a>, in whose service <a href=/people/96 target=_blank>Aeschines</a> had formerly been, sided with him against <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, and caused the jury to rise before <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> had finished his speech. Subsequently, when he attacked the proposal of <a href=/people/231 target=_blank>Ctesiphon</a> on behalf of <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> as illegal, having himself settled the amount of the fine he was prepared to pay if he did not make good the charge, he failed to do so, and left his country.

He is said to have been the first to compose imaginary speeches and what are called declamations in his leisure hours. In his old age he removed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>, where he died. He was of humble origin; his father was <a href=/people/3143 target=_blank>Atrometus</a>; his mother <a href=/people/5679 target=_blank>Glaucothea</a>, a priestess. He had two brothers, <a href=/people/4857 target=_blank>Aphobetus</a> and <a href=/people/2915 target=_blank>Philochares</a>. At first, being possessed of a loud voice, he became a third-rate actor; then he was copying-clerk to the Council; and soon afterwards came forward as a public speaker. He belonged to the philippizing party at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, and was consequently a political opponent of <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>. He is said to have attended <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s lectures, and to have been the pupil of <a href=/people/914 target=_blank>Antalcidas</a>, statements which are supported by the grandeur of his language and the dignity of his inventions.

The charm of his history chiefly consists in his manner of relating events, which is strong in the emotional and unexpected, and in his varied use of mythical embellishment. The style is more careless than it should be, and the phraseology often descends to the commonplace, whereas that of <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>, both in this and other respects as far as vigour and art are concerned, is the model representative of the Ionic dialect. </p>                        </div>

Nepos himself was subsequently slain at the instigation of Glycerius. These seven books show that the author had already written an account of preceding events, as also appears from the beginning of the first book of the seven.

His style is not suited for history. He makes use of poetical expressions that are insipid and childish; the composition is harsh and discordant, inclined to dithyrambic bombast or degenerating into carelessness and inelegance.

How Verina conceived a hatred of her brother on this account, assisted <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> with money to recover the throne, was persecuted by her brother, and, had not Armatus secretly got her away from the church, would probably have lost her life. Armatus, who had carried on an intrigue with the wife of <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a>, obtained great influence and was entrusted with the conduct of the war against <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>; but subsequently entered into an agreement with Illus and went over to <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>. Armatus was held in great esteem by <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>, and his son was raised to the rank of Caesar. Nevertheless, he was afterwards put to death, and his son, deprived of the rank of Caesar, became one of the readers at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410289UBla class=place long=28.9427 lat=41.0395>Blachernae</a>. <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a> before this had declared his son <a href=/people/809 target=_blank>Marcus</a> Caesar and afterwards emperor. Illus, having become reconciled to <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>, prepared to help him to recover the throne. <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliscus</a>, against whom his own adherents revolted, fled with his children and his wife Zenonis, was treacherously induced by Armatus to leave the church in which he had taken refuge, and banished to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>, where he was put to death with all his family.

The emperor being in want of money succeeded in obtaining some by methods suggested to him. Many who conspired against him were seized and put to death. Illus rendered great services to the empire by his valour in war and military successes, by his ambitious political measures and by his just dealings. After the death of the Roman emperor Nepos and the expulsion of his son Augustulus, Odoacer obtained possession of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> itself. But the western Gauls rebelled against him, and both they and Odoacer sent ambassadors to <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>, who rather favoured Odoacer. A certain Alan who attempted to kill Illus, after he had wounded him, declared that he had been bribed by Epinicius, an intimate of Verina. Epinicius was handed over, to Illus, and after obtaining a promise that he should be forgiven and rewarded, disclosed Verina's designs against Illus. <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> hands Verina over to Illus, who banished her to a fortress in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, and thus secured his safety.

His style is clear but loose and wanting in vigour, and sometimes degenerates into commonplace vulgarity, so that the work does not deserve to be considered a history. Perhaps that is the reason why the author himself, conscious of these defects, declares that his work is not a history, but a collection of materials for a history, so destitute of regular form did he himself consider his style and phraseology. He is not distinguished for form, except so far as one might assert that he now and again approaches simplicity; but even in this, owing to the excessive meanness and paltriness of his diction, he is unsuccessful and gradually descends to vulgar mannerism. He calls his work Silva, but divides it into books and strives to embellish it with prefaces.

First, the climate is so healthy, that not only do none of the inhabitants suffer from epilepsy, but those who come from other parts are cured of it. Next, he speaks of the vast tracts of sand, and the wells, dug 200, 300, sometimes even cubits deep, which spurt up a stream of water, from which the husbandmen who have taken part in the work in turn draw water to irrigate their fields. The trees bear fruit perpetually, and the corn which grows there is finer than any other and whiter than snow. There are sometimes two crops of barley in a year and three of millet. The inhabitants water their little plots of land every third day in summer, every sixth day in winter, which makes the soil very fertile. Clouds are rarely, if ever, seen. About the clocks made there. The author says that the oasis was formerly an island, which had been detached from the mainland, and that it is called by <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> the islands of the blest, but that <a href=/people/2235 target=_blank>Herodorus</a> (who wrote the lives of <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a> and <a href=/people/4006 target=_blank>Musaeus</a>) calls it Phaeacis. He argues that it was an island, first, from the fact that sea shells are found adhering to stones upon the mountain which leads to the oasis from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/262327UThe class=place long=32.75 lat=26.25>Thebaid</a>, and, secondly, because of the vast quantity of sand, which fills three oases. For he tells us that the oases are three in number, two large, an outer and an inner, opposite each other but a hundred miles apart, while the third is small and a great distance from the other two. A further argument that it was an island is that fish are often found that have been carried there by birds, and the remains of fish that have been eaten, so that one may conjecture that the sea was not far off.

He also sent monks to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a> to redeem from error those who were given over to idolatry; these monks, armed with the imperial authority, overthrew the idolatrous temples, the expenses being defrayed by certain pious women.

He utterly rooted out the Marcionite heresy which was raising its head again in the East. He increased the number of nightly services with chanting. He took his food alone for three reasons; he was a total abstainer from wine because it affected his head (except when he drank it flavoured with roses in summer), he suffered from a weak stomach so that he often could not eat the food put before him, but asked for something else, and when at leisure he often refrained from food all day. The clergy considered him very harsh and austere. His deacon <a href=/people/3248 target=_blank>Serapion</a> was also the cause of great hatred against him.

She accordingly took refuge with the general port in a storm, the great John, who brought an action against Paulacius for the payment of pieces to the widow. This roused the hostility of Eudoxia, who was anxious for Paulacius to be let off. She was not listened to, however, and the just man claimed and restored to the ill-treated woman that of which she had been unjustly defrauded. Then a wonderful thing happened. When Eudoxia sent to rescue Paulacius in despite of John, an angel appeared bearing a spear and frightened her messengers, so that their mission was unsuccessful.

This <a href=/people/1510 target=_blank>Isidore</a>, owing to his blameless character, had formerly been sent to <a href=/people/2735 target=_blank>Damasus</a> by <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a>, and had brought from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to Flavian an offer of friendship and alliance, after the two Churches had been at variance for twenty years. The evidence of <a href=/people/1510 target=_blank>Isidore</a> roused the anger of <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a>, who expelled Peter from the Church and falsely accused <a href=/people/1510 target=_blank>Isidore</a> of gross immorality. When the falsehood was discovered, <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a> was roused to further villainy, which was increased by the following incident. A certain rich woman named Theodota had given <a href=/people/1510 target=_blank>Isidore</a> pieces of money to distribute amongst the poor without consulting <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a>, which <a href=/people/1510 target=_blank>Isidore</a> had done. To avoid the wrath of <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a> he fled to the mountain of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/309303UNit class=place long=30.3861 lat=30.9265>Nitria</a>, where he had formerly lived in a cell. The chief of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> monks were <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>, <a href=/people/753 target=_blank>Ammonius</a>, Euthymius, and <a href=/people/1157 target=_blank>Eusebius</a>, four brothers, called the long from the height of their stature. At that time a quarrel had broken out with the Anthro.po-morphite heretics. When some ignorant and coarse monks created a disturbance in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a>, apparently alarmed when they abused him, attempted to deceive them by flattery, saying, I have seen your faces as the face of God. But when they further demanded that <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a>, because he asserted that the divinity was without human form, should be anathematized, he consented, and so escaped death. Seizing hold of this pretext against the long brethren (since they would no longer associate with him as before, and denied that God had a human form), he accused them to the monks and stirred up that ignorant herd against them and also against <a href=/people/1510 target=_blank>Isidore</a>, on whose account he was the more hostile to them. At last; after having been the victims of intrigue and ill-treatment, and their cells having been set fire to, they fled to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>. John received them kindly and sympathetically, but did not admit them to communion for fear of offending <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a>, to whom he wrote a letter proposing reconciliation, but <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a> paid no attention. In the meantime the long brethren presented documents containing charges against <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a>, and were in turn accused by others at his instigation. When these latter were unable to prove anything they were thrown into prison and flogged, some of them died and the rest were condemned to banishment in the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406276IPro class=place long=27.6167 lat=40.6167>Proconnesus</a>. John informed <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a> of the charges against him, to which <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a> angrily replied : I believe you are acquainted with the canons of the council of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404297PNic class=place long=29.7168 lat=40.4266>Nicaea</a>, by which it is ordained that no bishop shall exercise jurisdiction beyond his own province. If you are not, then make yourself acquainted with them and do not interfere with the charges against me. Notwithstanding, the same <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a> who wrote these words afterwards condemned John, although he belonged to another diocese. As the monks did not desist from their accusations against <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a>, the emperor ordered him to present himself for trial. But the animosity against John increased to such a degree that, on his arrival, <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a> was appointed judge of John himself. </p>                        </div>

Our author relates (as is also stated in the life of <a href=/people/3592 target=_blank>Epiphanius</a>), that he by no means approved of the deposition of <a href=/people/10862 target=_blank>Chrysostom</a>, as others believed he did, in spite of the empress's importunity. He also mentions their prediction to each other, that neither should see his throne again. Before his condemnation John, having heard that Eudoxia was angry with him, delivered a lengthy discourse against women generally, which the people interpreted as an attack on the empress.

He declared that he did not wish to resume his pastoral office until the unjust sentence against him had been submitted to investigation. Soon afterwards, Eudoxia being again enraged because John had attacked her in reference to the statue which had been erected in her honour near his church and was the cause of disturbance inside, intrigues were again set on foot against him. <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a>, although this was an unexpected piece of good fortune for him, being afraid of the hatred of the citizens, did not appear. The cause of their hatred against him was that, after the deposition of John, he had communicated with the long brethren, by whose means he had plotted against him, and that he did not himself abstain from reading the writings of <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a>, on account of which he had accused John. He did not, therefore, attend in person, but sent others to declare that John ought not even to be brought to trial, since after his deposition he had ventured to perform the services of the Church, whereas the synod of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> left no room for defence to one who did so after he had been deprived of office. Those who sided with John declared that both the canon and the synod were tainted with Arianism, and that the canon had been aimed at <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a>; that the council of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427233USer class=place long=23.3283 lat=42.6975>Sardica</a> repudiated the validity of the synod, and not only allowed <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a> to defend himself but also to perform the duties of the priesthood with <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>. </p>                        </div>

But in my opinion one may recognise his wisdom because, in proposing to join together carefully fables and real facts, he avoids blame by the ambiguity of his title.

In sum, the vocabulary has vigour, the construction harmony; he adapts a style of pathos to reasonings and arguments of pathos, and to those of a practical character he adapts the form that suits them. The author keeps a balance, not only in this discourse but also in many others. However, it is difficult for a combative author to keep his balance from bout to bout against his antagonist, above all when one is naturally lively and passionate, traits of character lacking in neither <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> nor <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a>.
