It was <a href=/people/303 target=_blank>Danaus</a>, our father, adviser and leader, who, considering well our course, decided, as the best of all possible evils, that we flee with all speed over the waves of the sea and find a haven on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>' shore. For from there descends our race, sprung from the caress and breath of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> on the gnat-tormented heifer. <br />To what kinder land than this could we come with these wool-wreathed branches in our hands, sole weapons of the suppliant? O realm, O land, and clear water; gods on high and earth-bound powers, grievous in your vengeance, which inhabit the tomb; and you, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the Savior, invoked third, the guardian of the habitations of righteous men: receive as suppliants this band of women with the compassionate spirit of the land. But the thronging swarm of violent men born of <a href=/people/1155 target=_blank>Egyptus</a>, should they set foot upon this marshy land, drive them seaward — and with them their swift ship — and there may they encounter a cruel sea with thunder, lightning, and rain-charged winds, and perish by the tempest's buffeting blasts, if they ever lay their hands on us, their cousins, and mount unwilling beds from which Right holds them aloof. </p>                        </div>

Recipients of such favors as these, it becomes us to hold gratitude in yet higher honor from the bottom of our hearts. And in addition to the many other wise injunctions of your father recorded in your memory, inscribe this too — that an unknown company is proved by time. For in an alien's case, all the world bears an evil tongue in readiness, and it is easy lightly to utter defiling slander. Therefore I would have you bring no shame upon me, now when your youthful loveliness attracts men's gaze. The tender ripeness of summer fruit is in no way easy to protect; beasts despoil it — and men, why not? — and brutes that fly and those that walk the earth. <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a>'s goddess spreads news abroad of fruit bursting ripe. . . . So all men, as they pass, mastered by desire, shoot an alluring arrow of the eye at the delicate beauty of virgins. See to it, therefore, that we do not suffer that in fear for which we have endured great toil and ploughed the great waters with our ship; and that we bring no shame to ourselves and exultation to our enemies. Housing of two kinds is at our disposition, the one <a href=/people/1165 target=_blank>Pelasgus</a> offers, the other, the city, and to occupy free of cost. These terms are easy.
