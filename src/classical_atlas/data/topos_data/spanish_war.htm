In these circumstances some states sent reinforcements of their own accord, while on the other hand some shut their gates against him.

Envoys from those in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379000UCor class=place long=-4.7764 lat=37.8847>Corduba</a> who had deserted the cause of Cn. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> had met <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and now reported that the town of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379000UCor class=place long=-4.7764 lat=37.8847>Corduba</a> could be captured by night, because it was by surprise that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> had mastered his rivals in that province, and moreover, <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> himself had revealed his own fears of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s arrival by the fact that he had posted couriers at all points to notify him of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s coming. They also advanced many other plausible reasons besides this. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was thereby encouraged and informed Q. <a href=/people/12083 target=_blank>Pedius</a> and Q. <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, the two officers he had previously appointed to command his army, that he had arrived, adding instructions that the cavalry which had been raised in the province should support him. But he came up with them more expeditiously than they themselves anticipated, and so did not have the cavalry to support him as he himself had wished.  <a href=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#2 target=_blank>SOL</a></p>                        </div>

On learning of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s arrival, envoys left this town unbeknown to Cn. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>' outposts, came to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and proceeded to entreat him to send them help at the earliest opportunity. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, who was aware that the township in question had always deserved well of the Roman people, promptly gave orders that six infantry cohorts and a corresponding number of cavalry should set out at the second watch; and in command of them he put L. <a href=/people/1725 target=_blank>Vibius</a> <a href=/people/9962 target=_blank>Paciaecus</a>, a well-known member of that province, and one that knew it pretty well. Now it so chanced that at the very time he came to Cn. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>'s outposts he was beset by bad weather and a violent gale. So severe was the storm and so dark did it make the approaches to the town that they could scarcely recognise their next-door neighbours. To them indeed this drawback proved of the utmost advantage. And so, when they had got thus far, he bade the horsemen go up in file, and they pushed rapidly forward to the town straight through their opponent's positions. When they were in the middle of their positions someone asked who they were; and one of our men told the questioner to hold his tongue: 'just at the moment they were trying to come up to the wall so as to capture the town.' It was in fact partly the disconcerting effect of this reply, partly the difficulties of the storm, which prevented the sentries from displaying proper attention to their duties. When they came up to the gate they gave the password and were admitted by the townsfolk: the infantry were deployed in various sectors of the town and stayed inside, while the cavalry raised a shout and sallied forth against the enemy camp. Thus, in the course of this operation, which had taken the enemy unawares, well nigh the majority of the troops in this camp thought they were as good as captured.  <a href=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#3 target=_blank>SOL</a></p>                        </div>

No sooner had they come within sight of the town than they all took to the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>; but this manoeuvre it was quite impossible for the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379000UCor class=place long=-4.7764 lat=37.8847>Corduba</a> to observe. Now as they were approaching <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379000UCor class=place long=-4.7764 lat=37.8847>Corduba</a>, a good large force came out of the town and cut the cavalry to pieces, and the heavy-armed infantry we have just mentioned now dismounted. They then fought a great battle, to such effect that out of the countless host but few men retired back into the town. In his alarm at this reverse Sextus <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> was constrained to send a despatch to his brother urging him to come promptly to his aid, to prevent <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s capturing <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379000UCor class=place long=-4.7764 lat=37.8847>Corduba</a> before Gnaeus himself could arrive there.

He was now encamped over against the town in the area of the bridge, and his camp was, as we have just mentioned, divided into three sections. When <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> arrived there with his forces he pitched a camp on the same principle on the opposite side. In order to cut him off from the town and the supplies it afforded, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> began to carry a line of fortifications to the bridge, and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> adopted tactics on similar lines. Whereupon a race took place between the two commanders as to which of them should seize the bridge first; and this race gave rise to daily skirmishes on a small scale in which now our troops, now theirs, would come out on top. This situation had now developed into a more intensive struggle, and both sides being more passionately bent on holding their ground had embarked upon hand-to-hand fighting and formed a solid mass near the bridge; and as they approach the river's banks they were flung headlong into it, packed tightly as they were. At this point the two sides vied with each other not merely in piling one death upon another but in matching mound of dead with mound. Several days were passed in this fashion, and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was anxious to bring his opponents down to favourable ground, if by any means he could do so, and fight a decisive action at the earliest opportunity.  <a href=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#5 target=_blank>SOL</a></p>                        </div>

Meanwhile <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had completed his emplacements and all his other dispositions which were required for assaulting the town, and proceeded to carry forward a ramp furnished with mantlets. Now this area is mountainous and offers natural obstructions to military operations: it is divided by a plain — the basin of the river Salsum — in such a way, however, that the river is nearest <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378000UAte class=place long=-4.5729 lat=37.7554>Ategua</a>, the distance being about two miles.

He had the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> and standards of thirteen legions; but among those which he thought afforded him any solid support two were native legions, having deserted from <a href=/people/951 target=_blank>Trebonius</a>; a third had been raised from the local Roman settlers; a fourth was one which was once commanded by <a href=/people/847 target=_blank>Afranius</a> and which <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> had brought with him from Africa; while the rest were made up of runaways or auxiliaries.

In fact, practically the whole region of Further Spain, fertile as it is and correspondingly well watered, makes a siege a fruitless and difficult task. Here too, in view of the constant sallies of the natives, all places which are remote from towns are firmly held by towers and fortifications, as in Africa, roofed over with rough-cast, not tiles. Moreover, they have watch-towers in them, commanding a view far and wide by reason of their altitude. Again, a large proportion of the towns of this private are more or less protected by the mountains and are established in naturally elevated positions, with the result that the approach to them, involving as it does a simultaneous climb, proves a difficult task. Thus it is their natural position that holds them aloof from sieges, and as a result the townships of Spain are no easy prey to an enemy, as proved to be the case in this war. To take the present instance: <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> had his camp established between the above-mentioned towns of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378000UAte class=place long=-4.5729 lat=37.7554>Ategua</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377000UUcu class=place long=-4.5538 lat=37.6808>Ucubi</a>, in sight of both of them; and some four miles distant from his camp there lies a hillock — a natural elevation which goes by the name of the Camp of <a href=/people/419 target=_blank>Postumius</a>; and there <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had established a fort for purposes of defence.  <a href=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Spanish_War/text*.html#8 target=_blank>SOL</a></p>                        </div>

On their return to the town with this reply, the inhabitants raised a shout, discharged volleys of missiles of all sorts, and went into action along the entire circuit of the battlements; and this led to a strong conviction among quite a large number of the men in our lines that they would make a sally that day. As a result a cordon of troops was thrown round the town and very violent fighting went on for some time; in the course of which a missile was discharged by our men from apiece of heavy artillery and demolished a tower, knocking out five members of the enemy crew who manned distant, as well as a slave whose regular duty it was to keep watch on that piece of artillery. </p>                        </div>

Likewise on the following day he again pursued his usual tactics and made a fairly extensive sweep, in the course of which at one point where our cavalry were picketed several squadrons of ours with some light-armed troops were attacked and dislodged from their position; and then, because of their small numbers, both our horsemen and the light-armed troops were completely crushed amidst the squadrons of their opponents.

When picked light-armed infantry took our cavalry by surprise by coming forward to engage them, and when this manoeuvre was observed in the course of the fighting, quite a number of our horsemen dismounted. As a result, in a short time our cavalry began to fight an infantry action, to such good purpose that they dealt death right up close to the rampart. In this battle on our opponents' side there fell one hundred and twenty-three men; and of those who were driven back to their camp not a few had been stripped of their arms and many were wounded. On our side there fell three men; twelve infantrymen and five horsemen were wounded. Later on that day the old routine was observed and fighting broke out along the battlements. After discharging a very large number of missile weapons and firebrands at our troops, who were on the defensive, the enemy embarked upon an abominable and completely ruthless outrage; for in our sight they proceeded to massacre some of their hosts in the town, and to fling them headlong from the battlements — a barbarous act, and one for which history can produce no precedent. </p>                        </div>

With them they brought out brushwood and hurdles to fill up the trenches, as well as hooks for demolishing and then burning the straw-thatched huts which had been built by our men to serve as winter quarters; they also brought silver and clothing besides, so that, while our men were busily engaged in looting it, they could wreak havoc upon them and then retire to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>' lines.

An exchange of views then took place between the two sides; whereupon, as the envoys were rejoining our men who were outside the town, the townsmen followed them up from behind with an armed party and then massacred them. There were two survivors, who fled and reported the incident to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> . . . and the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372000UUrs class=place long=-5.0902 lat=37.2423>Ursao</a> sent investigators to the town of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378000UAte class=place long=-4.5729 lat=37.7554>Ategua</a>. And when they had definitely established that the envoys' account was correct, and that the incidents had occurred just as they had related, a crowd of townsfolk quickly gathered, and they began to stone and shake their fists at the man who had massacred the envoys, shouting that he had been responsible for their own undoing. So when he had barely been rescued from his perilous plight, he besought the townsfolk for leave to go on a mission to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, saying that he would satisfy the latter. Permission being granted, he set out from the town, collected a bodyguard and, when he had made it a good large force, contrived by treachery to be taken back into the town by night.

At this point, while our men were busily engaged in the operation, a fair number of the enemy swooped down upon them from higher ground and, as our men carried on with their work, there were not a few casualties among them from the heavy volleys of enemy missiles. Hereupon, as <a href=/people/337 target=_blank>Ennius</a> puts it, our men gave ground for a brief space. Consequently, when our men observed that they were giving ground more than their wont, two centurions from the Fifth legion crossed the river and restored the battle line; and as they drove their more numerous enemies back, displaying dash and gallantry of an exceptional order, one of them succumbed to a heavy volley of missiles discharged from higher ground. And so his colleague now began an uphill fight; and when he observed that he was being completely surrounded, he retreated and lost his footing. As this gallant officer fell not a few of the enemy made a rush to plunder his decorations; but our cavalry crossed the river and from lower ground proceeded to drive the enemy to their rampart. And so, in their too eager anxiety to carry destruction within the area of the latter's defence positions, they were cut off by enemy squadrons and light-armed troops. Had not their gallantry been of the highest order, they would have been captured alive; for they were, moreover, hemmed in so tightly by the emplacements of the camp as to make it well nigh impossible for a horseman to defend himself in the restricted space. As a result of both types of engagement — quite a number of men were wounded, including <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> Arquitius; but although both sides were engaged at such close quarters, no-one was lost on our side apart from the two centurions, who bore themselves with outstanding distinction. </p>                        </div>

When accordingly the forces of both sides had launched an attack upon this lofty knoll, our men forestalled the enemy and hurled them back on to the level ground. This led to a successful action by our troops: on all sides their opponents gave ground, and our men were engaged in a massacre of no mean proportions. It was the high ground, not the enemy's valour, which proved the latter's salvation; and even relying upon its aid they would, but for the approach of evening, have been deprived of all support by our less numerous forces. As it was, their casualties comprised three hundred and twenty-three light-armed and a hundred and thirty-eight legionaries, apart from those who were stripped of their arms and equipment.

While our men were engaged on their task of fortification, the enemy cavalry forces began to launch attacks; and simultaneously his legionary troops kept clamorously demanding to have their turn, seeing that their normal role was to support the cavalry — you might have supposed them to be straining madly at the leash; when our men advanced a good long way from a shallow valley and halted on more favourable ground in the plain. However, there was no doubt about it, the enemy all lacked the courage to come down into the plain to engage — all except one man, <a href=/people/1531 target=_blank>Antistius</a> <a href=/people/5298 target=_blank>Turpio</a>; and he, confident in his strength, began to indulge in taunts, claiming that there was nobody a match for him on the opposite side.

So fanatically eager were they all, each man gripped by the enthusiasm of the champions and supporters of his own side. As for the two champions, what with their dashing courage, now that they had moved into the plain for the encounter, and the inwrought work of their shields — emblems of their fame — flashing in front of them . . . and their duel would almost certainly have put an end to the action, unless, owing to the attack of the enemy cavalry noted above, . . . <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> posted some light-armed troops not far from the emplacement to give cover.

On receipt of this news <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> displayed the flag-signal for action. Now the reason why <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> had led out his forces was this: he had previously sent a despatch to the citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372000UUrs class=place long=-5.0902 lat=37.2423>Ursao</a>, who were supporters of his, saying that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was unwilling to come down into the valley because the greater part of his army was inexperienced. This despatch stiffened the morale of the townsfolk considerably. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> therefore, relying on this conviction, supposed that he could carry the whole thing off; for where he had established his camp he was protected not only by the natural conformation of the ground but also by the fortifications of the town itself. For, as we have pointed out earlier, it is lofty country, bastioned by hills with an occasional intervening plain; and this, it so happened, was the case on the present occasion. </p>                        </div>

Extending from the town the plain ground nearest to it levelled out, and ran down to where a stream ran in front of it, which made the ground there extremely awkward for <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s troops to approach the Pompeians; for the soil to the right of the river's course was marshy and full of bog-holes. Consequently, when <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> saw their battle line deployed, he had no doubt that his opponents would advance to the level ground to do battle in the middle of the plain. This area was in full view of all. Moreover, with a level plain like that and a calm, sunny day, it was a tempting situation for cavalry — a wonderful, longed-for and well-nigh heaven-sent opportunity for engaging battle. Our men were delighted — though some also had misgivings — at the thought that the welfare and fortunes of everyone were being brought to the point that no one could tell for certain what would prove to be the luck vouchsafed them an hour later. And so our men advanced to do battle; and we supposed that the enemy would do likewise: but our opponents would not venture to advance far from the defences of the town: on the contrary, they were establishing themselves in the town close to the wall. And so our men advanced. From time to time the favourable nature of the ground would sorely tempt the enemy to press on to victory under such conditions; but, none the less, they would not depart from their accustomed tactics so as to forsake either the high ground or the town. And when our men, advancing at a moderate pace, came up closer to the stream, their opponents remained consistently on the defensive on the steep ground. </p>                        </div>

So when our men, as they approached, reached the unfavourable ground at the farthest limit of the plain, the enemy were ready on higher ground, making it extremely dangerous for our men to pursue their passage to the higher level. When <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> observed this, to avoid any blunder being perpetrated owing to rashness or faulty judgment, he began to restrict the operational area. But when it came to the ears of the men that he was doing so, they were bitterly disgusted, as they took it to mean that their chance of deciding the conflict was being hampered. This delay made the enemy keener: it was fear, they thought, that was preventing <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s forces from joining battle: and although by displaying themselves they gave our men the opportunity of engaging them on steep ground, yet it was only at great risk that one could approach them. On our side the men of the Tenth legion held their proper post — the right wing; while the men of the Third and Fifth legions together with all the rest of our forces — the auxiliary troops and the cavalry — held the left wing. The shout was raised and the battle joined. </p>                        </div>

In fact, as regards attacking and shouting — the two chief methods of demoralising an enemy — both sides stood on equal terms of comparison. But, though they accordingly brought to the contest an equal fighting capacity in both these departments of battle, yet the enemy masses were pinned down by our volleys of heavy javelins, and fell in heaps. Our right wing, as we have explained, was held by the men of the Tenth legion; and despite their small numbers, their gallantry none the less enabled them by their exertions to inspire no little panic among their opponents. They proceeded, in fact, to exert strong pressure on the enemy, driving him back from his positions, with the result that he began to transfer a legion from his right, to give support and to prevent our men from outflanking him. As soon as this legion had been set in motion <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s cavalry began to exert pressure on the enemy left wing, so that, no matter how gallantly the enemy might fight, he was afforded no opportunity of reinforcing his line. And so, as the motley din — shouts, groans, the clash of swords — assailed their ears, it shackled the minds of the inexperienced with fear. Hereupon, as <a href=/people/337 target=_blank>Ennius</a> puts it, foot forces against foot and weapons grind 'gainst weapons; and in the teeth of very strong opposition our men began to drive the enemy back. The town, however, stood them in good stead. And so they were routed and put to flight on the very day of the <a href=/people/7876 target=_blank>Liberalia</a>; nor would they have survived, had they not fled back to their original starting point.

Shields and javelins taken from among the enemy's weapons were placed to serve as a palisade, dead bodies as a rampart; on top, impaled on sword points, severed human heads were ranged in a row all facing the town, the object being not merely to enclose the enemy by a palisade, but to afford him an awe-inspiring spectacle by displaying before him this evidence of valour. Having thus encircled the tomb with the javelins and spears taken from the corpses of the enemy, the Gallic troops now proceeded to assault it.

There was the party which had sent envoys to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>: there was another party which espoused the cause of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. Civil discord being thus stirred up, they seized the gates: much blood was shed: <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, who was wounded, seized twenty warships, and took to flight. As soon as the news of his escape reached <a href=/people/3581 target=_blank>Didius</a>, who was at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gades</a> in command of a squadron, he forthwith began to give chase; and from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362000UCar class=place long=-5.4104 lat=36.1832>Carteia</a> too the hunt was likewise taken up forthwith by infantry and cavalry marching in swift pursuit. On the fourth day of their voyage <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>' party put in to land, since they had been ill provided and without water when they sailed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362000UCar class=place long=-5.4104 lat=36.1832>Carteia</a>. While they were getting water <a href=/people/3581 target=_blank>Didius</a> hastened up with his fleet, captured some of their ships, and burned the rest. </p>                        </div>

When the cavalry and infantry cohorts which had been despatched in his pursuit learned of this from scouts they had sent on ahead, they pushed on day and night. Now <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> was seriously wounded in the shoulder and left leg; added to which he had also sprained his ankle, which hampered him very much. So a litter was employed to carry him off to this redoubt and, once arrived there, he continued to be carried about in it. One of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-83RLus class=ethnic long=-8.3 lat=39>Lusitanians</a> who had been despatched from his escort on reconnaissance in accordance with normal military routine was now spotted by the Caesarian force, and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> was promptly surrounded by the cavalry and cohorts. It was a difficult place to approach: that in fact was the very reason why <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> had chosen himself a naturally fortified position, so that, no matter how great a force was brought up to it, a handful of men might be able to defend it from higher ground. On their arrival our men came up close to it only to be driven back with javelins. As they gave ground the enemy pressed upon them the more eagerly and called an immediate halt to their advance. When this manoeuvre had been repeated several times it became obvious that it was a very risky business for our men. The enemy then began to fortify his position with a circumvallation; our men, however, acting with speed and despatch, carried a similar circumvallation along the high ground, to enable them to encounter their opponents on an equal footing. When the latter observed this move they took refuge in flight. </p>                        </div>

On all sides our troops were carrying on the work of slaughter. Cut off from his entrenchment and having lost his supporters, <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> now resorted to a ravine, to a spot where the ground was eaten away; and there in a cave he proceeded to hide himself, so that, short of his being given away by a prisoner, it was no easy matter for our men to find him. By such means in fact he was discovered there and put to death.

Those <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-83RLus class=ethnic long=-8.3 lat=39>Lusitanians</a> who survived the battle rallied to their standard and, when a good large force had been mustered, duly proceeded against <a href=/people/3581 target=_blank>Didius</a>. Although he displayed no lack of care in guarding his ships, yet their constant sallies enticed him on occasions to leave his stronghold, with the result that in the course of almost daily battles they laid a trap for him, dividing up their forces into three groups. There were some who were detailed to burn the ships; some to repel an enemy relief force, when the ships had once been fired: these parties were posted in such a way as to be entirely hidden from view, whereas the remainder marched into battle in full view of all. Accordingly, when <a href=/people/3581 target=_blank>Didius</a> advanced with his forces from his stronghold to drive them back, the signal was displayed by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-83RLus class=ethnic long=-8.3 lat=39>Lusitanians</a>, the ships were set on fire, and simultaneously those who had advanced to battle from the stronghold — they were now pursuing the same retreating bandits, who had turned tail on that same signal — were surprised by the ambushing party, which raised a shout and surrounded them from the rear. <a href=/people/3581 target=_blank>Didius</a> met a gallant death with many of his men; some in the course of the fighting seized some pinnaces which were close inshore, while quite a number, on the other hand, swam off to the ships moored in deep water, weighed anchor, and then began to row them out to sea, thereby saving their lives. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-83RLus class=ethnic long=-8.3 lat=39>Lusitanians</a> gained possession of the booty. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gades</a> and hastened back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374000UHis class=place long=-5.9909 lat=37.3903>Hispalis</a>. </p>                        </div>

Now that they were cut off the enemy fell to fighting amongst themselves; and after a welter of bloodshed they made a sally. Our troops did not fail to take this opportunity of recovering the town and captured the remaining men alive, to the number of fourteen thousand. Our men now set out for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372000UUrs class=place long=-5.0902 lat=37.2423>Ursao</a>, a town which was buttressed by massive fortifications, to such an extent that in itself the place seemed adapted to assail an enemy by virtue of its natural site as well as its artificial fortification. Added to this, apart from a single fountain in the town itself, there was no water to be found anywhere in the neighbourhood under eight miles from the town; and this was a great advantage to the townsfolk. Then again there was the additional circumstance that materials for a rampart, . . . and timber, which they habitually used for the construction of towers and mantlets, was not to be found under six miles' distance from the town; and in order the more to safeguard himself against an attack upon it, <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> had had all the timber in the neighbourhood felled and dumped inside it. Thus our troops were under the necessity of detaching men to carry timber thither from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374000UMun class=place long=-5.196 lat=37.376>Munda</a>, the town they had just recently captured. </p>                        </div>

He reminded them that at the outset of his quaestorship he had made that province above all others his own special concern, and had liberally bestowed on it such benefits as lay in his power at that time; that when subsequently he had been promoted to the praetorship he had asked the Senate to rescind the taxes which <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> had imposed, and had secured the province immunity from paying the money in question; that having once taken upon himself to champion the province he had defended it, not only introducing numerous deputations into the Senate but also undertaking legal actions both public and private, and thereby incurring the enmity of many men. Similarly, during the period of his consulship he had bestowed on the province in his absence such advantages as lay in his power. Yet both in the present war and in the period before it he was well aware that they had been unmindful of all these advantages, and ungrateful for them, both towards himself and towards the Roman people. 'You,' he went on, 'who are well acquainted with the law of nations and the established usages of Roman citizens, have none the less behaved like savages and have laid violent hands more often than once upon the inviolable magistrates of the Roman people, and designed the dastardly murder of <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> in broad daylight in the middle of the forum. You have also so hated peace that this province has never ceased to be occupied by the legions of the Roman people. With you good deeds count as misdeeds, and vice versa. Consequently you have never been able to maintain harmony in peace or high morale in war. It was you who harboured the young Cn. <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> after his flight; it was at your instigation that, albeit a private citizen, he seized the rods of office and usurped military command, put many citizens to death, raised armed forces to fight the Roman people, and laid waste the territories of the province. On what field did you come out victorious? Or didn't you take into consideration the fact that, if I were done away with, the Roman people possessed legions which could not only offer you resistance but could also cause the heavens to fall?
