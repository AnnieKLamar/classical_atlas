Therefore I think we should regard such people as the common enemies of all men, and that they should never receive any indulgence when they are on trial before you; for each one of them comes into court, not under compulsion, but having chosen to incur the risk of the oath. </p>                        </div>

For you see that most people who adopt children do so through being cajoled by flattery and often in a spirit of contentiousness caused by family quarrels.

In what manner did he declare his view regarding this? When he says 'a man may return to his own family, leaving behind him a lawfully born son' he makes it plain, I take it, that it is not lawful for him to adopt; for it is impossible for a man to leave behind him a lawfully born son, unless he have a son born of his body.

For it was just, in my opinion, that the lawgiver, as he laid upon the nearest of kin the duty of relieving the misfortunes of their relatives, and of giving in marriage their women-folk, so also has given to these same people as their due the right of inheriting and of sharing in the good things. </p>                        </div>
