And let no one regard these details as trivial; inasmuch as nothing can be done without them. 3 The net-keeper should be a man with a keen interest in the business, one who speaks Greek, about twenty years old, agile and strong, and resolute, that, being well qualified to overcome his tasks, he may take pleasure in the business. 4 The purse-nets should be made of fine <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=demonym long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasian</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> flax, and the road-nets and hayes of the same material.

Both kinds should be thirty knots high, and should have meshes of the same width as those of the purse-nets. 6 At the elbows at either end let the road-nets have slip-knots of string and the hayes metal rings, and let the cords be attached by loops. 7 The stakes for the purse-nets should be thirty inches long, but some should be shorter. Those of unequal length are for use on sloping ground, to make the height of the nets equal, while those of the same length are used on the level.

The stakes for the road-nets should be twice the length of these, and those for the hayes forty-five inches long. The latter should have little forks with shallow grooves, and all should be stout, of a thickness proportioned to the length. 8 The number of stakes used for the hayes may be large or small; fewer are required if the nets are strained tight when set up, more if they are slack. 9 A calf-skin bag will be wanted for carrying the purse-nets and road-nets and hayes and the bill-hooks for cutting wood and stopping gaps where necessary.</p>                        </div>

The Castorian is so called because <a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a> paid special attention to the breed, making a hobby of the business. The Vulpine is a hybrid between the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> and the <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>fox</a>: hence the name. In the course of time the nature of the parents has become fused. 2 Inferior specimens (that is to say, the majority) show one or more of the following defects. They are small, hook-nosed, grey-eyed, blinking, ungainly, stiff, weak, thin-coated, lanky, ill-proportioned, cowardly, dull-scented, unsound in the feet. 3 Now small <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> often drop out of the running through their want of size; hook-nosed <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> have no mouth and can't hold the hare; grey-eyed <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> and blinkers have bad sight; ungainly <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> look ugly; stiff ones are in a bad way at the end of the hunt; no work can be got out of the weak and the thin-coated ones; those that are lanky and ill-proportioned are heavy movers and carry themselves anyhow; cowards leave their work and give up and slink away from the sun into shady places and lie down; <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> with no nose seldom scent the hare and only with difficulty; and those with bad feet, even if they are plucky, can't stand the hard work, and tire because they are foot-sore. 4 Moreover, <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> of the same breed vary much in behaviour when tracking. Some go ahead as soon as they find the line without giving a sign, and there is nothing to show that they are on it.

For both white and black frost hold heat; since the one draws it out by its own strength, and the other congeals it. 2 The <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a>' noses, too, are numbed by the cold, and they cannot smell when the tracks are in such a state until the tracks thaw in the sun or as day advances. Then the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> can smell and the scent revives. 3 A heavy dew, again, obliterates scent by carrying it downwards; and storms, occurring after a long interval, draw smells from the ground and make the earth bad for scent until it dries. South winds spoil scent, because the moisture scatters it, but north winds concentrate and preserve it, if it has not been previously dissolved. 4 Heavy showers drown it, and so does light rain, and the moon deadens it by its warmth, especially when at the full. Scent is most irregular at that time, for the hares, enjoying the light, fling themselves high in the air and jump a long way, frolicking with one another; and it becomes confused when <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>foxes</a> have crossed it.</p>                        </div>

In the autumn it is unimpeded; for the cultivated crops have been harvested and the weeds have withered, so that the odours of the herbage do not cause trouble by mingling with it. 6 In winter and summer and autumn the scent lies straight in the main. In spring it is complicated; for though the animal couples at all times, it does so especially at this season; so instinct prompts them to roam about together, and this is the result they produce. 7 The scent left by the hare in going to her form lasts longer than the scent of a running hare. For on the way to the form the hare keeps stopping, whereas when on the run she goes fast; consequently the ground is packed with it in the one case, but in the other is not filled with it. In coverts it is stronger than in open ground, because she touches many objects while running about and sitting up. 8 They find a resting-place where there is anything growing or lying on the ground, underneath anything, on the top of the objects, inside, alongside, well away or quite near or fairly near; occasionally even in the sea by springing on to anything she can reach, or in fresh water, if there is anything sticking out or growing in it, the hare, when going to her 9 form generally choosing a sheltered place for it in cold weather and a cool one in hot, but in spring and autumn a place exposed to the sun; but hares on the run do not do that, because they are scared by the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a>.</p>                        </div>

She moves her nostrils continually when sleeping, but less frequently when awake. 12 When the ground is bursting with vegetation they frequent the fields rather than the mountains. Wherever she may be she remains there when tracked, except when she is suddenly alarmed at night; in which case she moves off. 13 The animal is so prolific that at the same time she is rearing one litter, she produces another and she is pregnant.

The eyes are prominent; the lids are too small and do not give protection to the pupils; consequently the vision is weak and blurred. 27 Added to this, though the animal spends much time asleep, it gets no benefit from that, so far as seeing goes. Its speed, too, accounts in no small degree for its dim sight. For it glances at an object and is past it in a flash, before realising its nature. 28 And those terrors, the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a>, close behind them when they are pursued combine with these causes to rob them of their wits.

In a fair run she is seldom beaten by the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> owing to her speed. Those that are caught are beaten in spite of their natural characteristics through meeting with an accident. Indeed, there is nothing in the world of equal size to match the hare as a piece of mechanism. For the various parts that make up her body are formed as follows.</p>                        </div>

Here is a proof of her agility. When going quietly, she springs—no one ever saw or ever will see a hare walking—bringing the hind-feet forward in advance of the fore-feet and outside them; and that is how she runs. 32 This is obvious when snow is on the ground. The scut is of no assistance in running, for it is not able to steer the body owing to its shortness. The hare does this by means of one of her ears; and when she is roused by the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> she drops one ear on the side on which she is being pressed and throws it aslant, and then bearing on this she wheels round sharply and in a moment leaves the assailant far behind. 33 So charming is the sight that to see a hare tracked, found, pursued and caught is enough to make any man forget his heart's desire. 34 When hunting on cultivated land avoid growing crops and let pools and streams alone. It is unseemly and wrong to interfere with them, and there is a risk of encouraging those who see to set themselves against the law .

But take the hayes, and go with a companion to the mountains, passing over the cultivated land, and as soon as the tracks are found, follow them. 3 If they are complicated, go back from the same ones to the same place and work round in circles and examine them, trying to find where they lead. The hare roams about uncertain where to rest, and, moreover, it is her habit to be tricky in her movements, because she is constantly being pursued in this manner. 4 As soon as the track is clear, push straight ahead. It will lead either to a thickly wooded spot or to a steep declivity. For the gusts of wind carry the snow over such places; consequently many resting-places are left, and she looks for one of these.</p>                        </div>

But they are soon caught in the second or third run, since their bodies are still too young to stand the work. 11 Caltrops are set for deer in the mountains, about meadows and streams and glades, in alleys and cultivated lands that they frequent. 12 The caltrops should be made of plaited yew, stripped of the bark, so as not to rot. They should have circular crowns, and the nails should be of iron and wood alternately, plaited into the rim, the iron nails being the longer, so that the wooden ones will yield to the foot and the others hurt it. 13 The noose of the cord to be laid on the crown and the cord itself should be of woven esparto, since this is rot-proof. The noose itself and the cord must be strong; and the clog attached must be of common or evergreen oak, twenty-seven inches long, not stripped of the bark, and three inches thick. 14 To set the caltrops make a round hole in the ground fifteen inches deep, of the same size at the top as the crowns of the traps, but tapering towards the bottom.

Remove any earth remaining over to a place some distance from the caltrop; for if the deer smells earth recently disturbed, it shies; and it is not slow to smell it. 17 Accompanied by the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a>, inspect the traps set in the mountains, preferably at daybreak (but it should be done also at other times during the day), in the cultivated lands early.

So take the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hound</a> and tie her up with the others at a good distance from the lair, and have the nets put up in the convenient anchorages, hanging the meshes on forked branches of trees. Out of the net itself make a long projecting bosom, putting sticks inside to prop it up on both sides, so that the light of day may penetrate as much as possible into the bosom through the meshes, in order that the interior may be as light as possible when the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> rushes at it.

Then let the most experienced and most powerful man in the field approach him in front and thrust his spear into him. 11 If, in spite of javelins and stones, he refuses to pull the rope tight, but draws back, wheels round and marks his assailant, in that case the man must approach him spear in hand, and grasp it with the left in front and the right behind, since the left steadies while the right drives it. The left foot must follow the left hand forward, and the right foot the other hand. 12 As he advances let him hold the spear before him, with his legs not much further apart than in wrestling, turning the left side towards the left hand, and then watching the beast's eye and noting the movement of the fellow's head. Let him present the spear, taking care that the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> doesn't knock it out of his hand with a jerk of his head, since he follows up the impetus of the sudden knock. 13 In case this accident should happen, the man must fall on his face and clutch the undergrowth beneath him, for, if the beast attacks him in this position, he is unable to lift the man's body owing to the upward curve of his tusks; but if his body is off the ground, the man is certain to be gored.

The enraged beast will come on, and but for the teeth of the blade, would shove himself forward along the shaft far enough to reach the man holding the spear. 17 His strength is so great that he has some peculiar properties which one would never imagine him to possess. Thus, if you lay hairs on his tusks immediately after he is dead, they shrivel up, such is the heat of the tusks.

Again, they will be capable of sleeping on a hard bed and of guarding well the place assigned to them. 3 In an attack on the enemy they will be able to go for him and at the same time to carry out the orders that are passed along, because they are used to do the same things on their own account when capturing the game. If their post is in the van they will not desert it, because they can endure. 4 In the rout of the enemy they will make straight for the foe without a slip over any kind of ground, through habit. If part of their own army has met with disaster in ground rendered difficult by woods and defiles or what not, they will manage to save themselves without loss of honour and to save others.

For men who are sound in body and mind may always stand on the threshold of success. 6 It was because they knew that they owed their successes against the enemy to such qualities that our ancestors looked after the young men. For in spite of the scarcity of corn it was their custom from the earliest times not to prevent hunters from hunting over any growing crops; and, in addition, not to permit hunting at 7 night within a radius of many furlongs from the city, so that the masters of that art might not rob the young men of their game. In fact they saw that this is the only one among the pleasures of the younger men that produces a rich crop of blessings. For it makes sober and upright men of them, because they are trained in the school of truth (and they perceived 8 that to these men they owed their success in war, as in other matters); and it does not keep them from any other honourable occupation they wish to follow, like other and evil pleasures that they ought not to learn. Of such men, therefore, are good soldiers and good generals made. 9 For they whose toils root out whatever is base and froward from mind and body and make desire for virtue to flourish in their place—they are the best, since they will not brook injustice to their own city nor injury to its soil.</p>                        </div>

They are not aware that all who benefit their cities and their friends are more attentive to their domestic affairs than other men. 11 Therefore, if keen sportsmen fit themselves to be useful to their country in matters of vital moment, neither will they be remiss in their private affairs: for the state is necessarily concerned both in the safety and in the ruin of the individual's domestic fortunes. Consequently such men as these save the fortunes of every other individual as well as their own. 12 But many of those who talk in this way, blinded by jealousy, choose to be ruined through their own evil rather than be saved by other men's virtue. For most pleasures are evil, and by yielding to these they are encouraged either to say or to do what is wrong. 13 Then by their frivolous words they make enemies, and by their evil deeds bring diseases and losses and death on themselves, their children and their friends, being without perception of the evils, but more perceptive than others of the pleasures. Who would employ these to save a state? 14 From these evils, however, everyone who loves that which I recommend will hold aloof, since a good education teaches a man to observe laws, to talk of righteousness and hear of it.</p>                        </div>

But if any decline to receive instruction because of the labour and prefer to live among untimely pleasures, they are by nature utterly evil. 16 For they obey neither laws nor good words, for because they toil not, they do not discover what a good man ought to be, so that they cannot be pious or wise men; and being without education they constantly find fault with the educated. 17 In these men's hands, therefore, nothing can prosper. All discoveries that have benefited mankind are due to the better sort . Now the better sort are those who are willing to toil. And this has been proved by a great example. 18 For among the ancients the companions of <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Cheiron</a> to whom I referred learnt many noble lessons in their youth, beginning with hunting; from these lessons there sprang in them great virtue, for which they are admired even today.

Neither do their contributions to literature tend to make men good: but they have written 2 many books on frivolous subjects, books that offer the young empty pleasures, but put no virtue into them. To read them in the hope of learning something from them is mere waste of time, and they keep one from useful occupations and teach what is bad. 3 Therefore their grave faults incur my graver censure. As for the style of their writings, I complain that the language is far-fetched, and there is no trace in them of wholesome maxims by which the young might be trained to virtue. 4 I am no professor, but I know that the best thing is to be taught what is good by one's own nature, and the next best thing is to get it from those who really know something good instead of being taught by masters of the art of deception.</p>                        </div>

I am well aware that someone, perhaps one of this set, will say that what is well and methodically written is not well and methodically written—for hasty and false censure will come easily to them. 7 But my aim in writing has been to produce sound work that will make men not wiseacres, but wise and good. For I wish my work not to seem useful, but to be so, that it may stand for all time unrefuted. 8 The sophists talk to deceive and write for their own gain, and do no good to anyone. For there is not, and there never was, a wise man among them; everyone of them is content to be called a sophist, which is a term of reproach among sensible men.

But huntsmen offer their lives and their property in sound condition for the service of the citizens. 12 These attack the wild beasts, those others their friends. And whereas those who attack their friends earn infamy by general consent, huntsmen by attacking the wild beasts gain a good report.

Unless they abound in labours and inventions and precautions, they cannot capture game. 14 For the forces contending with them, fighting for their life and in their own home, are in great strength; so that the huntsman's labours are in vain, unless by greater perseverance and by much intelligence he can overcome them.</p>                        </div>
