Thus in the same book of the Antiquities he writes as follows: <a href=/people/141 target=_blank>Valerius</a> <a href=/people/3030 target=_blank>Gratus</a> having put an end to the priesthood of <a href=/people/2089 target=_blank>Ananus</a> appoints Ishmael, the son of Fabi, high priest. And having removed him after a little he appoints Eleazer, the son of <a href=/people/2089 target=_blank>Ananus</a> the high priest, to the same office. And having removed him also at the end of a year he gives the high priesthood to <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a>, the son of Camithus. But he likewise held the honor no more than a year, when <a href=/people/1222 target=_blank>Josephus</a>, called also <a href=/people/6314 target=_blank>Caiaphas</a>, succeeded him. Accordingly the whole time of our <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a>'s ministry is shown to have been not quite four full years, four high priests, from Annas to the accession of <a href=/people/6314 target=_blank>Caiaphas</a>, having held office a year each. The Gospel therefore has rightly indicated <a href=/people/6314 target=_blank>Caiaphas</a> as the high priest under whom the <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a> suffered. From which also we can see that the time of our <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a>'s ministry does not disagree with the foregoing investigation. </p>                        </div>

For in the one case a man suffers martyrdom for the sake of his own soul; in the other case in behalf of the entire Church.
