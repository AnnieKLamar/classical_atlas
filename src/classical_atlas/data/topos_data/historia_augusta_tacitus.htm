For originally, when the regency was proclaimed after the reign of <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, regents were actually created, and that whole year was divided up among the hundred senators for periods of three, or four, or five days apiece, in such a way that there was only one single regent who held the power. 3 From this it resulted that the regency remained in force for even more than a year, in order that there might be no one of those equal in rank who had not held the rule at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. 4 To this must be added that also in the time of the consuls and the military tribunes vested with consular power, whenever a regency was proclaimed there were always regents, and never did the Roman commonwealth so entirely lack this office that there was not some regent created, though it might be for only two or three days. 5 I perceive, indeed, that the argument can be brought up against me that for the space of four years during the time of our ancestors there were no curule magistrates in the commonwealth. There were, however, tribunes of the plebs vested with the tribunician power, which is the most important element of the power of a king. 6 Even so, it is nowhere stated that there were no regents in that time; and indeed it has been declared on the authority of more reliable historians that consuls were later created by regents for the purpose of conducting the election of the other magistrates. </p>                        </div>

What peace for the people! How full of weight the authority of the senate! Nowhere did any pretender arise, and the judgement of the senate, the soldiers and the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> guided the entire world; it was not because they feared any emperor or the power of a tribune that they did righteously, but — what is the noblest thing in life — because they feared themselves. <br />3 I must, however, describe the cause of a delay so fortunate and an instance of unselfishness which should both receive special mention in the public records and be admired by future generations of the human race, in order that those who covet kingdoms may learn not to seize power but to merit it. 4 After <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> had been treacherously slain, as I have described in the previous book, by the trick of a most base slave and the folly of the officers (for with these any falsehood gains credence, provided only they hear it when angry, being often drunken and at best almost always devoid of counsel), when all returned again to sanity and the troops had sternly put down those persons, the question was at once raised whether any one of them all should be chosen as emperor. 5 Then the army, which was wont to create emperors hastily, in their anger at those who were present, sent to the senate the letter of which I have already written in the previous book, asking it to choose an emperor from its own numbers. 6 The senate, however, knowing that the emperors it had chosen were not acceptable to the soldiers, referred the matter back to them. And while this was being done a number of times the space of six months elapsed. </p>                        </div>

Scarce can I fulfill the duties of a senator, scarce can I speak the opinions to which my position constrains me. 7 Observe with greater care my advanced age, which you are now sending out from the shade of the chamber into the cold and the heat.

At no time, however, has a more wise or more weighty opinion been voiced in this sacred place. 2 We have chosen as prince a man advanced in years, one who will watch over all like a father. From him we need fear nothing ill-considered, nothing over hasty, nothing cruel. All his actions, we may predict, will be earnest, all dignified, and, in fact, what the commonwealth herself would command. 3 For he knows what manner of prince he has ever hoped for, and he cannot show himself to us as other than what he himself has sought and desired. 4 Indeed, if you should wish to consider those monsters of old, a <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, I mean, an <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a>, a <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> — or rather, always, an Incommodious — you would assuredly find that their vices were due as much to their youth as to the men themselves. 5 May the gods forfend that we should give the title of prince to a child or of Father of his Country to an immature boy, whose hand a schoolmaster must guide for the signing of his name and who is induced to confer a consulship by sweetmeats or toys or other such childish delights. 6 What wisdom is there — a plague upon it! — in having as emperor one who has not learned to care for fame, who knows not what the commonwealth is, who stands in dread of a guardian, who looks to a nurse, who is in subjection to the blows or the fear of a schoolmaster's rod, who appoints as consuls or generals or judges men whose lives, whose merits, whose years, whose families, whose achievements he knows not at all? 7 But why, Conscript Fathers, do I proceed farther. Let us rejoice that we have an elder as our prince, rather than recall again those times which appear more than tearful to those who endured them. 8 And so I bring and offer thanks to the gods in heaven in behalf, indeed, of the entire commonwealth, and I appeal to you, <a href=/people/3256 target=_blank>Tacitus</a> Augustus, asking and entreating and openly demanding in the name of our common fatherland and our laws that, if <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a> should overtake you too speedily, you will not name your young sons as heirs to the Roman Empire, or bequeath to them the commonwealth, the Conscript Fathers, and the Roman people as you would your farm, your tenants, and your slaves. 9 Wherefore look about you and follow the example of a <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a>, a <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>, and a <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>. It is a great glory to a dying prince to love the commonwealth more than his own sons. </p>                        </div>

Yours it is, therefore, to command and enact whatsoever seems worthy of yourselves, worthy of a well-ordered army, and worthy of the Roman people. 2 In this same speech he proposed that a golden statue of <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> be set up in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitolium</a>, likewise a silver one in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>Senate-house</a>, in the Temple of the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, and in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BMTr class=place long=12.4862 lat=41.8954>Forum</a> of the Deified <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>.

About them many epigrams were written, ridiculing the soothsayers who made the promise of the imperial power. 5 This is all that I remember learning about the lives of <a href=/people/3256 target=_blank>Tacitus</a> and <a href=/people/11058 target=_blank>Florian</a> that is worthy of record. <br />6 Now we must take up <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a>, a man of note both at home and abroad, and one to be preferred to <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a>, to <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>, to <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>, to the Antonines, to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, and to <a href=/people/11041 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, for the reason that, while they had various virtues, he had all combined and to a surpassing degree. He was made emperor after <a href=/people/3256 target=_blank>Tacitus</a> by the vote of all good men, and he ruled a world to which he had brought perfect peace by destroying barbarian tribes and by destroying also the very many pretenders who arose in his time, and about him it was said that he was worthy to be called <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a> even if that had not been his name. Many, indeed, declare that he was even foretold by the <a href=/people/12187 target=_blank>Sibylline books</a>, and had he but lived longer the world would contain no barbarians. 7 These statements about him I thought should be given in the life of others as a foretaste, lest the day, the hour, and the moment should put forth some claim against me because my fate is destined, and I should die without mention of <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a>. 8 Now, since I have for the time satisfied my zeal, I will bring this book to a close, believing that I have given satisfactory expression to my devotion and my desire. </p>                        </div>

Very many other things, too, turned purple. 4 Now the omens predicting his death were these: His father's tomb burst its doors asunder and opened of its own accord. His mother's shade appeared in the daytime as though alive to <a href=/people/3256 target=_blank>Tacitus</a> and to <a href=/people/11058 target=_blank>Florian</a> as well — it is said, indeed, that they had different fathers. All the gods in their private chapel fell down, overthrown either by an earthquake or by some mischance. 5 The statue of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, worshipped by them both, was found removed from the top of its pedestal and laid on a couch, all without the agency of any human hand. But to what end shall I proceed further? There are others to relate these things; let us save ourselves for <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a> and for <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a>' famous deeds. </p>                        </div>

May it prove happy, auspicious, of good omen, and to the welfare of the commonwealth and of the Roman world! The right of conferring the imperial power, of naming an emperor, and of entitling him Augustus has been restored to us. 3 To us, therefore, you will now refer all matters of importance. Every appeal shall now be made to the prefect of the city, but it shall come up to him from the proconsuls and the regular judges. 4 And herein, we believe, your authority also has been restored to its ancient condition, for this body is now supreme, and in recovering its own power it is preserving the rights of others as well. <br />5 Another letter: <br />From the most noble senate to the council of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/498066UCol class=ethnic long=6.644 lat=49.7597>Treviri</a>. We believe that you are rejoicing that you are free and have ever been free. The power to create the emperor has been restored to the senate, and at the same time the prefect of the city has been authorized to hear all appeals. <br />6 After the same manner letters were written to the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a>, of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Milan</a>, of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=place long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonica</a>, of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>, and of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. </p>                        </div>

Now at last it is fitting, my revered father, for you to be present in the most noble senate, and now to speak your opinion, for so greatly has the authority of that noble body increased that, now that the commonwealth has been restored to its ancient position, we name the princes, we create the emperors, we, in fine, give the Augusti their title. 2 Now look to it that you grow strong, ready to be present once more in the ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>Senate-house</a>.

We have obtained, revered sir, what we have always desired; the senate has been restored to its ancient position. We now create the emperors and in our body is vested every power. 4 All thanks to the Roman army, aye, Roman in truth!

To the wise a word is sufficient. <br />6 It would be too long to include all the letters that I have found and read. I will say only this much, that all the senators were so carried away by joy that they all in their houses sacrificed white victims, uncovered everywhere the portraits of their ancestors, sat arrayed in white garments, served more sumptuous banquets, and supposed that the ancient times had been restored. </p>                        </div>
