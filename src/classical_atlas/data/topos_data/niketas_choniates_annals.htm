In recording ancient events and customs, the narratives elucidate human nature and expose men of noble sentiments, those who nourish a natural love for the good, to varied experiences. In abasing evil and exalting the noble deed, they introduce us, for the most part, to the temperate and the intemperate who incline to one or the other of these two scales.</p>                        </div>

The same is true for those who, on the contrary, have led depraved lives. It is most fitting that the actions of the virtuous and the shameless be known to posterity. The soul moves on to Hades while the body returns to those elements from which it was constituted. <br />Whether the actions of a man during his lifetime were holy and righteous or lawless and contemptible, and whether he lived a happy life or gave up the ghost in evildoing, are proclaimed loudly by history. Wherefore, history can be called the book of the living and the written word a clarion trumpet, like a signal from heaven, raising up those long dead and setting them before the eyes of those who desire to see them.</p>                        </div>

Let no one be so mad as to believe that there is anything more pleasurable than history. Decrepit old men, more ancient than Tithonos and thrice a crow’s age, familiar with the record of the past, related these things to willing audiences, kindling the fires of their memories and ploughing the furrows of the past. He who loves learning, even though he be but an adolescent, proposes to do the same thing. <br />For these reasons, therefore, the events which occurred in my times and shortly before, deserving of narration and remembrance, and being of such a multitude and magnitude, I could not allow to pass in silence. <br />It is, then, by way of this history that I make these events known to future generations. <br />Since others are of the opinion — and I wholly agree — that in the narration of history they should eschew that which is obscure and distorted by discordant and prolix circumlocutions, and should cherish clarity as not only being in accord with the words of the sage but also as being appropriate to them, one shall not find that the events recorded herein fall short of that ideal. Nor have I in any way embraced an affected, recondite, and vulgar vocabulary, even though many are gaping in eager expectation for this; or perhaps it would be more truthful to say that they pass over ancient and contemporary events and bedeck lavishly whatever business suits their interests best. For the most part, however, when it is a matter of setting down in writing those things that are fitting, they choose not to overstep or overleap history’s proper limits. <br />Above all else, as I have said, the phrase which is not straightforward and easy to comprehend has been rejected, and that which is unadorned, natural, and absolutely unambiguous has been preferred and embraced. <br />This history, having truth as its sole objective, shuns rhetorical artifice and poetic storytelling as being diametrically opposed and disavows, moreover, their characteristics. Furthermore, even when History is composed with solemnity and reverence, she passionately desires to be the reward of diggers and of smiths covered with soot; she is also familiar with the armed company of Ares and is not captious with women who cultivate her; she rejoices at the most elegant of phrases and prefers to adorn herself, not with the pretentious and ostentatious, but with the cloth of plain and simple words. <br />This history, as far as is possible, will be treated with clarity and succinctness. If it lacks distinction and grace, I humbly request the forebearance of those into whose hands it may fall.</p>                        </div>

My work, then, is a continuation of their written record and is interwoven to resemble a channel whose waters flow from a single source or connecting links which are added to a chain that reaches into infinity. <br />This history will touch briefly upon the reign of John, who succeeded Alexios to the throne, but will not long dwell thereon as it will on succeeding events. Since I was not an eyewitness of that which I have recorded, I could not describe these events extensively but have set down what I heard from those contemporaries who personally knew the emperor and who escorted him on his campaigns against the enemy and accompanied him into battle.

Of all his children, Emperor Alexios favored John. Determined that John should succeed him to the throne, he gave him the red buskins and allowed him to be proclaimed emperor. The mother, Empress Irene, in opposition, threw her full influence on the side of her daughter Anna and lost no opportunity to calumniate their son John before her husband Alexios, mocking him as rash, pleasure loving, and weak in character. She continuously attempted to persuade the emperor to change his mind. Whenever the occasion allowed, she would heap extravagant praise on Bryennios, lauding him profusely as the most eloquent and no less capable of getting things done, as learned in the liberal arts which develop moral character and greatly assist those who are about to assume the reins of government in preserving the empire intact. Alexios, hearing these things and gware of Irene’s maternal affection for Anna, often pretended that his mind was preoccupied with matters of great urgency and would give the impression that he had not even heard the words. At other times, after deliberating on her exhortations, he would contend that he had not overlooked her petition. When he could stand no more, he would say, O woman, sharer of my bed and empire, will you not desist from admonishing me on behalf of your daughter, attempting thereby to dissolve praiseworthy harmony and good order as though you had been stricken by some God-sent madness? Put your trust in good fortune. Or rather come, let us take counsel together and see which of the former Roman emperors who had a son suited to take over the reins of government set him aside and chose instead his son-inlaw?

He was, beyond all others, a dissembler, deeming secretiveness a clever thing and never saying much about what he intended to do. <br />When Alexios approached the end of his life and lay in the splendid complex of the Monastery of Mangana, John, seeing his father at death’s door and his mother’s heart hardened against him, and his sister courting the empire, consulted with his relatives, chief among whom was his brother Isaakios, who supported his cause, as to the course of action to be taken. Undetected by his mother, he entered his father’s bedchamber and, while embracing him as though in mourning, secretly removed the signet ring from his finger. Some say that he did so at his father’s behest, which seems to be borne out by what shall be described shortly. <br />Immediately thereafter, John gathered together his counselors and, announcing the action taken, took up arms, mounted his charger, and hastened toward the Great Palace. Both the Monastery of Mangana and the streets of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>City</a> were crowded with his supporters, and the assembled citizenry, having heard rumors of the events taking place, acclaimed him emperor. <br />John’s mother, Empress Irene, was taken by surprise by the turn of events.

But when she saw that Bryennios did nothing, she approached her husband who lay prostrate on his bed and whose only sign of life was his gasping for breath. She threw herself over his body and cried aloud against their son, shedding tears even as a fountain of dark water, that while Alexios was still among the living, John was stealing the throne with acts of rebellion. Alexios, however, did not respond to her accusation, in all likelihood giving his thoughts to more serious matters, such as his imminent departure from this life, and directing his gaze upon the angels who would lead his soul to the next world. While the empress was pleading with Alexios, vehemently protesting their son’s actions, Alexios briefly forced a smile and raised his hands to heaven, perhaps rejoicing over the news and offering thanks to God, saying that it was but to mock and laugh at him that his wife should rant about his successor at a time his soul was taking leave of the body and when he should be atoning before God for whatever sins he may have committed. <br />The woman, convinced that her husband was gloating over her protestations, with all her hope denied, the victim of false promises, sighed deeply and spoke: “O husband, in life you excelled in all kinds of deceits, gilding your tongue with contradictory meaning, and even now as you are departing this life you remain unchanged from your former ways.” <br />When John reached the palace, he found the entrance barred to him by the guards, who were not satisfied with the display of the ring but demanded further evidence of his father’s wish that he should be allowed inside. John’s escort lifted the palace gates off their hinges with heavy bronze poles and threw them to the ground; then John entered with ease,</p>                        </div>

Promptly at dawn, the mother summoned John to join the funeral procession bearing his father’s body to the Monastery of Christ Philanthropes, built by the deceased. John refused to heed her bidding, not because he wished to spurn his mother’s authority or to show any disrespect for his father, but because he had not had sufficient time to secure the throne. He feared his rivals’ inordinate passion to seize power. Like an octopus clinging to the rocks, John hugged the palace, but he allowed most of his kinsmen with him to join in his father’s funeral procession. <br />A few days later, he permitted anyone who wished to do so to enter or leave the palace, since he was now in firm control of the government and administered the affairs of state according to his wishes. Conducting himself with fair-mindedness before his relatives and close friends who approached him, he bestowed on each suitable honors. He showed himself to be one in body and mind with his brother Isaakios, to whom he was devoted. Isaakios had proved his love beyond all others, having contributed the most to John’s accession to power.

A band of evil-working men, pledging good faith, rallied around Bryennios; because he had been educated in the liberal arts, displayed royal bearing, and was the most outstanding of those connected to the imperial family by marriage, they handed over the royal power to him.

The kaisarissa ’ s gold and silver, her wealth of all kinds, and her diverse garments, had been collected in one room. Emperor John, standing there and gazing upon them, said, above all else, “How the natural order of things has been inverted for me! Kinsmen have become the enemy, and strangers friends; it is only proper for this reason to turn these treasures over to friends.” He commanded them all to be taken by the grand domestic, who thanked the emperor for his great generosity and asked for permission to speak freely. His request granted, he said, “Even though your sister has resorted to violent and wholly unjust means, O Emperor, and has renounced by these deeds her family ties, she did not thereby cast off her name and kinship. She remains, after all, the sister of a virtuous emperor and by repentance will recover, thanks to the ties of blood, your affection, which she has now lost through madness. O Master, spare your sister who has offended your majesty and chastise her with your loving-kindness, for she has already confessed to having been utterly defeated by your virtue. Give her also these things which lie before our eyes, not as payment of a just debt, but as a voluntary gift. They are more rightly hers than mine, being a paternal inheritance bequeathed to offspring.” Persuaded by these words, or, more truthfully, shamed by them, the emperor eagerly granted the request, admitting, “I should be unworthy to rule should you be deemed more merciful than I towards my family and more above the temptation of excessive and easy gain.” He restored everything to the kaisarissa and John Komnenos was reconciled with her.</p>                        </div>

In the thick of battle the Patzinaks, inspired by necessity, resorted to the following base stratagem. After collecting all of their wagons and deploying them in a circle, they positioned a goodly number of their troops on them and fashioned a palisade.

His behavior on the battlefield gave witness to his great piety: whenever the Roman phalanxes were hard pressed by the enemy falling furiously upon them, he would look upon the icon of the Mother of God and, wailing loudly and gesturing pitifully, shed tears hotter than the sweat of battle. It was not in vain that he acted thus; donning the breastplate of the power from on high, he routed the Patzinak battalions just as Moses had turned back the troops of Amalek by raising his hands. <br />Taking with him his bodyguards, who were armed with long shields and single-edged axes, John went forth like an unbreakable wall to meet the Patzinaks.

The hidden cause of this dispute was the fact that Almos, the brother of Stephan, ruler of the Hungarians, had fled to the emperor and had been warmly received. The specious and ostensible cause was the charge that the inhabitants of Branicevo had attacked and plundered the Hungarians who had come to these parts to trade, perpetrating the worst crimes against them. <br />With the unexpected eruption of this evil, the emperor who happened to be sojourning in the vicinity of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421247PPhi class=place long=24.751 lat=42.1468>Philippopolis</a>, gave careful consideration to the problem and decided to remove the Hungarians from this area.

Recall Isaac who was second in birth to Ismael, Jacob coming forth from the maternal womb after Esau, Moses born after Aaron, David who was small among his brothers and the youngest in his father’s house, and many others. For God does not look at the outward appearance as man does, nor does he award public offices because of advanced years, as one devoted to grey hair and old age, but, rejoicing in the nobility of soul, he looks upon the meek and the gentle and upon him who keeps his commandments. Accordingly, therefore, conceding little to Nature, the arbiter, and shunning her ordinances like the counsels of a narrow-minded woman in matters of vital concern, I prefer instead to emulate God, who is above every respect of persons. <br />Were the rule to be transferred indisputably to my son Isaakios, who is the older, there would be no need for me to speak of the character of both my sons, but since the sovereignty has inclined towards my last-born Manuel, to turn aside the suspicions of many and the conviction of some that I have preferred to honor the youngest son above the elder on the basis of affection instead of virtue, I must explain the reasons. <br />The road of aspirations is not singular but branches off into numerous paths, as is the case with the human form, even though we humans have inherited the same nature.

Manuel communicated his views to his kin, the members of the senate, and the clergy; although many were nominated to the supreme high priesthood, the deciding and nearly unanimous vote went to the monk Michael from the Monastery of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/349249IOxe class=place long=24.9295 lat=34.9294>Oxeia</a>, who was both renowned for his virtue and erudite in our learning. 12s</p>                        </div>

Isaakios was irascible and for the slightest cause would inexplicably be impelled to inflict inordinate punishments on many. He nurtured, furthermore, an ignoble timidity, so much so that he was unmanly. His father John, the best of emperors, was deemed happy by all and of glorious and blessed memory for the added reason that he had rightly chosen Manuel to reign as emperor above Isaakios. <br />Because Mas'ud was plundering and laying waste the eastern provinces, Manuel set out against him [1144 or 1145]. When he came to Melangeia, he attacked the Turks in those parts; after he had directed the campaign for the recovery of Melangeia and stationed a garrison for her defense, he returned to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>queen of cities</a> stricken with pleuritis. <br />To wreak his vengeance against Raymond, prince of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, for harassing the cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> subject to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, Manuel dispatched an army and designated as commanders his nephews, the brothers John and <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a> Kontostephanos, and a certain Prosuch, who was not ignorant of military matters. He also dispatched long ships under the command of Demetrios Branas. <br />Once the beleaguered cities and fortresses in those parts were furnished with assistance, Manuel proposed forthwith to march against the Turks; they were already pressing on to take possession of the fortifications around Pithekas, and, invading the Thrakesian theme, they carried off everything in their path.

There he was struck in the flat of the foot by an arrow shot by a certain Turk overthrown by the emperor’s lance; as he fell backwards, the discharged arrow pierced the sole of Manuel’s foot. Manuel, who appeared awesome and daring to the enemy and more venturesome than his father John, did not choose to turn back, nor would he be persuaded by those who counseled him to consider returning home lest the Turks, in desperation, regroup and batter his forces. <br />Indeed, he rode on to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379325PIko class=place long=32.4921 lat=37.8728>Ikonion</a> with heightened enthusiasm. Mas'ud, who had departed, had set up camp at Taxara, the ancient Koloneia; one of his daughters, reportedly married to the emperor’s cousin, John Komnenos, the son of the sebastokrator Isaakios who, because of some trifling vexation against his uncle, Emperor John Komnenos, had fled and defected to Mas'ud, peered out from above the walls and delivered a persuasive defense on behalf of her father, the sultan.

Consequently, the emperor was not very attentive to her, but she shared in the honors, bodyguard, and remaining imperial splendors; in matters of the bed, however, she was wronged. For Manuel, being young and passionate, was wholly devoted to a dissolute and voluptuous life and given over to banqueting and reveling; whatever the flower of youth suggested and his vulgar passions prompted, that he did. Indulging in sexual intercourse without restraint and copulating undetected with many female partners, he unlawfully penetrated his kinswoman. And he was blemished by this disfiguring and unseemly action as warts or pustules of dull white leprosy sprout on the face mar a lovely countenance. <br />The emperor attended, nonetheless, to public affairs. He appointed John of Poutze procurator of the public taxes and grand commissioner and inspector of accounts, as his father and emperor had done before him when he was serving as protonotarios of the dromos, and he installed John Hagiotheodorites as chancellor, whose responsibility it was to carry out the imperial edicts. The latter was seen ever in the presence of the emperor and received his commandments and directives as though they were oracular pronouncements; as ministers of the written and spoken word he made use of many of the learned men who abounded at the imperial court, especially Theodore Styppeiotes, about whom we shall speak in the following. <br />John of Poutze was extremely clever in the matter of public affairs, a sly and oppressive tax collector, most exacting in the payment of existing taxes and without peer in inventing new ones.

That which was distressing and insufferable to the men of those days was the fact that there was no clear response forthcoming from him to a petitioner’s request, but he took great satisfaction in remaining silent; sometimes he would dismiss a supplicant without ever speaking to him. He was invested with so much power and authority from the emperor that he rejected and tore up whatever imperial edicts were not to his liking, while including others in the public registers. <br />Thanks to this man’s counsel, a measure for the common welfare and salutary for all the islands perpetuated by the former emperors was abolished by Emperor John with great harm. Whatever contributions were collected by ship-money levies and designated in the past for the fleet, he diverted into the treasury by the use of convincing arguments and very nearly scuttled the manned triremes provided on demand by the islands. <br />Arguing that the state and public did not always have need of the triremes and that the expenditures made on their behalf were a heavy annual burden, and that these funds, therefore, should be deposited in the treasury and that supplies and pay should be provided the navy by the imperial treasury only when needed, he appeared to be the best of men and an expert in the nature of public affairs — he who resorted to the pirate’s plot of throwing his captive overboard. By proposing such measures, he diverted the emperor from excessive expenditures and, in turn, the chancellor was pleased by the moderation of expenses. Now, as a result of this ill-advised policy or pennypinching, pirates rule the seas and the Roman maritime provinces are harassed by pirate ships, and the enemy gloats.

Realizing that his rank and influence might be transferred to another, his freedom of speech rescinded, and his power undermined in no time, and that others, raised to power by the emperor, might violently attack and subvert his position, he pulled down all proper limitations to his authority, and taking advantage of both time and circumstances clung to both and embraced them. Addressing one of his confidants with the words, “Come, let us enrich ourselves,” he became a completely different man; reversing forthwith his tactics, he devoted himself to unjust gain as no other man of that time. He looked cheerfully upon those who appeared before him and addressed them courteously as he inspected them most carefully to ascertain whether they carried any gold on their person. <br />Married to a woman from among the rejected and withered nobility, he lavished great wealth on his children, sufficient to indulge their pleasures. <br />But otherwise he was parsimonious, a niggard and a miser who never raised his eyelids to gaze upon the poor; he was attached to Wealth, which held him permanently fettered in unbreakable and indissoluble bonds, a virtual prisoner, just as Akrisios kept Danae long ago. Mean and stingy, he would often send comestibles that had been given to him to a shop to be sold: for example, he would return the huge and fat flat fish and bass which he had received as many as three different times, to be purchased as many times and in turn by others who had need of his services.

At this, he felt a craving to drink his fill of the sauce and munch on the stems of the greens. When one of his attendants by the name of Anzas remarked that he should curb his appetite, since he would find food to his liking prepared and set out for him at home, John, looking at him with a fierce and titanic gaze, insisted on satisfying his craving. Greedily grabbing the bowl containing the meal he coveted from the hands of the female vendor, he lowered his head with his mouth wide open, gulped down the juice in one draught, and gluttonously devoured the greens.

At this, the children were convulsed in laughter, and his companions ridiculed him and marveled that the skinflint should behave so niggardly even over such flimsy trifles. It was not surprising, therefore, that when this inordinate lover of money died, he was found to have storehouses teeming with money, even having secretarial pen cases engraved in colors. <br />The counsels of John Hagiotheodorites were crowned with success, yet the mercurial and capricious flow of events permitted the clever Theodore Styppeiotes to trip him up, as he was free to work with or against John.

Fortune, without even waiting for his leave-taking, removed herself to Styppeiotes, attaching herself to him, and, in a manner of speaking, gladly and most gracefully sang his praises as she promoted him from one office to another and exalted him from one glory to the next. Finally, she advanced Styppeiotes to the lofty dignity of keeper of the inkstand, where he enjoyed the devoted friendship of the emperor. While she lavishly bestowed many other preferments on him, she regarded Hagiotheodorites unfeelingly, so that he must even want for a morsel of bread. Nor did fickle Fortune alter or in any way change her decrees, but remained unusually constant and stood at Styppeiotes’ side. Henceforth, he administered public affairs as he wished, profoundly wise, prudent, pleasant in manner, and soaring in political judgment. He agreed to whatever the emperor commanded and commanded whatever the emperor wished. <br />At that time the emperor was free of unjust and base gain; he was a sea of munificence, an abyss of mercy, affable to the genial and unrivaled in imperial virtue, still possessing a guileless soul and an ingenuous disposition. As those who are advanced in years have reported to us, alluding to those celebrated golden years, they were like a swarm of buzzing bees flying out of a hollow rock and no different from the crowds who thronged about the agora as they would enter the imperial treasuries to receive the benefit of some largess; they pressed about the gates as the benefactions were distributed in turn, some pushing their way inside as others were prodded to leave. We, however, hear but a rumor. <br />The public treasuries, moreover, at that time were overflowing.

A hard driver of men, he governed the affairs of state imperiously, treating his ministers not as free men but as allotted slaves. He suspended the flow of munificence, not to say that he forced the flow backwards, and he justified its redistribution from time to time, not so much, I think, because he voluntarily chose to do so (for in things unknown it is necessary to give one the benefit of the doubt) as from the need not to pour out gold dust by the cupful, since his outlays were as expansive as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409115WTyr class=place long=11.5 lat=40.9>Tyrrhenian</a> Sea, as I shall demonstrate in the course of my history. <br />But while the emperor governed the empire in this fashion, a cloud of enemies, a dreadful and death-dealing pestilence, fell upon the Roman borders; I speak of the campaign of the Germans, joined by other kindred nations.

By knowingly committing these unlawful acts, they incensed the All-Seeing Eye, for cheating at the scales and for taking no pity on them as strangers, and for not even setting before them, as coreligionists, any of their own household stores, instead seizing from their throats that which was necessary to sustain the body. The worst of the inhabitants, especially those motivated by inhumanity, did not let down even the tiniest morsel but, drawing up the gold or silver, deposited the coins in their bosoms and disappeared, not to be seen again on the walls between the towers.

Sebastokrator Isaakios, Manuel’s blood brother, regarded him almost as a god, deeming whatever the patriarch enjoined as pleasing to God and desirable, and whatever he forbade as despised by God and to be abjured. The cabal of bishops at that time, who were adversaries of virtue and opponents of virtue’s champion, slandered him to the emperor as one who conspired to give the empire to his brother Isaakios, describing the sebastokrator ’ s overt visits to the patriarchal palace as clandestine and the conversations which took place, not in the dark recesses of the earth but with the sun as witness, as secret plots. <br />These men who were detractors of the patriarch accused him of seeking to depose Manuel from the throne by urging Isaakios to become emperor, and the strong-willed young Manuel became suspicious of his brother. Since as we know, Calumny defiles the sacred, and every man is inclined to do evil, the patriarch was deposed on the charge of conspiring with the monk Niphon.

Placed on trial, or rather standing condemned, he was asked about those things of which he knew not and ostracized [26 February 1147], Kosmas was filled with indignation, and, looking about the assembly, he cursed the empress’s womb so that it should not bear a son; he excommunicated certain officials around the emperor and also the synod that had gathered to depose him, saying that they licked the imperial boots and were toadies to important persons, and hence had ousted him from his throne and flock uncanonically and illegally. <br />Then Kontostephanos, one of those who surrounded the imperial throne and was in close touch with the emperor and could speak freely with him, was of the opinion that the latter would suffer grievously because the empress’s womb had been cursed. Alone of all those present, he responded immoderately to the zealot; seething with anger he approached the patriarch, intent on striking him down with his fist, but he managed to check his impulse. Nor did the emperor deem this to be a prudent act, but revealed in his complaints that he was sorely distressed by the incident. The emperor’s blood relations and the attending senate rebuked Kontostephanos for his impious conduct and for not shuddering at the earth which swallows up those who are guilty of such crimes. The patriarch replied in a gentle voice, “Let him be, inasmuch as he has not yet received his own stony fate,” speaking thus of his doom in riddles and enigmas. <br />Whether it was because of the father’s curse that the empress never heard herself called mother of a male child, made by God in honor of his servant, but bore only female children throughout her life, I am not</p>                        </div>

He excelled in generalship, was brave in hand-to-hand combat, and endowed with qualities of great leadership. The emperor, in idle occupation without purpose, became restless and did not wish to waste his days to no benefit, as happened in former times with Odysseus, the king of the Kephallenians, in the matter of the oxen belonging to Helios, so he boarded the flagship and reconnoitered the entire island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer class=place long=19.9156 lat=39.6063>Kerkyra</a>.

But these things pertain to an incredible and great deed of mythical origin. <br />Perplexed as to what to do in a ravine whose interior was both accessible and approachable, he proposed to set up a wooden scaling ladder fashioned in the shape of a tower on all sides. Planks used in shipbuilding were fitted together, and masts from large ships were joined with those which fell short of the necessary height that were braced by bands.

Although they were the first to have the courage to climb up, it was Poupakes [Abu-Bakr], the bodyguard of the grand domestic, who actually preceded them, wholly inspired by this task as he sprang forward, and not a few others zealously followed this example. The emperor was delighted with the eagerness demonstrated by all and their sudden rush, and setting apart those whom he had often seen toiling in battle and fighting stoutly, some four hundred in number, he ordered the rest to ascend after first delivering a long harangue and exhorting them on to brave deeds, with promises of rich rewards for them and their children. <br />“Should you survive,” said he, escaping this present danger, and give an excellent account of yourselves in the contest at hand, you will find me a provident father beyond expectation instead of master and emperor; should you lose your lives, winning honor for your fatherland and glory for yourselves, I shall not neglect your affairs, but I will so dispose of those things pertaining to your homes, children, and wives that they who survive must deem these fortunate and worthy of emulation, and this great solace will follow you down to Hades.

Being the most reckless and cunning of men, methodical in his ways and capable of extricating himself from dire straits, upon discovering an ancient underground passage beneath his cell (this was a tower built entirely of baked bricks), he secretly let himself down and cleared the entrance and exit, using his hands as a hoe or shovel, in such a way that the openings remained concealed. At dinner time, when the guards opened the cell doors and the prepared meal was brought inside, their guest was nowhere to be found. The guards searched the cell to see where the man of many wiles might have broken through or pierced the walls to make his escape.

As they could neither stop him nor change his mind, they streamed forth from the gates to meet him with a show of servile submission and prepared a triumphal procession adorning the boulevards and streets with furnishings, rugs, and decorations of fresh-cut sprays, and in the center of the city they planted a garden of delights filled with flowers, thus improvising a magnificent parade for him.

It was something to behold during this mock battle in one place a knight thrown on his head and shoulders, and in another place one knocked off his saddle, and one lying on his face, and another on his back, and still another who turned tail in headlong flight.

From this experience, many learned how great a virtue is forethought, and that afterthought is unprofitable and detrimental: it is better to put off an action for another day, when to do so brings salvation and glory, than to rush headlong to one’s death, even though this course may at first appear expedient.

The narration of these events as they happened is not, I trust, without profit, charm, and grace for most. <br />When Manuel’s German wife died [end of 1159 or beginning of 1160], he grieved bitterly, looking upon her demise as if a limb had been torn from his body, and his lamentation was like the roar of a lion. He honored her remains with a magnificent burial, celebrating the funeral rites in the paternal Monastery of the Pantokrator. But after concluding the prescribed period of mourning as if half-dead and sundered in twain, he contemplated a second marriage because he desired to hear himself called the father of a son. <br />Letters from emperors, kings and princes throughout the world, as well as matchmakers, came to him.

The latter, in turn, marched out against him, and they clashed in battle frequently [1155-60], After much blood was shed by both armies, victory smiled on Yaghi-Basan, and both adversaries laid down their arms for the time being [1161 CE]. Yaghi-Basan remained in his province, but the sultan went directly to the imperial city when he returned from the western regions and appealed to the emperor for help [spring 1162], Receiving him graciously, the emperor heaped honors upon him so that he was gladdened at the lavishness of the hospitality.

The earth shook, and many splendid dwellings collapsed, the atmospheric conditions were violent and unstable, and other such terrors took place so that one could not pay heed to the triumph, and the mind swooned. The clergy of the holy church, contended (and the emperor himself received their words as evil omens) that God was wroth and that under no circumstances would he tolerate an impious man to show himself and participate in a triumph adorned by all-hallowed furnishings and embellished by the likenesses of the saints and sanctified by the image of Christ. Thus, the triumph was thoughtlessly conceived, and neither did the emperor himself pay adequate attention to it, nor was proper regard paid to custom. <br />The sultan sojourned with the emperor for some time [80 days] and feasted his eyes on the horse races. Now, in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362BHiA class=place long=36.1717 lat=36.2269>Hippodrome</a> there was a tower which stood opposite the spectators; beneath it were the starting posts which opened into the racecourse through parallel arches and above were fixed four gilt-bronze horses, their necks somewhat curved as if they eyed each other as they raced round the last lap. At this time a certain descendant of Agar, who posed as a conjurer but who, as later events were to show, was the most wretched of men and no more than a suicide, ascended, announcing that he would fly through the stadium. He stood on the tower as though at a starting post, dressed in an extremely long, wide white robe, on which twisted withes, gathering the garment all around, made ample folds. It was the Agarene’s intention to unfurl the upper garment like the sail of a ship, thus enveloping the wind in its folds. <br />All eyes were turned on him.

The sultan, an observer of the unfolding drama, was dubious as to the outcome, he both throbbed with emotion and grinned, elated and at the same time fearful for his compatriot. Snapping at the air frequently and testing the wind, the Agarene mocked the hopes of the spectators. Many times he raised his arms, forming them into wings and beating the air as he poised himself for flight. When a fair and favorable wind arose, he flapped his arms like a bird in the belief that he could walk the air. But he was an even more wretched sky-runner than Ikaros. Instead of taking wing, he plummeted groundward like a solid mass pulled down by gravity. In the end, he plunged to the earth, and his life was snuffed out, his arms and legs and all the bones of his body shattered. <br />This abortive flight was bruited about by the citizens in mockery and ridicule of the Turks in the sultan’s retinue. They could not even pass through the agora without being laughed at as the silversmiths made loud noises by striking the iron tools of their benches. When the emperor was informed of these things, he was, in all probability, amused, knowing how the rabble was fond of gossip and play, but he humored the sultan (for as he gradually became aware of the coarse jests, his soul was sorely vexed) and pretended to restrict their freedom of speech. <br />After the display of admirable munificence, the sultan, who had skimmed off many splendid gifts from the imperial treasuries, before which he stood amazed, wondering if the emperor could possibly possess others of such number and magnitude, returned home laden and rejoicing. <br />Manuel, who knew that no barbarian is able to resist the temptation of gain, wished to magnify himself and to astound Kilij Arslan with the immense riches of the treasuries which overflowed on all sides of the Roman empire, and thus he displayed all the gifts which he proposed to</p>                        </div>

On entering the men’s apartments to which he had summoned the sultan, the emperor inquired if he wished to receive as gifts the contents of the treasury at hand.

The sultan, like a swollen torrent or a serpent which had devoured herbs, deluged and swept away everything before him and often swallowed up our fortresses, spitting out the venom of evil. The emperor, on the other hand, dammed up the main roads and stemmed the rising tide with an unbreakable wall of soldiers, or he lulled the serpent to sleep in peace with the enticement of seductive gold, and as it reared up to strike in pursuit of plunder and coiled its body to crush the army, he soothed and quieted it.</p>                        </div>

He sent Sulayman back to the sultan to set forth those things of which he was not ignorant and to taunt him for the untrustworthiness, faithlessness, and wickedness of his ways, and to warn him that should he not desist from these actions, he would suffer the vengeance of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. <br />Nonetheless, the sultan continued his customary forays for plunder. <br />With select troops he laid siege to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodikeia</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>, which was not as thickly peopled at that time as it is now, nor was it fortified by secure walls, but spilled out to the villages along the slopes of the mountains. He carried off large numbers of men and countless animals; furthermore, he slew no small number of men, among whom was the bishop Solomon, a eunuch who otherwise was gracious and elegant in manner and godlike in virtue. The sultan remarked to his intimates sarcastically that the more injuries he inflicted on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, the more treasures he received from the emperor. “It is customary,” he said, “for gifts to be gladly given to conquerors so that they should not desire to advance their conquests, just as festering diseases require numerous treatments so that they should not spread and increase further.”</p>                        </div>

The two commanders drew up their light troops into companies and led them forth. They decided that it would be better to attack the enemy by night and gave the troops the password “iron [sideron] to cry out when they engaged the Turks in the dark.

Geza [II], the ruler of the Hungarians, had two brothers, Istvan [IV] and Laszlo [II], and his two sons were Istvan [III] and Bela [III]. Istvan [IV] was forced to flee from the murderous clutches of his brother and reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a> [1154 CE], where he was welcomed with open arms by Emperor Manuel. There he received a multitude of gifts, and, moreover, he was married to Manuel’s niece Maria, the daughter of the sebastokrator Isaakios. Shortly afterwards [1158 CE] Laszlo [II], the third brother, following in the footsteps of Istvan [IV], defected to Manuel, not so much because Geza loved him less than he should or that he feared a plot on his brother’s part, but more because he was fascinated by Istvan’s fame. Neither was he disappointed in his expectations nor was he received by the emperor in a manner unworthy of his station, but all his objectives were realized. Had he so desired to take a wife, he could have married a woman of royal blood, but he refrained from marriage so that he should not forget to return to his country and thus bring ruin to his domestic affairs, enchanted by the spell of a wife. <br />But what happened? Geza, the king of the Hungarians, died [31 May 1162] and his death was a peaceful one; the taut strings of his mortal frame were slackened by nature, dissolving into those elements of which it was composed.</p>                        </div>

This event seemed to the emperor like a most beautiful flower sprung forth from an ugly root. He reflected that should the Hungarian satrapy pass over to his niece’s husband [Istvan IV], who obviously had a legitimate claim to the throne, glory would first redound upon him and afterwards the Roman empire and that as partial tribute he might receive undisputed and guaranteed possession of Frangochorion and Zevgminon. <br />Eagerly, Manuel acted to attain his objectives. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=demonym long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantine</a> envoys appointed to assist in Istvan’s [III] coronation set out to Hungary without delay; shortly thereafter Manuel arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427233USer class=place long=23.3283 lat=42.6975>Sardica</a>. When they first heard of these events, the Hungarians renounced Istvan [IV]. They took grave offence at the sound of his name and cited several reasons for repudiating him, in particular, his having taken a Roman wife; they deemed it disadvantageous to join with a man who was related to the emperor by marriage and feared that as Hungarians they would be governed by him as king while he was ruled by the emperor of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>.

He marched out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427233USer class=place long=23.3283 lat=42.6975>Sardica</a> and when he arrived in the region of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Danube</a> [Paristria] adjacent to Branicevo and Belgrade dispatched his nephew Alexios Kontostephanos with an armed force to Istvan. Once in control of Chramon, they did everything possible to secure the throne, winning over the most powerful of the Hungarians with gifts, seducing them with flattery, and inciting them with the greatest of promises; however, the only thing they achieved was that the Hungarians accepted Laszlo as their ruler.

But the emperor did not accept this turn of events meekly, and Geza’s brother Istvan [IV] was forever scheming to gain the throne. <br />As a result, many battles were fought, and when the emperor chose Geza’s son Bela [III] to be his daughter Maria’s husband [autumn 1163], the Hungarians who opposed Istvan [IV] uprooted and cut down the first shoots of his hopes, for they were intent on leaving behind the periodic and lengthy hostilities for which he was responsible. Having done with these matters, the Hungarians decided to get rid of the despicable Istvan [IV] by resorting to treachery. Agreed that poison was the best way of putting him to death, they searched for the right person to place the death-bringing cup in his hands. A certain attendant of Istvan named Thomas agreed to help them if they paid his price. This man who held out his hand for evil gain, was so sharp and quick in taking a man’s life and severing the body from the soul found another method to send Istvan more speedily on his way to Hades. In bleeding Istvan’s vein, he smeared with poison the bandage which covered the wound; from there it spread and diffused throughout the body and penetrated into the most vital parts and removed the man from life [13 April 1165], thereby clearly confirming the uncertain and cowardly devices of men. In vain some strive after goals and labor in their pursuits if God above does not give his blessing, approve of their actions, and direct their deliberations and steps. Thus did Istvan lie dead. His corpse was treated spitefully and denied funeral rites, and Zevgminon was surrendered to the Hungarians.

His manner of escape was as follows. He pretended to be ill and was provided with a young boy to attend to his physical needs, a foreigner who largely mispronounced our speech. <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a> knew that there was only one entrance into the prison. He instructed the boy to stealthily remove the keys to the tower gates when the guards, overcome with copious drink, were taking their daily nap and to make a wax impression of them so that the impress should be in every way identical to the original in shape and form. The lackey did as he was commanded and brought the wax impressions to <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a>. The latter directed the young attendant to present these to his son Manuel and to tell him that it was imperative that he forge keys from them as quickly as possible; moreover, he was to insert into the amphorae of wine which held his drink for his midday meals small ropes of twisted linen fibers and balls of thread, together with woolen yarn and slender cords. When these instructions were carried out, at a signal from <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a> the boy lifted the bars of the prison gates during the night, and the gates were thrown wide open without any trouble. Then <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a>, holding the cords in his hands, let himself down into the thick weeds growing high in the impassable parts of the palace grounds. During the second and third days he continued to escape the detection of his pursuers by hiding in the tall grass. Once they were satisfied with their search of the palace environs, <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a> made a ladder of wooden rungs and let himself down over the wall between the two towers. At a prearranged signal he boarded a boat pitching between the shore and the breakwaters found at intervals along the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>City</a>’s sea wall which dissipated the impact of the breaking waves.

But now ready Wit saved the resourceful man, cutting and gathering from her own garden fitting medicinal herbs to cure the ills of the times, just as David was preserved from danger in Geth by altering his appearance and beating on the drum and crazily jerking his legs.

When all were put into operation, discharged stones of a talent weight weakened the walls’ joints. <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a> took charge of a stonethrowing engine and by using the sling, winch, and screwpress, shook the section of the wall between the two towers violently.

Thus the irrational desire of the lawless lover who lusted madly after the woman was extinguished, since the cause was no more; and this truly wretched woman, who had been so passionately desired, was deprived of the gladdening light of life. Alas! How fateful the complexity of events and how vengeful and treacherous the Telchine who has produced such tragedies for the crowded theater. O, two contrary loves contesting for the same prize!

The mighty of the earth can be likened to lofty and tapering pine trees; just as these rustle when the sharp winds shake the needles of their branches, so do these rulers mistrust the man of wealth and cower before him who surpasses most in manly spirit. And should there exist someone endowed with the beauty of a statue and the lyrical eloquence of a nightingale in song, gifted, moreover, with ready wit, then the wearer of the crown can neither sleep nor rest, but his sleep is interrupted, his voluptuousness suppressed, his appetite for pleasure lost, and he is filled with grave apprehensions; with wicked tongue he curses the creator nature for fashioning others suitable to rule and for not making him the first and last and the fairest of men. Such rulers oppose providence and behave insolently toward the Deity. As victims they slay the best from among the people so that undisturbed they may waste and squander in luxury the public revenues as though they were their own private patrimony and treat free men as slaves and, at times, behave towards their most competent ministers as though they were purchased slaves.

It goes without saying that in eloquence and learning we excel the barbarians, and that being experienced and comprehending, we surpass them in generalship and stratagems. In previous clashes we have contended hotly with the Hungarians, invading and ravaging their land. Thus we shall now engage them in battle, and as though from habit we shall emerge victorious.

His standard, waving in the wind, was raised on a thick, high-reaching pole on wheels, pulled by four yoke of oxen. The enemy line, wholly constituted of lance-bearing cavalrymen, was truly a fearsome and terrifying sight. The men armed cap-a-pie, and it was a spectacle to behold the horses displaying fillets and cinches and wearing frontlets and breastplates as protection against missiles. The snorting of the horses and the sunlight flashing brilliantly in reflection from the weapons as the armies approached each other created a most unusual sight that inspired fear and wonderment on both sides. <br />Since the two opposing forces had closed the space that separated them, and it was midday, Kontostephanos deemed the time right for the battle to commence. He commanded the troops of both the right and left wings who were following close behind to cut down the barbarian rear guard and ordered the mounted archers to shoot uncommonly fast and thick. The purpose of the stratagem was to break up or to repel the compact Hungarian ranks; it was a battle out of Homer that day, “buckler pressed on buckler, helm on helm, and man on man ,” the horses were head to head, “the battle, that brings death to mortals, bristled with spears ,” and the armies swayed back and forth like an undulating serpent rattling its scales.

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, taking hold of their iron maces (it was their custom to carry this weapon into battle), smote the Hungarians, and the blow against head and face was fatal.</p>                        </div>

To the wonderment of all, on both sides of the route along which the triumph was to pass, standing side by side, were platforms raised to two and three stories, and the rooftops above all were crammed with spectators. When the time came for the emperor to join the triumphal procession, he was preceded by a gilded silver chariot drawn by four horses as white as snowflakes, and ensconced on it was the icon of the Mother of God, the invincible ally and unconquerable fellow general of the emperor. The axle did not creak loudly, for it did not carry the dreadful goddess, the pseudo-Virgin Athena, but the true Virgin, who, beyond understanding, bore the Word through the word.

When he saw that the emperor was in pursuit, he showed himself in battle but briefly and then hid in the cover of mountain caves which he sealed with stones. At last his pride was shattered, and he prostrated himself at Manuel’s feet. Lying outstretched, mighty in his mightiness, he pleaded that he not be made to suffer cruelly; he was anguished lest he be removed as sovereign over the Serbs and political power be transferred to those who were more fit to rule, those whom he had pulled down so that he might seize power. <br />Thus did Manuel deal with Nemanja and prevail upon him to make a pledge of good faith: whenever he observed him straying from the straight and narrow, or acting independently, or entering into an alliance with the king of the Germans, or inclining towards the Hungarians and sharing a common purse and pouch with them, he was more diligent than a shepherd guarding a small flock. And Nemanja feared Manuel more than the wild animals fear the king of beasts; often Manuel led out only the cavalry and commanding his bodyguards, “Follow me,” crossed the Roman borders and rode against Nemanja at full tilt, restoring conditions in these parts according to his own design. <br />What followed these events?

He spoke with the king and finally convinced him, after pressing him strongly, to lead out his troops and deploy them along the entire wall and, when this action was successfully accomplished, to throw up ladders and have his men scale them. Amalric lauded <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a>’s words and apotheosized him for his excellent strategy, but swearing an oath on Christ’s tomb, he contended that he would not undertake the task unless wooden towers were constructed first to be placed along the walls.

Observing these things, <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a> was vexed. The army’s provisions were short; some of the troops had no money with which to purchase the necessities of life and were threatened with death by starvation, while the rest were indignant because, not having their own market, they were compelled to pay exorbitant sums to the king’s grain merchants in return for meager foodstuffs.

Let our narrative proceed and record each event in its proper place and time. <br />Since the sultan [Kilij Arslan II] would not embrace peace, for it was inimical to his enrichment, whereas it was always most profitable to have his Turks pour over the Roman borders, the emperor once again marched out against him. He would not allow the Turkish ruler to sleep, but, as though prodding a ravening beast, he maddened him, roused him from his lair, and provoked him into battle. Indeed, neither armistices nor truces, compacts, treaties, nor the negotiations of envoys could prevent or stave off mutual attacks, for both sides were prone to hot and reckless acts. Eager for warfare, they marched against each other on the slightest pretext; their chief business was to strip off suits of armor, assemble troops, fall to, and exchange blows. The two rulers differed from one another in this way: the sultan appeared always to be deliberate and to exercise forethought, reflecting carefully on his actions and cautiously winding up the skein of battle through his commanders (no one ever saw him standing in the front line of a phalanx or sharing in his soldiers’ toil); the emperor, on the other hand, was courageous by nature, reckless in battle, and daring in the deeds worked by his hand, and when the report came that the enemy had made one of its frequent incursions,</p>                        </div>

He reckoned that it was no small wonder that the Sultan should be unaware of the march on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398305UDor class=place long=30.529 lat=39.784>Dorylaion</a> and should feign to be unaware of the reason. <br />Since it was imperative to rebuild the city, Manuel, the first man to carry stones on his back, set the manly example for others to follow. Thus the walls were raised with great speed, the palisade was thrown up outside, and wells were excavated inside for drawing up an abundant water supply. <br />The Turks knew that they would be in danger should they be forced to abandon the fertile plains of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398305UDor class=place long=30.529 lat=39.784>Dorylaion</a> on which their herds of goats and cattle grazed, romping in the verdant meadows, and should the city be restored with a Roman phalanx installed as a garrison.

Guarding against their forays in search of food, they prevented them from gathering wood and slew those they took captive. The emperor easily surmounted this obstacle. At the exact moment when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who were charged with collecting the necessities sallied forth, he gave the command for the sounding of the trumpet, issued first from the entrenched camp, and led the way. Never leaving the side of those in search of provisions, not even briefly, he sometimes would not return to camp until late afternoon or evening. Because he was intent on carrying the war to the Turks, they were unremittingly begrimed with dust in their flight and set fire to the crops and burned their tents so that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> should not succeed in securing supplies.</p>                        </div>

The Turk spurs his horse again and again, and as its legs quickly strike the ground it is furiously swept along; the Turk, holding the arrow in his hands, discharges it from behind and slays the foe who is rushing to reach him by meeting him first, thus overthrowing his enemy about to overtake him, and suddenly the pursued becomes the pursuer. <br />When the emperor had rebuilt <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398305UDor class=place long=30.529 lat=39.784>Dorylaion</a> and had taken every safeguard for its defense, he departed and went to Souvleon which he resorted and garrisoned.

This place is a far-stretching defile with mountain passes that descends gently the steep northern slope to the hills below, opening up into broad ravines and then dropping down on the other side to jutting rocks and precipitous, beetling cliffs. <br />It appears that Manuel took no precautions on behalf of the army when he set out on such a path. He neither lightened the loads of the pack animals nor did he put aside the wagons carrying the siege engines, nor did he attempt to rout the Turks in advance from the overgrown mountain passes with a company of his light troops, thus smoothing the way for the army. After making his way over the open plains, he elected to be pressed in by this narrow defile, even though he had been forewarned.

Following these came the right wing, led by Baldwin, the brother of the emperor’s wife, while Theodore Mavrozomes commanded the left wing. Next came the pack animals, the camp menials, and the wagons carrying the siege engines. Then came the emperor himself with his picked troops, followed by <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a> Kontostephanos as the rear guard. <br />The troops about Angelos’s sons, Makrodoukas and Lapardas, passed through the rough terrain without injury, for the infantry, sent on ahead, startled the. barbarians, dislodging them from the hills below the mountain where they had been posted to give battle,</p>                        </div>

Perhaps the troops who followed would have passed safely through the Turkish melee also had they only closed ranks with, the companies who had preceded them and used their archers to repel the onslaughts of the attacking Turks, but they neglected to maintain closed ranks, allowing the superior number of Turks swarming down the hill sides from the higher ground to scatter the troops and engage them in a most reckless manner. The Turks routed Baldwin’s men, wounded many, and slew not a few. Thereupon, Baldwin, seeing that his troops were in a sorry plight, too weak to break through the enemy’s ranks and escape, and pressed hard on all sides, gathered certain of his knights and rode through the Turkish phalanxes, but, surrounded by the enemy, he was slain. All his companions fell with him, displaying desperate courage in their daring and noble deeds. <br />Elated by their success, the barbarians closed all avenues of escape to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, who, pressed closely together, were unable to move through the mountain pass.

After proceeding a short distance, however, his advance was again barred by the Turks as well as impeded by the corpses of the fallen which lay about in the open in heaps, obstructing the roads. Crossing over the rugged terrain and the swollen mountain stream flowing nearby, and treading on the carcasses and riding over them, he collected another band of Roman soldiers who came running when they saw him. When he looked up he espied his niece’s husband, John Kantakouzenos, one man hotly contending against many, bravely pressing his attack while looking about to see if anyone was coming to his aid. A short time afterwards, the emperor saw him fall and despoiled because no one had come to his defense. <br />When the Turks who had slain Kantakouzenos saw the emperor passing by (for it was impossible to escape their notice), they formed into a band and set upon him as though in pursuit of great prey; they were undecided whether to take him captive or to kill him.

A certain man standing nearby who showed himself to be rash and impudent, more unpleasant than these troubled times, unblushingly commented: “Get along with you, O Emperor, this is certainly not so, oh no! This is not the first time; often in the past you have drunk unto intoxication from a wholly unmixed wine bowl of Christian blood, stripping and gleaning your subjects.” The emperor cheerfully suffered this accusing and abusive man as though he had not heard him or as one who had no reproofs in his mouth. <br />When the emperor saw the Turks ripping open the moneybags of the treasury and seizing the gold and silver coin strewn on the ground, he exhorted the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> around him to fall on the barbarians and take possession of the monies to which they had a greater right than did the Turks.

On being received by the emperor, Gabras rendered a profound obeisance in the barbarian fashion, and at the same time presented as a gift from the sultan a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380582UNis class=demonym long=58.21 lat=37.9511>Nisaean</a> horse with silver-mounted bridle from among those horses kept at rack and manger for use in solemn processions, and he also presented a long, two-edged sword. As he initiated the discussion of peace terms, using soft words, he mollified the emperor’s evident discomfiture, soothing his raging passion as though the words he whispered into his ears were enchantments. Gabras observed the yellowish appearance of the surcoat over the emperor’s coat of mail and remarked, “This is not an auspicious color, O Emperor, but in the hour of warfare it very much militates against good fortune.” Manuel, forcing a brief smile at these words, removed the surcoat embroidered with purple and gold and presented it to Gabras. He then accepted the horse and sword, had the treaties drawn up, and set his hand to them. Time would not permit certain articles to be spelled out precisely, but it was stipulated that the fortresses of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398305UDor class=place long=30.529 lat=39.784>Dorylaion</a> and Souvleon were to be demolished. <br />Now that Manuel found the barbarian to be speaking truthfully on behalf of peace and not disposed to devising deceitful stratagems, he requested that he might depart by a route other than the road he had taken earlier</p>                        </div>

But the guides led him over the original route rather than over another so that he should see the horrible spectacle with his own eyes. Indeed, the sight was worthy of tears, or, more accurately, the magnitude of the evil was too great for tears. The ravines were leveled with corpses, while the hollows rose up to become sepulchral mounds and the groves were hidden. The slain had had their scalps torn from their heads, and the phalluses of many had been cut off. It was said that the Turks took these measures so that the circumcised could not be distinguished from the uncircumcised and the victory therefore disputed and contested since many had fallen on both sides. No one passed by on the opposite side 5iy without bursting into tears and calling by name his slain companions and close friends. <br />At this point in the narrative I can now say that it is difficult to protect mankind from the future and that none can deliver us easily from the events which overtake us except the Deity, who, through our supplications, takes pity and turns aside the perils, or shakes the cup and thereby blends the unmixed wine and dilutes the pure wine because of his love for mankind.

The day on which he set out on his dangerous march, a certain man, an interpreter, and a Roman by race, whose surname was Mavropoulos, came to him and related that he dreamed he entered a church named after [Saint] Cyrus, and as he was making a propitiatory offering he heard a voice coming from the icon of the Mother of God saying, “The emperor is now in the utmost danger,”</p>                        </div>

The entire Turkish forces did not escort the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> through the nearly impenetrable terrain, but rather they sporadically followed close upon them in bands, and thus the chiefs and the majority of their soldiers returned home laden with the spoils of war.

Vatatzes’ officers, at the head of the forces provided by the emperor together with those they collected along the way, hurriedly made their way to the fortresses of Hyelion and Leimmocheir where, in olden times, a bridge spanned the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376275WMae class=place long=27.4713 lat=37.622>Maeander</a> River. <br />Because the scouts whom Vatatzes had placed, along all the roads leading there reported that the Turks had turned back and were no longer forging ahead, the commander divided the army into two sections and deployed the greater part as ambushes along the roads the enemy was to traverse. <br />Then he stationed the remainder along the old bridge with orders to wait until a portion of the Turks had crossed over and then to meet them courageously and without fear. <br />While Vatatzes, having deemed this plan the best tactic, deployed his troops accordingly; the Turks crossed over and, pelted by missiles cast from the higher ground, tumbled into the river and drowned.

As the siege was protracted, with the enemy prolonging their investment, the Anconians laid hands on strange foods and unaccustomed fare, like those who choose to run after banquets but feed on bread. <br />The emperor’s envoys convened an assembly of the people to inquire whether they might bring in assistance. The people replied that it was permissible, but, as was obvious, they did not have an abundance of money. The envoys assured them, calling upon God as their witness, that the emperor would defray all expenses. They were urged not to delay, else the worst would be guaranteed at the hands of those who would take the city: the abduction of childen and women, and the plunder of monies and possessions. Thereupon the city sent for a certain Count William [of Marchisella] by name and a certain noblewoman [Aldruda Frangipane, countess of Bertinoro] who, recently deprived of her husband by Death, had inherited her husband’s family power and authority. Once the people had agreed to make bountiful payments to these two, the enemy was beaten off with ease, and the citizens rejoiced over the recovery of their liberty as if their city had swum to the surface from the bottom of the sea. The emperor had good cause to be gladdened by these events; he heaped praise upon the Anconians and, admitting them to the same civic rights enjoyed by Roman citizens, he promised to provide them with whatever legitimate and practicable needs they might request. He also sent ever-increasing sums of gold. <br />Thus was concluded the affair of the Anconians, who were disposed to remain steadfast in their loyalty, rather than to change their minds with every turn of the wheel of fortune. One might be perplexed as to the reason why they thrust aside the demands of a neighboring monarch who was more deserving of leading them, as was the king of the Germans, and favored the Roman emperor, who held sway over much of the visible earth and shadowy mountains, were it not for their innate consciousness of right-doing which remained undaunted and ardent in the face of</p>                        </div>

This emperor, pouring into the treasuries the so-called gifts of the paroikov like water into a cistern, sated the thirst of the armies by the payment of provision money and thereby abused a tactic begun by former emperors and rarely resorted to by those who had frequently thrashed the enemy. <br />He was not aware that he was enfeebling the troops by pouring countless sums of money into idle bellies and mismanaging the Roman provinces. The brave soldiers lost interest in distinguishing themselves in the face of danger, as no one any longer spurred them on to perform glorious exploits, and now the concern of all was to become wealthy.

Others considered the saying “greater” to apply to the Logos, not only in his nature and essence but also because of the extreme kenosis m and humiliation of his incarnation. Still others piously accepted other interpretations, but Manuel, I know not on what grounds, rejected these as not adequately addressing the issue and gave his own definition. <br />He convened a synod, assembling all those who were learned in the divine doctrines, and exhorted everyone to suscribe to the dogmatic tome, laying down this definition: “I concur with the teachings of the God-bearing Fathers pertaining to “my Father is greater than I,” and I affirm that this saying refers to his created and passible flesh.” <br />I do not know how they designated the flesh-bearing Son as being inferior to the Father, for if indeed he was divested of his equality because he assumed human nature and dwelt among us, he would not thus have been able to preserve his own glory confined by the limitations of kenosis; or had he not deified and exalted that which had been abased by rendering it a partaker of his glorification by way of the union [of the two natures], he himself in turn would have been abased, which would be absurd. <br />Emblazing this doctrine in red letters, as though with a flaming sword, Manuel threatened anyone who impulsively dared to scrutinize it with expulsion from the faith and death, especially anyone who grumblingly attacked it.

While ours was a wicked and adulterous generation, we were fortunate to have such a good man. When the emperor [Manuel], newly crowned as successor to his father’s throne, passed through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378293UKol class=place long=29.26 lat=37.7875>Chonai</a> on his way from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a> and entered the Church of the Archangel [Michael], he had been blessed by the hand of this bishop. The latter was celebrated because of his virtue and his fame was spread far and wide. <br />The clergy and of these the most astute doubted whether Manuel, a mere youth with the first growth of down on his cheeks, would really be able to govern the empire, which very much needed a man with shaggy beard, grown hoary in prudence, and, moreover, whether he could overthrow his brother Isaakios, who had a more lawful claim to the throne and was ensconced in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>queen of cities</a>.

When the controversy over the above-mentioned doctrine was initiated and the emperor recklessly contended for the first time that the god glorified by Muhammad as holosphyros, who is neither begotten nor begets, is the true God, everyone agreed that this was the fulfillment of the prophecy because this doctrine, being wholly the opposite of the truth, was truly and absolutely the worst kind of madness. <br />The emperor first took ill before the month of March in the then current thirteenth indiction [1 September to August 1180], at the time the doctrinal issue was emerging. The controversy was resolved around the month of May, and with the coming of September the emperor came to the end of his life. He had achieved nothing very notable for the empire and had made no provisions or arrangements for events following his death because he in no way would accept that death was near, for he contended that he had certain knowledge that another fourteen years of life was to be freely given him. The wise and thrice-blessed Patriarch Theodosios advised him to take thought, as a father, of the affairs of state while he was still in possession of his faculties and to search for someone who should steadfastly cleave to his son, the successor to the throne who had not yet reached puberty, one who should be as devoted to the emperor as to his own mother.

The emperor sought caves and hollows as protection against the winds and prepared them for habitation; he removed the glass from the imperial buildings so that they should not be damaged by the blasts of the winds while his attendants, kinsmen, and sycophants also anxiously involved themselves in these undertakings, with some burrowing into the earth like ants and others making tents, fastening them with threefold cords and cutting sharp pegs to serve as supports. <br />But, as I was saying, as the symptoms of the emperor’s disease worsened, he rashly made use of the bathing room; there, he saw that, like the water, his hopes for continued life were being washed away. He briefly discussed his son Alexios with those in attendance, and, foreseeing the events that would follow his death, he intermixed his words with lamentations. <br />On the advice of the patriarch, he renounced his earlier trust in astrology. <br />Finally, placing his hand on an artery to take his own pulse, he sighed deeply, struck his thigh with his hand, and asked for the monastic habit. <br />As was to be expected, these words raised a confused clamor.

To the side, resting on a base, was a slab of red marble the length of a man which received veneration; it was formerly located in the church of [St. John the Evangelist] <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesos</a> and was commonly reported to be that on which Christ was washed with myrrh and wrapped in burial linen clothes after he had been taken down from the cross. This emperor had it taken out of the church, and, placing it on his back, he carried it up from the harbor of Boukoleon to the church in the lighthouse of the palace [Pharos] as though it were the actual body of God conveying its grace on him. Not long after the emperor’s death, the marble slab was removed from the palace to the place described above with proclamations, I believe, that declared loudly all the feats for which he who lay silent in the tomb had labored and struggled so hard to achieve.</p>                        </div>

The enemy forces in the open court of the Augousteon, thrown into confusion and pressed hard by the kaisar's first assault, poured out of the entrances; many of the imperial troops were wounded, and one was run through by the sword and killed.

With the coming of night, the kaisar and his wife left the temple and came to the Great Palace where the rulers resided. <br />Thus ended the affair concerning the kaisar and the causes for which this inglorious war began, bringing down upon us divine retribution for the sacrilege perpetrated in the holy temple.

How much more then should God-fearing Christians pay honor to this most beautiful and holy temple which the hands of God have truly constructed and fashioned into an inimitable work of art from beginning to end, a veritable heavenly orb upon the earth. <br />The protosebastos was very angry with Patriarch Theodosios for ardently opposing his purposes and thwarting his designs.

The protosebastos now was able to gratify his anger by expelling the holy man from the sacred palace and confining him to the Pantepoptes monastery. He pondered diverse courses of action and wrestled with many ideas, meeting with the most wicked members of the senate and consulting those clerics who feared neither the vengeance of God nor the wrath of men as to how this holy man might plausibly and speciously be ousted. But he failed to achieve his aim, and no cause whatsoever could be found to justify the patriarch’s deposition. Moreover, the empress and almost all, if not all, of the emperor’s blood relations revered the man enormously.

So that the sunlight, so welcomed by other men, should not force open his eyes because of its brightness, he darkened his bedroom with opaque curtains and made the darkness his secret place whenever dealing with important matters.

After giving a great deal of thought to the many ways in which he might escape, <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a> Lapardas, like a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconian</a> hound in hot pursuit, found one salutary path that would lead him away from the countenance and power of <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a>, and he would have preserved himself from injury had he persisted in this design and had not ventured on another course of action. With a passionate desire to punish <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a> and avenge the crime against his lord and emperor, he dared to revolt. He knew that the West would not come over to his side nor be willing to take up and continue the battle against <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a> because of the presence of his fellow general Branas. Thus he set his eyes on the East, where he was better known because there he had often exercised the highest commands, and that was, moreover, the breeding ground of eager champions of resistance.</p>                        </div>

Emulously vying with those present, <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a> boasted that he was supremely skilled in the art of taking cities. On the one hand, he positioned the siege engines, carefully examined the sling, secured both the withy end and the crank handle, and reinforced the battering ram with iron; the defenders, on the other hand, leapt forth from the city’s hidden posterns, put the torch to the war engines, and smashed them by hand; when similar engines were moved up to the walls, they demolished them like the threads of a spider’s web. When <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a> saw all his deliberations brought to naught, he contrived an inhuman deed which had been executed a few times in the past by both besiegers and besieged. <br />Euphrosyne [Kastamonitissa], the mother of Isaakios Angelos, was brought from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantion</a>. <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a> proposed at first to use her as a shield for the siege engines, but instead he placed her on top of the battering ram as though it were a carriage and moved the engines of war up to the walls. One could not but both weep and marvel at such a spectacle — weep because this strange sight was the cause of fury compounded by the fact that the perpetrators shrank not from an act so incredible and alien to human nature — and marvel that the frail woman, seated on top of the engines of war and hauled to the city’s walls, had not died of fright. For the first time, mortals were to see soft feminine flesh become a bulwark for iron, exchanging its function for a dissimilar one, the fragile human frame projecting out from the hard engines of war to prevent metal from smashing against metal, the human body giving cover to iron. The defenders discharged their missiles from the walls as before, but with great care, so as to wound and strike down the attackers while preserving the noblewoman from all bodily harm; it was as though by gesturing with her hands and nodding, she deflected the missiles away from herself and transfixed them in the hearts of the enemy.

In the measure that he often measured out, punishment was measured out to him in return, but compacted, pressed down, and running over, and he obligingly fell into the pit that he had often dug for his neighbors (I praise thee, O Justice!) and rolled over himself the stone he had many times heaved against his next of kin. <br />When one of his relatives informed against him to <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a>,</p>                        </div>

This event united the people even more and brought those who earlier mumbled against <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a> but hesitated to do anything that might expose them to danger wholeheartedly into the enemy camp. They were now seen bearing swords and shields and fenced with long coats of mail, but the majority were armed with clubs and with wooden beams taken from workshops.

Only a few of them were ready to follow his call for action, and so he took direct charge of the battle. Taking hold of a bow, he sent his arrows against the attackers from the embrasures of the highest tower, called Kentenarion. He soon realized that he was attempting to accomplish the impossible and spoke to the people through a messenger. He agreed to lay aside his crown and deliver it over to his son Manuel, hoping to still the tumult and to ward off the danger at hand.

Entering the armories, they removed countless weapons.

In it they gathered many demoniacs of both races; with crossed and bloodshot eyes, hair dishevelled, and with precisely all the other symptoms demonstrated by those possessed by demons, they were instructed to say in their ravings that the God of the race of the Bulgars and Vlachs had consented to their freedom and assented that they should shake off after so long a time the yoke from their neck; and in support of this cause, Demetrios, the Martyr for Christ, would abandon the metropolis of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=place long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessaloniki</a> and his church there and the customary haunts of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and come over to them to be their helper and assistant in their forthcoming task.

The emperor gathered together those of the monks who go barefoot and couch on the ground and brought down those who live on pillars, suspended above the earth; but while he prayed through them to God to bring an end to the civil war and not to allow the sovereignty to pass over, or to fly off, to another, he himself neglected to make preparations for battle, resting all his hopes on the panoply of the Spirit. Conrad, on the other hand, acting as the crab to the mussel, would often awaken him from sleep and prod him to rise up, persuading him not to rest all his hopes in these mendicants. He counseled the emperor to attend to the troops, to employ the heavy infantry against the rebel, that is, not only the arms on the right hand, which is the assistance of holy men, but also that on the left, which is the armor strengthened by sword and breastplate. He admonished him, moreover, not to be sparing of money but to spend it freely to raise troops because, with the exception of the emperor’s blood relations and those whose residences were in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>City</a>, everyone else had submitted to Branas, and it was not possible to bring in a military force from the outside. <br />Prodded continually by the kaisar’s words as though by an ox-goad, the emperor woke from his torpor, threw off his apathy, and began to collect an auxiliary force.

He was Branas’s worst enemy, and realizing what evil would befall him should Branas prevail, he revealed all his substance to the emperor and allowed him to take as much as he wanted, for he deemed it better to part with all his possessions on behalf of an emperor who was his friend and kinsman, and to receive in return much more gratitude should he emerge victorious, than to have his properties fill the coffers of a stranger, implacable and hardhearted in his hostility, to his own derision and the former’s great amusement.

When the sun was ablaze in the zenith and the signal for battle was given, Conrad, with his purple-dyed emblem imprinted on his and his troops’ arms, was first to move. He fought then without a shield, and in lieu of a coat of mail he wore a woven linen fabric that had been steeped in a strong brine of wine and folded many times.

With about two thousand of his best well-armed horsemen, he decided to proceed by night to the vicinity of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421247PPhi class=place long=24.751 lat=42.1468>Philippopolis</a> and immediately to take up positions of ambush in the hills for the purpose of attacking the food train at dawn [c. November 1189], While he was engaged in this maneuver, as though divinely inspired, he commanded the impedimenta, the soldiers’ attendants, and the remainder of the army to depart thence with us. <br />Dawn had not yet smiled when the Germans who had learned the prostrator’ s design from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a> inside the fortress of Prousenos (for the king’s army was encamped there), more than five thousand men, all clad in full armor, set out posthaste from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421247PPhi class=place long=24.751 lat=42.1468>Philippopolis</a> to attack us. <br />They escaped the detection of our scouts and advance guards and did not encounter the protostrator’ s picked troops. The protostrator, traversing the mountain approaches where there were villages still heavily stocked with provisions and taking cover in the hills, was not visible to the prey; the Germans, on the other hand, confidently traveled the route leading to the Roman camp over a smooth plain.

When he saw that the king had again postponed his crossing until spring because of the arrival of winter (it was the month of November when these things took place), he reverted back to his original designs and wrote a letter in which he prophesied to the king, an activity not befitting an emperor, that he would be dead before the holy days of Easter. <br />I omit what was said between the emperor and myself, which was deserving more of condemnation than of praise, and say only that he was finally persuaded to allow the envoys to return to the king.

Unable to resist the emperor and to remain safe at home, they entombed themselves in holes and corners of others’ homes until the king had passed to the East. Furious, the emperor dispatched secretaries as hostages in lieu of the judges of the velum. The possessions and dwellings of those who defied him he handed over to his favorites, and he appointed other judges. Afterwards, he recognized that their action had been motivated, not by disobedience, but by legitimate fear. He then returned the properties to their owners and restored these men to their former judicial dignities.

The majority of those wicked men were destroyed miserably, while the others saved themselves by scattering. <br />We were able to confirm the great number of the fallen by the testimonies of the enemy; a certain Ismaelite, who was present at this battle, on hastening to the emperor and taking an oath on his own religion, attested that he had paid two hundred silver staters to have removed the corpses of those slain in his garden. <br />The Germans, having taken <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379325PIko class=place long=32.4921 lat=37.8728>Ikonion</a> [18 May 1190], did not enter inside but encamped on the outskirts of the city, pitching their tents on the housetops.

When he was about to be tonsured a monk against his will, he did not ask for a loaf of bread, a sponge, and a lyre as did a certain individual of old when he was sorely tried by a bitter and cruel fate: bread to restore the tone of his human frame, weakened by lack of food; the lyre to accompany him as he sang plaintively of his misfortunes; the sponge to wipe away the stream of tears flowing from his eyes as though from a hollow rock.

(They saw that to oppose the dictates of Constantine would not have been without danger and physical harm to themselves, for he was irascible towards the generals who stood before him, and those who did not abide by his decisions suffered his bared sword.) By their present action, they pointed out, they had demonstrated to the emperor the proof of their loyalty. The emperor saw through the subterfuges and specious excuses of these untrustworthy men, but he praised their action, nonetheless, because it was advantageous to him; he did not openly punish any of the accomplices of Constantine, whom he blinded. <br />So greatly did the Vlachs rejoice, and Peter and Asan exult, over the fate of Constantine that they spoke of making Isaakios emperor over their own nation, for he could not have benefited the Vlachs more than by gouging out Constantine’s eyes.

I know not whence and how they arrived at such elaborately worked-out conclusions. <br />The Vlachs, therefore, set out with a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=demonym long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cuman</a> battalion to sack a fortress, plunder villages, or lay waste cities.

For he was unable to complete many circuits around the track of virtue; as soon as he began to tire, the intensity of his efforts flagged and his praiseworthy intention was wholly enervated. Transferring the bridle and reins of the empire from one official to another so that he might avoid the weighty responsibility of governing the state, he finally handed over the conduct and administration of all public affairs to his maternal uncle, Theodore Kastamonites. <br />This man, extremely skillful in wielding power and especially in the collection of public taxes, was also eloquent in speech.

The people, the state senate, and the emperor’s blood relations followed behind him in escort, and surrounding the chair as though it were a casket, they bewailed not him but their own fortunes. Nothing was done without his knowledge, and no one in authority was allowed to sit down with Kastamonites, but must stand in his presence in a servile attitude. The emperor was not troubled in the least by all this. Seeing his own glory passing unpropitiously to another and his power being snatched from him, he perceived nothing improper whatsoever in this absurdity and gave his approval to these developments without any evident justification. <br />When Kastamonites went in procession on horseback, Isaakios allowed him to have the imperial purple trappings and to wear the purple military cloak; he was allowed to sign the public decrees and rescripts in dye of the same color. The state of affairs had truly taken a strange turn, inconsonant with Nature herself, until a certain merciful disease that showed compassion for those who took no pity on themselves befell the man. Its spreading noxious matter affected the joints of his body and afflicted his reason even more strongly. <br />It was the fifteenth day of the month of August when Kastamonites, escorted with great festivity by a huge crowd of officials, visited the Monastery of Pantanassa by way of the agora to celebrate the rites of the death of the Mother of God and for the first time heard himself acclaimed despot and emperor, for this is how flatterers and wheedlers choose to address those who rule.

Kastamonites briefly recovered from his cachexia and spent the rest of the day in better spirits, but then he fell ill once again, and a few days later he died. The disease had spread to other parts of the body, and his buttocks were covered with sores. <br />Next to beauty, ugliness appears to be even more conspicuous. Following Kastamonites’ death, a youngster, who should have been studying with an elementary schoolmaster, writing tablet in hand, succeeded to the emperor’s favor. <br />While the one departed this life from among us, a small boy [Constantine Mesopotamia] assumed the administration of public affairs less than a year after he had put down pen and ink; not only did he lead the emperor about in the manner of a leader whale but he also took charge of troop registers as though he had been trained from infancy to administer momentous affairs, or as if even before birth he had been entrusted with worldly concerns as was Sibyl, about whom it is said that as soon as she issued from her mother’s womb she began to philosophize about the composition of the universe.

On alternate days, when he took pleasure in the baths, he smelled of sweet unguents and was sprinkled with oils of myrrh, and he surpassed the likeness of a temple with his fine, long robes and curled hair. The dandy strutted about like a peacock and never wore the same garment twice, coming forth daily from the palace like a bridegroom out of his bridal chamber or the sun rising out of a beauteous mere. <br />As he delighted in ribaldries and lewd songs and consorted with laughter-stirring dwarfs, he did not close the palace to knaves, mimes, and minstrels. But arm and arm with these must come drunken revel, followed by sexual wantonness and all else that corrupts the healthy and sound state of the empire. Once at dinner Isaakios said, “Bring me salt.” Standing nearby admiring the dance of the women made up of the emperor’s concubines and kinswomen was Chalivoures, the wittiest of the mimes, who retorted, “Let us first come to know these, O Emperor, and then command others to be brought in.”</p>                        </div>

This undisguised undertaking was not wholly without danger. 443] He also transported there the broad and high bronze gates that formerly barred the entrance of the Great Palace and in our day secured the prison that took from them its name, Chalke. He stripped bare the renowned church called Nea in the Great Palace of all its sacred furniture and holy vessels. As a result, he pridefully gave himself airs and plumed himself as though no other had ever built such marvelous works. He thought that removal was the same as augmentation, and transposition the same as addition, and he preferred the shadow-filled depiction of the good deed which paints the form of piety but sketchily or not at all; of a truth, he believed that the Divinity would be not angry but pleased should this temple be despoiled of its former splendor and left to become a nesting place for birds and the habitation of hedgehogs while another was consecrated with relics removed from their rightful place and magnificently embellished with ornaments taken from elsewhere. <br />He was, to put it mildly, brazen enough to defile the sacred vessels which he snatched from the holy churches and used at his meals. When carousing, he would clasp the goblet-like votive offerings to God decorated with precious gems and made of refined gold that hung in the tombs of the emperors, and there were carried about exquisite, elegant pitchers for hand washing which the Levites [deacons] and priests use to cleanse themselves when they approach the Holy Mysteries.

Afterwards he approached the so-called Beautiful Portals of the temple and remained there for some time, awaiting to receive the signal for the exact moment of his entrance [into the narthex] from the timekeepers in the Catechoumeneia above.

Alexios made repeated attempts to mount the horse, but, kicking up its front hooves and wheeling about, it repulsed him. After much coaxing and stroking of its neck, it finally seemed to calm down, to cease making its proud gyrations and thrashing its legs in the air. The emperor leaped on it and grabbed the reins, but the horse, as though tricked into accepting the rider against its will, misbehaved as before, lifting up its legs and neighing loudly. Nor did it end its Bacchic frenzy until it had knocked the bejeweled crown from the emperor’s head to the ground so that certain parts of it were shattered and had thrown him off like a ball as well. When another horse was brought forward and Alexios paraded with a broken crown, this was deemed an inauspicious portent of the future: that he would be unable to preserve the empire intact but would fall from his lofty throne and be ill-treated by his enemies. <br />Accompanying the emperor in the procession on horseback were his two sons-in-law, <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a> Kontostephanos and Isaakios Komnenos, and his paternal uncle, the aged John Doukas, who, during this triumphal procession, had the following unexpected event befall him.

Not a few of the emperor’s blood relations, for whom the highest offices had been reserved, would draw nigh, and placing their shoulders like wooden beams under the splendid and lofty throne, elevated the empress. <br />Three months had not yet passed [before July 1195] when the news arrived that a certain Alexios from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, who had assumed the name of emperor Manuel’s son Alexios, had gone over to the satrap of the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392289UAnk class=place long=32.863 lat=39.95>Ankara</a> [Muhl al-Din Mas ‘Udshah] and had been received as the true son of Emperor Manuel. Although this man knew that he would not accomplish his objective (for he knew that Emperor Alexios had been strangled by <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a>, he deemed this would embroil the emperor of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in troubles, for he would thus be pitted against insurrectionists.

They gave everyone to understand that being uncommitted they would not announce themselves at once for either one; when the issue was decided they would join the victor. Even in their audiences with the emperor, they did not desist from extolling Alexios. They would often say, “You, too, would be delighted in the man if you saw him, O Despot and Emperor. His long, yellowish red hair is adorned as though with filings of gold. A man of goodly stature is he and such a horseman that he cannot be shaken, and it is as though he were fixed in the saddle.” <br />When the emperor replied that Emperor Manuel’s son was put to death long ago by <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a>, that he who had now come forward was an impostor unrelated to the Komnenos family, and even if one should concede that he were alive and that this aggressor were he, he, the emperor, would still have a better right to the throne as he held the scepter of the Roman empire in his hand, then the listeners interrupted, and using his own words to refute his arguments, they said, “Do you see, O Emperor, how you too have doubts about the youth’s identity and how uncertain you are about his death? Be not angry then with those who take pity on the youth on whom the empire has devolved through three generations and who unjustly has been separated from both throne and country.” <br />When the emperor saw that he could not prevail and that nothing was being gained by his presence, he went from one fortress to another. <br />Some he won back from Alexios and others he put to the torch for having gone over to the rebel.

Asan could not tolerate such nonchalance as a matter of negligence and insisted, and Ivanko, eventually cognizant why he was being summoned, deliberated with his blood relations and friends as to what he should do. They advised him to gird on his long sword and come before Asan, concealing the sword under his outer garment.

It was said that it was at the instigation of the sebastokrator Isaakios that Ivanko, who was encouraged in this by many promises, killed Asan, and that Ivanko was especially set on the wing by the pledge of marriage to Isaakios’s own daughter Theodora. <br />But Isaakios gave up the ghost in prison without having effected the murder.

Everyone was to depart unharmed, together with his nearest and dearest and his possessions, free to go wherever he liked, since the barbarian would allow no one to stay behind. He would not agree in any way whatsoever that they should pay him tribute.

A native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406176RCal class=place long=17.6 lat=40.6>Calabria</a>, he was once a pirate, indeed the very worst of pirates; in return for lavish gifts, he had gone over to Emperor Isaakios and had benefited the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> many times in naval battles. But when he sailed against Gafforio, he suffered an unexpected misfortune; having taken great care to outmaneuver his adversary, who commanded a larger force, he became the victim of the stratagem he had contrived from the very beginning.

He found them emptied of their crews and seized them all, together with their arms and every living thing on board. From this time on, he attacked the islands with impunity, plundered the towns along the coast, and demanded and collected tribute as he pleased. <br />The emperor, who was confounded by these events, decided that it was necessary to come to terms with Gafforio. He dispatched some of Gafforio’s Genoese friends (he had often put in at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantion</a> for trade purposes and was fined money for the damages he inflicted by the dux of the fleet, Michael Stryphnos and initiated peace talks. He also made preparations for war, fitting out other triremes and again turning them over to Steiriones. He and Gafforio came to an agreement that the emperor would send six hundredweight of gold to Gafforio and apportion enough land to support seven hundred of his countrymen as men-at-arms; Gafforio, in turn, would submit to the emperor and obey his every command.

Once these evils were overcome, an upheaval in the palace greatly tarnished the emperor’s government and brought long-lasting confusion. <br />In describing these events, I shall first go back to the beginning in an attempt to clarify that which followed. <br />Emperor Alexios, as I briefly have remarked, before coming to power was deemed by most not a pacific man but a most bellicose one; hence everyone expected that he would stretch forth his lance against the enemies of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and not be altogether tolerant towards his subjects.

This notion was indeed most notable and admirable, the groundwork and base and foundation of an auspicious reign; even if one chooses to find parallels, neither in the distant past nor in recent times could one find such an example as in our own days. All the emperor’s relatives were avaricious and grasping, and the frequent turnover of officials taught them nothing else but eagerly to steal and loot, to purloin the public taxes, and to amass great wealth. The petitioners who came to them because of their influence with the emperor they despoiled, and the monies collected, huge sums that surpassed any private fortune, they appropriated for themselves. <br />As a result of these conditions, Alexios failed in all else, more so than any other emperor, and the ministries went from bad to worse; once again they were offered for sale to those who wanted to buy them. Anyone who so wished could become governor of a province and receive the highest Roman dignity.</p>                        </div>

The pilot of the ship of state, therefore, was ill-spoken of by all, and the officers he stationed in command at the bow and the crew were subjected to the most abominable curses. The empress deemed the situation to be intolerable, and as nothing could escape her inquisitiveness and her love for money, she decided she could not voluntarily keep quiet for long; either the appointments to office were not to be sold by the command of her husband or the monies collected must be stored in the imperial treasury. First of all, the empress appointed as her minister, Constantine Mesopotamites; it was he who exercised the highest authority under Isaakios Angelos, as we have recounted in the chapters dealing with his reign. Later, Alexios achieved a reconciliation with Mesopotamites, who, before Alexios came to power, looked upon him with disaffection and who continued to turn his face from him even after he ascended the throne because he had instigated the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> to rebel against the present state of affairs and progressively and ceaselessly had confounded and thrown everything into confusion. <br />As the administration of public affairs again devolved upon Mesopotamites, the authority of others was extinguished and the light of domination of those attached to the emperor was dimmed. He, who formerly was looked down upon as refuse by the emperor, was now deemed to be incomparable, the horn of plenty, the mixing bowl of many virtues, or</p>                        </div>

On this day, they met with him and said, “Although nature recognizes kinship as being more honorable and deserving of affection, we wish to be, and to be known as, the emperor’s friends or as Alexios’s friends, rather than as Euphrosyne’s friends.

She, in turn, demanded to be placed on trial for the charges made against her, asserting that she was willing to suffer whatever judgment was made against her. She entreated the emperor to disregard the ingenious inventiveness of her accusers and his kinship with them and to give heed to the accuracy and truth of the matter. He did not follow any such course of action but instead subjected certain of the female chamberlains to torture. Ascertaining from the eunuchs of the bedchamber precise details of the affair, he commanded some days later that she be removed from the palace and divested of her imperial garment and splendid robe. She was led out of the palace through a littleknown descending passageway dressed in a common frock, the kind worn by women who spin for daily hire, escorted by two barbarian handmaids who spoke broken Greek.

They had never expected the emperor to act so drastically against her, looking to his softheartedness and his ability to remain coolheaded. They who brought shame upon their family were grieved, although they were not as distressed as they should have been; and the reproaches and taunts cast upon them by the populace pressed hard upon them. <br />Six months had elapsed [October to March 1198], and the empress Euphrosyne remained banished from the palace. She would have been ignored until the very end had not they who had wounded her also healed her, but not in the manner that Achilles healed Telephos; instead, the universal hatred against them for having brought disgrace to her who had honored them impelled them to find a way in which she could be restored. While all the emperor’s kinsmen were of one mind and persisted in their efforts to topple Constantine Mesopotamites from the tightrope he walked, Euphrosyne was reinstated forthwith and became more powerful than ever. She did not openly express her exceeding wrath against her adversaries, neither did she lay snares for the sake of revenge, nor was she so possessed by anger that like Medea she was goaded to Bacchic frenzy against them. She tamed her husband like some wild animal, and since it was a long time since he had shown her any affection, nor had he gone to bed with her, she cleverly insinuated herself into his good graces, choosing to wheedle him with cunning. In this way, she took over almost the complete administration of the empire. Such then was the outcome of these events. <br />Constantine Mesopotamites (for more must be said about the Proteus of our times, this extremely wily and versatile man) put on airs and walked mincingly upon the empress’s return. It was for this reason, I think, that he believed that he could do anything with the emperor and forthwith rejected the honor of being promoted to the office of keeper of the inkstand as being both inadequate to his station and too small to contain the magnitude of his power. He preferred instead to be ordained from lector to deacon, as he was unable to endure that anything, even holy orders, should be outside his reach. His request was immediately granted. The emperor himself went down to the celebrated church in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410289UBla class=place long=28.9427 lat=41.0395>Blachernai</a>, and as soon as the patriarch arrived, he promoted Mesopotamites from lector to deacon, and he was granted the preeminent standing</p>                        </div>

Having accomplished this, he assumed a posture of one in decline and never again appeared at the palace or served the emperor in any capacity whatsoever; the canons do not allow priests to be both consecrated to God and involved in secular affairs in any way, for both are distinct and can never coalesce because to serve God and mammon is a contradiction. But the emperor clung to him like ivy. With his hands around a tome which he displayed forthwith, he compelled Patriarch Xiphilinos to allow Mesopotamites to serve both God and emperor, church and palace, without suffering the penalty for violating those canons which sharply discipline this double life [before July 1198].

Providence, which directs human affairs, made an example of his exceeding exaltation and abysmal abasement, for having ascended to the heavens, he fell into the depths, toppled by the counter-winds of Fortune.

Thus he remained unalterably fixed to his original design. So that nothing would be accomplished without his advice, he inserted his brothers into the government like wedges or hoops, or he hung them like earrings on both the emperor’s ears so that should he ever be attending a church synod nothing should be done or said without his knowledge and no one, unbeknownst to him, should insinuate himself into his place.

In his perpetual striving for advancement and in that he knew no surfeit in his quest for glory, he was like the mosquito of the fable that escaped detection when engaging the lion in battle but was caught in the delicate spider’s web; he canceled out every honor which earlier he had eagerly pursued, according to the psalm of David, “bowing down and falling when he had mastered the poor in knowledge.” All those onto whose heads he had leaped like the flea of the comedy and whose face he had come near to slapping as though they were slaves formed a party of no small numbers and assembled publicly. Collecting certain odious accusations against him like so much muck, they approached the emperor. When they found him yielding and easily led to hatred by their every word, they attacked Mesopotamites fiercely. Thereafter he was expelled from the palace like a well-rounded missile propelled from a mighty siege engine, and he was also banished from the high priesthood [1198?].

The patriarch assembled certain bishops as judges and sat in council with as many of these as were frivolous and in hot pursuit of the emperor’s favor. Because the arguments that were presented in favor of unfrocking the prelate seemed to be feeble and unsubstantial, the patriarch added to the act of deposition some charges which presumed Mesopotamites guilty, and thus the man was divested of all liturgical privileges. The patriarch’s motivation is not clear; he may have yielded to imperial command, or his critical judgment may have been dulled by his hatred of Mesopotamites, or, again, some other reason may have prevented him from performing his duty.

What followed was no different from what went before. The way of life remained ever the same — listless and spiritless. <br />The peace treaties that the emperor had negotiated with the Turkish ruler of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379325PIko class=place long=32.4921 lat=37.8728>Ikonion</a> were ignored and violated. Kaykhusraw (for this was the barbarian’s name) seized two <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=demonym long=40 lat=28>Arabian</a> stallions which were being sent to the emperor by the sultan of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> [al-'Aziz Othman]. <br />When one of these dislocated its knee as it was let loose to run, Kaykhusraw dispatched an embassy to the emperor asking his forbearance for having taken possession of them and adding that because of the injury of the one, he refrained from sending the other; at any event, the emperor should not take offense at the actions of a friend and he would not for long be deprived of the horses. Thus he delivered a specious defense of what he had done. The emperor neither praised magnanimity nor turned necessity into generosity, nor put in his mind that the times, stifling in all things, ever opposed him as a grievous adversary. To the contrary, he roared with anger like a holm oak suddenly bursting into flame. He did not, however, undertake any brave action in order to harass the Turk but rather waged war against himself and showed his sword, which hitherto had been concealed. He ordered the Roman and Turkish merchants who had come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantion</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379325PIko class=place long=32.4921 lat=37.8728>Ikonion</a> cast into prison and confiscated their possessions.</p>                        </div>

It so happened that on that day a certain man of power, rank, and influence in the city was celebrating his daughter’s nuptial festivities. There was, as is customary in such celebrations, the din of revelers and the tinkling of cymbals throughout the night, and the beating of kettledrums, dancers kicking their legs to and fro, and choirs of women singing suitable wedding songs. As Kaykhusraw neared the city, the sound of the musical instruments fell upon his ears and he heard the harmonious union of the singers’ voices, but he did not divine what was actually going on. To him, these sounds appeared to be signals of men prepared for battle who had been forewarned of his attack, and so he departed thence and went to Lampe. <br />At Lampe he appointed officials to register the captives, asking each one his native city and his name; he asked who his captor was, whether he had lost any of his substance, and whether a son or daughter or spouse</p>                        </div>

The throng of those taken into slavery was numbered at five thousand persons. The barbarian took pains that the captives should not lack the necessaries of life, and providing them with bread, he did not ignore the pernicious cold of the season [winter 1198-99]; taking up a two-edged ax, he himself split into billets an old tree nearby which had fallen long ago. To those Turks who came running to see the spectacle, he suggested that they do likewise, explaining the reason for the labor and adding, moreover, that it was for their own good. The Turks were permitted to leave the camp at any time to cut wood, for there was no one to deter them, but the captive <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were not allowed to do so, being kept under guard so that they would not think of escaping and thus avoid being put in chains as suspect runaways. <br />When the Turk came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384314UPhi class=place long=31.416 lat=38.3555>Philomilion</a> with his horde of captives, he assigned them to unwalled villages and apportioned fertile lands for cultivation; he then provided grain and seed for the sowing of crops. Indeed, he filled them with high hopes, assuring them that once he and the emperor were reconciled and had renewed the former treaties, their reward would be their return home. Should the emperor decide on another course of action, they would remain tribute-free for five whole years, relieved of all tax collectors; afterwards, he would impose upon them a light tax which would never exceed the limit, as is customary among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, nor would it be increased many times.

The frequent tyrannies frustrated prudent conduct on the part of the people, and the majority, stripped bare by the rapine, took no thought of behaving with moderation towards their fellow countrymen. <br />What, then, was the response of the emperor to these events? He dispatched <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a> Doukas [beginning of 1199], a youth with the first down upon his lips, to engage the Turk in battle. After a long delay, he mounted an attack against the Turks with the troops under his command, but, after conducting nocturnal assaults against the shepherds and herdsmen of a certain amir Arsan, he returned shortly afterwards. <br />The emperor, who found it as difficult to drag himself away from the luxuriant localities of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408280WPro class=place long=28 lat=40.75>Propontis</a> as though they were the lands of the lotus and the Sirens, arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404297PNic class=place long=29.7168 lat=40.4266>Nicaea</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402291UPru class=place long=29.0615 lat=40.1848>Prusa</a>.

One day, shutting the doors to his bedchamber and disclosing his intentions to none but his chamberlains, he applied burning cautery irons to his legs, and pressing the cauterizing apparatus deep, he counteracted the pain caused by the burning chiefly by holding forth with abusive repudiations of the physicians, asserting that they treated only in cathartics and knew of no remedy for the sick except purgatives. When the inflammation caused by the burns and the severe pain became more acute, the physicians were summoned, not one by one, but all together; moreover, the emperor’s kinsmen became alarmed lest the downward flow of the secretion to his feet be checked and deflected to some mortal part of the body, sweeping him suddenly to his death, and the rule then be transferred to another. <br />The medical attendants decided to administer purgatives to him to ease the flow and excess of matter, and the medicines, mixed almost day by day, proved effective.

The latter had occupied Strummitsa, where he took possession of a certain fortress called Prosakos, and made it into a tyrant’s dwelling for himself, strenthening in diverse ways the walls which Nature from the beginning had generously provided and fashioned; these are abrupt and cloven cliffs which abut upon one another, reached by a single narrow, steep, precipitous ascent, and the remaining circumference of the cliffs are sheer and inaccessible. The deep-eddying <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411225WAxi class=place long=22.6611 lat=40.7223>Axios</a> River, winding around, provides an even more uncommon defense.

Only one indispensable and essential advantage was lacking: not a single drop of water trickles there, nor are there wells, making necessary the descent to the river to draw water in pitchers. In possession of such a fortification, Chrysos was not at all disturbed by the fact that the emperor was marching against him but made preparations to oppose him. <br />Those <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who were experienced in warfare — indeed, if there were any such left at that time — and who were informed of the features of the land, deemed it necessary, and advised the emperor accordingly, to bypass Prosakos and to attack the remaining towns and villages obedient to Chrysos; only after subduing these should he advance against Prosakos. Thus the morale of the troops would be high because they would first destroy those places that were easy to overcome and come into possession of booty.

After much toil and slaughter, they drove the barbarians back from the advanced fortification which had recently been constructed as an outpost to protect the gates in this section. There were those who scaled the steep slopes nimble-footed as wild goats in an attempt to penetrate the walls and rush the citadel. <br />Just when they thought that they had accomplished a salutary and mighty deed, having chased the defenders from the walls and shut them inside, they realized that they had labored in vain; when they called for mattocks in order to pull down the walls, there was no one to furnish the required tool. But they persisted in this labor, grumbling against the officers in charge of the imperial tools. Using their hands and swords as crowbars, they detached the stones from their joints; then, leaping up, they pulled down the bulwark. Later, but too late, for the work was under way and they were being harried by the enemy attacking them from above, the official in charge of the tools, a eunuch, arrived carrying mattocks bound together by a rope. The scoundrel should have been drowned forthwith or made to pay miserably for his actions as a brief respite for those who had suffered from combat as well as thirst and suffocation caused by the sun’s burning heat, but he prudishly rebuked them and with a loud smacking of the lips pretended to be vexed and quelled the resolve of these courageous men.</p>                        </div>

To appropriate the alms of the lovers of God, at night he released from prison the most notorious thieves, still fettered in chains, and these furtively ransacked the houses and brought him the stolen goods.

There the company recovered from their vertigo, and spitting out the brine and consigning to the deep of oblivion the vicissitudes and terrors of their plight, they crossed over to the Great Palace, celebrating horse races and entertaining the populace with spectacles. <br />At the conclusion of these events, the emperor wished to go directly to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410289UBla class=place long=28.9427 lat=41.0395>Blachernai</a>, but because the season was unsuitable (for the emperors up to our times scrutinize the position of the stars before they take a single step), he remained in the Great Palace through the first week of Lent [11-18 February 1201] against his wishes. Since the sixth day [17 February] was not unpropitious for a change of residence, especially if he departed in the morning twilight, he decided to arrive at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410289UBla class=place long=28.9427 lat=41.0395>Blachernai</a> in the dark, before the sun had begun to cast its rays. The trireme rode at anchor off the shore of the palace, and all the emperor’s kinsmen assembled at his side with lights to sail in company with him. Now God demonstrated that he is the Lord of seasons and years and that he guides the steps of some or trips them up: the floor before the emperor’s bed collapsed without visible cause and opened into a yawning chasm. Contrary to all expectations, the emperor was delivered from the danger, but one of his sons-in-law, Alexios Palaiologos, and many others fell through the opening and suffered grievous injury to their legs. A certain eunuch was killed as he fell to the very bottom of the gaping hole. What were the emperor’s thoughts about these</p>                        </div>

What occurred immediately afterwards [spring 1201], I will now record. <br />This emperor’s third daughter was named Evdokia. While her father wandered among the Ismaelites and roamed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/320350RPal class=place long=35.0001 lat=32.0206>Palestine</a> to escape <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronikos</a>, Isaakios, her father’s brother, gave her in marriage [1185-87] to one of the sons of Stefan Nemanja, the ruler of the Serbs. Stefan Nemanja remained in power for only a short time and then ascended Mount Papykios and embraced monastic life [1196 CE]; his son Stefan presented Evdokia' as joint heir to the paternal satrapy and succeeded after many years in fathering children with her. <br />But time, the transformer and perpetual engenderer of dissimilarities, sundered them from their former unity and like-mindedness and did not allow their oneness to remain unsullied until their last breath, that which prudent couples deem to be the fullness of human happiness. Stefan accused his wife of itching from scabby incontinence, while she charged him with being drunk from the appearance of the morning star, with not drinking water from his own water jars, and with gorging himself on bread eaten in secret. As the dissension continued to grow apace in this manner, Stefan conceived a monstrous and most barbarous action which he pursued with a vengeance; fabricating the story (or he may have been telling the truth) that Evdokia was caught in the act of adultery, he stripped her of her woman’s robe, leaving her with only her undergarment, which was cut round about so that it barely covered her private parts and dismissed her thus in disgrace to go forth as a wanton [after June 1198]. <br />Vukan, Stefan’s brother, opposed this indecent, relentless, and excessively repellent act and reproached his brother for his inhuman behavior. <br />He pleaded with him to temper his wrath in view of Evdokia’s illustrious</p>                        </div>

When Evdokia’s father learned what had happened, he dispatched a two-headed throne, necklaces, and splendid imperial garments and welcomed his daughter. <br />Nemanja’s sons did not continue to the end in brotherly love; warring against one another, they joined the chorus of others who, as we stated but a short while ago, ignore nature because of their lust for power and the stupidity of their ways. The victorious Vukan expelled Stefan from both throne and country [April to summer 1203].

He razed the city’s walls and departed to encamp near Varna, which he besieged fiercely on the sixth day of the Lord’s Passions [23 March 1201]. The majority of the defenders were mighty warriors, and these, aided by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> troops, defended the city tenaciously. In response, Ioannitsa constructed a foursided siege engine as long as the fosse’s width and as high as the city’s wall and set it on wheels, positioning it next to the fosse. Later, when it was overturned, it spanned both sides; thus, Ioannitsa’s troops used one and the same siege engine both as a bridge across the fosse and as a</p>                        </div>

Ioannitsa neither respected the solemnity of the day (for it was the most blessed Sabbath on which Christ slept in the tomb) nor reverenced the name of Christian, to which he only paid lip service. <br />Driven by bloodthirsty demons, he pushed all those he took captive alive into the fosse, and, filling it level with earth, he made of it a common burial place. When he had demolished the walls of the city, he returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440205RMys class=place long=20.5 lat=44>Mysia</a>, having honored the first and chief day of the week with such offerings to the dead and most loathsome rites. <br />At the same time, the following events were taking their course. The protostrator Manuel Kamytzes, who had long been confined in prison in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440205RMys class=place long=20.5 lat=44>Mysia</a> [since 1200], begged his cousin the emperor to pay his ransom out of his own substance. He was a captive of the barbarians and should not be overlooked as though he were a criminal. But he could not sway the emperor in his letters. Despairing, he appealed to his son-in-law Chrysos and beseeched him to ransom him. Once his petitions were consummated, he left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440205RMys class=place long=20.5 lat=44>Mysia</a> for Prosakos. He did not desist once he arrived there from importuning the emperor to pay Chrysos the ransom money, which amounted to two hundred pounds of gold, contending that much more had been confiscated, in addition to the silver and gold vessels, the silken yarn, and splendid garments about which he had preened himself as the richest of men. Alexios placed his relationship with the protostrator on one scale of balance and his wealth on the other and weighed both; he found that the second was by far the heavier in the fall of the scale pan; whence he paid no heed whatsoever to Kamytzes’ petitions. <br />In desperation Kamytzes, together with Chrysos, decided to attack the Roman themes that bordered Prosakos.

Banners were flown on top, and huge rewards were offered those who would ascend to give battle. <br />A measure of the horrors was about to begin, others were already under way, and still others were to follow; the deliberations on amity were disregarded, wholly ignored. Certain wicked Telchines frequently confounded the negotiations. The doge of Venice, Enrico Dandolo, electing to discuss peace terms with the emperor, boarded a trireme and put in at Kosmidion. As soon as the emperor arrived there on horseback, they exchanged views on the peace, paying no heed to anyone else. The demands made by the doge and the remaining chiefs were for the immediate payment of five thousand pounds of gold and certain other conditions which were both galling and unacceptable to those who have tasted freedom and are accustomed to give, not take, commands.</p>                        </div>

He proved to be helpful to us in those troubled times. Putting on his armor and transforming himself from merchant to soldier, he pretended to be a companion in arms and, speaking to them in their own barbaric tongue, claimed that he had occupied the dwelling first. Thus he beat off the despoilers to a man. But they continued to pour in in large numbers, and he despaired of opposing them, especially the French, who were not like the others in temperament or physique and boasted that the only thing they feared was heaven. As it was impossible for him to fall upon them, he enjoined us to depart so that we men should not be put in chains because of our money, and the women should not be violated and wantonly raped. <br />This good and former household servant and client now became our brave helpmate, providing us protection in these anxious times. After he had taken us to another house where <a about=https://topostext.org/place/457120REne class=demonym long=12.01 lat=45.7>Venetian</a> acquaintances of ours resided, we left a short time later, dragged away by the hand as though we had been allotted to him as captives of his spear, and downcast and ill-clad we were sent on our way. <br />Because this part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>City</a> had fallen to the French, we became immigrants once again.

The day was Saturday, and what had taken place was not, I believe, an event without meaning, a fortuitous circumstance or a coincidence, but the will of God. It was a stormy and wintry day, and my wife was approaching the throes of childbirth, so that Christ’s prophecy, “Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day,” and “Woe unto them that are with child in those days!” appeared to have been spoken for us, and to have been wholly fulfilled. <br />Numerous friends and relatives and a multitude of others, on seeing us, came running to escort us on our way, and we were like a throng of ants passing through the streets. The troops who came out to meet us could not be called armed for battle, for although their long swords hung down alongside their horses, and they bore daggers in their sword belts, some were loaded down with spoils and others searched the captives who were passing through to see if they had wrapped a splendid garment inside a torn tunic or hidden silver or gold in their bosoms. Still others looked with steadfast and fixed gaze upon those women who were of extraordinary beauty with intent to seize them forthwith and ravish them. Fearing for the women, we put them in the middle as though in a sheepfold and instructed the young girls to rub their faces with mud to conceal the blush of their cheeks so that they should not, like a beacon’s fire in the night, signal wayfarers who would first become spectators, then admirers, and finally rapists, viewing their own pleasure as guiltless. We lifted our hands in supplication to God, smote upon our breasts with contrite hearts, and bathed our eyes in tears and prayed that we all, both men and women, should escape those savage beasts of prey unharmed. It was necessary that we pass through the Golden Gate.</p>                        </div>

The girl’s father, afflicted by old age and sickness, stumbled, fell into a mudhole, and lay on his side wailing and wallowing in the mire; turning to me in utter helplessness and calling me by name, he entreated that I do everything possible to free his daughter. I immediately turned back and set out after the abductor, following his tracks; in tears I cried out against the abduction, and with gestures of supplication I prevailed upon those passing troops who were not wholly ignorant of our language to come to my aid, and I even held on to some with my hand. In this way I succeeded in moving some to pity and convinced them to go in pursuit of that shameless fleshpot. <br />I went on ahead and the others followed. When we arrived at the lodgings of this lover of women, he sent the girl inside and stood at the gateway to repulse his opponents. Pointing my finger at him, I said, “This is he to whose wrongdoing the light of day bears witness, and who disregards the commands of your wellborn chiefs. You have decreed and have sworn the most awesome oaths to refrain from intercourse with, and, if possible, from even casting an adulterous eye on, married women, maidens who have never known any man, and nuns consecrated to God. This man has flouted your injunctions before many witnesses and was not afraid to bray like a salacious ass at the sight of chaste maidens. Defend, therefore, those who are protected by your laws and who have been put in our charge; be softened by these tears which God does accept and which nature has channeled into our eyes so as to arouse pity for one another.

At first, the barbarian showed contempt, as he was held captive by the two most tyrannical of passions, lust and wrath. When he saw, however, that the men were bristled with anger and proposed to hang him from a stake as an unjust and shameless man, and that their threats came not from their lips only but from their hearts as well, he yielded reluctantly and surrendered the girl.

He did not have long experience in affairs of state, for which reason Dandolo distrusted the marquis. <br />Baldwin was not yet thirty-two years old. <br />He was, furthermore, devout in his duties to God, and was reported to be temperate in his personal conduct; for as long as he was separated from his dear wife, he never so much as cast a glance at another woman. <br />In singing the praises of God and in the face of every distress, he was unwavering. Most important, twice a week in the evening he had a herald proclaim that no one who slept within the palace was to have sexual intercourse with any woman who was not his legal wife. <br />After he had become emperor [16 May 1204], Baldwin marched out to the western regions [summer 1204], He did not intend to subjugate them (for he thought that everything was there for the taking, asserting in a</p>                        </div>

Baldwin yielded to these reasonable petitions, but he was well aware that the angry retreat of the marquis did not augur well. <br />Moreover, informed by many of the marquis’s actions, he paid heed to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=ethnic long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonians</a> and delivered to them a letter written in red ink, confirming the city in all her customary privileges.</p>                        </div>

The citadel’s defenders spread out and extended their defences along the walls and continued their resistance. Seeing that Ioannitsa had cut off the citadel as though with a wall of circumvallation constituted by all his troops, and that he had closed off every exit to them so that none could steal his way on foot to the marquis, the defenders wanted to surrender the citadel, provided they were given a pledge of safe-conduct and allowed to leave with their arms and horses.

There he ascertained that all the information contained in the letters was true and gleaned whatever still stood of the city’s cornfields that had been harvested during the battle which took place before his arrival. Mulcting the citizens of their goods, he left them as naked as a pestle, and from among the popular masses and the clergy, some he killed and some he hanged.

He gave notice to the city’s inhabitants that he would not return home unless they agreed to come to terms or he prevailed over them by the law of warfare. At the mere mention of treaties, the inhabitants responded in vexation that henceforth <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> would never trust in oaths sworn to by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> because the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> were absolutely untrustworthy in the assurances they gave and treated those who went over to them with brutality; the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had come to know them to be most merciless to captives of war. At this answer, Henry began operations. He found the city encompassed by a double fosse, dug wide and deep. Attached to the tops of the towers were wooden scaffolds that rose high into the air and were protected by coverings made of prepared hides and skins to ward off fiery missiles, serving as a bulwark for those fighting from them. Atop the wooden towers poles were fixed from which incendiary materials were poured down, causing widespread destruction. In certain places along the scaffoldings, compartments had been constructed as resting places for the warriors, allowing them to go inside and to observe from the benches the depths below and to inspect the schools of fishes. From some of the platforms, stones were suspended from chains, dropped by cranes, pulled up again, and diverted where most needed; there were, moreover, fourteen stone-throwing engines positioned on the towers. <br />Henry and his troops were resolved to take possession of the outer fosse by military action, and, after the second was filled in, to move the</p>                        </div>

After the first fosse was taken, the second was filled in, but only with great difficulty; bodiless heads and headless bodies of the fallen on both sides were used in large part to fill the empty space of the fosse. When, finally, after much bloodshed, it was covered over, they moved the tower-like scaling ladders to the walls. One of the ladders positioned on the fosse sank because the newly poured fill was still soft and loose; another was moved directly opposite the wall, but before the drawbridge could be let down, it was struck and shattered by the heavy stones suspended from the poles atop the towers and by the missiles discharged from the stone-throwing engines, and rendered useless. Indeed, many who were fighting from it were grievously injured, one of whom, Peter of Bracieux, celebrated among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> as the strongest and bravest of them all, had his skull crushed by a stone.

As soon as the city’s defenders saw the engine of war approaching the towers and the strong-built bridge touching upon the walls so as to allow the assigned troops to cross over, they threw open the gates, sallied out with their weapons and combustibles, and ignited a huge fire, and a battle fiercer than the first was fought. But once again they were forced to withdraw without success and looked upon their siege engines going up in flames before them. The Vlach and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=demonym long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cuman</a> troops outside the city compassed the palisade and would allow no provisions to enter the encampment. <br />Overcome by their helplessness and deeply discouraged, they sent word to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantion</a> requesting that fresh troops come to their assistance. <br />The troops marched out under compulsion, rather than from zeal, threatened with the ban of excommunication and anathema, should they refuse to do so, by Cardinal Martin and Thomas [Morosini], patriarch of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, who had but recently arrived from Venice.

Then the defenders, removing the mask of cringing suppliants, came furiously forward, as the enemy defended themselves with every means at their disposal.

Nowadays, as evidence of their victories, the barbarians to whom we have been delivered over by God for chastisement have invented the razing of cities and total ruin. They are not content until they reach the pinnacle of enormities and sate themselves in blood lust. They grouped certain Roman captives together with their fellow countrymen who had either died a natural death or who had lost their lives in battle and buried them alive, seated on their swift ponies, with their horn-tipped bows and two-edged swords, and there was none to ransom them or to rescue them. Thus they do not shrink from perpetrating deeds contrary to nature. <br />Withdrawing for these reasons from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411282USel class=place long=28.2477 lat=41.0785>Selymbria</a>, we returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, where we remained for six months before we sailed to the East to avoid looking upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> and their driveling.

But our change of residence did nothing to improve our circumstances; once again we are deluged by sorrow, and we manage thanks only to God, since the negligible assistance we are fortunate enough to receive from the hands of men is begrudgingly bestowed, for they are not cheerful givers, and, one can say, they are inimical to sharing. We are nourished by a little bread and sometimes by a measure of wine, we are surfeited with the calamities of our countrymen as well as of our own, and we are offered the joyless cup of afflictions. Like a line stretching out into infinity, all that was oppressive, horrible, heartrending, soul-destroying, wholly devastating, and utterly desolating in full measure they brought to the Roman nation.

He invested the city and, after pitching camp, battered the walls with siege engines and continued the operations through the night. When the blows of the discharged missiles brought the walls crashing to earth, the helpless inhabitants within had no recourse left except to tear their cheeks and to pull out their hair, to fast and weep, and to lift up their hands in supplication to God and the Holy Mother of God who gave birth to him. But as God is wont to oppose the proud and to shed his grace on the humble, to reward those who call upon his holy name for a way out of their distress, he did not turn his back on their invocations. Although the enemy were certain that the city had already fallen into their hands, and that all that was left for them to do was to offer up sacrifices of entry and to drum upon the armor stripped from the vanquished, the defenders one after another stood side by side, to protect the demolished sections of the wall. Some made a wall of dry wood and bundles of shavings and whatever else was suitable for kindling °f <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a> a fire and then awaited the enemy’s assault, holding burning torches in their hands so that they could quickly ignite that wooden wall. This they did when the enemy pressed on in the expectation of taking the city, unaware of the wooden bulwark and the deep canal excavated in the ground behind it. These then were the actions the besieged took, deemed to be great but small when compared to that which God performed afterwards. A fog rose up from the rivers and flowed by the city to cover the enemy troops like the darkness that may be felt; and so, rising up, the enemy departed from there [c. May 1207] and fled to their own country, deeming this event an awesome sign from God, who manifestly came to the aid of the defenders. Ioannitsa, about whom we have said much, raised the siege for the time being, but he continued despoiling and pillaging the provinces, imagining that the utter destruction of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> would provide him with security while deterring the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> expedition against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440205RMys class=ethnic long=20.5 lat=44>Mysians</a>, and believing that he would be regarded with fear and deserving of friendship rather than enmity. Not long afterwards, he appeared on the rugged lands of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411253UPor class=place long=25.3253 lat=41.1286>Mosynopolis</a> and devastated the region. When Marquis Boniface proposed to come to the aid of those suffering grievously, a fierce battle ensued. As the victory inclined towards Ioannitsa, the marquis was felled by an arrow [4 September 1207], to the delight of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> — this surly man was fond of gold, pertinacious, opinionated, a monster who preyed on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>.

Overturning the sole of the horse’s hoof with hammers, they found lying underneath the image of a man pierced through with a nail and wholly covered by lead, whom the majority conjectured to be of the Bulgar race or to represent a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a>, as was broadcasted by all in the past.

His wings were aflap as though attempting flight, while a coiled snake clutched in his claws prevented its being carried aloft by striking out at the winged extremities of his body. But the venomous creature accomplished nothing, for, transfixed by the sharp claws, its attack was smothered, and it appeared to be drowsy rather than ready to give battle to the bird by clinging to his wings.

With neck held high, it was fierce in countenance, the eyes betraying its eagerness to charge forth; the legs were raised high in the air, exhibiting warlike agitation. <br />Next to this figure, very close to the eastern turn of the four-horse chariot course called Rousion [Red], statues of charioteers were set up with inscriptions of their chariot-driving skill; by the mere disposition of their hands, they exhorted the charioteers, as they approached the turning post, not to relax the reins but to hold the horses in check and to use the goad continuously and more forcefully, so that, as they wheeled round the turning post in close quarters, they should compel their rival, even though his horses were faster and he a skilled competitor, to drive on the outside of the turn and come in last. <br />The following should certainly be included even though it was never my intention to describe everything. A delight to behold and almost more wondrous in craftsmanship than all the others was the brazen animal</p>                        </div>

It did not portray an unambiguous bull for it was short-tailed and neither had a thick throat such as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> bulls [hippopotami] have, nor was it equipped with cloven hooves. In its jaws it throttled another animal whose body was covered all over with scales so prickly that even in bronze it caused pain to him who touched them. This animal, clenched in the bull’s mouth, appeared to some to be a basilisk and to others an asp; not a few conjectured that the one was a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> bull and the other a crocodile. <br />I shall not concern myself with the diversity of opinions; I shall speak only of the unique struggle as the two beasts contended against one another, each suffering terribly from the wounds inflicted by the other, killing and being killed, holding fast and being held fast, winning and being overthrown by the other. For the so-called basilisk had covered the bull with bites, from the head to the soles of the hoofs; the whole body of the bull was discolored and had turned greener than frog-color as the deadly venom penetrated throughout the animal’s system. As a result, the bull collapsed to its knees, and, as its vital life force faded, the eye’s light was extinguished. It gave the spectators the impression that it would have fallen over long ago had not the legs supported it in an upright position. <br />As for the basilisk, which barely struggled with its hindmost parts, it was held fast in the bull’s jaws.</p>                        </div>

It seemed to be straining in its attempt to break through the barrier of teeth in order to escape and slip through the gaping mouth, but it could not because that part of the body which follows immediately after the shoulders and the front legs and all those parts of the body joined to the tail were held secure in the distended mouth, impaled in the jaws. <br />In this manner, each was killed by the other. Common to both was the contest, common the defense, co-equal the victory, and death the fellow contestant. This mutual destruction and killing has persuaded me to say that these death-dealing evils, ruinous to men, not only are portrayed in images and not only happen to the bravest of beasts but frequently occur among the nations, such as those which have marched against us <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, killing and being killed, perishing by the power of Christ who scatters those nations which wish for wars, and who does not rejoice in bloodshed, and who causes the just man to tread on the asp and the basilisk and to trample under foot the lion and the dragon.</p>                        </div>
