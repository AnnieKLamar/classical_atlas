Happy that day is called, happy that year, and happy are they who have looked upon such a year and such a day! Thus in due order are inwoven the battles of <a href=/people/681 target=_blank>Pallas</a>: the great robes are adorned with the trophies of <a href=/people/11034 target=_blank>Giants</a>, and grim combats are depicted in blood-red scarlet.

'Tis the story of how, once upon a time, unfilial <a href=/people/10625 target=_blank>Scylla</a>, frenzied by love's portents, saw in the sky aloft strange gatherings of birds, and, mounting the heaven on slender pinion, hovered on azure wings above her home, paying this penalty, accursed one, for the crimson lock, and for the utter uprooting of her father's city. </p>                        </div>

But neither do <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s pages suffer us to credit this tale nor does he who is the pernicious source — of those poets' sundry mistakes.

Father <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a> himself had embraced the frightened maid on the lonely strand, and broken his conjugal vow to chaste <a href=/people/1147 target=_blank>Amphitrite</a>) beheld awful shapes plant themselves about her: — how often, alas! did she marvel and grow pale at her strange limbs! how often, alas! did she turn in terror from her own baying! but still long afterwards she exacted penalty, for when the delight of his consort was riding upon the deep, she herself confounded the savage sea with much blood — or whether, as 'tis said, seeing that she excelled all women in beauty, and in avarice made wanton havoc of her eager lovers, she of a sudden became fenced about with fell fishes and <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>, for that she, a woman, dared to defraud the powers divine, and to withhold from <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> the vow-appointed price, even the payment which a base harlot, encompassed by a thronging crowd of youths, and stirred with a wild and savage spirit, had imposed upon her lovers — that by this report she was with reason defamed, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367151LPac class=place long=15.131 lat=36.67>Pachynus</a> has learned and so bears witness, speaking by the lips of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>, queen of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347326PPal class=place long=32.5829 lat=34.7064>Old Paphos</a>: — whatsoever and howsoever each has spoken of such disastrous state, 'tis all dreams: rather let the <a href=/people/3559 target=_blank>Ciris</a> become known, and not a <a href=/people/10625 target=_blank>Scylla</a> — who was but one of many maidens. </p>                        </div>

This city the prince who in those days was eminent above others in arms, even <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a>, had ravaged and laid waste with his fleet, because <a href=/people/2654 target=_blank>Polyidos</a>, fleeing from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/356271IKar class=demonym long=27.1333 lat=35.5833>Carpathian</a> sea and the streams of Caeratea, had taken shelter in the ancestral home of <a href=/people/563 target=_blank>Nisus</a>. Seeking to win him back in war, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/351249UGor class=demonym long=24.95 lat=35.0594>Gortynian</a> hero was strewing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> land with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> arrows. But neither in that hour do the citizens, nor in that hour does the king himself, fear to strike down the troops that flock in hostile band to the walls, or valorously to blunt the spirit of the unconquered foe, since it is enough to remember the answer of the gods. For surmounting the king's head (wondrous to tell) uprose white hair (the temples were decked with laurel), and midway on its crown was a roseate lock. As long as this preserved its nature, so long had the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a>, voicing in unison their fixed will, given assurance that <a href=/people/563 target=_blank>Nisus</a>' country and kingdom would be secure. Thus all their care was centred in that hoary hair, which, adorned in wonted fashion, a golden buckle and close roll bound with a cicada's shapely clasp. </p>                        </div>

Not yet had the fire tasted the holy offerings; not yet had the priestess bathed in the wonted water and adorned her head with pale olive-leaves, when the ball slipped away from her hands, and as it rebounds the maiden runs forward. Would that thou hadst not been beguiled by play, and hadst not loosened the golden robe on thy slender body!

Yet shame so foul as this methought my countrymen might work me, should some mischance first disclose our alliance, and when their city walls were razed I, cruel one, alas! assailed their shrines with flames; but if thou wert victor, I deemed that the stars would change their courses ere thou shouldst do such deed to me, thy captive. Now, now 'tis wickedness that conquers all I Did I, forlorn one, love thee above my father's realm? Did I love thee? Yet 'tis not strange. A maiden, deceived by thy face — as I saw, how was I lost! how a fatal frenzy swept me away! — I did not deem that from that form of thine such guilt could spring.

But still she purposed not to clothe the gentle maid with scales for ever, or establish her amid treacherous fishes (all too greedy is <a href=/people/1147 target=_blank>Amphitrite</a>'s flock): rather she raised her aloft on airy wings, that she might live on earth as <a href=/people/3559 target=_blank>Ciris</a>, named from the deed wrought — <a href=/people/3559 target=_blank>Ciris</a>, more beauteous than <a href=/people/596 target=_blank>Leda</a>'s <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370224UAmy class=demonym long=22.4502 lat=37.0363>Amyclaean</a> swan.

First, the lovely face and those lips yearned for by many, and the broad brow's charm, began to grow together and to prolong the chin with a slender beak. Then, where on the head the line appeared that parts the hair in equal portions, lo! of a sudden, as if copying her sire's glory, on her crown a tuft waved its crimson crest, while soft plumes, blending varied hues, clothed her marble-white body with vesture of wings, and the feeble arms put forth long feathers. Then other parts and the legs, coloured with blushing crimson, an unfamiliar leanness overlaid with rough skin, and to the tender feet fastened sharp nails. And yet to succour the hapless maiden in this manner only was scarce worthy of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a>'s gentle spouse. Never hereafter did the eyes of her kin behold her tying back her purple fillets upon her golden head; no chamber, fragrant with Syrian spice, no home welcomed her; what, indeed, had she to do with home?
