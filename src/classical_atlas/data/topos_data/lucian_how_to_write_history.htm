It began with the whole population's exhibiting feverish symptoms, strongly marked and unintermittent from the very first attack. About the seventh day, the fever was relieved, in some cases by a violent flow of blood from the nose, in others by perspiration not less violent. The mental effects, however, were most ridiculous; they were all stage-struck, mouthing blank verse and ranting at the top of their voices. Their favourite recitation was the <a href=/people/691 target=_blank>Andromeda</a> of <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>; one after another would go through the great speech of <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a>; the whole place was full of pale ghosts, who were our seventh-day tragedians vociferating, O <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a>, who lord'st it over Gods and men, and the rest of it. This continued for some time, till the coming of winter put an end to their madness with a sharp frost. I find the explanation of the form it took in this fact: <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> was then the great tragic actor, and in the middle of the summer, during some very hot weather, he had played the <a href=/people/691 target=_blank>Andromeda</a> there; most of them took the fever in the theatre, and convalescence was followed by a relapse — into tragedy, the <a href=/people/691 target=_blank>Andromeda</a> haunting their memories, and <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a> hovering, <a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Gorgon</a>'s head in hand, before the mind's eye. Well, to compare like with like, the majority of our educated </p>                        </div>

I do not intend to write a history, or attempt actual narrative; I am not courageous enough for that; have no apprehensions on my account; I realize the danger of rolling the thing over the rocks, especially if it is only a poor little jar of brittle earthenware like mine; I should very soon knock against some pebble and find myself picking up the pieces. Come, I will tell you my idea for campaigning in safety, and keeping well out of range. Give a wide berth to all that foam and spray, and to the anxieties which vex the historian — that I shall be wise enough to do; but I propose to give a little advice, and lay down a few principles for the benefit of those who do venture.

But the truth is — you know it without my telling, old friend — , it is not a task to be lightly undertaken, or carried through without effort; no, it needs as much care as any sort of composition whatever, if one means to create 'a possession for ever,' as <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a> calls it. Well, I know I shall not get a hearing from many of them, and some will be seriously offended — especially any who have finished and produced their work; in cases where its first reception was favourable, it would be folly to expect the authors to recast or correct; has it not the stamp of finality? is it not almost a State document? Yet even they may profit by my words; we are not likely to be attacked again; we have disposed of all our enemies; but there might be a Celto-Gothic or an Indo-Bactrian war; then our friends' composition might be improved by the application of my measuring-rod — always supposing that they recognize its correctness; failing that, let them do their own mensuration with the old foot-rule; the doctor will not particularly mind, though all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410250PAbd class=place long=24.9833 lat=40.95>Abdera</a> insists on spouting the <a href=/people/691 target=_blank>Andromeda</a>. </p>                        </div>

This will include the manner of his beginning, the order in which he should marshal his facts, the questions of proportion, of discreet silence, of full or cursory narration, of comment and connexion. Of all that, however, later on; for the present we deal with the vices to which bad writers are liable. As to those faults of diction, construction, meaning, and general amateurishness, which are common to every kind of composition, to discuss them is neither compatible with my space nor relevant to my purpose.

It will be convenient, however, to refer by the way to a few illustrations in recent histories. Here is a serious fault to begin with. It is the fashion to neglect the examination of facts, and give the space gained to eulogies of generals and commanders; those of their own side they exalt to the skies, the other side they disparage intemperately. They forget that between history and panegyric there is a great gulf fixed, barring communication; in musical phrase, the two things are a couple of octaves apart. The panegyrist has only one concern — to commend and gratify his living theme some way or other; if misrepresentation will serve his purpose, he has no objection to that. History, on the other hand, abhors the intrusion of any least scruple of falsehood; it is like the windpipe, which the doctors tell us will not tolerate a morsel of stray food. </p>                        </div>

Poetry enjoys unrestricted freedom; it has but one law — the poet's fancy. He is inspired and possessed by the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>; if he chooses to <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> his car with winged steeds, or set others a-galloping over the sea, or standing corn, none challenges his right; his <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, with a single cord, may haul up earth and sea, and hold them dangling together — there is no fear the cord may break, the load come tumbling down and be smashed to atoms. In a complimentary picture of <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, there is nothing against his having <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>'s head and eyes, his brother <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>'s chest, <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>'s belt — in fact, the son of <a href=/people/126 target=_blank>Atreus</a> and <a href=/people/2136 target=_blank>Aerope</a> will naturally be an epitome of all Divinity; <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> or <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> or <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> could not singly or severally provide the requisite perfections. But, if history adopts such servile arts, it is nothing but poetry without the wings; the exalted tones are missing; and imposition of other kinds without the assistance of metre is only the more easily detected. It is surely a great, a superlative weakness, this inability to distinguish history from poetry; what, bedizen history, like her sister, with tale and eulogy and their attendant exaggerations? as well take some mighty athlete with muscles of steel, rig him up with purple drapery and meretricious ornament, rouge and powder his cheeks; faugh, what an object would one make of him with such defilements! </p>                        </div>

It is true, there is a school which makes a pretty division of history into the agreeable and the useful, and defends the introduction of panegyric on the ground that it is agreeable, and pleases the general reader. But nothing could be further from the truth. In the first place the division is quite a false one; history has only one concern and aim, and that is the useful; which again has one single source, and that is truth. The agreeable is no doubt an addition, if it is present; so is beauty to an athlete; but a <a href=/people/474 target=_blank>Nicostratus</a>, who is a fine fellow and proves himself a better man than either of his opponents, gets his recognition as a <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, however ugly his face may be; and if one opponent is the handsome <a href=/people/529 target=_blank>Alcaeus</a> himself — handsome enough to make <a href=/people/474 target=_blank>Nicostratus</a> in love with him, says the story — , that does not affect the issue.

There is flattery, indeed, ad nauseam, eulogy vulgar to the point of farce; but never without the logical trimmings; always that dialectical catechism. I confess it strikes me as a vulgarity also, hardly worthy of a philosopher with so long and white a beard, when he gives it in his preface as our ruler's special good fortune that philosophers should consent to record his actions; he had better have left us to reach that conclusion for ourselves — if at all. </p>                        </div>
