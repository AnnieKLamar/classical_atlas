Why do you delay? Do not be overcome while fearing each for himself and showing terror instead of courage. </p>                        </div>

We agree with the opinion of <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a>, all of us. <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> and <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a> Augusti, may the gods keep you! The gods have made you emperors; may the gods keep you! Save the senate from the bandits; we entrust you with the war against the bandits. 11 May the public enemy <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> and his son perish! Hunt down the public enemy. You are happy in the judgment of the senate, the state is happy in your rule. 12 What the senate has given you, perform stoutly; what the senate has given you, take gladly. </p>                        </div>

For the men of the crowd feared his strictness, which, they believed, was very welcome to the senate and very hostile to themselves. 3 And for this reason it came about, as we have related, that they demanded the youthful <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a> as their prince; and thus he was straightway entitled.

Thence, after handling them roughly, they started to hurry them through the centre of the city to the camp, 6 but when they learned that the Germans were following to defend them, they slew them both and left them in the middle of the street. 7 In the meantime <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a> Caesar was lifted up by the soldiers and hailed emperor (that is, Augustus), there being no one else at hand; and then, jeering at the senate and people, the soldiers betook themselves immediately to the Camp. 8 As for the German guard, not wishing to fight needlessly now that their Emperors were slain, they betook themselves to their quarters outside the city. </p>                        </div>

For never was anyone braver than <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> (or <a href=/people/11053 target=_blank>Pupienus</a>) or more kindly than <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a>, as one may see from the facts in the case. The senate did not choose unworthy men when it had the power. 2 And besides this, they were tested by many honours and offices, for the one was consul twice and prefect, the other consul and prefect, and they were advanced in years when they attained the sovereignty. They were beloved by the senate and even by the people, although the latter were slightly in awe of <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>. 3 This is the information we have gathered concerning <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, chiefly from the Greek author <a href=/people/3610 target=_blank>Herodian</a>. <br />4 Many, however, say that <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> was conquered at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a>, not by <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, but by the Emperor <a href=/people/11053 target=_blank>Pupienus</a>, and that it was he, also, who was slain with <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a>; they omit the name of <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> altogether. 5 Such is the ignorance, moreover, or the usage of these disputing historians, that many desire to call <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> the same as <a href=/people/11053 target=_blank>Pupienus</a>, although <a href=/people/3610 target=_blank>Herodian</a>, who wrote of his own lifetime, speaks of <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, not of <a href=/people/11053 target=_blank>Pupienus</a>, and <a href=/people/1445 target=_blank>Dexippus</a>, the Greek author, says that <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> and <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a> were made emperors against <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> after the two Gordians, and that <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> was conquered by <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, not by <a href=/people/11053 target=_blank>Pupienus</a>. 6 In addition to this, they show their ignorance by saying that the child <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a> was prefect of the guard, not knowing that he was often carried on a man's neck to be displayed to the soldiers. <br />7 <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> and <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a> reigned for one year, after <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> and his son had reigned for two years, according to some, for three according to others. </p>                        </div>

He did not fear death, he says, being trained in all the philosophical disciplines. <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, he declares, was not the sort of man that most of the Greeks said he was. 5 He adds that such was the hatred of the citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a> for <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> that they made strings for their bows from their women's hair, and thus shot their arrows. 6 <a href=/people/1445 target=_blank>Dexippus</a> and <a href=/people/3610 target=_blank>Herodian</a>, who investigated the history of these princes, say that <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> and <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a> were the princes selected by the senate to oppose <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> after the death of the two Gordians in Africa, and that the third <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a>, the child, was chosen with them. 7 In the majority of the Latin authors, however, I do not find the name of <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, and as emperor with <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a> I discover <a href=/people/11053 target=_blank>Pupienus</a>; indeed this same <a href=/people/11053 target=_blank>Pupienus</a> is said to have fought against <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a>, whereas, according to the testimony of the afore-mentioned writers, we are told that <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> did not even fight against <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> but remained at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> and there learned that the victory had been gained.

In it he rejoices that they had restored the state after it had been in the hands of wicked bandits. <br />2 <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> to the Emperors <a href=/people/11053 target=_blank>Pupienus</a> and <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a>. When first I learned that by choice of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> Optimus <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, of the immortal gods and of the senate, together with the agreement of all mankind, you had undertaken to preserve the state from the sins of that impious bandit and rule it in accordance with Roman law, my lords and most holy and unconquerable Augusti, when first I learned this, not yet from your own sacred proclamations but from the decree of the senate that my illustrious colleague <a href=/people/3007 target=_blank>Celsus</a> <a href=/people/3752 target=_blank>Aelianus</a> forwarded to me, I felicitated the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, that you had been chosen to preserve it; I felicitated the senate, that you, in returned for its choosing you, had restored to it its early dignity; I felicitated <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, that you are defending it particularly from spoliation by the enemy; I felicitated the provinces, torn in pieces by the insatiable greed of tyrants, that you are restoring them to some hope of safety; I felicitated the legions, lastly, and the auxiliaries, which now worship your images everywhere, that they have thrust away their former disgrace and have now, in your name, a worthy symbol of the Roman principate. 3 No voice will ever be so strong, no speech will ever be so happy, no talent will ever be so fortunate, as ever adequately to express the state's felicity. 4 How great this felicity is, and of what sort, we can see at the very beginning of your reign. You have restored Roman laws, you have restored justice that was abolished, mercy that was non-existent, life, morality, liberty, and the hope of heirs and successors. 5 It is difficult even to enumerate these things, 6 and much more to describe them with a fit dignity of speech. How shall I tell or describe how you have restored us our very lives, after that accursed bandit, sending the executioners everywhere throughout the provinces, had sought them to the point of openly confessing that he was enraged at our whole order, 7 especially when my insignificance cannot express even the personal rejoicing of my own mind, to say nothing of the public felicity, and when I behold as Augusti and lords of the human race those by the unwavering elegance of whose lives I would like my own conduct and sobriety to be approved as by the ancient censors? And though I might trust to have them approved by the attestation of former princes, 8 still I would glory in your judgment as a weightier one. May the gods preserve — and they will preserve — this felicity for the Roman world! For when I observe you, I can hope for nothing else than what the conqueror of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> is said to have implored of the gods, namely, that they preserve the state in the condition in which it was then, since no better one could be found. 9 And, therefore, I pray that they may preserve this state, that has tottered up to now, in the condition in which you have established it. </p>                        </div>
