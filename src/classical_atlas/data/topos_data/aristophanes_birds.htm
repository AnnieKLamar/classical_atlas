Why, nothing whatever but bite and scratch! — What's the matter with you then, that you keep opening your beak? Do you want us to fling ourselves headlong down these rocks?

Yes, spectators, our madness is quite different to that of Sacas. He is not a citizen, and would fain be one at any cost; we, on the contrary, born of an honourable tribe and family and living in the midst of our fellow-citizens, we have fled from our country as hard as ever we could go. 'Tis not that we hate it; we recognize it to be great and rich, likewise that everyone has the right to ruin himself; but the crickets only chirrup among the fig-trees for a month or two, whereas the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> spend their whole lives in chanting forth judgments from their law courts.

Firstly, black-winged <a href=/people/12253 target=_blank>Night</a> laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite deeps of <a href=/people/933 target=_blank>Erebus</a>, and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> with his glittering golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated in deep <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a> with dark <a href=/people/1434 target=_blank>Chaos</a>, winged like himself, and thus hatched forth our race, which was the first to see the light.

When the kite reappears, he tells of the return of spring and of the period when the fleece of the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> must be clipped. Is the swallow in sight?

Among us you can create yourself forefathers; you can always find relations. Does the son of <a href=/people/2343 target=_blank>Pisias</a> want to betray the gates of the city to the foe? Let him become a partridge, the fitting offspring of his father; among us there is no shame in escaping as cleverly as a partridge.

There is nothing more useful nor more pleasant than to have wings. To begin with, just let us suppose a spectator to be dying with hunger and to be weary of the choruses of the tragic poets; if he were winged, he would fly off, go home to dine and come back with his stomach filled. Some Patroclides in urgent need would not have to soil his cloak, but could fly off, satisfy his requirements, and, having recovered his breath, return. If one of you, it matters not who, had adulterous relations and saw the husband of his mistress in the seats of the senators, he might stretch his wings, fly thither, and, having appeased his craving, resume his place. Is it not the most priceless gift of all, to be winged? Look at <a href=/people/3016 target=_blank>Diitrephes</a>! His wings were only wicker-work ones, and yet he got himself chosen Phylarch and then Hipparch; from being nobody, he has risen to be famous; 'tis now the finest gilded cock of his tribe. </p>                        </div>

Out of love for the birds they repeat all the songs which concern the swallow, the teal, the goose or the pigeon; in each verse you see wings, or at all events a few feathers.

Do you want to dethrone your own father? <br />PISTHETAERUS: What an error! Why, the gods will be much more powerful if the birds govern the earth. At present the mortals are hidden beneath the clouds, escape your observation, and commit perjury in your name; but if you had the birds for your allies, and a man, after having sworn by the <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a> and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, should fail to keep his oath, the <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a> would dive down upon him unawares and pluck out his eye. <br />POSIDON: Well thought of, by <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>! <br />HERACLES: My notion too. </p>                        </div>

And no daughter would be that, if she had a legitimate brother. <br />HERACLES: But what if my father wished to give me his property on his death-bed, even though I be a bastard? <br />PISTHETAERUS: The law forbids it, and this same <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> would be the first to lay claim to his wealth, in virtue of being his legitimate brother. Listen; thus runs <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>'s law.
