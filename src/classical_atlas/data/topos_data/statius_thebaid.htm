Then he displays to heaven those empty orbs, the cruel, pitiful punishment of his life, and with blood-stained hands beats upon the hollow earth, and in dire accents utters this prayer: Gods who hold sway over guilty souls and over <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a> crowded with the damned, and thou O <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380222WSty class=place long=22.2039 lat=37.9836>Styx</a>, whom I behold, ghastly in thy shadowy depths, and thou <a href=/people/1495 target=_blank>Tisiphone</a>, so oft the object of my prayer, be favourable now, and further my unnatural wish: if in aught I have found favour; if thou didst cherish me in thy bosom when I fell from my mother's womb, and didst heal the wounds of my pierced feet; if I sought the lake of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384225PKir class=place long=22.4455 lat=38.4296>Cirrha</a> where it winds between the two summits of the range, when I could have lived contented with the false <a href=/people/1145 target=_blank>Polybus</a>, and in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=demonym long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocian</a> strait where three ways meet grappled with the aged king and cleft the visage of the trembling dotard, searching for my true sire; if by wit of the foreshowing I solved the riddles of the cruel <a href=/people/974 target=_blank>Sphinx</a>; if I knew exulting the sweet ecstasy and fatal union of my mother's bed, and passed many an unhallowed night, and begot sons for thee, as well thou knowest, yet soon, greedy for punishment, did violence to myself with tearing fingers and left my eyes upon my wretched mother — hear me to the end, if my prayer be worthy and such as thou wouldest inspire my ranging heart withal. Sightless though I was and driven from my throne, my sons, on whatever couch begotten, attempted not to give me guidance or consolation in my grief; nay, haughtily (ah! the maddening sting!) an raised to royalty with me long dead, they mock my blindness and abhor their father's groans.

Set on thy head the gore-drenched circlet that my bloody nails tore of, and inspired by their father's curses go thou between the brethren, and with the sword sunder the binding ties of kinship. Grant me, thou queen of <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a>' abyss, grant me to see the evil that my soul desires, nor will the spirit of the youths be slow to follow; come thou but worthy of thyself, thou shalt know them to be true sons of mine. </p>                        </div>

Even so would a farmer fain unite under the plough-yoke two picked bullocks of the savage herd, but they indignant — for not yet has the frequent coulter bowed those arching necks to the sinewy shoulders — pull contrariwise and with strength well-matched break harness and confound the furrows with divers tracks: not otherwise does furious discord enrage the proud brothers.

By a grudging law they bade their fortunes change, so that a new claimant should ever embitter the monarch's fast-expiring term. No other bond united the brethren, this was their sole stay from arms, nor destined to endure to a second reign. Yet then no ceilings glittered with thick plates of yellow gold, nor did quarried Grecian pillars bear aloft vast halls that could freely spread the serried mass of clients; no spears kept guard o'er a monarch's troubled slumbers, no sentinels groaned at the recurring duty of the watch; they thought not to entrust precious stones to the wine-cup, nor to soil gold with food; 'twas for naked power the brethren armed, a starveling realm was their cause of battle.

But the other was gentle to our prayers, affable of speech, and more patient of the right. What wonder? he was not alone.

Equally removed from hence is the whole world's extent, the abodes of east and west, and earth and sea outspread beneath the infinite sky. Loftily through their midst moves the King himself making all tremble, yet with countenance serene, and takes his seat on the starry throne: nor dare they sit, the heavenly ones, until the sire himself with tranquil hand permit them. Next a crowd of wandering demigods and Rivers, of one kin with the high clouds, and Winds, their clamours hushed by fear, throng the golden halls. The arching vaults of heaven are all agleam with majesty, the heights glow with a fuller radiance, and alight that is not of earth blooms upon the portals.

Lend me your hearing, and I will recount the tale. When that the god had smitten the dark and sinuous-coiling monster, the earth-born Pytho, who cast about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> his sevenfold grisly circles and with his scales ground the ancient oaks to powder, even while sprawling by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225WCas class=place long=22.505 lat=38.483>Castalia</a>'s fountain he gaped with three-tongued mouth athirst to feed his deadly venom: when having spent his shafts on numberless wounds he left him, scarce fully stretched in death over a hundred acres of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384225PKir class=demonym long=22.4455 lat=38.4296>Cirrhaean</a> soil, then, seeking fresh expiation of the dead, he came to the humble dwelling of our king <a href=/people/2678 target=_blank>Crotopus</a>. A daughter, in the first years of tender maidenhood, and wondrous fair, kept this pious home, a virgin chaste. How happy, had she ne'er kept secret tryst with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253SSan class=demonym long=25.2666 lat=37.4004>Delian</a>, or shared a stolen love with <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a>! For she suffered the violence of the god by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378227WNem class=place long=22.70945 lat=37.80614>Nemea's stream</a>, and when <a href=/people/3572 target=_blank>Cynthia</a> had twice five times gathered her circle's visage to the full, she brought forth a child, <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Latona</a>'s grandson, bright as a star. Then fearing punishment — for her sire would ne'er have pardoned a forced wedlock — she chose the pathless wilds, and stealthily among the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>-pens gave her child to a mountain-wandering guardian of the flock for nurture. No cradle worthy of a birth so noble, hapless infant, did thy grassy bed afford thee, or thy woven home of oaken twigs; enclosed in the fibre of arbutus-bark thy limbs are warm, and a hollow pipe coaxes thee to gentle slumbers, while the flock shares thy sleeping-ground. But not even such a home did the fates permit, for, as he lay careless and drinking in the day with open mouth, fierce ravening <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> mangled the babe and took their fill with bloody jaws. But when the tidings reached the mother's horror-struck ears, father and shame and fear were all forgot; herself straightway she fills the house with wild lamentation, all distraught, and baring her breast meets her father with her tale of grief. Nor is he moved, but bids her — Oh horrible! even as she desires, suffer grim death. </p>                        </div>

For he recalls that day, when by the hazard that favoured his brother he stood in <a href=/people/2870 target=_blank>Echion</a>'s palace stripped of power, and saw his cause deserted by the gods and his friends all slunk away in hurry and alarm, himself defenceless on every side and all his fortune fled.

Then nightly and day by day does he recount in order those whose joy he marked as he went forth, those who were foremost in flattery of the unjust prince, or whom he had himself seen to bewail his exile; anguish devours his mind, and furious wrath, and hope, than which the heart can bear no heavier burden, when 'tis long deferred.

But his faithful wife had marked his secret yearning to be gone, and lying on the couch in the first pale light of dawn, her arms about her lord, What thoughts of flight, she said, are these thou ponderest? nought escapes a lover's eye. I know thy wakeful complainings and thy bitter sighs, thy ever-troubled slumber. How often touching thee with my hand do I find this face all wet with tears, and thy breast loud groaning with thy weight of cares! 'Tis not the sundering of our marriage-bond that moves me, nor a widowed youth; although our love is still fresh, nor has our couch yet since the bridal lost he first glow of passion. 'Tis thy own safety, O beloved — I hasten to confess it — that wrings my heart.

Yea, Report, that is ever cunning to catch the mind of princes, tells that he is proud and arrogant in his stolen power, and ill-disposed to hear thee; nor had he yet reigned a full year. Terrified too am I now by soothsayers, now by entrails that speak of threatening gods, by flight of birds, or by disturbing visions of the night; and ah! never do I call to mind that <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a> came falsely to me in my dreams.

Then at last the Echionian youth brief-laughing consoled his wife's tender grief, and set timely kisses on her sorrowful cheeks and stayed her tears: Free thy mind of fear; prudent counsels, believe me, win peaceful days; cares beyond thy years become thee not. But should one day the Saturnian father take knowledge of my fate, and <a href=/people/194 target=_blank>Justice</a>, if she think at all to glance down from heaven and defend the right on earth: then perchance that day shall dawn for thee, when thou shalt see thy husband's walls, and go in queenly pomp through two cities. </p>                        </div>

The hero drew nigh the woods, and from a lofty mound sees the red gleam of warriors' shields and plumed helmets, where the forest boughs leave an open space, and through the opposing shade the flickering moonlight plays upon the brazen armour. Appalled at the sight he yet went onward; he but draws to him his spiky darts, and the sword sheathed to the hilt. Then first he makes question, in no base terror: Whence are ye, men, what mean ye lurking thus armed? No voice made answer, the suspicious silence holds no sure pledge of peace.

Nor waited they; but when he saw them, more than he thought, swarming up from countless lurking places, some issuing from the ridges, others in ever-growing numbers coming from the valley-depths, nor few upon the plain, as when the first cry drives the encircled quarry into the open, and the road all lit by gleams of armour, he makes for the heights of the dire <a href=/people/974 target=_blank>Sphinx</a> — the only path of safety in his bewilderment — and tearing his nails upon the sheer cliff he scales the dreadful steep and gains mastery of the rock, where he has security behind and a clear downward range of harm. Then he tears away from the rocks a huge boulder, that groaning bullocks scarce with full strength could move from the ground and drag up to the wall; then heaving with all his force he raises ands strives to poise the deadly mass: even as great-hearted Pholus lifted the empty mixing-bowl against his <a href=/people/721 target=_blank>Lapith</a> foes.

Her arrows whistle unseen through the wood, her <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> bay nightly, when she flies from her uncle's threshold and resumes afresh <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a>'s kindlier shape. Or when she is weary from her ranging on the hills, and the sun high in heaven invites sweet slumber, here doth she rest with head flung back carelessly on her quiver, while all her spears stand fixed in the earth around. Outside, of vast extent, stretches the Martian plain, the field that bore its harvest to <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a>. Hardy was he who first after the kindred warfare and the crime of those same furrows dared with the ploughshare till the soil and upturned the blood-soaked meads; even yet the accursed earth breathes mighty tumults at midday and in the lonely night's dim shadows, when the black sons of earth arise to phantom combat: with trembling limbs the husbandman flees and leaves the field unfinished, and his <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> hie them to their stalls, distraught. </p>                        </div>

Such misery is it to stand still, a thousand steps are lost ere they start, and, on the absent plain, their hooves ring loud. Around stand trusty friends, smoothing out the twisted tangled manes, and speak heartening words and give much counsel. The Tyrrhenian blast rang in their ears, and all leapt forward from their places.

Long expected, at last darts he forward, leaping lightly o'er the companies, and unfastens the twisted golden clasp of his cloak. His limbs shine forth, and all his graceful frame is revealed, his fine shoulders, and breast as smooth and comely ahs his cheeks, and his face was lost in his body's beauty. But he scorns the praise of his fairness, and suffers not admirers to come near him. Then he cunningly sets to work with the draughts of <a href=/people/429 target=_blank>Pallas</a>, and makes his skin tawny with rich oil. Thus do <a href=/people/719 target=_blank>Idas</a> and <a href=/people/1547 target=_blank>Dymas</a> and the rest shine sleek and glossy. So when the starlight glitters on a tranquil sea, and the spangled heaven is mirrored tremulous in the deep, brilliant is every star, but more brilliant than the rest does <a href=/people/1702 target=_blank>Hesperus</a> shoot his beams, and brightly as he flames in the high heavens, so bright is his reflection in the dark-blue waves. <a href=/people/719 target=_blank>Idas</a> is next in beauty, nor much slower in speed, next older too in years; but for him already has the palaestra's oil brought on the tender growth, and the down is creeping o'er his cheeks, nor yet confesses itself among the cloud of unshorn locks. Then they duly try their speed and sharpen up their paces, and by various arts and feigned excitement stir their languid limbs; now they sink down with bended knees, now smite with loud claps their slippery breasts, now ply their fiery feet in short sprint and sudden stop. </p>                        </div>

So when a cloud-encompassed mountain-side is loosened by the fresh storms of winter, or by irresistible decay of age, it crashes down upon the plain, a fearful terror, and sweeps away in many a track of ruin fields, husbandmen, and aged oaks, and at length, its furious rush exhausted, either scoops out a vale or bars a river in mid-course. Not otherwise does the chariot, burdened by the great warrior and the mighty god, drive furiously through many a scene of bloodshed. From his seat the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253SSan class=demonym long=25.2666 lat=37.4004>Delian</a> guides both reins and weapons, and instructs his aim; he turns aside hostile darts and cheats the flying javelins of their fortune. Menaleus on foot is overthrown, and <a href=/people/1866 target=_blank>Antiphus</a>, no whit defended by his lofty steed, and <a href=/people/2203 target=_blank>Aetion</a>, born of a nymph of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384228LHel class=place long=23.0154 lat=38.3207>Helicon</a>, and <a href=/people/1923 target=_blank>Polites</a>, ill-renowned for a brother's murder, and <a href=/people/2804 target=_blank>Lampus</a>, who tried to defile the couch of the priestess <a href=/people/1762 target=_blank>Manto</a>: against him <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a> with his own hand sped holy arrows. And now the horn-footed steeds snort at the corpses in alarm and probe the ground, and every wheel-track runs o'er bodies and reddens deep with severed limbs. Some the remorseless axle grinds unconscious, but others half-dead from wounds — and powerless to escape — see it as it draws nigh to crush them. Already the reins are wet with gore, the slippery care gives no foothold, blood clogs the wheels and trampled entrails hinder the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>' hooves: then the hero himself madly tears out darts abandoned in the slain and spears projecting from the midst of corpses: ghosts shriek and pursue the chariot. </p>                        </div>

Even so when a bark has lost its helmsman and stopped in mid-voyage, either the watchman of the sides or of the wave-breasting prow succeeds to the guidance of the widowed helm; the ship herself is all aghast, and the very tackling is slow to obey the word, nor does she brook the protection of a lesser lord. Therefore with spirited words the prophet rouses the hearts of the downcast <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a>: Chieftains, it is the high commands and awful counsels of the gods that I bring you; these words come not from my own breast; he gives the oracle, whom your solemn word, he too consenting, constrained me to serve and to assume his fillets. The divine augury reveals a night fruitful in achievement and well fitted for glory-winning guile; Valour meets and beckons us, and <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> implores our arms. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=demonym long=23.25 lat=38.35>Aonian</a> legions are sunk 'neath the spell of slumber: now is the time to avenge our princes' deaths and that unhappy day; snatch up your weapons and break through the hindering gates! This means the lighting of our comrade's pyres, this means their burial. This saw I during the battle of the day, when our arms were stricken and we fled defeated to the rear — I sear it by the tripods and the strange fate of my lost master — I saw it, and the birds around me sang a favouring strain. But now my belief is sure. Only now beneath the silent night he himself — himself, <a href=/people/284 target=_blank>Amphiaraus</a>! — rose up again from the chasm of earth, even as he was — the shades had touched his team alone — and came towards me: 'tis of no vain phantom of night, or vision of sleep that I tell. 'Wilt thou allow the idle sons of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378228WIna class=place long=22.744 lat=37.625>Inachus</a>,' he cries, ' — restore then those <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385226LPar class=demonym long=22.6219 lat=38.5354>Parnassian</a> wreaths, give me back my own gods! — to lose so favourable a night, degenerate one? Was it thus I taught thee all the secrets of the sky and the wandering flight of birds? Begone! for me at least take vengeance with the sword.' He spake, and seemed to raise his lance, and to drive me with all his chariot's force unto these doors. Arouse you, then, and use heaven's favour; this is no hand-to-hand slaying of the foe; his men lie prostrate, and ye may take your revenge. Will any come forward, ready to exalt themselves to mighty fame, while the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> allow?

Just now — was it not so? — the sound of a terrible din came down to you from the stars: me did that awful storm assail, 'twas I who mingling with the hero's fury-stricken arms laughed at the warring gods and the levin's mighty wrath.

Thou who still hast all thy rage, whose tresses are still riotous and fresh from <a href=/people/1315 target=_blank>Cocytus</a>' fount, join thou thy strength to mine. 'Tis no common fray or Martian battle that we prepare, but brothers — though kindly Faith and Duty resist, they will be o'ercome — ay, brothers shall draw the sword in combat hand-to-hand. A noble work! Gird we ourselves with deadly hate, with armed discord. Dost thou hesitate? Nay, choose which banner thou wilt bear. Both are compliant and will do our will; but the mob is double-minded, and I fear his mother's words and <a href=/people/1180 target=_blank>Antigone</a>'s persuasive tongue, lest they somewhat hinder our design. Ay, even he, who is wont to weary us with his entreaties and call on the <a href=/people/1744 target=_blank>Furies</a> to avenge his eyes, already feels his fatherhood; already they say he weeps alone, far from the haunts of men; ay, verily, I like not to invade <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a> and the abode I know so well without thy succour.
