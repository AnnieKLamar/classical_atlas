To prevent him appearing to be considered an enemy, if he was not permitted to enter, or acquitted, if he was admitted, a general law was passed that no king could be permitted to enter <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. <br />Consul <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> subdued the Alpine Gauls, consul Gaius <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a> <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=ethnic long=8.3 lat=44.3>Ligurians</a>. <br />Envoys of king <a href=/people/319 target=_blank>Prusias</a> complained that <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a> ravaged their territory and said that he conspired with <a href=/people/4420 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> [IV Epiphanes] against the Roman people. At their request, an alliance was concluded with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=ethnic long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodians</a>. <br />[164 BCE] The censors performed the lustrum ceremony. 337,022 citizens were registered.

It was said that a very large <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=demonym long=3 lat=36>Numidian</a> army, commanded by Arcobarzanes, son of <a href=/people/301 target=_blank>Syphax</a>, was on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> soil, and Marcus <a href=/people/756 target=_blank>Porcius</a> <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> argued that although this force was ostensibly directed against <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Massinissa</a>, it was in fact against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and that consequently, war had to be declared. Publius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/896 target=_blank>Nasica</a> defended the opposite, and it was agreed that envoys were to be sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, to see what was going on. They rebuked the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> Senate because it had, contrary to the treaty, collected an army and timber to build ships, and proposed to make peace between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> and <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Massinissa</a>, because <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Masinissa</a> was evacuating the contested piece of land. But <a href=/people/235 target=_blank>Hamilcar</a>'s son <a href=/people/1831 target=_blank>Gesco</a>, a riotous man who occupied an office, provoked the populace to wage war against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, so that when the [<a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a>] Senate announced it would comply with the Roman wishes, the envoys had to flee to escape violence. When they told this, they made the [Roman] Senate, already hostile towards the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>, even more hostile. <br />Marcus <a href=/people/756 target=_blank>Porcius</a> <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> gave his son, who had died during his praetorship, a cheap funeral according to his means (because he was poor). <br /><a href=/people/2206 target=_blank>Andriscus</a>, who pretended persistently that he was the son of <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Perseus</a>, the former king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, was sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. <br />Before he died, Marcus <a href=/people/116 target=_blank>Aemilius</a> <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>, who had been chosen as first among the senators by six pairs of censors, ordered his sons that they should carry his bier to the pyre covered with linens without purple, and they were not to spend more than a million for the remainder: the images [of ancestors] and not the expenditure should enhance the funerals of great men. <br />There was an investigation of poisonings. The noble women Publilia and <a href=/people/3035 target=_blank>Licinia</a> were accused of murdering their husbands, former consuls; after the hearing, they assigned real estate as bail to the praetor, but were executed by a decision of their relatives. <br /><a href=/people/4160 target=_blank>Gulussa</a>, the son of <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Massinissa</a>, told that a levy was conducted in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, a navy was being built, and that without any doubt, they were preparing for war. When <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> argued that war should be declared, and Publius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/896 target=_blank>Nasica</a> said that it was better to do nothing too fast, it was decided to send ten investigators. <br />[151 BCE] When consuls Lucius <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> and <a href=/people/1616 target=_blank>Aulus</a> <a href=/people/419 target=_blank>Postumius</a> <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> recruited their army with great strictness and favored no one with an exemption, they were imprisoned by the tribunes of the plebs, because they were unable to obtain exemptions for their friends. <br />The Spanish War had been waged unsuccessfully and resulted in such a great confusion among the Roman citizens that no one wanted to go there as tribune or commander, but Publius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> [Scipio] <a href=/people/1261 target=_blank>Aemilianus</a> came forward and said he would accept any kind of military task to which he should be assigned. This example gave everyone an appetite for war. <br />Although <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> appeared to have pacified all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403-29RCel class=demonym long=-2.9 lat=40.32>Celtiberian</a> nations, his successor consul <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> subdued the <a href=/people/12070 target=_blank>Vaccaeans</a> and <a href=/people/12072 target=_blank>Cantabrians</a> and several other hitherto unknown nations in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390000RIbe class=place long=-4 lat=39>Hispania</a>. Here, tribune Publius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> <a href=/people/1261 target=_blank>Aemilianus</a>, the son of Lucius [Aemilius] <a href=/people/1299 target=_blank>Paullus</a>, and the grandson of [Publius Cornelius Scipio] <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a> (although by adoption), killed a barbarian challenger, and added an even greater danger when the town of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420000UInt class=place long=-5.1833 lat=41.9833>Intercatia</a> was stormed, because he was the first to climb the wall. <br />Praetor <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a> unsuccessfully fought against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-83RLus class=ethnic long=-8.3 lat=39>Lusitanians</a>. <br />The envoys returned from Africa with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> ambassadors and <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Massinissa</a>'s son <a href=/people/4160 target=_blank>Gulussa</a>, saying they had seen how an army and navy were built in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, and it was decided to ask for opinions [of all senators]. While <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> and other influential senators argued that an army should immediately be sent to Africa, <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/896 target=_blank>Nasica</a> said that it still did not seem to be a justified war, and it was agreed to refrain from war if the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> would burn their ships and dismiss their army; if they did less, the next pair of consuls should put the Punic War on the agenda. <br />When a theater, contracted for by the censors, was built, Publius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/896 target=_blank>Nasica</a> was the author of a senatorial decree that this building, which was so useless and dangerous for the public morals, should be destroyed; for some time, the people had to stand to watch theatrical performances. <br />When the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> declared war upon <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Massinissa</a> and broke the treaty, they were beaten by this man (who was ninety-two years old and accustomed to eat and enjoy dry bread without a relish) and incurred a war against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. <br />It also contains an account of the situation in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> and the war waged between its kings.

It was decided to declare war on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, because the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> had, contrary to the treaty, ships, because they had sent an army outside their territory, because they had waged war against <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Massinissa</a>, an ally and friend of the Roman people, and because they had refused to receive in their city <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Massinissa</a>'s son <a href=/people/4160 target=_blank>Gulussa</a> (who had been with the Roman envoys). <br />Before any troops had boarded their ships, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371101UUti class=person long=10.0623 lat=37.0565>Utican</a> envoys came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, to surrender themselves and everything they owned.This embassy was received as a good omen by the senators, and as a bad omen in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. <br />The games of Dis Pater took place at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>, in accordance with the [Sibylline] Books. Similar festivities had taken place hundred year before, at the beginning of the First Punic War, in the five hundred and second year since the founding of the city. <br />Thirty envoys came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to surrender <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>'s opinion prevailed that the declaration of war was to be maintained and that the consuls, as had been agreed, would proceed to the front. When they had crossed into Africa, they received the three hundred hostages they had demanded and all the weapons and war engines that were in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, and demanded on the authority of the Senate that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> rebuilt their city on another site, which was to be no less than 15 kilometers from the sea. These offensive demands forced the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> to war. <br />The beginning of the siege and the attack of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> were organized by consuls Lucius <a href=/people/10971 target=_blank>Marcius</a> [Censorinus] and <a href=/people/382 target=_blank>Manius</a> <a href=/people/1949 target=_blank>Manilius</a>. During the siege, two tribunes rashly broke through a carelessly defended wall and suffered greatly from the inhabitants, but were relieved by <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> Orfitianus [Africanus]. With the help of a few cavalry, he also relieved a Roman fort that had been attacked by night, and he received the greatest glory from the liberation of Roman camps which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>, sallying in full force from the city, vigorously attacked. <br />Besides, when the consul (his colleague had returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> for the elections) led the army from the unsuccessful siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> against <a href=/people/144 target=_blank>Hasdrubal</a> (who had occupied with many troops an inaccessible pass), he convinced the consul first not to attack on this inaccessible place. However, the opinions of the others, who were jealous of his intelligence and valor, prevailed, and he entered the pass himself, and when -as he had predicted- the Roman army was defeated and routed and two subunits were besieged by the enemy, he returned with a few cavalry squadrons, relieved them, and brought them back unharmed. In the Senate, his valor was praised by even <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, a man whose tongue was better suited for criticism, but now said that the others fighting in Africa were mere spirits, whereas <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> was alive; and the Roman people received him with so much enthusiasm that most districts elected him as consul, although his age did not allow this. <br />When Lucius <a href=/people/1792 target=_blank>Scribonius</a>, a tribune of the plebs, proposed a law that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-83RLus class=ethnic long=-8.3 lat=39>Lusitanians</a>, who had surrendered to the Roman people but had been sold [into slavery] by <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> [Sulpicius] <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a> in Gaul, would be liberated, Marcus <a href=/people/756 target=_blank>Porcius</a> <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> supported him energetically. (His speech still exists and is included in his Annals.) Quintus <a href=/people/152 target=_blank>Fulvius</a> <a href=/people/2640 target=_blank>Nobilior</a>, who had often been assailed by <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> in the Senate, spoke for <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>; and <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a> himself, seeing that he was about to be condemned, embracing his two young sons and the son of <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a> <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a>, whose guardian he was, spoke so pitiably in his own defense, that the case was abandoned. (Three of his speeches still exist: two against tribune <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a> in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-83RLus class=demonym long=-8.3 lat=39>Lusitanian</a> case, and one against Lucius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/965 target=_blank>Cethegus</a>, in which he admits that during a truce, he had massacred the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-83RLus class=ethnic long=-8.3 lat=39>Lusitanians</a> near his camp because, as he explains, he had found out that they had sacrificed a man and a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, which according to their custom meant that they were preparing an attack.) <br />A certain <a href=/people/2206 target=_blank>Andriscus</a>, a man of the lowest kind, pretending to be a son of king <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Perseus</a>, changed his name into Philip, and secretly fled from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, to which king <a href=/people/1330 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> [I Soter] of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> had sent him, precisely because of this lie; many people were attracted by his false story (as if it were true), he gathered an army and occupied all of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, whether the people wanted it or not. <br />He told the following story: born as the son of king <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Perseus</a> and a courtesan, he had been handed over for education to a certain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a>, so that, in this situation of war against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, some scion of the royal stock would survive. Without knowledge of his family and believing that the man who taught him was his father, he had been educated at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395269Uadr class=place long=26.9346 lat=39.504>Adramyttion</a> until he was twelve years old. When this man fell ill and was close to the end of his life, he finally told <a href=/people/2206 target=_blank>Andriscus</a> about his origin and gave his mother a writing that had been sealed by king <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Perseus</a>, which she should give the boy when he reached maturity, and the teacher added that everything had to be kept secret until that moment. When he reached maturity, <a href=/people/2206 target=_blank>Andriscus</a> received the writing, from which he learned that his father had left him two treasures. Until then he had only known that he was a foster son and had been unaware about his real ancestry; now his foster mother told him about his lineage and begged him to avoid being assassinated by departing from the country before the news reached [king] <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a> [II Soter of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=place long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamon</a>], an enemy of <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Perseus</a>.

When a soldier was seen out of ranks, he had him beaten with vines when he was a Roman, or with rods if he was a foreigner. He sold all animals, so that they might not relieve the soldiers from their loads. He frequently fought successfully against enemy sallies.

When he had locked up <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418000UNum class=place long=-2.4442 lat=41.8095>Numantia</a> from all sides and noticed that the besieged suffered from hunger, he ordered that those enemies who went out to look for food should not be killed, because they would sooner exhaust their supplies if there were more of them. </p>                        </div>

Consul Gnaeus <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a> was killed and all noble members of the opposite party butchered, like Marcus <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> (a man of great eloquence), and Gaius and Lucius <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, whose heads were placed on the speaker's platform.

When we take everything into account, he had been a man about whom it was not easy to say whether he was more excellent in times of war than he was dangerous in times of peace. It can therefore be said that as much as he saved the state as a soldier, so much he damaged it as a citizen - first by his tricks, later by his revolutionary actions. </p>                        </div>
