With regard to this man, before I tell of his life, or rather of his death, I will set forth the reason why his father <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> gave to him too the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. 2 For there is not much to relate in the life of a man who was removed from human affairs before he could take the imperial power conjointly with his brother. <br />3 Once when <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Septimius Severus</a> asked about the future and prayed that it might be revealed to him who should be his successor when he died, he learned from a dream that an <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> would succeed him. 4 Whereupon he went at once to the army and gave <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a>, the elder of his sons, the name Marcus <a href=/people/11042 target=_blank>Aurelius</a> <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. 5 After this, when it was brought to his mind either by fatherly reflection, or, as some relate, by <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a> his wife, who was skilled in dreams, that by this action he himself had cut off his younger son from any chance of reigning, he ordered that <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>, his younger son, should also receive the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. 6 And so he always gave him this name in letters to members of his household, writing, whenever he chanced to be absent from home, 7 Give greetings to the Antonines, my sons and successors. But all his fatherly care was of no avail, for he was succeeded by that son alone who had first been given the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. So much about the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. </p>                        </div>

This he did out of love for Marcus, whom he always called his brother, and whose studies in philosophy and training in letters he always sought to imitate. 3 Some say, however, that it was not only in honour of Marcus that <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> gave his son the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, since this was Marcus' name by adoption only, but also in honour of him who bore the surname <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a>, <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>'s successor, I mean; 4 and, furthermore, the <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> gave it because it was this emperor who raised him from a pettifogger in the law courts to the post of pleader for the privy-purse, and the way to great advancement had been opened up to him by the happy augury of an appointment by <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> to the first step in his career, or rather his first public office; 5 and at the same time because no prince seemed to him more auspicious for lending his name, than the one whose personal name had now been borne by four of the emperors. <br />6 With regard to this same <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, on learning his horoscope — a study in which, like most Africans, he was very proficient — is said to have made the remark: 7 It seems to me strange, my dear Juvenalis, that our <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a> is destined to be a deified emperor, for in his horoscope I see nothing imperial. Now Juvenalis was his prefect of the guard. And <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> was not mistaken. 8 For when <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> had killed <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a> and was in fear of being branded as a tyrant because of his act of fratricide, he was told that his crime could be mitigated were he to give his brother the appellation of the Deified; he then remarked, it is said, 9 Let him be deified provided he is not alive. Accordingly, he placed him among the deified emperors and so came back into favour with a good reputation, fratricide though he was. </p>                        </div>

He was the son of <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a>, whom <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> married because he found out that her horoscope showed that she should be the wife of a king, while he was still only a subject, though he held even then an excellent place in the state. 2 Immediately after <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a> was born some one announced that a purple egg had been laid by a hen in the palace. 3 This egg was then brought in, and <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> his brother, seizing it, dashed it upon the ground, as a child would do, and broke it; whereupon <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a>, it is said, exclaimed in jest, Accursed fratricide, you have killed your brother. 4 But this, which was said as a jest, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> took more seriously than any of those who were present, though afterwards all who were there testified to it as uttered by divine inspiration. 5 There was also another omen. For on the very day and at the very hours when <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a> was born, there was born on the farm of a certain plebeian named <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a> which had purple wool on its forehead; thereupon the owner, learning from a soothsayer that after <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> an <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> should reign, interpreted the prophecy as referring to himself, but fearing any indication of so great a destiny, he thrust a knife in the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a>. 6 And this too was a sign that <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a> should be killed by <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, as became later abundantly clear. 7 There was, moreover, as was later shown by the outcome, another important prediction of the crime which indeed came to pass. 8 For when <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> was making ready to celebrate the birthday of the infant <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>, the sacrificial victim was slain by a boy named <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. 9 At the time no one looked for a hidden meaning in this or commented upon it, but later its importance was understood. </p>                        </div>

And when answer was made that they had, he remarked, Then there will be more in the state to mourn than to make merry at our victory. 4 And he would have carried his point, had not the prefect <a href=/people/10104 target=_blank>Plautianus</a>, or rather Juvenalis, stood out against him in the hope of proscriptions, for which they became enriched. They were also encouraged by the great brutality of <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a>. 5 He, in the course of his argument, urged, half in jest half in earnest, that all those of the opposite factions be slain together with their children; whereupon <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>, it is said, exclaimed, You, who spare no one, are capable even of killing your brother — a remark which received no attention then, but afterwards passed for an omen. </p>                        </div>

He was ever mindful of his father's sayings, always regarded by his brother with hatred, more affectionate than his brother toward their mother, speaking with a stammer though his voice was melodious. 2 He was very fond of bright clothing — so much so, in fact, that his father would laugh at him. Whatever he received from his parents he used for his own adornment, and he never gave presents to any. <br />3 After the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> war, his father, who was then at the height of his glory and had named <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> partner in the imperial power, gave <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a> the name of Caesar and, according to some, of <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> also. <br />4 It was a common practice of his to propound puzzles to the grammarians, asking them to characterize the cries of the different animals, as for example: 5 the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a> bleats, the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> squeals, the dove coos, the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>hog</a> grunts, the bear growls, the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> roars, the leopard snarls, the elephant trumpets, the <a href=/people/10983 target=_blank>frog</a> croaks, the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> neighs, the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> brays, the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> bellows; and in proof he would cite the ancient writers. 6 His favourite books were the works of <a href=/people/2931 target=_blank>Serenus</a> Sammonicus, addressed to him by <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. 7 He was accustomed, moreover, to have skilful slaves serve meals, and especially dinners, according to a single letter of the alphabet, as, for instance, one in which there were 8 goose, gammon, and gadwall, or, again, pullet, partridge, <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peacock</a>, pork, poisson, <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>'s-thigh, and other kinds of food beginning with this letter, or pheasant, farina, figs and so forth.

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi2331.phi014:6'><b>&sect; 6</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;After the murder of <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>, those soldiers who had not been bribed received the news of the fratricide with anger, and all declared they had sworn allegiance to both sons and ought to maintain it to both. They then closed the gates of the Camp and for a long time the Emperor was not admitted. 2 And not until he had quieted their anger by bitter words about <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a> and by giving them great sums of money, was <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> able to return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. 3 Next, <a href=/people/11055 target=_blank>Papinian</a> and many others besides, who had either desired concord or had been partisans of <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>, were killed; men of both senatorial and equestrian rank were slain while in the bath, or at table, or in the street, and <a href=/people/11055 target=_blank>Papinian</a> himself was struck down with an axe, whereupon <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> found fault that the business had not been done with a sword. 4 At last matters came to the point of a mutiny among the city-troops; <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a>, however, brought them to order with no light hand, and their tribune was put to death, as some relate, or, as others, sent into exile. 5 Yet <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> himself was in such fear that he entered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>Senate-house</a> wearing a cuirass under his broad-striped tunic and thus clad rendered an account of his actions and of the death of <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>. 6 It was at this time, too, it is said, that <a href=/people/1885 target=_blank>Helvius</a> <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>, the son of <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>, afterwards killed by <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a>, remarked to the praetor <a href=/people/5664 target=_blank>Faustinus</a>, who was reading aloud and had uttered the titles <a href=/people/10226 target=_blank>Sarmaticus</a> <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> and Parthicus <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, Add to these also Geticus <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, that is to say, Gothicus. 7 This remark sank deep into the heart of <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a>, as was afterwards proved by his murder of <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>, and not of <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> alone, but, as we have said before, of many others as well, far and wide and with utter injustice. He suspected <a href=/people/1885 target=_blank>Helvius</a>, moreover, of aspiring to the imperial office, merely because he was loved by all and was the son of <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> the Emperor — a combination none too safe for any man content to remain a commoner. </p>                        </div>
