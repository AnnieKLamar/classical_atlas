He invaded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a>, and other countries that had revolted from his ancestors, and performed many exploits, from which he was named <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> the Great. Elated by his successes, and by the title which he had derived from them, he invaded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335360RCSy class=place long=36 lat=33.5>Coele-Syria</a> [-198] and a portion of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> and took them away from <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> <a href=/people/1172 target=_blank>Philopator</a> [<a href=/people/1219 target=_blank>Epiphanes</a>], king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, who was still a boy.

Then he crossed over to Europe, brought <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> under his sway, and reduced by force those who would not obey him.

But the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403267UPit class=place long=26.6992 lat=40.3467>Lampsacus</a>, and some others who still resisted, sent ambassadors to <a href=/people/149 target=_blank>Flamininus</a>, the Roman general, who had lately overthrown <a href=/people/35 target=_blank>Philip</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=person long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> in a great battle in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>; for the affairs of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> and of the Greeks were closely linked together at certain times and places, as I have shown in my Grecian history. Accordingly, certain embassies passed between <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> and <a href=/people/149 target=_blank>Flamininus</a> and tested each other to no purpose. The Romans and <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> had been suspicious of each other for a long time, the former surmising that he would not keep quiet because he was so much puffed up by the extent of his dominions and the acme of fortune that he had reached. <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, on the other hand, believed that the Romans were the only people who could put a stop to his increase of power and prevent him from passing over to Europe. Still, there was no outward cause of enmity between them until ambassadors came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> from <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> <a href=/people/1172 target=_blank>Philopator</a> complaining that <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> had taken <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> away from him. The Romans gladly seized this occasion as one well suited to their purposes, and sent to <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> ostensibly to bring about a reconciliation between him and <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, but really to find out his designs and to check him as much as they could. </p>                        </div>

We are wholly at a loss to know, he said, why <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> should come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a> bringing such a fleet and such an army from the upper country to the Asiatic coast, make an incursion into Europe, build cities there, and subdue <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, unless these are the preparations for another war. <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> replied that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> had belonged to his ancestors, that it had fallen away from them when they were occupied elsewhere, and that he had resumed possession because he had leisure to do so. He had built <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405268ULys class=place long=26.769 lat=40.5114>Lysimacheia</a> as the future seat of government of his son <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>. He would leave the Greek cities of Asia independent if they would acknowledge the gratitude therefor as due to himself and not to the Romans. I am a relative of <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, he said, and I shall be his father-in-law, although I am not so now, and I will see to it that he renders gratitude to you. I am at a loss to know by what right you meddle with the affairs of Asia when I never interfere with those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>.

He was now a fugitive from his own country on account of the accusations of his enemies, who reported to the Romans that he was hostile to them, that he wanted to bring on a war, and that he could never enjoy peace. This was a time when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> were leagued with the Romans by treaty. <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> received <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> in a magnificent manner on account of his great military reputation, and kept him near himself. At <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=place long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycia</a> he learned that <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> was alive.

Lucius was repulsed from Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388225UTei class=place long=22.5239 lat=38.7845>Tichius</a> by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=ethnic long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aetolians</a>, who at that place fought well, but <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, who moved against Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388226FKal class=place long=22.5775 lat=38.7824>Callidromus</a>, fell upon the enemy while they were still asleep, about the last watch. Nevertheless there was a stiff fight here, as he was obliged to climb over high rocks and precipices in the face of an opposing enemy. Meantime <a href=/people/382 target=_blank>Manius</a> was leading his army against <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>' front in straight lines, as this was the only way possible in the narrow pass. The king placed his light-armed troops and peltasts in front of the phalanx, and drew up the phalanx itself in front of the camp, with the archers and slingers on the right hand next to the foot-hills, and the elephants, with the guard that always accompanied them, on the left near the sea. </p>                        </div>

Not knowing how large <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>'s force was, it was magnified to their minds by terror. Fearing for the safety of their camp they fled to it in disorder, with the intention of defending it against the enemy. But the Romans were close at their heels and entered the camp with them.

The enemy being three to one grappled him contemptuously with iron hooks, and when the ships were fastened together the battle was fought as though it were on land. The Romans, being much superior in valor, sprang upon the enemy's ships, overpowered them, and returned, bringing back two ships captured simultaneously by one. This was the prelude to the naval engagement. When the fleets came together the Romans had the best of it by reason of their bodily strength and bravery, but on account of the unwieldy size of their ships they could not capture the enemy, who got away with their nimble craft, and, by rapid flight, took refuge in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>.

When their commander, <a href=/people/1154 target=_blank>Diophanes</a>, from the wall saw the soldiers of <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> sporting and drinking in a contemptuous way, he urged the Pergameans to join him in a sally against the enemy. As they would not agree to this he armed his 1000 foot and his 100 <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, led them out of the city under the wall, and stood there quietly. The enemy derided him for a long time on account of the smallness of his force and because he did not dare to fight, but he fell upon them while they were taking their dinner, threw them into confusion, and put their advance guard to flight.

The <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipios</a> in council gave this answer to <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a>, If <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> wishes peace he must surrender not only the cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390271RAio class=place long=27.1 lat=39>Aeolia</a>, but all of Asia this side of Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a>, and pay the whole cost of the war incurred on his account.

Behind these were 10,000 <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> allies, and both these divisions were in files in triple line of battle.

Altogether they were about 30,000 strong. <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> took his station on the right wing and placed the consul in the centre.

Nevertheless, they presented their thick-set pikes on all four sides. They challenged the Romans to close combat and preserved at all times the appearance of being about to charge. Yet they did not advance, because they were foot-soldiers and heavily armed, and saw that the enemy were mounted. Most of all they feared to relax their close formation lest they might not readily bring it together again. The Romans did not come to close quarters nor approach them because they feared the discipline, the solidity, and the desperation of this veteran corps; but circled around them and assailed them with javelins and arrows, none of which missed their mark in the dense mass, who could neither turn the missiles aside nor dodge them. After suffering severely in this way they yielded to necessity and fell back step by step, but with a bold front, in perfect order and still formidable to the Romans.

But a military tribune, the prefect of the camp, hastened to meet him with a body of fresh troops and checked his advance, and the fugitives took new courage from their comrades and rallied.

The Senate ratified their acts, and a treaty was written carrying out <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>'s views, a few things being added or made plain that had been left indefinite.

When he began to speak he made no mention of the accusation against him, but detailed the events of his life, what he had done, the wars he had waged for his country, how he had carried on each, and how often he had been victorious. It delighted the listeners to hear this grand discourse. When he came to the overthrow of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> he was roused to the highest pitch of eloquence and filled the multitude, as well as himself, with noble rage, saying, On this very day, O citizens, I won the victory and laid at you feet <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, that had lately been such an object of terror to you.

The crowd followed him, including most of the judges, with joyful acclamations, which were continued while he was performing the sacrifice. The accusers were nonplussed and did not dare to call him to trial again, as that was to no purpose, or to charge him with demagogism, because they knew that his whole life had been above the reach of suspicion or calumny. </p>                        </div>

He was tried last. I acknowledge, he said, that I retained the command beyond my time, contrary to law, and that I coerced those whom you have just acquitted. Nor do I deprecate the death penalty, since I have broken the law.

The judges, moved to shame by the speech, and to admiration of the defence, and to reverence for the man who had spoken, did not wait to take the vote, but ran out of the court-room.

The first satrap of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> was Laomednon of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391265PMyt class=person long=26.5621 lat=39.1114>Mitylene</a>, who derived his authority from <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a> and from <a href=/people/740 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, who succeeded the latter as prime minister. To this <a href=/people/781 target=_blank>Laomedon</a>, <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, the satrap of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, came with a fleet and offered him a large sum of money if he would hand over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> to him, because it was well situated for defending <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and for attacking <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>. When <a href=/people/781 target=_blank>Laomedon</a> refused <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> seized him. <a href=/people/781 target=_blank>Laomedon</a> bribed his guards and escaped to <a href=/people/738 target=_blank>Alcetas</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=place long=28.7 lat=37.01>Caria</a>.

When the soothsayers were alarmed at this prodigy, thinking that it portended delay, <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, the son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, who accompanied the expedition, said that an anchor was a sign of safety, not of delay. For this reason <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>, when he became king, used an engraved anchor for his signet-ring. Some say that while <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was still alive and looking on, another omen of the future power of <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> was made manifest in this wise.

They say, also, that when the <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magi</a> were ordered to indicate the propitious day and hour for beginning the foundations of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/331445USel class=place long=44.5263 lat=33.101>Seleucia-on-the-Tigris</a> they falsified as to the hour because they did not want to have such a stronghold built against themselves. While the king was waiting in his tent for the appointed hour, and the army, in readiness to begin the work, stood quietly till <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> should give the signal, suddenly, at the true hour of destiny, they seemed to hear a voice ordering them on. So they sprang to their work with such alacrity that the heralds who tried to stop them were not able to do so. When the work was brought to an end <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>, being troubled in his mind, again made inquiry of the <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magi</a> concerning his city, and they, having first secured a promise of impunity, replied, That which is fated, O King, whether it be for better or worse, neither man nor city can change, for there is a fate for cities as well as for men. It pleases the gods that this city shall endure for ages, because it was begun on the hour on which it was begun. We feared lest it should be a stronghold against ourselves, and falsified the appointed time. Destiny is stronger than crafty <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magi</a> or an unsuspecting king. For that reason the deity announced the more propitious hour to the army. It is permitted you to know these things so surely that you need not suspect us of deception still, for you were presiding over the army yourself, as king, and you had yourself ordered them to wait; but the army, ever obedient to you in facing danger and toil, could not now be restrained, even when you gave them the order to stop, but sprang to their work, not a part of them merely, but all together, and their officers with them, thinking that the order had been given. In fact it had been given. That was the reason why not even you could hold them back. What can be stronger in human affairs than a king, unless it be a god, who overcame your intention and supplanted us in giving you directions about the city; for the god is in hostility to us and to all the people round about? What can our resources avail hereafter with a more powerful race settled along side of us? This city of yours has had a fortunate beginning, it will be great and enduring. We beg that you will confirm your pardon of our fault which we committed from fear of the loss of our own prosperity. The king was pleased with what the <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magi</a> said and pardoned them.

If this seems noble and kingly on his part, even nobler and wiser was his behavior in reference to his son's falling in love, and his self-restraint in suffering; for <a href=/people/2146 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> was in love with <a href=/people/1082 target=_blank>Stratonice</a>, the wife of <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>, his own stepmother, who had already borne a child to <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>. Recognizing the wickedness of this passion, <a href=/people/2146 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> did nothing wrong, nor did he show his feelings, but he fell sick, took to his bed, and longed for death. Nor could the celebrated physician, <a href=/people/763 target=_blank>Erasistratus</a>, who was serving <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> at a very high salary, form any diagnosis of his malady. At length, observing that his body was free from all the symptoms of disease, he conjectured that this was some condition of the mind, through which the body is often strengthened or weakened by sympathy. <a href=/people/1975 target=_blank>Grief</a>, anger, and other passions disclose themselves; love only is concealed by the modest. As <a href=/people/2146 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> would confess nothing when the physician asked him in confidence, he took a seat by his side and watched the changes of his body to see how he was affected by each person who entered his room. He found that when others came the patient was all the time weakening and wasting away at a uniform pace, but when <a href=/people/1082 target=_blank>Stratonice</a> came to visit him his mind was greatly agitated by the struggles of modesty and conscience, and he remained silent. But his body in spite of himself became more vigorous and lively, and when she went away he became weaker again. So the physician told <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> that his son had an incurable disease. The king was overwhelmed with grief and cried aloud. Then the physician added, His disease is love, love for a woman, but a hopeless love. </p>                        </div>

Desiring to learn only one thing more, he asked, Who is this woman? <a href=/people/763 target=_blank>Erasistratus</a> replied, He is in love with my wife. Well then, my good fellow, rejoined <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>, since you are so bound to us by friendship and favors, and are a model of goodness and wisdom in matters of small moment, will you not save this princely young man for me, the son of your friend and king, unfortunate in love but virtuous, who has concealed his sinful passion and prefers to die rather than confess it? Do you so despise <a href=/people/2146 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>? Do you despise his father also? Then <a href=/people/763 target=_blank>Erasistratus</a> changed his tactics, and, as though he were giving him a knock-down argument, said, You would not give <a href=/people/2146 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> your wife if he were in love with her, although you are his father. <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> swore by all the gods of his royal house that he would willingly and cheerfully give her, and make himself an illustrious example of a kind and good father to a chaste son who controlled his passion and did not deserve such suffering.

Then he assembled his army, which was perhaps expecting something of the kind, and told them of his exploits and of the extent of his empire, showing that it surpassed that of any of the other successors of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, and saying that as he was now growing old it was hard for him to govern it on account of its size. I wish, he said, to divide it, and so at the same time to provide for your safety in the future and give a part of it now to those who are dearest to me. It is fitting that all of you, who had advanced to such greatness of dominion and power under me since the time of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, should cooperate with me in everything.
