He took a great number of the neighbouring inhabitants into the city; he chose a hundred of the older men, by whose advice he might manage all his affairs, and whom, from their age, he named senators. Next, as both himself and his people were in want of wives, he invited the tribes contiguous to the city to an exhibition of games, and seized upon their young women. Wars having arisen in consequence of this outrage in capturing the females, he conquered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419126UCae class=ethnic long=12.6135 lat=41.9228>Caeninenses</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125UAnt class=ethnic long=12.5006 lat=41.9375>Antemnates</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420126UCru class=ethnic long=12.5482 lat=42.0127>Crustumini</a>, the <a href=/people/11083 target=_blank>Sabines</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420125UFid class=ethnic long=12.5123 lat=41.9784>Fidenates</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420124UVei class=ethnic long=12.3897 lat=42.0233>Veientes</a>; all whose towns lay around the city. And since, after a tempest that suddenly arose, in the thirty-seventh year of his reign, he was no longer to be seen, he was believed to have been translated to the gods, and was accordingly deified. The senators then ruled at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> by periods of five days; and under their government a year was passed. </p>                        </div>

His reign was of no striking character; he acted, in many respects, with gentleness and moderation, in some with cruelty and folly. He made war upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>, which no Roman since Julius <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had visited; and, having reduced it through the agency of Cnaeus <a href=/people/2257 target=_blank>Sentius</a> and <a href=/people/1616 target=_blank>Aulus</a> <a href=/people/2183 target=_blank>Plautius</a>, illustrious and noble men, he celebrated a magnificent triumph.

So condescending, too, was he towards some of his friends, that he even attended <a href=/people/2183 target=_blank>Plautius</a>, a man of noble birth, who had obtained many signal successes in the expedition to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>, in his triumph, and walked at his left hand when he went up to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>. He lived to the age of sixty-four, and reigned fourteen years; and after his death was consecrated and deified. <br />To him succeeded NERO, who greatly resembled his uncle <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a>, and both disgraced and weakened the Roman empire; he indulged in such extraordinary luxury and extravagance, that, after the example of Caius <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a>, he even bathed in hot and cold perfumes, and fished with golden nets, which he drew up with cords of purple silk. He put to death a very great number of the senate. To all good men he was an enemy. At last he exposed himself in so disgraceful a manner, that he danced and sung upon the stage in the dress of a harp-player and tragedian. He was guilty of many murders, his brother, wife, and mother, being put to death by him. He set on fire the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, that he might enjoy the sight of a spectacle such as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> formerly presented when taken and burned. <br />In military affairs he attempted nothing. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a> he almost lost; for two of its most noble towns were taken and levelled to the ground under his reign.

But being in dread, as long as he remained in the east, of a rival for the imperial dignity, he thought too little of his glory. After marching from thence, accordingly, and directing bis course towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, he died suddenly on the borders of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401330RGal class=place long=33 lat=40.1>Galatia</a>. He was a man, in other parts of his conduct, deficient neither in energy nor understanding. </p>                        </div>

He died in the seventh month of his reign, on the 18th of April, in the thirty-third year of his age, and, by the kindness of the emperors that succeeded him, was enrolled among the gods; for he was inclined to equity, and liberal by nature. <br />Such was the state of the Roman empire in the consulship of the Emperor <a href=/people/2887 target=_blank>Jovian</a> and <a href=/people/5310 target=_blank>Varronianus</a>, in the year one thousand, one hundred and nineteen from the foundation of the city.
