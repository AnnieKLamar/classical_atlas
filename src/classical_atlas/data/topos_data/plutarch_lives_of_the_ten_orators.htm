Having attained to competent measure of knowledge and eloquence, — and that, as some believe, from his own natural ingenuity, — he dedicated his study chiefly to affairs of state. And yet he was for some time conversant in the schools, and had a controversy with <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> the philosopher about the art of disputing, — not so much for the sake of contention as for the profit of arguing, as <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> tells us in his Commentaries of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>. At the request of some citizens, he wrote orations by which they defended their suits at law. </p>                        </div>

He is most accurate in his orations, in invention subtle; and he would frequently baffle his adversary at unawares, by a covert sort of pleading; in troublesome and intricate matters he was very judicious and sharp; and as he was a great admirer of ornamental speaking, he would always adapt his orations to both law and reason.

He is reported to have composed some of his tragedies alone, and others with <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> the tyrant.

But after some time, thinking that art not worth his while, he betook himself to the study and teaching of oratory.

He likewise had another against <a href=/people/197 target=_blank>Hippocrates</a> the general; who did not appear on the day appointed for his trial, and was condemned in his absence. </p>                        </div>
