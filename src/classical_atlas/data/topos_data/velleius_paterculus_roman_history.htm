For two years <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Perses</a> had kept up the struggle with the consuls with such varying fortune that he generally had the advantage in these conflicts, and succeeded in winning over a large part of Greece to ally itself with his cause. 2 Even the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=ethnic long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodians</a>, who in the past had been most loyal to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, were now wavering in their fidelity, and, watching his success, seemed inclined to join the king's side. In this war King <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a> maintained a neutral attitude, neither following the initiative of his brother nor his own established custom. 3 Then the senate and the Roman people chose as consul Lucius <a href=/people/10991 target=_blank>Aemilius Paulus</a>, who had previously triumphed, both in his praetorship and in his consulship, a man worthy of the highest praise that can be associated with valour. He was a son of the <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> who had met death at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413162UCan class=place long=16.1515 lat=41.2964>Cannae</a> with a fortitude only equalled by his reluctance to begin a battle so disastrous to the republic. 4 <a href=/people/10991 target=_blank>Paulus</a> defeated <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Perses</a> in a great battle at a city in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> named <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404226PPyd class=place long=22.6173 lat=40.3973>Pydna</a>, put him to rout, despoiled his camp, destroyed his forces, and compelled him in his desperate plight to flee from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>. Abandoning his country, <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Perses</a> took refuge in the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405255PSam class=place long=25.5348 lat=40.5039>Samothrace</a>, as a suppliant entrusting himself to the inviolability of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405255SMeg class=place long=25.5301 lat=40.5008>temple</a>. 5 There Gnaeus <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, the praetor in command of the fleet, reached him and persuaded him by argument rather than force to give himself up to the good faith of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. Thus <a href=/people/10991 target=_blank>Paulus</a> led in triumph the greatest and the most illustrious of kings. In this year two other triumphs were celebrated: that of <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, the praetor in charge of the fleet, and that of <a href=/people/1345 target=_blank>Anicius</a>, who drove before his triumphal chariot <a href=/people/1112 target=_blank>Gentius</a>, King of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a>. 6 How inseparable a companion of great success is jealousy, and how she attaches herself to the most eminent, may be gathered from this fact: although no one raised objections to the triumphs of <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a> and <a href=/people/1345 target=_blank>Anicius</a>, there were those who tried to place obstacles in the way of that of <a href=/people/10991 target=_blank>Paulus</a>. His triumph so far exceeded all former ones, whether in the greatness of King <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Perses</a> himself, or in the display of statues and the amount of money borne in the procession, that <a href=/people/10991 target=_blank>Paulus</a> contributed to the treasury two hundred million sesterces, and by reason of this vast sum eclipsed all previous triumphs by comparison. </p>                        </div>

One will scarcely find a man of any race, or any age, or any rank, whose happy fortune is comparable with that of <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>. 6 For, not to mention his surpassing triumphs, the great honours which he held, his supreme position in the state, the length of his life, and the bitter struggles on behalf of the state which he waged with his enemies without damage to his reputation, he reared four sons, saw them all reach man's estate, left them all surviving him and held in the highest honour. 7 These four sons bore the bier of their dead father to its place in front of the rostra; one was an ex-consul and ex-censor, the second an ex-consul, the third was actually consul, and the fourth was then a candidate for the consulship, an office which he duly held.

He was a man whose virtues resembled those of his grandfather, Publius <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a>, and of his father Lucius <a href=/people/10991 target=_blank>Paulus</a> (he was, as has been already said, the son of <a href=/people/10991 target=_blank>Paulus</a>, and had been adopted by the son of Publius <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>) — endowed with all the qualities essential to a good soldier and a good citizen, the most eminent man of his day both in native ability and acquired knowledge, who in his whole life was guilty of no act, word, or thought that was not praiseworthy. He had already received in Spain the mural crown, and in Africa the corona obsidionalis for his bravery, and while in Spain he had challenged and slain an enemy of great stature though himself a man of but ordinary physical strength. 4 The war against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> begun by the consuls two years previously he now waged with greater vigour, and destroyed to its foundations the city 5 which was hateful to the Roman name more because of jealousy of its power than because of any offence at that time. He made <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> a monument to his valour — a city which had been a monument to his grandfather's clemency. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, after standing for six hundred and seventy-two years, was destroyed in the consulship of Gnaeus <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> and Lucius <a href=/people/782 target=_blank>Mummius</a>, one hundred and seventy-three years from the present date. 6 This was the end of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, the rival of the power of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, with whom our ancestors began the conflict in the consulship of <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> and <a href=/people/152 target=_blank>Fulvius</a> two hundred and ninety-two years before you entered upon your consulship, Marcus <a href=/people/4740 target=_blank>Vinicius</a>.

Just as animals of different species when shut in the same pen or other enclosure still segregate themselves from those which are not of their kind, and gather together each in its own group, so the minds that have had the capacity for distinguished achievement of each kind have set themselves apart from the rest by doing like things in the same period of time. 3 A single epoch, and that only of a few years' duration, gave lustre to tragedy through three men of divine inspiration, <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a>, <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>, and <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>.

Although he was a cousin of <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a>, he set his country before all ties of blood, choosing to regard as contrary to his private interests everything that was not for the public weal, a quality which earned for him the distinction of being the first man to be elected <a href=/people/12031 target=_blank>pontifex maximus</a> in absentia. He held no public office at this time and was clad in the toga. Wrapping the fold of his toga about his left forearm he stationed himself on the topmost steps of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> and summoned all those who wished for the safety of the state to follow him. 2 Then the optimates, the senate, the larger and better part of the equestrian order, and those of the plebs who were not yet infected by pernicious theories rushed upon <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a> as he stood with his bands in the area of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> and was haranguing a throng assembled from almost every part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>.

From this time on right was crushed by might, the most powerful now took precedence in the state, the disputes of the citizens which were once healed by amicable agreements were now settled by arms, and wars were now begun not for good cause but for what profit there was in them. Nor is this to be wondered at; 4 for precedents do not stop where they begin, but, however narrow the path upon which they enter, they create for themselves a highway whereon they may wander with the utmost latitude; and when once the path of right is abandoned, men are hurried into wrong in headlong haste, nor does anyone think a course is base for himself which has proven profitable to others. </p>                        </div>

The third was consumed in preparation for this war. In this year Gnaeus <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, the tribune of the people, passed a law that the priests, who had previously been chosen by their colleagues, should now be elected by the people. 4 In his fourth consulship <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> met the <a href=/people/4314 target=_blank>Teutons</a> in battle beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> in the vicinity of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435054UCol class=place long=5.4473 lat=43.5319>Aquae Sextiae</a>. More than a hundred and fifty thousand of the enemy were slain by him on that day and the day after, and the race of the <a href=/people/4314 target=_blank>Teutons</a> was exterminated. 5 In his fifth consulship the consul himself and the proconsul Quintus <a href=/people/1512 target=_blank>Lutatius</a> <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a> fought a most successful battle on this side of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> on the plain called the Raudian Plain. More than a hundred thousand of the enemy were taken or slain. By this victory <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> seems to have earned some claim upon his country that it should not regret his birth and to have counterbalanced his bad by his good deeds. 6 A sixth consulship was given him in the light of a reward for his services.

The knights had acquired this prerogative through the legislation of <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a>, and had treated with severity many noted men who were quite innocent, and, in particular, had brought to trial on a charge of extortion and had condemned, to the great sorrow of all the citizens, Publius <a href=/people/1250 target=_blank>Rutilius</a>, one of the best men not only of his age, but of all time. But in these very measures which <a href=/people/330 target=_blank>Livius</a> undertook on behalf of the senate he had an opponent in the senate itself, which failed to see that the proposals he also urged in interest of the plebs were made as a bait and a sop to the populace, that they might, by receiving lesser concessions, permit the passage of more important measures. 3 In the end it was the misfortune of <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> to find that the senate gave more approval to the evil measures of his colleagues than to his own plans, however excellent, and that it spurned the dignity which he would confer it only to accept tamely the real slights levelled against it by the others, tolerating the mediocrity of his colleagues while it looked with jealous eyes upon his own distinction. </p>                        </div>

He considered that his duty was to crush the enemy before taking vengeance upon citizens, and that after he had repelled the menace of the foreigner and won a victory in this way abroad, he should then prove himself the master in a war at home. 5 Before Lucius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>'s arrival <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a> was slain in a mutiny of his army. He was a man who deserved to die by the sentence of his victorious enemies rather than at the hands of his angry soldiers. Of him one can truly say that he formed daring plans, such as no good citizen would have conceived, and that he accomplished what none but a most resolute man could have accomplished, and that he was foolhardy enough in the formulation of his plans, but in their execution a man. <a href=/people/669 target=_blank>Carbo</a> remained sole consul throughout the year without electing a colleague in the place of <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a>. </p>                        </div>

But peace could not be to the liking of men whose cause was wicked and whose cupidity was unbounded. 2 In the meantime <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>'s army was daily growing, for all the better and saner citizens flocked to his side. By a fortunate issue of events he overcame the consuls <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> and <a href=/people/1374 target=_blank>Norbanus</a> near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>. <a href=/people/1374 target=_blank>Norbanus</a> was defeated in battle, while <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, deserted and betrayed by his army, was allowed by <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> to go unharmed. 4 So different was <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> the warrior from <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> the victor that, while his victory was in progress he was mild and more lenient than was reasonable, but after it was won his cruelty was unprecedented. For instance, as we have already said, he disarmed the consul and let him go, and after gaining possession of many leaders including Quintus <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a>, so soon to become the firebrand of a great war, he dismissed them unharmed. The reason, I suppose, was that we might have a notable example of a double and utterly contradictory personality in one and the same man. <br />It was while <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> was ascending Mount <a href=/people/3269 target=_blank>Tifata</a> that he had encountered Gaius <a href=/people/1374 target=_blank>Norbanus</a>. After his victory over him he paid a vow of gratitude to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a>, to whom that region is sacred, and consecrated to the goddess the waters renowned for their salubrity and water to heal, as well as all the lands in the vicinity. The record of this pleasing act of piety is witnessed to this day by an inscription on the door of the temple, and a bronze tablet within the edifice. </p>                        </div>

In addition the goods of the proscribed were sold, and their children were not only deprived of their fathers' property but were also debarred from the right of seeking public office, and to cap the climax of injustice, the sons of senators were compelled to bear the burdens and yet lose the rights pertaining to their rank. </p>                        </div>

Seven years before this, <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, at the conclusion of his consulship, had obtained the proconsulship of <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, and had been placed in command against <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>.

That he had not put an end to the war was due, one might say, to lack of inclination rather than of ability; for although in all other respects he was a man of laudable character and in war had scarcely ever been defeated, he was a victim to the love of money. He was still engaged in carrying on the same struggle when <a href=/people/1949 target=_blank>Manilius</a>, tribune of the people, a man of venal character always, and ready to abet the ambitions of others, proposed a law that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> should be given the chief command in the <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridatic</a> war. 2 The law was passed, and the two commanders began to vie with each other in recriminations, <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> charging <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> with his unsavoury greed for money, and <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> taunting <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> with his unbounded ambition for military power. Neither could be convicted of falsehood in his charge against the other. 3 In fact <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, from the time when he first took part in public life, could not brook an equal at all. In undertakings in which he should have been merely the first he wished to be the only one. No one was ever more indifferent to other things or possessed a greater craving for glory; he knew no restraint in his quest for office, though he was moderate to a degree in the exercise of his powers. Entering upon each new office with the utmost eagerness, he would lay them aside with unconcern, and, although he consulted his own wishes in attaining what he desired, he yielded to the wishes of others in resigning it. 4 As for <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, who was otherwise a great man, he was the first to set the example for our present lavish extravagance in building, in banquets, and in furnishings. Because of the massive piles which he built in the sea, and of his letting the sea in upon the land by digging through mountains, <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> used to call him, and not without point, the Roman <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>. </p>                        </div>

All fair-minded men desired that both <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> should disband their armies. Now <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> in his second consulship had caused the provinces of Spain to be assigned to him, and though he was actually absent from them, administering the affairs of the city, he continued to govern them for three years through his lieutenants, <a href=/people/847 target=_blank>Afranius</a> and <a href=/people/1898 target=_blank>Petreius</a>, the former of consular and the latter of praetorian rank; and while he agreed with those who insisted that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> should dismiss his army, he was opposed to those who urged that he should also dismiss his own. 2 Had <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> only died two years before the outbreak of hostilities, after the completion of his theatre and the other public buildings with which he had surrounded it, at the time when he was attacked by a serious illness in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a> and all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> prayed for his safety as her foremost citizen, fortune would have lost the opportunity of overthrowing him and he would have borne to the grave unimpaired all the qualities of greatness that had been his in life. 3 It was Gaius <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>, however, a tribune of the people, who, more than anyone else, applied the flaming torch which kindled the civil war and all the evils which followed for twenty consecutive years. <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> was a man of noble birth, eloquent, reckless, prodigal alike of his own fortune and chastity and of those of other people, a man of the utmost cleverness in perversity, who used his gifted tongue for the subversion of the state. 4 No wealth and no pleasures sufficed to satiate his appetites. He was at first on the side of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, that is to say, as it was then regarded, on the side of the republic. Then he pretended to be opposed both to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, but in his heart he was for <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. Whether his conversion was spontaneous or due to a bribe of ten million sesterces, as is reported, we shall leave undetermined. 5 Finally, when a truce was on the point of being concluded on terms of the most salutary character, terms which were demanded in a spirit of the utmost fair-mindedness by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and accepted by <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> without protest, it was in the end broken and shattered by <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> in spite of <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>'s extraordinary efforts to preserve harmony in the state. <br />As to the order of these events, and of those which have been mentioned before, the reader is referred to the special works of other historians, and I myself hope some day to give them in full. 6 But at the present time it will be consistent with the general plan of this briefer narrative if I merely stop to congratulate Quintus <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>, the two <a href=/people/4188 target=_blank>Luculli</a>, <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, and <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>, who, after flourishing in public life without envy and rising to pre-eminence without danger to themselves, in the course of nature died a peaceful or at least a not untimely death before the outbreak of the civil wars. </p>                        </div>

This great and formidable war had been stirred up by Gnaeus <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, the son of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> Magnus, a young man of great energy in war, and reinforcements flowed in from all parts of the world from among those who still followed his father's great name. 3 <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s usual fortune followed him to Spain; but no battle in which he ever engaged was more bitterly fought or more dangerous to his cause. Once, indeed, when the fight was now more than doubtful, he leapt from his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, placed himself before his lines, now beginning to give way, and, after upbraiding fortune for saving him for such an end, announced to his soldiers that he would not retreat a step. He asked them to consider who their commander was and in what a pass they were about to desert him. 4 It was shame rather than valour that restored their wavering line, and the commander showed more courage than his men. Gnaeus <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, badly wounded, was discovered on a pathless waste and put to death. <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a> and <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> met their death in battle. </p>                        </div>

After he had filled the office of praetor, the province of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> fell to his lot, where he was honoured with the title of imperator.

At the age of eighteen <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> followed <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> to Spain in his campaign there, and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> kept him with him thereafter as his companion, allowing him to share the same roof and ride in the same carriage, and though he was still a boy, honoured him with the pontificate. 4 When the civil war was over, with a view to training his remarkable talents by liberal studies, he sent him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407195PApo class=place long=19.4727 lat=40.7215>Apollonia</a> to study, with the intention of taking him with him as his companion in his contemplated wars with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435268RGet class=ethnic long=26.8 lat=43.5>Getae</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>. 5 At the first announcement of his uncle's death, although the centurions of the neighbouring legions at once proffered their own services and those of their men, and <a href=/people/1905 target=_blank>Salvidienus</a> and <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> advised him to accept the offer, he made such haste to arrive in the city that he was already at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> when he learned the details of the assassination and the terms of his uncle's will. 6 As he approached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> an enormous crowd of his friends went out to meet him, and at the moment of his entering the city, men saw above his head the orb of the sun with a circle about it, coloured like the rainbow, seeming thereby to place a crown upon the head of one destined soon to greatness. </p>                        </div>

He preferred to trust the judgement concerning himself of a great-uncle who was <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, rather than that of a stepfather, saying that he had no right to think himself unworthy of the name of which <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had thought him worthy. 3 On his arrival, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, the consul, received him haughtily — out of fear, however, rather than contempt — and grudgingly gave him, after he had secured admission to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s gardens, a few moments' conversation with himself; and it was not long before <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> began wickedly to insinuate that an attempt had been made upon his life through plots fostered by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>.

But, when they had once left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> behind them, by deliberate agreement and without government sanction they had taken possession of provinces and armies, and under the pretence that the republic existed wherever they were, they had gone so far as to receive from the quaestors, with their own consent, it is true, the moneys which these men were conveying to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> from the provinces across the sea. 4 All these acts were now included in the decrees of the senate and formally ratified. <a href=/people/412 target=_blank>Decimus</a> <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> was voted a triumph, presumably because, thanks to another's services, he had escaped with his life. <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> and <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a> were honoured with a public funeral. 5 Of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> not a word was said. The senate even went so far as to instruct its envoys, who had been sent to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s army, to confer with the soldiers alone, without the presence of their general. But the ingratitude of the senate was not shared by the army; for, though <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself pretended not to see the slight, the soldiers refused to listen to any orders without the presence of their commander. 6 It was at this time that <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, with his deep-seated attachment for the Pompeian party, expressed the opinion, which said one thing and meant another, to the effect that <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> should be commended and then — elevated. </p>                        </div>

Marcus <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> was charged with constructing the ships, collecting soldiers and rowers, and familiarizing them with naval contests and manoeuvres. He was a man of distinguished character, unconquerable by toil, loss of sleep or danger, well disciplined in obedience, but to one man alone, yet eager to command others; in whatever he did he knew no such thing as delay, but with him action went hand in hand with conception. 2 Building an imposing fleet in lakes <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141WAve class=place long=14.0822 lat=40.8393>Avernus</a> and Lucrinus, by daily drills he brought the soldiers and the oarsmen to a thorough knowledge of fighting on land and at sea.

This delayed finishing the war, which, however, was subsequently carried on with shifting and sometimes doubtful fortune. 4 For <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s fleet was again buffeted by a storm in the same locality, and although the issue was favourable in the first naval battle, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382152PMyl class=place long=15.2404 lat=38.2194>Mylae</a>, under the leadership of <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, a serious defeat was received near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379153PTau class=place long=15.2921 lat=37.8523>Tauromenium</a> beneath the very eyes of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, in consequence of the unexpected arrival of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s fleet, and <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s own person was endangered.

After losing not less than a fourth part of his soldiers, he was saved through the fidelity and by the suggestion of a captive, who was nevertheless a Roman. This man had been made prisoner in the disaster to the army of <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>, but had not changed his allegiance with his fortune. He came by night to a Roman outpost and warned them not to pursue their intended course but to proceed by a detour through the forest. 3 It was this that saved Marcus <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> and his many legions; and yet, even so, not less than a fourth part of these soldiers and of his entire army was lost, as we have already stated, and of the camp-followers and slaves a third, while hardly anything of the baggage was saved.

For a period of two hundred years the struggle was kept up with so much bloodshed on both sides that the Roman people, by the loss of its commanders and armies, often suffered disgrace, and sometimes its empire was really endangered. 3 These, namely, were the provinces that brought death to the <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipios</a>; that taxed the endurance of our ancestors in the disgraceful ten years' war under <a href=/people/1797 target=_blank>Viriathus</a>; that shook the Roman people with the panic of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418000UNum class=demonym long=-2.4442 lat=41.8095>Numantine</a> war; here occurred the disgraceful surrender of Quintus <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, whose terms the senate disavowed, and the more shameful capitulation of <a href=/people/1752 target=_blank>Mancinus</a>, which was also disavowed, and its maker ignominiously handed over to the enemy; it was Spain that destroyed so many commanders who were consulars or praetorians, and which in the days of our fathers raised <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> to such a height of power that for a period of five years it was not possible to decide whether there was greater strength in the arms of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390000RIbe class=person long=-4 lat=39>Spaniard</a> or the Roman, and which of the two peoples was destined to obey the other. 4 These, then, were the provinces, so extensive, so populous, and so warlike, which <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, about fifty years ago, brought to such a condition of peace, that whereas they had never before been free from serious wars, they were now, under the governorship of Gaius <a href=/people/1531 target=_blank>Antistius</a> and then of Publius <a href=/people/1117 target=_blank>Silius</a> and of their successors, exempt even from brigandage. </p>                        </div>

This title of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> was deservedly given him on the motion of <a href=/people/505 target=_blank>Plancus</a> with the unanimous acclaim of the entire senate and the Roman people. 2 Yet there were those who did not like this prosperous state of affairs. For example, Lucius <a href=/people/12001 target=_blank>Murena</a> and <a href=/people/1133 target=_blank>Fannius</a> <a href=/people/1001 target=_blank>Caepio</a> had entered into a plot to assassinate <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, but were seized by state authority and themselves suffered by law what they had wished to accomplish by violence.

Securing the favour of the people in his aedileship by putting out fires with his own gang of slaves, he increased it daily to such an extent that the people gave him the praetorship immediately after the aedileship. It was not long before he dared to become a candidate for the consulship, but he was overwhelmed by the general knowledge of his shameless deeds and crimes, and the state of his property came to be as desperate as his mind. Therefore, collecting about him men of his own kind, he resolved to assassinate <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> in order that he might die after getting rid of him whose existence was not compatible with his own. 4 Such men are so constituted that each would prefer to fall in a general cataclysm than to perish alone, and, though suffering the same fate in the end, to be less conspicuous in dying. He, however, was not more successful than the rest in concealing his designs, and after being thrust into prison with his fellow conspirators, died the death his life richly deserved. </p>                        </div>

When the two armies were united, that is to say the troops which had served under <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and those which had come to reinforce him, and there were now gathered together in one camp ten legions, more than seventy cohorts, fourteen troops of cavalry and more than ten thousand veterans, and in addition a large number of volunteers and the numerous cavalry of the king — in a word a greater army than had ever been assembled in one place since the civil wars — all were finding satisfaction in this fact and reposed their greatest hope of victory in their numbers. 2 But the general, who was the best judge of the course he pursued, preferring efficiency to show, and, as we have so often seen him doing in all his wars, following the course which deserved approval rather than that which was currently approval, after keeping the army which had newly arrived for only a few days in order to allow it to recover from the march, decided to send it away, since he saw that it was too large to be managed and was not well adapted to effective control. 3 And so he sent it back whence it came, escorting it with his own army on a long exceedingly laborious march, whose difficulty can hardly be described. His purpose in this was, on the one hand, that no one might dare to attack his united forces, and, on the other, to prevent the united forces of the enemy from falling upon the departing division, through the apprehension of each nation for its own territory. Then returning himself to <a href=/people/4691 target=_blank>Siscia</a>, at the beginning of a very hard winter, he placed his lieutenants, of whom I was one, in charge of the divisions of his winter quarters. </p>                        </div>

Throughout the whole period of the German and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=demonym long=19 lat=45>Pannonian</a> war there was not one of us, or of those either above or below our rank, who fell ill without having his health and welfare looked after by <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Caesar</a> with as much solicitude indeed as though this were the chief occupation of his mind, preoccupied though he was by his heavy responsibilities. 2 There was a horsed vehicle ready for those who needed it, his own litter was at the disposal of all, and I, among others, have enjoyed its use. Now his physicians, now his kitchen, and now his bathing equipment, brought for this one purpose for himself alone, ministered to the comfort of all who were sick. All they lacked was their home and domestic servants, but nothing else that friends at home could furnish or desire for them. 3 Let me also add the following trait, which, like the others I have described, will be immediately recognized as true by anyone who participated in that campaign. <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Caesar</a> alone of commanders was in the habit of also travelling in the saddle, and, throughout the greater portion of the summer campaign, of sitting at the table when dining with invited guests. Of those who did not imitate his own stern discipline he took no notice, in so far as no harmful precedent was thereby created. He often admonished, sometimes gave verbal reproof, but rarely punishment, and pursued the moderate course of pretending in most cases not to see things, and of administering only occasionally a reprimand. </p>                        </div>

Here I can merely lament the disaster as a whole. 2 An army unexcelled in bravery, the first of Roman armies in discipline, in energy, and in experience in the field, through the negligence of its general, the perfidy of the enemy, and the unkindness of fortune was surrounded, nor was as much opportunity as they had wished given to the soldiers either of fighting or of extricating themselves, except against heavy odds; nay, some were even heavily chastised for using the arms and showing the spirit of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. Hemmed in by forests and marshes and ambuscades, it was exterminated almost to a man by the very enemy whom it had always slaughtered like <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, whose life or death had depended solely upon the wrath or the pity of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. 3 The general had more courage to die than to fight, for, following the example of his father and grandfather, he ran himself through with his sword. 4 Of the two prefects of the camp, Lucius Eggius furnished a precedent as noble as that of Ceionius was base, who, after the greater part of the army had perished, proposed its surrender, preferring to die by torture at the hands of the enemy than in battle. Vala Numonius, lieutenant of <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a>, who, in the rest of his life, had been an inoffensive and an honourable man, also set a fearful example in that he left the infantry unprotected by the cavalry and in flight tried to reach the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> with his squadrons of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. But fortune avenged his act, for he did not survive those whom he had abandoned, but died in the act of deserting them. 5 The body of <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a>, partially burned, was mangled by the enemy in their barbarity; his head was cut off and taken to <a href=/people/3422 target=_blank>Maroboduus</a> and was sent by him to <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; but in spite of the disaster it was honoured by burial in the tomb of his family. </p>                        </div>

When was the price of grain more reasonable, or when were the blessings of peace greater? The Pax <a href=/people/964 target=_blank>Augusta</a>, which has spread to the regions of the east and of the west and to the bounds of the north and of the south, preserves every corner of the world safe from the fear of brigandage. 4 The munificence of the emperor claims for its province the losses inflicted by fortune not merely on private citizens, but on whole cities. The cities of <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> have been restored, the provinces have been freed from the oppression of their magistrates. Honour ever awaits the worthy; for the wicked punishment is slow but sure; fair play has now precedence over influence, and merit over ambition, for the best of emperors teaches his citizens to do right by doing it, and though he is greatest among us in authority, he is still greater in the example which he sets. </p>                        </div>

In the case of these men their lack of lineage was no obstacle to their elevation to successive consulships, triumphs, and numerous priesthoods. For great tasks require great helpers, 2 and it is important to the state that those who are necessary to her service should be given prominence in rank, and that their usefulness should be fortified by official authority. 3 With these examples before him, <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius Caesar</a> has had and still has as his incomparable associate in all the burdens of the principate <a href=/people/1081 target=_blank>Sejanus</a> <a href=/people/499 target=_blank>Aelius</a>, son of a father who was among the foremost in the equestrian order, but connected, on his mother's side, with old and illustrious families and families distinguished by public honours, while he had brothers, cousins, and an uncle who had reached the consulship. He himself combined with loyalty to his master great capacity for labour, and possessed a well-knit body to match the energy of his mind; 4 stern but yet gay, cheerful but yet strict; busy, yet always seeming to be at leisure. He is one who claims no honours for himself and so acquires all honours, whose estimate of himself is always below the estimate of others, calm in expression and in his life, though his mind is sleeplessly alert. </p>                        </div>

With what sagacity did he draw to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> <a href=/people/3681 target=_blank>Rhascupolis</a>, the slayer of his brother's son <a href=/people/530 target=_blank>Cotys</a> who shared the throne with him; in this transaction <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> employed the rare services of <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a>, a consular, and a man born to carry out tasks requiring accurate discrimination, and who by his straightforward character also deserved glory though he never sought it. 2 With what dignity did he listen to the trial of <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a>, not in the capacity of emperor, but as a senator and a judge! How swiftly did he suppress that ingrate in his plot for revolution! How well had <a href=/people/2619 target=_blank>Germanicus</a> been trained under his instructions, having so thoroughly learned the rudiments of military science under him that he was later to welcome him home as conqueror of <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a>! What honours did he heap upon him, young though he was, making the magnificence of his triumph to correspond to the greatness of his deeds! 3 How often did he honour the people with largesses, and how gladly, whenever he could do so with the senate's sanction, did he raise to the required rating the fortunes of senators, but in such a way as not to encourage extravagant living, nor yet to allow senators to lose their rank because of honest poverty! With what honours did he send his beloved <a href=/people/2619 target=_blank>Germanicus</a> to the provinces across the seas! With what effective diplomacy, carried out though the help and agency of his son <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>, did he force <a href=/people/3422 target=_blank>Maroboduus</a>, who clung to the limits of the territories he had seized as a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> to his hole, to come forth like the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> under the spell of his salutary charms — a simile which I use with no disrespect to <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. With what honour does he treat him while at the same time he holds him securely! With what wonderful swiftness and courage did he repress the formidable war, stirred up at the instigation of <a href=/people/10202 target=_blank>Sacrovir</a> and <a href=/people/1425 target=_blank>Florus</a> <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a>, so that the Roman people learned that he had conquered before they knew he was engaged in war, and the news of victory preceded the news of the danger! 4 The African war also, which caused great consternation and grew more formidable every day, was soon extinguished under his auspices and in accordance with his plans. </p>                        </div>

For a feeling of kinship leads him to protect every famous monument. 2 With what generosity at the time of the recent fire on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LCae class=place long=12.4957 lat=41.8836>Caelian</a> Hill, as well as on other occasions, did he use his private fortune to make good the losses of people of all ranks in life! And the recruiting of the army, a thing ordinarily looked upon with great and constant dread, with what calm on the part of the people does he provide for it, and without any of the usual panic attending conscription! 3 If either nature permits, or man's weak faculties allow, I may dare to make this plaint to the gods: How has this man deserved, in the first place, to have <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a> enter upon a traitorous conspiracy against him, or later to earn the hostility of <a href=/people/1117 target=_blank>Silius</a> and <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, though in the one case he created his rank, and in the other he increased it? Passing on to greater trials — although he regarded these as great enough — how did he deserve the loss of his sons in their prime or of his grandson, the son of <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>? Thus far I have told of sorrows only, 4 we must now come to the shame. With what pain, Marcus <a href=/people/4740 target=_blank>Vinicius</a>, have the past three years rent his heart! With what fire, the more cruel because pent up, was his soul consulted because of the grief, the indignation, and the shame he was forced to suffer through his daughter-in-law and his grandson! His sorrow at this time was crowned by the loss of his mother, 5 a woman pre-eminent among women, and who in all things resembled the gods more than mankind, whose power no one felt except for the alleviation of trouble or the promotion of rank. </p>                        </div>
