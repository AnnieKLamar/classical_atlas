But, brushing aside these requirements, I have reflected that even in the sacrifices the suppliants at the altars present offerings not all of the same value. Some seek to show themselves worthy of participating with the gods by offering whole <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> and <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>, not to mention the composition of hymns in prose or verse; while others, having nothing similar to offer, present only cakes, a few grains of incense, or a short invocation, and are none the less favorably heard. Moved by these reflections, and besides fearing to fail the gods, as says <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s <a href=/people/1631 target=_blank>Ibycus</a>, but here rather to fail this great sage; also, by my attitude, to assure myself the praises of the world, — for all these reasons, I have decided that it was for me an obligation to relate in writing some of the high and numerous qualities which the philosopher exemplified in his life, and to relate them in all their truth. <br />I indeed feared that it was not an act of piety to remain silent, I alone among his friends, and to omit relating the truth about him, within the limits of my ability, when the duty to speak is particularly mine; and while even among men generally I might be misunderstood, had I not undertaken this task they might believe that I refrained not from modesty, but from laziness, or worse. </p>                        </div>

For I believe that he has been the happiest of all men whose happiness has for centuries been celebrated. Nor am I speaking merely of the happiness which is allotted to sages, although that also he enjoyed to the fullest extent; nor because he had all the physical advantages which permit the enjoyment of life; nor of the happiness of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> which most people prize, and with which Chance most unusually favored <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a>, in as he disposed of unusually large resources, — but I am referring to a complete and perfect happiness, to which absolutely nothing was lacking, and which combined both conditions of felicity. </p>                        </div>

This blessed man possessed them all naturally since his birth, which could be clearly seen in his exterior wrapper, which we carry as the oyster does his shell. <br />First, he possessed an extreme delicacy of the senses, which may be called 'corporeal wisdom,' especially of our noblest senses, sight and hearing, which were given by the gods to man so that he might devote himself to philosophy, and to enjoy the sweetness of well-being. Our philosopher preserved them intact his life-long. <br />Secondly, his was a most robust constitution, which resisted the extremes of heat and cold, and which remained unaffected by irregularities, by his neglect of food, by excess of work by day and night, when occupied in prayers, pouring over scientific books, writing, conversing familiarly with his friends, — and all that so continuously as if each was his only occupation. Such power might justly be called corporeal bravery. <br />The third bodily quality he possessed is comparable to temperance, to which is properly related handsomeness. For as the former consists in the harmony and mutual agreement of the faculties of the soul, so the latter physical beauty may be discovered in a certain symmetry of its organic members. His appearance was most agreeable, for not only did he possess the beauty of just proportions, but from his soul exuded a certain living light, or miraculous efflorescence which shone over his whole body, and which is quite indescribable. He was so lovely that no painter was able to catch his likeness, and that in all of his portraits that are in circulation (however fine they be) there is still a lack of many features to represent his personality adequately. <br />His fourth bodily virtue was health, which is often compared to justice in the soul. These two are really quite analogous, for justice is a soul-habit which hinders upsets of the soul-parts, while health fosters order and mutual agreement between the disordered elements of the body. That is just the definition given by the Asklepian healers [or physicians]. <br />So profoundly had this health been rooted in <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> ever since his birth, that he was able to tell how many times he had been sick, which was twice or thrice during seventy-five completed years. Indeed, so true is this that during his last sickness he did not recognize his symptoms, so rarely had he felt them. </p>                        </div>

According to <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, these are the elements of a philosophic nature. The primary elements of the soul were innate in him, and he had no need of learning them, and even so they were highly developed in him. His was a great memory, an intelligence suited to all kinds of studies; he was liberal, affable, loving, and fraternal to truth, justice, courage and temperance. Never had he voluntarily told a lie; lies he abhorred, and he cherished sincerity and veracity. What else could be expected from a man who was to achieve the presence of True Being? Since youth, he was impassioned for truth, for truth is the source of all goods, among gods as among men. His profound scorn for sensuality, and his inclination to temperance was well illustrated by his extreme ardor and overwhelming leaning towards science, and all kinds of sciences, which do not even allow a first start to the pleasures of gross and animal life, and, on the contrary have the power to impress us with the pure and unmingled joys of the soul. <br /><a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a> of gain was entirely alien to <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a>, to the point that, from childhood, he neglected care of the fortune left him by his parents, who were very rich, from passionate love for philosophy. So he was entirely foreign to thievery and meannesses, his soul being ever directed towards the universal and total in human and divine things. From this arose a high-mindedness which impressed him with the nothingness of human life, and released him from the usual fear of death. He felt no fear of the things which seem so terrible to men generally, and his disposition was no less than courageous. <br />This illustrates his youthful love of justice: honorable and gentle, never moody, or difficult in daily intercourse, never unjust; gracious, un-covetous, never taking advantage, as foreign to arrogance as to timidity. </p>                        </div>

His powerful memory never betrayed the least hesitation; he was always self-possessed, and had no business other than science. His disposition was opposed to rudeness and discourtesy; his taste was ever selective and the best in everything, and his politeness and affability both in worldly gatherings, religious banquets, and all acts of life, without in any way detracting from his dignity, captivated his interlocutors, so that they always left him in a better soul-disposition than when they had met him. </p>                        </div>

At birth he was welcomed by the Poliouchos of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> [the goddess <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>], who as it were assisted his mother in childbirth. She might have been considered the cause of his life, because he was born in the town she protects and saves; and who, when he reached childhood and youth, made him live well: for she appeared to him in a dream inducing him to follow philosophy. That is how he began so close an intimacy with the goddess, so that he sacrificed especially to her, and practiced her precepts with the greatest enthusiasm. Shortly after his birth, his parents removed him to their homeland, to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364293PXan class=place long=29.3182 lat=36.3565>Xanthus</a>, a town dedicated to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, and which thus, by some divine chance, became his own homeland. For it seemed no more than fitting that a man who was to become a prince of all sciences should be raised and grow under the influence of the divine Leader of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. The excellent education he received there permitted him to acquire the moral virtues, and to accustom himself to love what duty commands, and to avoid the contrary. </p>                        </div>

In rhetoric he even became celebrated, capturing the admiration of his fellow students and his teachers by his fine flow of language, by his facility in assimilating this art, and by his appearing a teacher rather than a student both by his proficiency and diplomacy. </p>                        </div>

The youth accompanied his teacher with much pleasure, so as not to interrupt his studies. But, after all, this was exceedingly providential, as it brought him back to the influence of the goddess who had been the cause of his birth [<a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>]. <br />For on his arrival the goddess advised him to devote himself up to philosophy, and to attend the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> schools.

To begin his study of <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>'s philosophy he attended the instruction of the Younger <a href=/people/803 target=_blank>Olympiodorus</a>, whose reputation was very extensive. For mathematics, he trusted himself to Heron, a very pious person, who possessed and practiced the best methods of his art. <br />These teachers were so charmed with the virtues of this youth that <a href=/people/803 target=_blank>Olympiodorus</a>, who had a daughter who was acquainted with philosophy wished to betroth her to him; and Heron did not hesitate to initiate him into all his ideas about religion, and to make him his continuous companion. <br />Now it seems that <a href=/people/803 target=_blank>Olympiodorus</a> possessed such a gift of speech, that he talked too rapidly and indistinctly, and only a few of his auditors understood him. One day, at the close of the lecture, <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> repeated the whole lecture to his fellow students, word by word, from memory.

So he looked upon these schools with scorn, and simultaneously remembering the divine vision that had visited him in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, and the command which it had brought him, he embarked for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, so to speak under the escort of [divine] oracles and all the gods and good daimons who watch over the preservation of philosophy. For he was being sent there by the gods of philosophy to preserve the school of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> in its truth and pureness. This was clearly demonstrated by the circumstances of his arrival, and the really divine symbols which clearly prognosticated the function which he was to inherit from his 'father', and the election which was, one day, to call him to the direction and administration of the School. <br />For at his landing in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Piraeus</a>, and as soon as his arrival was bruited about in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nikolaus</a>, who was later to become so famous as a sophist, and who at this time was pursuing his studies here, came to the harbor to welcome him, and to offer him hospitality, as he was acquainted with him personally, and was his co-national, from <a href=/people/5094 target=_blank>Lycia</a>. So <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nikolaus</a> led him to the town; but on the way, having arrived at the monument to <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> felt himself tired of walking. Now he did not know, and had never heard tell that there existed there a place sacred to <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>. Yet he begged <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nikolaus</a> to stop there a moment, so he might sit down to rest, and asked him to fetch him a little water, from any place at all, for, said he, I am dying of thirst. <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nikolaus</a>, very anxious, had some brought him, not from any chance place, but from the consecrated shrine itself, for the spring of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>'s Pillar was not far off. After <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> had drunk, <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nikolaus</a> suddenly saw in this a symbol, and told him that he was resting in a place consecrated to <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, and that the water he had drunk, the first Attic water he had tasted, was from this source. So <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> rose, and before proceeding, offered a prayer. <br />As he was arriving at the fortified gate, at the entrance he met the porter, who was already preparing to insert his keys in the lock, and he actually said to <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a>: Really, if you had not arrived, I should have closed!

It happened to be late dusk, and the sun was setting during their conversation, and the moon, quitting her conjunction with the sun, began to appear.

The latter, on seeing this barely twenty-year-old youth, and on learning of his ardent desire and determination to devote himself entirely to philosophy, was charmed with him, to the point of urgently welcoming him to his lessons of philosophy, although he was often hindered by his age, being already very old. With him <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> read <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>'s De Anima, and <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s <a href=/people/1077 target=_blank>Phaedo</a>.

The great master advised <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> to record the text of their conversations in writing, and to arouse his zeal, sought to excite his ambition by saying to him that if he completed these notes people would say It is <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> who is the author of these commentaries on <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>! <br />As <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a> saw <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> very rigidly abstaining from flesh food, he advised him not to push this abstinence too far, so as to keep his body vigorous enough to carry on the labors and fatigues of his spirit. He even asked the philosopher <a href=/people/1721 target=_blank>Syrianus</a> to endorse this advice about diet, but the latter retorted to the old man, as <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> himself reported to me, Let him learn what I want, by following this so rigid a diet; and afterwards, if he insists on it, let him die!

So <a href=/people/1721 target=_blank>Syrianus</a> took <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> into his own home, made him profit as much as possible from his lessons, and made <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> share in his philosophical way of life, because he had found in him the disciple and successor he had long been seeking, — someone, namely, who was capable of understanding the sciences in both their multiplicity and diversity, while simultaneously grasping the divine verities. </p>                        </div>

For he managed to save his life in the midst of the greatest perils, when he had to weather terrible tempests, when all the unleashed typhoons were shaking his so well regulated life, without letting himself be frightened or discouraged. <br />One day, indeed, when he found himself the object of the suspicions and vexations of a sort of vultures that surrounded him [i.e., certain <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>], obeying that Power which starts revolutions in this world, he left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> and made a journey to Asia, where his residence became most profitable to him.

Never having tasted the joys of family or of marriage, — that is, because he so elected it, having received many propositions very favorable from the standpoint of birth and fortune — having, therefore, remained free from these bonds, he showed such a solicitude for his pupils and friends, and even for their wives and children, that he was looked upon as a common father and as the author of their existence. If any one of his acquaintances fell sick, he implored the gods on his behalf with ardent piety in sacrifices and hymns; then he visited the patient with a zealous solicitude, convoked the physicians and urged them without delay to apply their art, and himself suggested some more efficacious remedy, and thus saved many sick people in most dangerous crises. <br />As to his humanity towards his most familiar servants, it appears from the last will of this perfect good man. Of all the people he knew, the one he loved best was <a href=/people/3768 target=_blank>Archiadas</a>, and after him, those who belonged to his family, especially because he belonged to the family of the philosopher <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a>, and then because he had been his fellow student and teacher; for of these two forms of friendship which are so rarely recorded among the ancients, that which bound them seems to have been the most profound.

For while these have the same function, — of purifying the soul and preparing it to attend freely to human affairs so as to achieve assimilation to God, which is the most perfect purpose of the soul — they do not all operate in the same manner, or to the same extent, some more, some less. Even if there are certain political purifications which give order and beauty to those who possess them, and make them better, even during their sojourn here below, because they impose limits and measure on irascible affections, and on sensual desires, and in general act to suppress passions, and false opinions, the purificatory virtues are superior to them, because they produce a separation that is complete, relieving us from the leaden burdens of the world of generation, and removing the obstacles to our flight from things here below. <br />These are virtues which our philosopher practiced all through a life devoted to philosophy, by eloquent lessons teaching their nature, how man acquires them, and especially by conforming his life to them, and practicing the actions by which the soul succeeds in separating itself, continually, by day or night, making use of the purificatory practices which woo us from evil, of lustrations, and of all other processes of purification, whether Orphic or <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a>, such as dipping himself into the sea without hesitation every month, and sometimes even twice or thrice a month. He practiced this discipline, rude as it was, not only in his prime, but even also when he approached his life's decline; and so he observed, without ever failing, these austere habits of which he had, so to speak, made himself a law. </p>                        </div>

He especially preached abstinence from animal food, but if a special ceremony compelled him to make use of it, he only tasted it, out of consideration and respect. Every month he sanctified himself according to the rites devoted to the <a href=/people/11088 target=_blank>Mother of the Gods</a> [<a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>] by the Romans, and before them by the Phrygians; he observed the holy days observed among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> even more strictly than did they themselves; and especially he fasted on certain days, quite openly. During the first day of the lunar month he remained without food, without even having eaten the night before; and he likewise celebrated the New Moon in great solemnity, and with much sanctity. He regularly observed the great festivals of all peoples, so to speak, and the religious ceremonies peculiar to each people or country. <br />Nor did he, like so many others, make this the pretext of a distraction, or of a debauch of food, but on the contrary they were occasions of prayer meetings that lasted all night, without sleep, with songs, hymns and similar devotions. Of this we see the proof in the composition of his hymns, which contain homage and praises not only of the gods adored among the Greeks, but where you also see worship of the god Marnas of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/315344UGaz class=person long=34.432 lat=31.523>Gaza</a>, <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asklepius</a> <a href=/people/5745 target=_blank>Leontychus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/317345UAsh class=person long=34.5464 lat=31.6601>Ascalon</a>, Thyandrites who is much worshipped among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabs</a>, the <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> who has a temple at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/240328UPhi class=place long=32.8843 lat=24.025>Philae</a>, and indeed all other divinities. It was a phrase he much used, and that was very familiar to him, that a philosopher should watch over the salvation of not only a city, nor over the national customs of a few people, but that he should be the hierophant of the whole world in common. Such were the holy and purificatory exercises he practiced, in his austere manner of life. <br />That is how he avoided physical sufferings; and if he was overwhelmed by them he bore them with gentleness, and he dulled their keenness by not allowing his most perfect part to grow tender about himself. He showed the strength of his soul in the face of suffering in his last illness. Even when beaten down by it, a prey to atrocious sufferings, he was still trying to conjure the evil. He begged us in turn to read hymns, during which readings the suffering seemed appeased, and replaced by a sort of impassibility. What is still more surprising, he recalled all that he had heard read, even though the weakness which had overcome him had made him apparently lose the recognition of persons around him. <br />When we read the beginning of a hymn, he would recite its middle and end, especially when they were Orphic verses; for when we were near him we would recite some of them. <br />It was not only against physical sufferings that he showed insensibility; but when external events would unexpectedly strike him, seeming to be contary to the usual course of events, he would on the occurrence of such events say, Well, such are the habitual accidents of life! This maxim has seemed to me worthy of preservation, because it bears strong testimony to our philosopher's strength of soul. <br />So far as possible, he repressed anger; rather, he did not allow it to break out at all, or rather it was only the sensitive part of the soul that was thereby affected; these involuntary movements no more than touched the rational part, and that only lightly and transitorily. As to sexual pleasures, I think that he admitted them only in the imaginative degree, and that only very superficially. </p>                        </div>

For he was already purified from and raised above the world of generation and change, scorning the many who carry the narthex, who revel therein. He on the contrary intoxicated himself with love for the primary beings. So he had himself achieved seeing directly the really beatific visions from beyond, establishing his assured science not on apodeictic and discursive syllogisms, but on what he could contemplate with his eyes, on the intuitions of intellectual activity, on the models contained within divine reason. So he acquired this virtue whose true and proper name is not science, but rather wisdom, sophia, or any other if possible more reverend name. <br />Conforming all his actions to this virtue, the philosopher had no trouble in understanding the whole Hellenic and foreign mythology, even those revelations which had been obscured by mythical fictions; and these he expounded for those who would or could attain their elevation, giving to all of them profoundly religious interpretations, and relating them all in a perfect harmony. <br />The writings of the most ancient authors he studied thoroughly, and after having subjected them to criticism, he gathered whatever thoughts he therein found to be useful and fruitful; but whatever seemed to lack force or value he set aside, branding them ridiculous puerilities.

For he was the first to assert the existence of a kind of souls that are capable of simultaneously seeing several Ideas. He had very properly postulated their existence as intermediate between the Mind (Nous) which embraces all things together by a single intuition, and the souls whose discursive thoughts pass, and who are unable to conceive more than a single idea at one time. <br />If we wished, we might easily mention other doctrines formulated by him, — you need only undertake the reading of his works — which I have at present abstained from doing, in the fear of drawing out this essay too much, by commenting on these details. He who will undertake this work will recognize the truth of all that we have attributed to him. <br />Still better would this have been realized if one had seen him, if one had basked in his presence, if one had heard him deliver his lectures, and had heard him pronounce such noble discourses at his yearly celebrations of the birthdays of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> and <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>.

After having, however inadequately, related what concerns his theoretic wisdom, we must now speak of that form of justice whose dignity equals this sort of virtues. Not like those of which we have spoken above does it consist of a plurality of parts, neither in the mutual agreement of those parts, but in an absolutely proper action, which belongs only to the thinking soul, and which therefore must be independently defined by itself. That which is peculiar to this virtue is that its action absolutely conforms to Mind (Nous) and to God; and this was the eminent characteristic of our philosopher's intellectual activity. For he hardly rested from the fatigues of his daily labors, and while he yielded his body to slumber, not even during these moments did his thought refrain from activity. So, after having early shaken off slumber, as a sort of psychic laziness, when his prayer-hour had not yet arrived because the night was far from having elapsed, alone, in his bed, he composed hymns, examined certain theories, and searched for ideas, which he later committed to writing at the coming of day. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> never had the time to explain the Orphic poems. <br /><a href=/people/1721 target=_blank>Syrianus</a> had indeed planned to explain to him and to Syrian <a href=/people/2869 target=_blank>Domninus</a>, either one of these works, the Orphic writings or the [<a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a>] Oracles, and had left the choice to them.

This disagreement hindered <a href=/people/1721 target=_blank>Syrianus</a> from doing anything, and then he soon died. <br />Therefore <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> had received from him only the first principles; but he studied the master's notes on the <a href=/people/8072 target=_blank>Orphics</a>, and also the very numerous works of <a href=/people/1320 target=_blank>Porphyry</a> and <a href=/people/5048 target=_blank>Iamblichus</a> on the Oracles and other kindred <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> writings.

So <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> combined the interpretations of his predecessors into a compendium that cost him much labor, and which he subjected to the most searching criticism, and he inserted therein the most characteristically <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> hypotheses, as well as the best drawn from the preceding commentaries written on the Oracles communicated by the divinities. <br />It was in regard to this work, which took him more than five years, that, in a dream, he had a divine vision. It seemed to him that the great <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a> predicted to him that he would live a number of years equal to the four-page folios he had composed on the Oracles. Having counted them, he found that there were seventy of them. The eventual close of his life proves that this dream was divine; for although, as we have said above, he lived five years beyond seventy, in these he was very much weakened. The too severe, nay, excessive austerity of his rule of life, his frequent ablutions, and other similar ascetic habits, had exhausted this constitution that nature had made so vigorous; so after his seventieth year he began to decline so that he could no longer attend to all his duties. In this condition he limited himself to praying, to composing hymns, to conversing with his friends, — all of which, however, still weakened him. Yet, remembering the dream that he had, he would be surprised about it, and would jokingly say that he had lived no more than seventy years. <br />In spite of this great state of feebleness, <a href=/people/3394 target=_blank>Hegias</a> induced him to take up his lectures again; from childhood this youth showed manifest signs of his ancestral virtues, which proved that he belonged to the family of the veritable golden chain, which began with <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s ancestor <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>; and with zeal did he study the writings of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> and the other theologians. <br />The old man confided to him his manuscripts, and felt great joy at seeing what giant's steps he was taking in the advancement of all the sciences.

He was a believer in these practices, in unpremeditated responses, and other such divinations, which he had learned from <a href=/people/7313 target=_blank>Asklepigenia</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a>, to whom exclusively her father had confided and taught the mystic rites preserved by Nestorius, and the whole theurgic science. <br />Even before that, according to the prescribed order, and purified by the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> lustrations, the philosopher had, as epoptic initiate, witnessed the apparitions of <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a> under a luminous form, as he himself has mentioned in a special booklet. <br />He had the power of producing rains by activating, at the right time, a particular rite, and was able to deliver <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a> from a terrible drought. He knew how to foresee earthquakes, he had experimented with the divinatory power of the tripod, and had himself uttered verses prophetic about his own destiny. <br />When 40 years old, he felt that in a dream he had uttered the following verses: Here broods an immortal splendor, that is supercelestial, which has sprung from the consecrated spring, and whence streams a fiery light! <br />At the beginning of his 42nd year, he so seemed to be shouting the following verses: I am possessed by a spirit which breathes into me the force of fire, which, enfolding and entrancing my reason in a whirl of flame, flies toward the aether, and with its immortal vibrations reechoes in the starry vaults! <br />Besides, in a dream he had clearly seen that he belonged to the Hermetic Chain; and, on the authority of a dream, he was convinced that his was the reincarnated soul of the <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagorean</a> <a href=/people/562 target=_blank>Nicomachus</a>. </p>                        </div>

Seeing her abandoned by the physicians, the father, as in the gravest circumstances of life, turned to his last resort, and ran to the philosopher's, as to the only person who could save her, and urgently besought him to come and pray for his daughter.

On completing the religious ceremonies, <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> visited <a href=/people/7313 target=_blank>Asklepigenia</a>, who had just been delivered from the sufferings that had assailed her, and who now was in perfect health. He had indeed performed his vows and offered his prayers in spite of everybody, so as to preclude any possibility of malicious slander, and the whole household had taken part in this act. <br />This indeed was one of <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a>'s good fortunes, that he lived in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237VPro class=place long=23.7256 lat=37.9698>house</a> that suited him best, where had dwelt both <a href=/people/1721 target=_blank>Syrianus</a>, whom he called his father, and <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a>, whom he called his grandfather.

Now arthritis is a disease which is frequently, and even habitually transmitted from parents to children; and as his father had suffered therefrom, <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> had always feared that it would afflict him also; and in my opinion, his fears were not entirely groundless, for, before the incident I am about to relate, he had felt pains of this nature, when took place another and very surprising incident. <br />On the advice of certain persons he put on the afflicted foot a bandage. While he was stretched out on his bed, suddenly a sparrow halted in his flight and carried it away. This was a divine sign that was really paeonic, and of a nature that should have inspired him with confidence for the future; but even in spite of this he did not any the less experience fears of being later on visited by this malady. <br />Having therefore implored the divinity on this subject, and having besought a clear guidance on this subject, while sleeping he saw something that is so bold, apparently, that I have to appeal to my courage to openly proclaim the truth of the matter. So he seemed to see somebody who was returning from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376231SAsk class=place long=23.075 lat=37.597>Epidaurus</a>, who bent over his legs, and without hesitation, showing a gesture of tender affection, kissed his knees.

For when <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> visited him, the god showed <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> his favor by appearing to him. Because the natives were not in agreement as to which god or gods resided in this place, and were worshipped, <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> was in doubt about it and desired enlightenment. Resting on numerous testimonies, some conjecturing it was a sanctuary of <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asklepius</a>; they said that voices really resounded there, that a table was consecrated to that god, and that there had been received there oracular responses relative to health; and that those who came for consultation were cured of the most dangerous maladies, against all hope. Others, on the contrary, thought it was the <a href=/people/526 target=_blank>Dioscuri</a> who frequented the place, for some persons thought that they had seen on the road leading to <a href=/people/6169 target=_blank>Adrotta</a> two young men, of an extreme beauty, riding <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> of great speed, who said that they were going in all haste to the sanctuary, so that, at first glance it had been believed they were human beings; but soon after the onlookers were convinced that it was a really divine manifestation, because when they themselves arrived at the temple and asked questions, they were told by the local officiating attendants that nothing had been seen there, the horsemen having vanished into thin air. <br /><a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> was therefore uncertain, and hardly knew what credit to give to the facts related. So he begged the local divinities to reveal their true and proper character by some indubitable testimony. In a dream then he saw a god coming to him and speaking clearly to him, thus: <br />What, did you not hear <a href=/people/5048 target=_blank>Iamblichus</a> say who those two persons were when he praised the names of <a href=/people/1010 target=_blank>Machaon</a> and <a href=/people/2961 target=_blank>Podaleirius</a> [sons of Asklepius]? <br />Thereupon the divinity gave this holy man a testimony of his good will. Just as in the theater orators pronounce panegyrics of great men, the god stood up, and with a gesture of his hand, and in a dramatic tone, with great force uttered these words (for I will repeat the exact words uttered by the divinity): <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> is the glory of the fatherland! What greater proof of the gods' affection for this really blessed man could be adduced? After having received such sympathetic testimonies from the divinities, <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> would burst into tears, every time he would recall to us what he had seen, and the divine praise uttered about him. </p>                        </div>

After having fulfilled this pious duty towards each of them, he went to the Academy, in a certain particular place, and by vows and prayers, he invoked the souls of his ancestors, collectively and separately; and, in another part of the building, in common with others, he made libations in honor of all those who had practiced philosophy. <br />After all that, this holy person traced out a third distinct space and offered a sacrifice to all the souls of the dead. <br />His body, clothed and arranged as I have said above, according to his own request, and carried by his friends, was buried in the most easterly part of the suburbs, near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LLyk class=place long=23.744 lat=37.982>Mount Lycabettus</a>, where rested the body of his teacher <a href=/people/1721 target=_blank>Syrianus</a>.

For many people came from different countries to attend his courses, some only to hear him, others to become his rivals, and then were bound to him in philosophical union. A writer more laborious than I will be able to make out the general list of his works, for my only purpose has been to satisfy a duty imposed by my conscience, and to satisfy my debt of pious homage toward this divine person, and towards the Good Daimon to whom he had been allotted. <br />As to his writings, I will limit myself to the statement that he always preferred his Commentary on the <a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaeus</a>, although he had a great fondness for his Commentary on the Theatetus. He would often say, If I had the power, of all ancient books I would leave in circulation only the Oracles and the <a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaeus</a>; all the others, I would make them disappear from the eyes of our contemporaries, for they can only harm those who undertake their reading without care and attention! <br /><a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> or Concerning <a href=/people/2309 target=_blank>Happiness</a> has been completed with the help of God. </p>                        </div>
