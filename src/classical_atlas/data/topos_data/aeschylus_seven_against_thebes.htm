You must aid, too, your children, and <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Mother Earth</a>, your beloved nurse. For welcoming all the distress of your childhood, when you were young and crept upon her kind soil, she raised you to inhabit her and bear the shield, and to prove yourselves faithful in this time of need. And so, until today, God has been favorably inclined, for though we have long been under siege, the war has gone well for the most part through the gods' will. But now, as the seer, the herdsman of birds, informs us, using his ears and his mind to understand with unerring skill the prophetic birds unaided by sacrificial fire — he, master of such prophecy, declares that the greatest <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=demonym long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a> attack is being planned in night assembly and that they will make plans to capture our city. Hurry each of you to the battlements and the gates of our towered walls! Rush with all your armor! Fill the parapets and take your positions on the platforms of the towers. Stand your ground bravely where the gates open out, and do not be afraid of this crowd of foreigners. God will bring it to a good end. <br />I myself have dispatched scouts and men to observe their army, and I am confident that their going is not in vain. Once I have heard their report, I will not be taken by any trickery. (Enter a Scout.] </p>                        </div>

Seven warriors, fierce regiment-commanders, slaughtered a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> over a black shield, and then touching the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>'s gore with their hands they swore an oath by <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>, by <a href=/people/1176 target=_blank>Enyo</a>, and by Rout who delights in blood, that either they will level the city and sack the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Cadmeans</a>' town by force, or will in death smear this soil with their blood. And on <a href=/people/201 target=_blank>Adrastus</a>' chariot they were placing remembrances of themselves for their parents at home, and were shedding tears while so doing, but no piteous wailing escaped their lips. For their iron- hearted spirit heaved, blazing with courage, as of <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> with war in their eyes. Your knowledge of these things was not delayed by fearfulness; for I left them casting lots to decide how each commander, his post assigned by chance, would lead his regiment against the gates. Therefore, choose the bravest men of the city and station them quickly at the outlets of the gates. For nearby already the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=demonym long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a> army in full armor is advancing in a flurry of dust, and glistening foam splatters the plain in drops from the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>' pantings. So you, like the careful helmsman of a ship, secure the city before <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>' blasts storm down upon it; for the wave of their army now crashes over the dry land. Seize the first opportune moment for doing this. For all else, I, on my part, will keep a reliable eye on the lookout, and you, by learning from my certain report what happens beyond the gates, shall remain unharmed. </p>                        </div>

Who could cleanse them of their pollution? O, the new troubles of this house mixed with its evils of before! <br />Indeed I speak of the ancient transgression, now swift in its retribution. It remains even into the third generation, ever since <a href=/people/465 target=_blank>Laius</a> — in defiance of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> who, at his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> oracle at the earth's center, said three times that the king would save his city if he died without offspring — ever since he, overcome by the thoughtlessness of his longing, fathered his own death, the parricide <a href=/people/173 target=_blank>Oidipus</a>, who sowed his mother's sacred field, where he was nurtured, and endured a bloody crop. <a href=/people/1051 target=_blank>Madness</a> united the frenzied bridal pair. <br />Now it is as if a sea of evils pushes its swell onward. As one wave sinks, the sea raises up another, triple-crested, which crashes around the city's stern. In between a narrow defense stretches — no wider than a wall. I fear that the city will be overthrown along with its kings. <br />For the compensation is heavy when curses uttered long ago are fulfilled, and once the deadly curse has come into existence, it does not pass away. When the fortune of seafaring merchants has grown too great, it must be thrown overboard. <br />For whom have the gods and divinities that share their altar and the thronging assembly of men ever admired so much as they honored <a href=/people/173 target=_blank>Oidipus</a> then, when he removed that deadly, man-seizing plague from our land? <br />But when, his sanity regained, he grew miserable in his wretched marriage, then carried away by his grief and with maddened heart he accomplished a double evil. With the hand that killed his father he struck out his eyes, which were dearer to him than his children. </p>                        </div>

This is how I was commanded to speak regarding him. But as for his brother, it is decreed that this corpse of <a href=/people/881 target=_blank>Polyneices</a> is to be cast out of the city unburied to be torn by <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>, since he would have been the destroyer of the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Cadmeans</a>, if one of the gods had not used his brother's spear to prevent him. Even in death he will retain the stain of his guilt against his fathers' gods, whom he dishonored when he launched a foreign army against the city to take it. For this reason it is decreed that he will receive his reward by being buried without honor beneath the winged birds; and that no labor of the hands shall attend him by building up a burial mound nor shall anyone offer him reverence in shrill-sung laments. He is to be refused the honor of being carried in funeral procession by his loved ones.
