For because of his shameful private life the laws forbade him to speak before the people, laying on him an injunction not difficult, in my opinion, to obey — nay, most easy; and had he been wise, he need not have made his slanderous attack upon me.

Men, therefore, who administer an oligarchy, or any government based on inequality, must be on their guard against those who attempt revolution by the law of force; but you, who have a government based upon equality and law, must guard against those whose words violate the laws or whose lives have defied them; for then only will you be strong, when you cherish the laws, and when the revolutionary attempts of lawless men shall have ceased. </p>                        </div>

Consider, fellow citizens, how much attention that ancient lawgiver, <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>, gave to morality, as did <a href=/people/1130 target=_blank>Draco</a> and the other lawgivers of those days. </p>                        </div>
