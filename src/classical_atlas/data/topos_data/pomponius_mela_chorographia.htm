To trace this arrangement completely is a time-consuming, rather than a welcome, subject, but nevertheless a very worthwhile thing to consider and understand. It repays the effort of those who give it attention — at least by the very act of contemplating it, if not by the richness of this supplicant's natural talent. </p>                        </div>

To start with, in fact, let me untangle what the shape of the whole is, what its greatest parts are, what the condition of its parts taken one at a time is, and how they are inhabited; then, back to the borders and coasts of all lands (a) as they exist to the interior and on the seacoast, (b) to the extent that the sea enters them and washes up around them, and (c) with those additions that, in the nature of the regions and their inhabitants, need to be recorded.

From there it spreads out again, but very moderately, and again it proceeds into a space even more constricted than the previous one.

Instead, after it floods out from its center point equally onto all the shores of land and island, even though they lie in different directions, Ocean gathers itself back into its center point from those shores and returns to its original condition.
