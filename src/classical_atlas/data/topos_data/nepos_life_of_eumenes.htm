If success equal to his abilities had been granted him, he would not, indeed, have been a greater man (for we estimate great men by merit, not by fortune), but he would have been much more renowned, and more honoured. As he happened to live, however, in the days in which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> flourished, it was a great disadvantage to him residing among them, that he was of a foreign country. Nor was anything wanting to him but a noble descent; for, though he was of a family of distinction in his native city, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> were nevertheless dissatisfied that he should ever be preferred to them. They were obliged to submit, however, for he excelled them all in caution, vigilance, endurance, and acuteness and activity of intellect. <br />When he was but a youth, he was received into favour by <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a>, the son of <a href=/people/1308 target=_blank>Amyntas</a>, and after a short time was admitted into intimate friendship with him; for, even then, when he was so young, there appeared to be great natural talent in him. He therefore kept him near himself in the office of secretary, which is much more honourable among the Greeks than among the Romans; for with us, secretaries are regarded as hirelings, as in reality they are; but with them, on the contrary, no one is admitted to that office who is not of good family and of known integrity and ability, because he must of necessity be the confidant of all their political measures. This post of confidence he held for seven years under <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a>, and after <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a> was assassinated, he was in the same office for thirteen years under <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. During the latter portion of this time, also, he commanded one of the two divisions of the cavalry called Hetaeriae. With both these princes he always had a place in the council, and was admitted to a knowledge of all their proceedings. </p>                        </div>

Nor did he alone, indeed, entertain such designs, but all the others, who had been friends of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, formed similar intentions. <a href=/people/1114 target=_blank>Leonnatus</a>, in the first place, had resolved to seize upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, and had endeavoured, by liberal promises, to prevail upon <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a> to desert <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a>, and form an alliance with himself. Being unable to make any impression upon him, he attempted to take his life, and would have effected his purpose, had he not secretly escaped from his guards by night. </p>                        </div>

In this artifice he successfully persevered, and drew out his army into the field, and joined battle, before the men were aware with whom, they were engaged. He succeeded, also, by an advantageous choice of ground, in fighting more with his cavalry, in which he had the superiority, than with his infantry, in which he was but weak. </p>                        </div>

Upon this, those who had deserted him were condemned to death in their absence, the army giving their suffrage to that effect; and among those condemned was <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a>, who, though he was affected at this blow, did not sink under it, or conduct the war with the less vigour. <br />But a course of necessitous circumstances, though they could not subdue the energy of his spirit, had yet some effect in diminishing it. <a href=/people/12218 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>, however, who pursued him, was often, though he had plenty of all kinds of troops, severely harassed by him on the march, nor could he ever come to an engagement with him except in places in which a few could resist many. But at last, when he could not be taken by manoeuvring, he was hemmed in by numbers; still he extricated himself, though with the loss of several men, and took refuge in a fortress of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>, called Nora; where, being besieged, and fearing that, by remaining in one place, he should lose his war-<a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, as there was no room for exercising them, he adopted an ingenious expedient, by which the animal might be warmed and exercised standing, so that it might take its food more freely, and not be deprived of the benefit of bodily motion. He tied up its head so high with a halter, that it could not quite touch the ground with its fore-feet; he then forced it, by lashing it behind, to leap up and throw back its heels; which motions excited perspiration no less than if the animal had run in an open course. Hence it happened (what was a matter of astonishment to all), that he led out his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> from the fortress, though he had been several months under siege, equally as sleek as if he had been keeping them in open fields. During that siege, as often as he desired, he either set on fire or demolished the works and defences of <a href=/people/12218 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>. He, however, kept himself in that one place as long as the winter lasted; but, as the fortress could have no relief from without, and the spring was coming on, he pretended to be desirous of surrendering, and, while he was treating about the terms, eluded the officers of <a href=/people/12218 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>, and brought himself and all his men off safe. </p>                        </div>

There is danger, therefore, lest ours should do what those did, and, by their insubordination and excessive licentiousness, ruin all, not less those whom they have supported than those whom they have opposed.

They had fixed upon their winter-quarters, not from regard to convenience for warfare, but for luxurious indulgence; and had separated into parties at a great distance from one another. <a href=/people/12218 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>, hearing of their dispersion, and being aware that he was not a match for his enemies when prepared to receive him, resolved that some new plan must be adopted. There were two ways by which he might march from the country of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, where he was wintering, to the winter-quarters of his adversaries, of which the shorter lay through desert tracts, which nobody inhabited by reason of the scarcity of water, but was only about ten days' march. The other, by which everybody travelled, presented a circuitous route of twice the length, but was well-supplied, and abounded with all necessaries. If he went by the latter, he felt sure that the enemy would know of his approach before he had accomplished the third part of the distance; but if he hurried through the deserts, he hoped that he might surprise his adversaries unawares. To effect his object, he ordered as many skins and sacks as possible to be got in readiness; and then forage and dressed provisions for ten days; desiring that as little fire as possible should be made in the camp. The route which he had in view he concealed from every one. Being thus provided, he set forward in the direction on which he had determined. </p>                        </div>

His officers held a meeting; and it was considered what ought to be done. They were all aware that their troops could not be assembled so soon as <a href=/people/12218 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> seemed likely to be upon them; and. while they were all consequently in perplexity, and despairing of their safety, <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a> said that If they would but use activity, and execute his orders (which they had not done before), he would put an end to their difficulties; for, though the enemy might now finish his journey in five days, he would take care that they should be delayed not less than as many days more. They must therefore go about, and each collect his troops. <br />To retard the progress of <a href=/people/12218 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> he adopted the following stratagem. He sent trustworthy men to the foot of the mountains, which lay over against the enemy's route, and ordered them, as soon as night came on, to make as large fires and as far dispersed, as they could; to reduce them at the second watch, and to make them very small at the third, and, by imitating the usages of a camp, to raise a suspicion in the enemy that there was actually a camp in those parts, and that intelligence had been given of their approach; and he told them to act in the same way on the following night. The men to whom this commission was given carefully observed their instructions. <a href=/people/12218 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>, when darkness came on, saw the fires, and supposed that something had been heard of his coming, and that his enemies had assembled their force on that quarter. He therefore changed his intention, and, thinking that he could not surprise them unawares, altered his route, and took the longer circuit of the well-supplied road, on which he halted for one day, to refresh his weary men and recruit his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, that he might come to battle with his army in better condition. </p>                        </div>

As he seemed to <a href=/people/1298 target=_blank>Onomarchus</a> to express himself somewhat arrogantly, he replied, Why, if you were of such a spirit, did you not rather die on the field of battle, than fall into the hands of your enemy? Would indeed that that had befallen me, rejoined <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a>, but it did not happen because I never engaged with a stouter than myself; for I have never crossed swords with any one who did not yield to me; and I have not fallen by the prowess of my enemies, but by the perfidy of my friends.
