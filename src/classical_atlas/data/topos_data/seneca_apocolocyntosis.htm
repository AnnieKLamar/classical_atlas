It shall be done without malice or favour. This is the truth. Ask if you like how I know it? To begin with, I am not bound to please you with my answer. Who will compel me? I know the same day made me free, which was the last day for him who made the proverb true — One must be born either a Pharaoh or a fool. If I choose to answer, I will say whatever trips off my tongue. Who has ever made the historian produce witness to swear for him? But if an authority must be produced, ask of the man who saw <a href=/people/2514 target=_blank>Drusilla</a> translated to heaven: the same man will aver he saw <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> on the road, dot and carry one. Will he nill he, all that happens in heaven he needs must see. He is the custodian of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPAp class=place long=12.5016 lat=41.8734>Appian Way</a>; by that route, you know, both <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> and <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> went up to the gods. Question him, he will tell you the tale when you are alone; before company he is dumb. You see he swore in the Senate that he beheld <a href=/people/2514 target=_blank>Drusilla</a> mounting heavenwards, and all he got for his good news was that everybody gave him the lie: since when he solemnly swears he will never bear witness again to what he has seen, not even if he had seen a man murdered in open market. What he told me I report plain and clear, as I hope for his health and happiness.</p>                        </div>

What hour it was I cannot certainly tell; philosophers will agree more often than clocks; but it was between midday and one after noon. Clumsy creature! you say. The poets are not content to describe sunrise and sunset, and now they even disturb the midday siesta.

Then <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a>, who had always been much pleased with his wit, drew aside one of the three <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a>, and said: Cruel beldame, why do you let the poor wretch be tormented? After all this torture cannot he have a rest? Four and sixty years it is now since he began to pant for breath. What grudge is this you bear against him and the whole empire? Do let the astrologers tell the truth for once; since he became emperor, they have never let a year pass, never a month, without laying him out for his burial. Yet it is no wonder if they are wrong, and no one knows his hour. Nobody ever believed he was really quite born. Do what has to be done: Kill him, and let a better man rule in empty court. <br /><a href=/people/1726 target=_blank>Clotho</a> replied: Upon my word, I did wish to give him another hour or two, until he should make Roman citizens of the half dozen who are still outsiders. (He made up his mind, you know, to see the whole world in the toga, Greeks, Gauls, Spaniards, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=ethnic long=-1.5 lat=53>Britons</a>, and all.) But since it is your pleasure to leave a few foreigners for seed, and since you command me, so be it. She opened her box and out came three spindles. One was for <a href=/people/7338 target=_blank>Augurinus</a>, one for Baba, one for <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>. <br />These three, she says, I will cause to die within one year and at no great distance apart, and I will not dismiss him unattended. Think of all the thousands of men he was wont to see following after him, thousands going before, thousands all crowding about him, and it would never do to leave him alone on a sudden. These boon companions will satisfy him for the nonce.</p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/1920 target=_blank>Lachesis</a>, quite as ready to cast a <br />favourable eye on a handsome man, spins away by the <br />handful, and bestows years and years upon <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> out <br />of her own pocket. As for <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, they tell everybody <br />to speed him on his way <br />With cries of joy and solemn litany. <br />t once he bubbled up the ghost, and there was an end to that shadow of a life. He was listening to a troupe of comedians when he died, so you see I have reason to fear those gentry. The last words he was heard to speak in this world were these. When he had made a great noise with that end of him which talked easiest, he cried out, Oh dear, oh dear! I think I have made a mess of myself. Whether he did or no, I cannot say, but certain it is he always did make a mess of everything.</p>                        </div>

No one forgets his own happiness. What happened in heaven you shall hear: for proof please apply to my informant. Word comes to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> that a stranger had arrived, a man well set up, pretty grey; he seemed to be threatening something, for he wagged his head ceaselessly; he dragged the right foot. They asked him what nation he was of; he answered something in a confused mumbling voice: his language they did not understand. He was no Greek and no Roman, nor of any known race. On this <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> bids <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> go and find out what country he comes from; you see <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> had travelled over the whole world, and might be expected to know all the nations in it. But <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, the first glimpse he got, was really much taken aback, although not all the monsters in the world could frighten him; when he saw this new kind of object, with its extraordinary gait, and the voice of no terrestrial beast, but such as you might hear in the leviathans of the deep, hoarse and inarticulate, he thought his thirteenth labour had come upon him. When he looked closer, the thing seemed to be a kind of man. Up he goes, then, and says what your Greek finds readiest to his tongue: <br />Who art thou, and what thy people? Who thy <br />parents, where thy home? <br /><a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> was delighted to find literary men up there, and began to hope there might be some corner for his own historical works. So he caps him with another Homeric verse, explaining that he was Caesar: <br />Breezes wafted me from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a> unto the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410255RKik class=demonym long=25.5 lat=41>Ciconian</a> land. <br />But the next verse was more true, and no less Homeric: <br />Thither come, I sacked a city, slew the people every one.</p>                        </div>

So of course he took <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, as a good Gaul ought to do. I pledge you my word that in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458048ULug class=place long=4.8197 lat=45.7597>Lyons</a> he was born, where <a href=/people/2629 target=_blank>Licinus</a> was king so many years.

At this point <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> flared up, and expressed his wrath with as big a growl as he could manage. What he said nobody understood; as a matter of fact, he was ordering my lady of Fever to be taken away, and making that sign with his trembling hand (which was always steady enough for that, if for nothing else) by which he used to decapitate men. He had ordered her head to be chopped off. For all the notice the others took of him, they might have been his own freedmen.</p>                        </div>

My lords and gentlemen, said he, I gave you leave to ask questions, and you have made a regular farmyard of the place. Be so good as to keep the rules of the House. What will this person think of us, whoever he is? So <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> was led out, and the first to be asked his opinion was Father <a href=/people/983 target=_blank>Janus</a>: he had been made consul elect for the afternoon of the next first of July, being as shrewd a man as you could find on a summer's day: for he could see, as they say, before and behind. He made an eloquent harangue, because his life was passed in the forum, but too fast for the notary to take down. That is why I give no full report of it, for I don't want to change the words he used. He said a great deal of the majesty of the gods, and how the honour ought not to be given away to every Tom, Dick, or Harry. <br />Once, said he, it was a great thing to become a god; now you have made it a farce. Therefore, that you may not think I am speaking against one person instead of the general custom, I propose that from this day forward the godhead be given to none of those who eat the fruits of the earth, or whom mother earth doth nourish. After this bill has been read a third time, whosoever is made, said, or portrayed to be god, I vote he be delivered over to the bogies, and at the next public show be flogged with a birch amongst the new gladiators. The next to be asked was Diespiter, son of Vica Pota, he also being consul elect, and a moneylender; by this trade he made a living, used to sell rights of citizenship in a small way. <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> trips me up to him daintily, and tweaks him by the ear. So he uttered his opinion in these words: Inasmuch as the blessed <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> is akin to the blessed <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, and also to the blessed <a href=/people/964 target=_blank>Augusta</a>, his grandmother, whom he ordered to be made a goddess, and whereas he far surpasses all mortal men in wisdom, and seeing that it is for the public good that there be some one able to join <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> in devouring boiled turnips, I propose that from this day forth blessed <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> be a god, to enjoy that honour with all its appurtenances in as full a degree as any other before him, and that a note to that effect be added to <a href=/people/2769 target=_blank>Ovid</a>'s Metamorphoses. The meeting was divided, and it looked as though <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> was to win the day. For <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> saw his iron was in the fire, trotted here and trotted there, saying, Don't deny me; I make a point of the matter. I'll do as much for you again, when you like; you roll my log, and I'll roll yours: one hand washes another.</p>                        </div>

There lay <a href=/people/752 target=_blank>Cerberus</a>, or, as <a href=/people/3856 target=_blank>Horace</a> puts it, the hundred-headed monster. <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> was a trifle perturbed (it was a little white <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>bitch</a> he used to keep for a pet) when he spied this black shag-haired <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hound</a>, not at all the kind of thing you could wish to meet in the dark. In a loud voice he cried, <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> is coming! All marched before him singing, The lost is found, O let us rejoice together! Here were found C. <a href=/people/1117 target=_blank>Silius</a> consul elect, Juncus the ex-praetor, <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> Traulus, M. <a href=/people/1885 target=_blank>Helvius</a>, <a href=/people/2553 target=_blank>Trogus</a>, <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a>, <a href=/people/1359 target=_blank>Vettius</a> <a href=/people/466 target=_blank>Valens</a>, <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a>, Roman Knights whom <a href=/people/10943 target=_blank>Narcissus</a> had ordered for execution. In the midst of this chanting company was <a href=/people/7985 target=_blank>Mnester</a> the mime, whom <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> for honour's sake had made shorter by a head. The news was soon blown about that <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> had come: to <a href=/people/2634 target=_blank>Messalina</a> they throng: first his freedmen, <a href=/people/160 target=_blank>Polybius</a>, <a href=/people/771 target=_blank>Myron</a>, <a href=/people/4163 target=_blank>Harpocras</a>, Amphaeus, Pheronactus, all sent before him by <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> that he might not be unattended anywhere; next two prefects, <a href=/people/1511 target=_blank>Justus</a> Catonius and Rufrius <a href=/people/701 target=_blank>Pollio</a>; then his friends, <a href=/people/758 target=_blank>Saturninus</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375220WGor class=place long=22.02354 lat=37.50335>Lusius</a> and Pedo <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> and Lupus and <a href=/people/1743 target=_blank>Celer</a> <a href=/people/685 target=_blank>Asinius</a>, these of consular rank; last came his brother's daughter, his sister's daughter, sons-in-law, fathers and mothers-in-law, the whole family in fact. In a body they came to meet <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>; and when <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> saw them, he exclaimed, Friends everywhere, on my word! How came you all here? To this Pedo <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> answered, What, cruel man? How came we here? Who but you sent us, you, the murderer of all the friends that ever you had? To court with you! I'll show you where their lordships sit.</p>                        </div>

Pedo requests the judge to take the prisoner's name, and produces a summons with this charge: Senators killed, 35; Roman Knights, 221; others as the sands of the sea-shore for multitude. <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> finds no counsel. At length out steps P. <a href=/people/908 target=_blank>Petronius</a>, an old chum of his, a finished scholar in the Claudian tongue and claims a remand. Not granted. Pedo <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> prosecutes with loud outcry. The counsel for the defence tries to reply; but <a href=/people/255 target=_blank>Aeacus</a>, who is the soul of justice, will not have it. <a href=/people/255 target=_blank>Aeacus</a> hears the case against <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, refuses to hear the other side and passes sentence against him, quoting the line: <br />As he did, so be he done by, this is justice undefiled. <br />A great silence fell. Not a soul but was stupefied at this new way of managing matters; they had never known anything like it before. It was no new thing to <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, yet he thought it unfair. There was a long discussion as to the punishment he ought to endure. Some said that <a href=/people/531 target=_blank>Sisyphus</a> had done his job of porterage long enough; <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a> would be dying of thirst, if he were not relieved; the drag must be put at last on wretched <a href=/people/729 target=_blank>Ixion</a>'s wheel. But it was determined not to let off any of the old stagers, lest <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> should dare to hope for any such relief. It was agreed that some new punishment must be devised: they must devise some new task, something senseless, to suggest some craving without result. Then <a href=/people/255 target=_blank>Aeacus</a> decreed he should rattle dice for ever in a box with no bottom. At once the poor wretch began his fruitless task of hunting for the dice, which for ever slipped from his fingers.</p>                        </div>
