The vices of his early youth were compensated by great virtues, so that no one is thought superior, and few are considered equal to him. <br />But we must begin from the beginning. His father <a href=/people/1269 target=_blank>Neocles</a> was of a good family, and married a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381237DAch class=place long=23.7332 lat=38.0803>Acharnae</a>, of whom <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a> was the son. Falling under the displeasure of his parents, because he lived too freely, and took no care of his property, he was disinherited by his father. This disgrace, however, did not dishearten him, but incited him to exertion, for being aware that it could not be obliterated without the utmost efforts on his part, he devoted himself wholly to affairs of state, studying diligently to benefit his friends as well as his own reputation. He was much engaged in private causes, and appeared often before the assembly of the people; no matter of importance was managed without him; he quickly discovered what was necessary to be done, and readily explained it in his speeches. Nor was he less ready in managing business than in devising plans for it, for, as <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a> says, he formed a most accurate judgment of present affairs, and the shrewdest conjectures as to the future. Hence it happened that he soon became distinguished. </p>                        </div>

Being chosen commander by the people to conduct it, he increased the confidence of the citizens, not only as to the struggle in which they were engaged, but for time to come. As the public money, which came in from the mines, was annually wasted by the profusion of the magistrates, he prevailed on the people that a fleet of a hundred ships should be built with that money. This being soon constructed, he first reduced the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer class=ethnic long=19.9156 lat=39.6063>Corcyraeans</a>, and then, by vigorously pursuing the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>, rendered the sea secure. In acting thus, he both supplied the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> with wealth, and made them extremely skilful in naval warfare. How much this contributed to the safety of Greece in general, was discovered in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> war, when <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> assailed the whole of Europe by sea and land, with such a force as no man ever had, before or since; for his fleet consisted of two hundred ships of war, on which two thousand transport vessels attended, and his land force was seven hundred thousand foot, and four hundred thousand <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. <br />When the news of his approach was spread through Greece, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, on account of the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381241LMaB class=place long=24.0002 lat=38.144>Marathon</a>, were said to be the chief objects of his attack, they sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> to ask what they should do in their present circumstances. As soon as they put the question, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> priestess replied that they must defend themselves with wooden walls. As no one understood to what this answer tended, <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a> suggested that it was <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>'s recommendation that they should put themselves and their property on board their ships, for that such were the wooden walls intended by the god. This plan being approved, they added to their former vessels as many more with three banks of oars, and carried off all their goods that could be moved, partly to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379235PSal class=place long=23.5408 lat=37.952>Salamis</a> and partly to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375234PTro class=place long=23.3484 lat=37.5033>Troezen</a>. The citadel, and sacred things, they committed to the priests, and a few old men, to be taken care of; the rest of the town they abandoned. </p>                        </div>

A select force was accordingly sent with <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a>, king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a>, to secure the pass of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388225FThe class=place long=22.536 lat=38.795>Thermopylae</a>, and prevent the barbarians from advancing further. This body could not withstand the force of the enemy, and were all slain on the spot. But the combined fleet of Greece, consisting of three hundred ships, of which two hundred belonged to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, engaged the king's fleet for the first time at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390232SArt class=place long=23.217 lat=39.0097>Artemisium</a>, between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a> and the main land; for <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a> had betaken himself to the straits, that he might not be surrounded by numbers. Though they came off here with success equally balanced, yet they did not dare to remain in the same place, because there was apprehension, lest, if part of the enemy's fleet should get round <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a>, they should be assailed by danger on both sides. Hence it came to past that they left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390232SArt class=place long=23.217 lat=39.0097>Artemisium</a>, and drew up their fleet on the coast of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379235PSal class=place long=23.5408 lat=37.952>Salamis</a>, over against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. </p>                        </div>

As those on board the fleet, alarmed at the report of this catastrophe, did not dare to remain where they were, and most of them gave their opinion that they should return to their respective homes, and defend themselves within their walls, <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a> alone opposed it, saying that united they would be a match for the enemy, but declaring that if they separated they would be destroyed. That this would be the case he assured <a href=/people/1183 target=_blank>Eurybiades</a>, king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a>, who then held the chief command, but making less impression on him than he wished, he sent one of his slaves, the most trustworthy that he had, to <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> in the night, to tell him in his own precise words, that his enemies were retreating, and that, if they should make off, he would require more labour and longer time to finish the war, as he would have to pursue those singly, whom, if he attacked them immediately, he might destroy in a body and at once. The object of this communication was, that all the Greeks should be forced to fight even against their will. The barbarian, receiving this intimation, and not suspecting any guile to be hidden under it, engaged, the day after, in a place most unfavourable for himself, and most advantageous for the enemy, the strait being so confined that the body of his fleet could not be brought into action. He was defeated in consequence rather by the stratagem of <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a> than by the arms of Greece. </p>                        </div>

But in the meanwhile he was driven from his position by the same leader. For <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a>, fearing that he would persist in protracting the contest, sent him notice that it was in contemplation that the bridge, which he had made over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>, should be broken up, and that he should thus be prevented from returning into Asia; and he convinced him that such was the fact. In consequence <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> returned into Asia in less than thirty days, by the same way by which he had spent six months in coming, and considered himself not conquered, but saved, by <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a>. Thus Greece was delivered by the policy of one man, and Asia succumbed to Europe.

He also rebuilt the walls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> at his own individual risk, for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a>, having found a fair pretext, in consequence of the inroads of the barbarians, for saying that no walled town should be kept up without the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a>, in order that there might be no fortified places of which the enemy might take possession, attempted to prevent the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> from building them. This attempt had a far different object from that which they wished to be apparent; for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, by their two victories at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381241LMaB class=place long=24.0002 lat=38.144>Marathon</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380236ASSB class=place long=23.573 lat=37.952>Salamis</a>, had gained so much renown among all people, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> became aware that they should have a struggle with them for the supremacy. They therefore wished the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> to be as weak as possible. <br />After they heard, however, that the erection of the wall was begun, they sent ambassadors to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> to prevent it from being continued. While the ambassadors were present, they desisted, and said that they would send an embassy to them respecting the matter. This embassy <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a> undertook, and set out first by himself, desiring that the rest of the ambassadors should follow when the height of the wall should seem sufficiently advanced; and that, in the meantime, all the people, slaves as well as freemen, should carry on the work, sparing no place, whether sacred or profane, public or private, but collecting from all quarters whatever they thought suitable for building. Hence it happened that the walls of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> were constructed of materials from temples and tombs. </p>                        </div>

While the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> were complaining that the work was nevertheless continued, and that he was trying to deceive them in the matter, the rest of the ambassadors in the meantime arrived; and, as he learned from them that but little of the wall remained to be done, he proceeded to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonian</a> Ephori, in whom the supreme power was vested, and assured them positively that false accounts had been given them, adding that it would be proper for them to send persons of character and respectability, in whom trust might be placed, to inquire into the affair; and that in the meantime they might detain himself as a hostage.' His suggestion was complied with, and three deputies, men who had filled the highest offices, were despatched to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. <br />When <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a> thought that they had reached the city, he went to the Ephori and senate of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a>, and boldly stated that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, by his advice, had enclosed their public gods, and their national and household gods, with walls, that they might more easily defend them from the enemy, a step which they were at liberty to take by the common law of nations; nor had they, in acting thus, done what was useless to Greece; for their city stood as a bulwark against the barbarians, at which the king's fleets had already twice suffered shipwreck; and that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> acted unreasonably and unjustly, in regarding rather what was conducive to their own dominion, than what would be of advantage to the whole of Greece.

While he was living there in great honour, on account of his many excellent qualities, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> sent ambassadors to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> to accuse him in his absence of having made a league with the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> to subjugate Greece. On this charge he was condemned, while absent, of treason to his country.

Having arrived here, and the king being absent at the time, he, in order that he might secure himself, if received, with the stronger safeguard of religion, took up the king's little daughter, and ran with her into a certain temple, which was regarded with the utmost veneration, and from which he did not come out till the king having given him his right hand, took him under his protection; an engagement which he strictly observed. For when his surrender was publicly demanded by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a>, he did not betray his dependant, but warned him to consult for his safety, as it would be difficult for him to live in security in a place so near to Greece. He in consequence caused him to be conducted to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404226PPyd class=place long=22.6173 lat=40.3973>Pydna</a>, appointing him a sufficient guard. Here he went on board a ship, to all the sailors in which he was personally unknown.

Being thus compelled by necessity, he disclosed to the captain of the ship who he was, promising him a large reward if he would save him. The captain, moved with concern for so illustrious a man, kept the ship at anchor in the open sea, at some distance from the island, for a day and a night, allowing no person to quit it. Thence he went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, where he set <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a> on shore, who afterwards liberally rewarded him for his services. </p>                        </div>
