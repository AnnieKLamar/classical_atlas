And he feared their anger, and hastened to perform the great task to which <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> had bound him. With him went the horse-driving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=ethnic long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotians</a>, breathing above their shields, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386231ROpu class=ethnic long=23.04 lat=38.65>Locrians</a> who fight hand to hand, and the gallant <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=ethnic long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocians</a> eager for war and battle.

So he arose from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a> by night pondering guile in the deep of his heart, and yearned for the love of the well-girded woman.

So in one night <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> shared the bed and love of the neat-ankled daughter of <a href=/people/1769 target=_blank>Electryon</a> and fulfilled his desire; and in the same night <a href=/people/495 target=_blank>Amphitryon</a>, gatherer of the people, the glorious hero, came to his house when he had ended his great task. He hastened not to go to his bondmen and shepherds afield, but first went in unto his wife: such desire took hold on the shepherd of the people. And as a man who has escaped joyfully from misery, whether of sore disease or cruel bondage, so then did <a href=/people/495 target=_blank>Amphitryon</a>, when he had wound up all his heavy task, come glad and welcome to his home. And all night long he lay with his modest wife, delighting in the gifts of golden <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>. And she, being subject in love to a god and to a man exceeding goodly, brought forth twin sons in seven-gated <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>. Though they were brothers, these were not of one spirit; for one was weaker but the other a far better man, one terrible and strong, the mighty <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>. Him she bare through the embrace of the son of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronos</a> lord of dark clouds and the other, <a href=/people/1801 target=_blank>Iphicles</a>, of <a href=/people/495 target=_blank>Amphitryon</a> the spear-wielder — offspring distinct, this one of union with a mortal man, but that other of union with <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, leader of all the gods. </p>                        </div>
