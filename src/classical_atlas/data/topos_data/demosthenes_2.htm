For that men should have been found to carry on war against <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a>; men whose territory borders on his and who possess some power; men, above all, whose sentiments in regard to the war are such that they think of the proposed compact with him, not only as untrustworthy, but as the very ruin of their country — this seems to be certainly the work of a superhuman, a divine, beneficence. </p>                        </div>
