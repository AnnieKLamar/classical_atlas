The ancient city falls, she who ruled for so many years: <br />crowds of dead bodies lie here and there in the streets, <br />among the houses, and on the sacred thresholds of the gods. <br />Nor is it Trojans alone who pay the penalty with their blood: <br />courage returns at times to the hearts of the defeated <br />and the Greek conquerors die. Cruel mourning is everywhere, <br />everywhere there is panic, and many a form of death. <br />First, <a href=/people/1463 target=_blank>Androgeos</a>, meets us, with a great crowd of Greeks <br />around him, unknowingly thinking us allied troops, <br />and calls to us in friendly speech as well: <br />'Hurry, men!

With these words, he takes up <a href=/people/1463 target=_blank>Androgeos</a>'s <br />plumed helmet, his shield with its noble markings, <br />and straps the Greek's sword to his side. Ripheus does likewise, <br /><a href=/people/1547 target=_blank>Dymas</a> too, and all the warriors delight in it. Each man <br />arms himself with the fresh spoils.

Others with naked swords block <br />the inner doors: these they defend in massed ranks. <br />Our spirits were reinspired, to bring help to the king's palace, <br />to relieve our warriors with our aid, and add power to the beaten. <br />There was an entrance with hidden doors, and a passage in use <br />between <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>'s halls, and a secluded gateway beyond, <br />which the unfortunate <a href=/people/902 target=_blank>Andromache</a>, while the kingdom stood, <br />often used to traverse, going, unattended, to her husband's parents, <br />taking the little <a href=/people/1868 target=_blank>Astyanax</a> to his grandfather. <br />I reached the topmost heights of the pediment from which <br />the wretched Trojans were hurling their missiles in vain. <br />A turret standing on the sloping edge, and rising from the roof <br />to the sky, was one from which all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> could be seen, <br />the Danaan ships, and the Greek camp: and attacking its edges <br />with our swords, where the upper levels offered weaker mortar, <br />we wrenched it from its high place, and sent it flying: <br />falling suddenly it dragged all to ruin with a roar, <br />and shattered far and wide over the Greek ranks. <br />But more arrived, and meanwhile neither the stones <br />nor any of the various missiles ceased to fly. <br />In front of the courtyard itself, in the very doorway of the palace, <br /><a href=/people/831 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> exults, glittering with the sheen of bronze: <br />like a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a>, fed on poisonous herbs, in the light, <br />that cold winter has held, swollen, under the ground, <br />and now, gleaming with youth, its skin sloughed, <br />ripples its slimy back, lifts its front high towards the sun, <br />and darts its triple-forked tongue from its jaws. <br />Huge <a href=/people/2023 target=_blank>Periphas</a>, and <a href=/people/1617 target=_blank>Automedon</a> the armour-bearer, <br />driver of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>'s team, and all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389246PSky class=demonym long=24.568 lat=38.907>Scyrian</a> youths, <br />advance on the palace together and hurl firebrands onto the roof. <br /><a href=/people/831 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> himself among the front ranks, clutching a double-axe, <br />breaks through the stubborn gate, and pulls the bronze doors <br />from their hinges: and now, hewing out the timber, he breaches <br />the solid oak and opens a huge window with a gaping mouth. <br />The palace within appears, and the long halls are revealed: <br />the inner sanctums of <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>, and the ancient kings, appear, <br />and armed men are seen standing on the very threshold. </p>                        </div>

I saw <a href=/people/831 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> myself, on the threshold, <br />mad with slaughter, and the two sons of <a href=/people/126 target=_blank>Atreus</a>: <br />I saw <a href=/people/2138 target=_blank>Hecuba</a>, her hundred women, and <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> at the altars, <br />polluting with blood the flames that he himself had sanctified. <br />Those fifty chambers, the promise of so many offspring, <br />the doorposts, rich with spoils of barbarian gold, <br />crash down: the Greeks possess what the fire spares. <br />And maybe you ask, what was <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>'s fate. <br />When he saw the end of the captive city, the palace doors <br />wrenched away, and the enemy among the inner rooms, <br />the aged man clasped his long-neglected armour <br />on his old, trembling shoulders, and fastened on his useless sword, <br />and hurried into the thick of the enemy seeking death. <br />In the centre of the halls, and under the sky's naked arch, <br />was a large altar, with an ancient laurel nearby, that leant <br />on the altar, and clothed the household gods with shade. <br />Here <a href=/people/2138 target=_blank>Hecuba</a>, and her daughters, like doves driven <br />by a dark storm, crouched uselessly by the shrines, <br />huddled together, clutching at the statues of the gods. <br />And when she saw <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> himself dressed in youthful armour <br />she cried: 'What mad thought, poor husband, urges you <br />to fasten on these weapons? Where do you run? <br />The hour demands no such help, nor defences such as these, <br />not if my own <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a> were here himself. Here, I beg you, <br />this altar will protect us all or we'll die together.' <br />So she spoke and drew the old man towards her, <br />and set him down on the sacred steps. <br />See, <a href=/people/1923 target=_blank>Polites</a>, one of <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>'s sons, escaping <a href=/people/831 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a>'s slaughter, <br />runs down the long hallways, through enemies and spears, <br />and, wounded, crosses the empty courts. <br /><a href=/people/831 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> chases after him, eager to strike him, <br />and grasps at him now, and now, with his hand, at spear-point. <br />When finally he reached the eyes and gaze of his parents, <br />he fell, and poured out his life in a river of blood. <br /><a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>, though even now in death's clutches, <br />did not spare his voice at this, or hold back his anger: <br />'If there is any justice in heaven, that cares about such things, <br />may the gods repay you with fit thanks, and due reward <br />for your wickedness, for such acts, you who have <br />made me see my own son's death in front of my face, <br />and defiled a father's sight with murder. <br />Yet <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, whose son you falsely claim to be, was no <br />such enemy to <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>: he respected the suppliant's rights, <br />and honour, and returned <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>'s bloodless corpse <br />to its sepulchre, and sent me home to my kingdom.' <br />So the old man spoke, and threw his ineffectual spear <br />without strength, which immediately spun from the clanging bronze <br />and hung uselessly from the centre of the shield's boss. <br /><a href=/people/831 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> spoke to him: 'Then you can be messenger, carry <br />the news to my father, to <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a>'s son: remember to tell him <br />of degenerate <a href=/people/831 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a>, and of my sad actions: <br />now die.' Saying this he dragged him, trembling, <br />and slithering in the pool of his son's blood, to the very altar, <br />and twined his left hand in his hair, raised the glittering sword <br />in his right, and buried it to the hilt in his side. <br />This was the end of <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>'s life: this was the death that fell to him <br />by lot, seeing <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> ablaze and its citadel toppled, he who was <br />once the magnificent ruler of so many Asian lands and peoples. <br />A once mighty body lies on the shore, the head <br />shorn from its shoulders, a corpse without a name. </p>                        </div>

Troubled greatly <br />in spirit, I prayed to the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> of the wild, <br />and father Gradivus, who rules the Thracian fields, <br />to look with due kindness on this vision, and lessen <br />its significance. But when I attacked the third <br />with greater effort, straining with my knees against the sand <br />(to speak or be silent?), a mournful groan was audible <br />from deep in the mound, and a voice came to my ears: <br />'Why do you wound a poor wretch, <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>?

Oh, leave this cruel land: leave this shore <br />of greed. For I am <a href=/people/1494 target=_blank>Polydorus</a>. Here a crop of iron spears <br />carpeted my transfixed corpse, and has ripened into sharp spines.' <br />Then truly I was stunned, my mind crushed by anxious dread, <br />my hair stood up on end, and my voice stuck in my throat. <br /><a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>, the unfortunate, seeing the city encircled by the siege, <br />and despairing of Trojan arms, once sent this <a href=/people/1494 target=_blank>Polydorus</a>, secretly, <br />with a great weight of gold, to be raised, by the Thracian king. <br />When the power of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> was broken, and her fortunes ebbed, <br />the Thracian broke every divine law, to follow <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>'s <br />cause, and his victorious army, murders <a href=/people/1494 target=_blank>Polydorus</a>, and takes <br />the gold by force. Accursed hunger for gold, to what do you <br />not drive human hearts! When terror had left my bones <br />I referred this divine vision to the people's appointed leaders, <br />my father above all, and asked them what they thought. <br />All were of one mind, to leave this wicked land, and depart <br />a place of hospitality defiled, and sail our fleet before the wind. <br />So we renewed the funeral rites for <a href=/people/1494 target=_blank>Polydorus</a>, and piled <br />the earth high on his barrow: sad altars were raised <br />to the Shades, with dark sacred ribbons and black cypress, <br />the Trojan women around, hair streaming, <br />as is the custom: we offered foaming bowls of warm milk, <br />and dishes of sacrificial blood, and bound the spirit <br />to its tomb, and raised a loud shout of farewell. </p>                        </div>

The rite completed, with joy <br />I told <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a> of this revelation, revealing it all in order. <br />He understood about the ambiguity in our origins, and the dual <br />descent, and that he had been deceived by a fresh error, <br />about our ancient country. Then he spoke: 'My son, troubled <br />by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>'s fate, Only <a href=/people/631 target=_blank>Cassandra</a> prophesied such an outcome. <br />Now I remember her foretelling that this was destined for our race, <br />and often spoke of <a href=/people/597 target=_blank>Hesperia</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> kingdom. <br />Who'd believe that Trojans would travel to <a href=/people/597 target=_blank>Hesperia</a>'s shores? <br />Who'd have been moved by <a href=/people/631 target=_blank>Cassandra</a>, the prophetess, then? <br />Let's trust to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, and, warned by him, take the better course.' <br />So he spoke, and we were delighted to obey his every word. <br />We departed this home as well, and, leaving some people behind, <br />set sail, and ran through the vast ocean in our hollow ships. <br />When the fleet had reached the high seas and the land <br />was no longer seen, sky and ocean on all sides, then <br />a dark-blue rain cloud settled overhead, bringing <br />night and storm, and the waves bristled with shadows. <br />Immediately the winds rolled over the water and great seas rose: <br />we were scattered here and there in the vast abyss. <br />Storm-clouds shrouded the day, and the night mists <br />hid the sky: lightning flashed again from the torn clouds. <br />We were thrown off course, and wandered the blind waves. <br /><a href=/people/1674 target=_blank>Palinurus</a> himself was unable to tell night from day in the sky, <br />and could not determine his path among the waves. <br />So for three days, and as many starless nights, <br />we wandered uncertainly, in a dark fog, over the sea. <br />At last, on the fourth day, land was first seen to rise, <br />revealing far off mountains and rolling smoke. <br />The sails fell, we stood to the oars: without pause, the sailors, <br />at full stretch, churned the foam, and swept the blue sea. </p>                        </div>

Then I order my friends <br />to take up their weapons and make war on that dreadful race. <br />They do exactly that, obeying orders, placing hidden swords <br />in the grass, and burying their shields out of sight. <br />Then when the birds swoop, screaming, along the curved beach, <br /><a href=/people/5795 target=_blank>Misenus</a>, from his high lookout, gives the signal on hollow bronze. <br />My friends charge, and, in a new kind of battle, attempt <br />to wound these foul ocean birds with their swords. <br />But they don't register the blows to their plumage, or the wounds <br />to their backs, they flee quickly, soaring beneath the heavens, <br />leaving behind half-eaten food, and the traces of their filth. <br />Only <a href=/people/1974 target=_blank>Celaeno</a>, ominous prophetess, settles on a high cliff, <br />and bursts out with this sound from her breast: <br />'Are you ready to bring war to us, sons of <a href=/people/1277 target=_blank>Laomedon</a>, is it war, <br />for the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> you killed, the bullocks you slaughtered, <br />driving the innocent <a href=/people/1202 target=_blank>Harpies</a> from their father's country? <br />Take these words of mine to your hearts then, and set them there. <br />I, the eldest of the <a href=/people/1744 target=_blank>Furies</a>, reveal to you what the all-powerful <br />Father prophesied to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Phoebus Apollo</a> to me. <br />Italy is the path you take, and, invoking the winds, <br />you shall go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and enter her harbours freely: <br />but you will not surround the city granted you with walls <br />until dire hunger, and the sin of striking at us, force you <br />to consume your very tables with devouring jaws.' <br />She spoke, and fled back to the forest borne by her wings. <br />But my companions' chill blood froze with sudden fear: <br />their courage dropped, and they told me to beg for peace, <br />with vows and prayers, forgoing weapons, <br />no matter if these were goddesses or fatal, vile birds. <br />And my father <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a>, with outstretched hands, on the shore, <br />called to the great gods and declared the due sacrifice: <br />'Gods, avert these threats, gods, prevent these acts, <br />and, in peace, protect the virtuous!' Then he ordered us <br />to haul in the cables from the shore, unfurl and spread the sails. <br />South winds stretched the canvas: we coursed over foaming seas, <br />wherever the winds and the helmsman dictated our course. <br />Now wooded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378209PZak class=place long=20.8921 lat=37.7872>Zacynthus</a> appeared amongst the waves, <br /><a about=https://topostext.org/place/383213IDol class=place long=20.72 lat=38.36>Dulichium</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383207PSam class=place long=20.6589 lat=38.2546>Same</a> and <a href=/people/3725 target=_blank>Neritos</a>'s steep cliffs. <br />We ran past <a href=/people/520 target=_blank>Laertes</a>'s kingdom, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383207IIth class=place long=20.71 lat=38.34>Ithacas</a>'s reefs, <br />and cursed the land that reared cruel <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>. <br />Soon the cloudy heights of Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387207PLeu class=place long=20.717 lat=38.81>Leucata</a> were revealed, <br />as well, and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>'s <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386205SApo class=place long=20.5486 lat=38.5688>headland</a>, feared by sailors. <br />We headed wearily for it, and approached the little town: <br />the anchor was thrown from the prow, the stern rested on the beach. </p>                        </div>

overcome such troubles?' <br /><a href=/people/515 target=_blank>Helenus</a>, first sacrificing bullocks according to the ritual, <br />obtained the gods' grace, then loosened the headband <br />from his holy brow, and led me, anxious at so much <br />divine power, with his own hand, to your threshold <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, <br />and then the priest prophesied this, from the divine mouth: <br />'Son of the goddess, since the truth is clear, that you sail <br />the deep blessed by the higher powers (so the king of the gods <br />allots our fates, and rolls the changes, so the order alters), <br />I'll explain a few things of many, in my words to you, <br />so you may travel foreign seas more safely, and can find <br />rest in an <a

from that far-off <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, whose neighbouring port <br />you intend to enter, unknowingly thinking it nearby. <br

and disturb the omens. <br />Let your friends adopt this mode of sacrifice, and yourself: <br />and let your descendants remain pure in this religion. <br />But when the wind carries you, on leaving, to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> shore, <br />and the barriers of narrow <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383157LPel class=place long=15.651 lat=38.267>Pelorus</a> open ahead, <br />make for the seas and land to port, in a long circuit: <br />avoid the shore and waters on the starboard side. <br />They say, when the two were one continuous stretch of land, <br />they one day broke apart, torn by the force of a vast upheaval <br />(time's remote antiquity enables such great changes). <br />The sea flowed between them with force, and severed <br />the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym

about=https://topostext.org/place/383157LSky class=place long=15.715 lat=38.255>Scylla</a> with dark hiding-places, <br />and she thrusts her mouths out, and drags ships onto the rocks. <br />Above she has human shape, and is a girl, with lovely breasts, <br />a girl, down to her sex, below it she is a sea-monster of huge size, <br />with <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphins</a>' tails joined to a belly formed of <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a>. <br />It is better to round the point of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367151LPac class=place long=15.131 lat=36.67>Pachynus</a>, <br />lingering, and circling <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> on a long course, <br />than to once catch sight of hideous <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383157LSky class=place long=15.715 lat=38.255>Scylla</a> in her vast cave <br />and the rocks that echo to her sea-dark <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a>. <br />Beyond this, if <a href=/people/515 target=_blank>Helenus</a> has any knowledge, if the seer <br />can be believed, if <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> fills his spirit with truth, <br />son of the goddess, I will say this one thing, this one thing <br />that is worth all, and I'll repeat the warning again and again, <br />honour great <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>'s divinity above all, with prayer, and recite <br />your vows to <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a> freely, and win over that powerful lady <br />with humble gifts: so at last you'll leave <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> behind <br />and reach the coast of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, victorious. <br />Once brought there, approach the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=place long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a>, <br />the ghostly lakes, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141WAve class=place long=14.0822 lat=40.8393>Avernus</a>, with its whispering groves, <br />gaze on the raving prophetess, who sings the fates <br />deep in the rock, and commits names and signs to leaves. <br />Whatever verses the virgin writes on the leaves, <br />she arranges in order, and stores them high up in her cave. <br />They stay in place, motionless, and keep in rank: <br />but once a light breeze ruffles them, at the turn of a hinge, <br />and the opening door disturbs the delicate leaves, she never <br />thinks to retrieve them, as they flutter through the rocky cave, <br />or to return them to their places, or reconstitute the prophecies: <br />men go away unanswered, and detest the <a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibyl</a>'s lair. <br />Though your friends complain, and though your course <br />calls your sails urgently to the deep, and a following wind <br />might fill the canvas, don't overvalue the loss in any delay, <br />but visit the prophetess, and beg her with prayers to speak <br />the oracle herself, and loose her voice through willing lips. <br />She will rehearse the peoples of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, the wars to come, <br />and how you might evade or endure each trial, <br />and, shown respect, she'll grant you a favourable journey. <br />These are the things you can be warned of by my voice. <br />Go now, and by your actions raise great <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> to the stars.' </p>                        </div>

Then we pray to the sacred power <br />of <a href=/people/429 target=_blank>Pallas</a>, of the clashing weapons, first to receive our cheers, <br />and clothed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> robes we veiled our heads before the altar, <br />and following the urgent command <a href=/people/515 target=_blank>Helenus</a> had given, <br />we duly made burnt offerings to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=person long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a> <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a> as ordered. </p>                        </div>

It's a house of blood and gory feasts, <br />vast and dark inside. He himself is gigantic, striking against <br />the high stars — gods, remove plagues like that from the earth! — <br />not pleasant to look at, affable to no one. <br />He eats the dark blood and flesh of wretched men. <br />I saw myself how he seized two of our number in his huge hands, <br />and reclining in the centre of the cave, broke them <br />on the rock, so the threshold, drenched, swam with blood: <br />I saw how he gnawed their limbs, dripping with dark clots <br />of gore, and the still-warm bodies quivered in his jaws. <br />Yet he did not go unpunished: <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> didn't suffer it, <br />nor did the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383207IIth class=demonym long=20.71 lat=38.34>Ithacan</a> forget himself in a crisis. <br />As soon as the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a>, full of flesh and sated with wine, <br />relaxed his neck, and lay, huge in size, across the cave, <br />drooling gore and blood and wine-drenched fragments <br />in his sleep, we prayed to the great gods, and our roles fixed, <br />surrounded him on all sides, and stabbed his one huge eye, <br />solitary, and half-hidden under his savage brow, <br />like a round Greek shield, or the sun-disc of <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a>, <br />with a sharpened stake: and so we joyfully avenged <br />the spirits of our friends. But fly from here, wretched men, <br />and cut your mooring ropes. Since, like <a href=/people/882 target=_blank>Polyphemus</a>, who pens <br />woolly flocks in the rocky cave, and milks their udders, there are <br />a hundred other appalling <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclopes</a>, the same in shape and size, <br />everywhere inhabiting the curved bay, and wandering the hills. <br />The moon's horns have filled with light three times now, while I <br />have been dragging my life out in the woods, among the lairs <br />and secret haunts of wild creatures, watching the huge <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclopes</a><br />from the cliffs, trembling at their voices and the sound of their feet. <br />The branches yield a miserable supply of fruits and stony cornelian <br />cherries, and the grasses, torn up by their roots, feed me. <br />Watching for everything, I saw, for the first time, this fleet <br />approaching shore. Whatever might happen, I surrendered myself <br />to you: it's enough for me to have escaped that wicked people. <br />I'd rather you took this life of mine by any death whatsoever.' </p>                        </div>

Now in his flight he saw the steep flanks <br />and the summit of strong <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a>, who holds the heavens <br />on his head, <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a>, whose pine-covered crown is always wreathed <br />in dark clouds and lashed by the wind and rain: <br />fallen snow clothes his shoulders: while rivers fall <br />from his ancient chin, and his rough beard bristles with ice. <br />There <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379224LKyl class=person long=22.3969 lat=37.9397>Cyllenian</a> <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a> first halted, balanced on level wings: <br />from there, he threw his whole body headlong <br />towards the waves, like a bird that flies low close <br />to the sea, round the coasts and the rocks rich in fish. <br />So the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379224LKyl class=demonym long=22.3969 lat=37.9397>Cyllenian</a>-born flew between heaven and earth <br />to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>'s sandy shore, cutting the winds, coming <br />from <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a>, his mother <a href=/people/525 target=_blank>Maia</a>'s father. <br />As soon as he reached the builders' huts, on his winged feet, <br />he saw <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> establishing towers and altering roofs. <br />His sword was starred with tawny jasper, <br />and the cloak that hung from his shoulder blazed <br />with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=demonym long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrian</a> purple, a gift that rich <a href=/people/433 target=_blank>Dido</a> had made, <br />weaving the cloth with golden thread. <br /><a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a> challenged him at once: 'For love of a wife <br />are you now building the foundations of high <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a><br />and a pleasing city?

What to do? With what speech dare he tackle <br />the love-sick queen? What opening words should he choose? <br />And he cast his mind back and forth swiftly, <br />considered the issue from every aspect, and turned it every way. <br />This seemed the best decision, given the alternatives: <br />he called <a href=/people/12120 target=_blank>Mnestheus</a>, <a href=/people/3692 target=_blank>Sergestus</a> and brave <a href=/people/3959 target=_blank>Serestus</a>, <br />telling them to fit out the fleet in silence, gather the men <br />on the shore, ready the ships' tackle, and hide the reason <br />for these changes of plan.

All be silent now, and wreathe your brows.' <br />So saying he veiled his forehead with his mother's myrtle. <br /><a href=/people/4552 target=_blank>Helymus</a> did likewise, <a href=/people/1149 target=_blank>Acestes</a> of mature years, the boy <br /><a href=/people/387 target=_blank>Ascanius</a>, and the rest of the people followed. <br />Then he went with many thousands, from the gathering <br />to the grave-mound, in the midst of the vast accompanying throng. <br />Here with due offering he poured two bowls of pure wine <br />onto the ground, two of fresh milk, two of sacrificial blood, <br />and, scattering bright petals, he spoke as follows: <br />'Once more, hail, my sacred father: hail, spirit, <br />ghost, ashes of my father, whom I rescued in vain. <br />I was not allowed to search, with you, for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>'s borders, <br />our destined fields, or Ausonia's <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, wherever it might be.' <br />He had just finished speaking when a shining <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> unwound <br />each of its seven coils from the base of the shrine, <br />in seven large loops, placidly encircling the mound, and gliding <br />among the altars, its back mottled with blue-green markings, <br />and its scales burning with a golden sheen, as a rainbow forms <br />a thousand varied colours in clouds opposite the sun. <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> was stunned by the sight. Finally, with a long glide <br />among the bowls and polished drinking cups, the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a><br />tasted the food, and, having fed, departed the altar, <br />retreating harmlessly again into the depths of the tomb. <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> returned more eagerly to the tribute to his father, <br />uncertain whether to treat the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> as the guardian of the place, <br />or as his father's attendant spirit: he killed two <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> as customary, <br />two <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a>, and as many black-backed heifers: <br />and poured wine from the bowls, and called on the spirit <br />and shadow of great <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a>, released from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392205WAch class=place long=20.4831 lat=39.2348>Acheron</a>. <br />And his companions as well, brought gifts gladly, of which <br />each had a store, piling high the altars, sacrificing bullocks: <br />others set out rows of cauldrons, and scattered among the grass, <br />placed live coals under the spits, and roasted the meat. </p>                        </div>

Steer her course this way: <br />hug the shore and graze the crags to port, oars raised: <br />let others keep to deep water.' He spoke, but <a href=/people/2466 target=_blank>Menoetes</a><br />fearing unseen reefs wrenched the prow towards the open sea. <br />'Why so far adrift?' again, 'Head for the rocks, <a href=/people/2466 target=_blank>Menoetes</a>!' <br />he shouts to him forcefully, and behold, he sees <a href=/people/3804 target=_blank>Cloanthus</a><br />right at his back and taking the riskier course. <br />He squeezed a path between <a href=/people/2623 target=_blank>Gyas</a>'s ship and the booming rocks <br />inside to starboard, suddenly passing the leader, <br />and, leaving the marker behind, reached safe water. <br />Then indeed great indignation burned in the young man's marrow, <br />and there were tears on his cheeks, and forgetting his own pride <br />and his crew's safety he heaved the timid <a href=/people/2466 target=_blank>Menoetes</a><br />headlong into the sea from the high stern: <br />he stood to the helm, himself captain and steersman, <br />urged on his men, and turned for the shore. <br />But when <a href=/people/2466 target=_blank>Menoetes</a> old as he was, clawed his way back heavily <br />and with difficulty at last from the sea floor, he climbed to the top <br />of the crag and sat down on the dry rock dripping, in his wet <br />clothing. The Trojans laughed as he fell, and swam <br />and laughed as he vomited the seawater from his chest. <br />At this a joyful hope of passing <a href=/people/2623 target=_blank>Gyas</a>, as he stalled, <br />is aroused in <a href=/people/3692 target=_blank>Sergestus</a> and <a href=/people/12120 target=_blank>Mnestheus</a>, the two behind, <br /><a href=/people/3692 target=_blank>Sergestus</a> takes the leading place and nears the rock, <br />still he's not a full ship's length in front, only part: <br />the rival Sea-Serpent closes on him with her prow. <br />Then, <a href=/people/5798 target=_blank>Mnesthus</a> walking among his crew amidships <br />exhorted them: 'Now, now rise to the oars, comrades <br />of <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>, you whom I chose as companions at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>'s <br />last fatal hour: now, exert all that strength, <br />that spirit you showed in the <a href=/people/12044 target=_blank>Gaetulian</a> shoals, <br />the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionian Sea</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364232LMal class=place long=23.198 lat=36.436>Cape Malea</a>'s pursuing waves. <br />Now I, <a href=/people/5798 target=_blank>Mnesthus</a>, do not seek to be first or try to win — <br />let those conquer whom you have granted to do so, <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a> — <br />but oh, it would be shameful to return last: achieve this for us, <br />countrymen, and prevent our disgrace.' They bend to it <br />with fierce rivalry: the bronze stern shudders at their powerful <br />strokes: and the sea-floor drops away beneath them: <br />then shallow breathing makes limbs and parched lips quiver. <br />and their sweat runs down in streams. <br />Chance brings the men the glory that they long for. <br />When <a href=/people/8296 target=_blank>Segestus</a>, his spirit raging, forces his bows, <br />on the inside, towards the rocks, and enters <br />dangerous water, unhappily he strikes the jutting reef. <br />The cliff shakes, the oars jam against them, and snap <br />on the sharp edges of stone, and the prow hangs there, snagged. <br />The sailors leap up, and, shouting aloud at the delay, <br />gather iron-tipped poles and sharply-pointed boathooks, <br />and rescue their smashed oars from the water. <br />But <a href=/people/5798 target=_blank>Mnesthus</a>, delighted, and made eager by his success, <br />with a swift play of oars, and a prayer to the winds. <br />heads for home waters and courses the open sea, <br />as a dove, whose nest and sweet chicks are hidden <br />among the rocks, suddenly startled from some hollow, <br />takes flight for the fields, frightened from her cover, <br />and beats her wings loudly, but soon gliding in still air <br />skims her clear path, barely moving her swift pinions: <br />in this way <a href=/people/12120 target=_blank>Mnestheus</a> and the Sea-Dragon herself furrow <br />the final stretch of water in flight, and her impetus <br />alone, carries her on her winged path. Firstly <br />he leaves <a href=/people/8296 target=_blank>Segestus</a> behind struggling on the raised rock <br />then in shoal water, calling vainly for help, <br />and learning how to race with shattered oars. <br />Then he overhauls <a href=/people/2623 target=_blank>Gyas</a> and the <a href=/people/1239 target=_blank>Chimaera</a>'s huge bulk: <br />which, deprived of her helmsman now, gives way. <br />Now <a href=/people/3804 target=_blank>Cloanthus</a> alone is left ahead, near to the finish, <br /><a href=/people/12120 target=_blank>Mnestheus</a> heads for him and chases closely <br />exerting all his powers. Then indeed the shouts redouble, <br />and together all enthusiastically urge on the pursuer. <br />The former crew are unhappy lest they fail to keep <br />the honour that is theirs and the glory already <br />in their possession, and would sell their lives for fame. <br />the latter feed on success: they can because they think they can. <br />And with their prow alongside they might have snatched the prize, <br />if <a href=/people/7509 target=_blank>Cleanthus</a> had not stretched out his hands over the sea <br />and poured out his prayers, and called to the gods in longing. <br />'Gods, whose empire is the ocean, whose waters I course, <br />On shore, I will gladly set a snow-white <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a><br />before your altars, in payment of my vows, <br />throw the entrailsinto the saltwater, and pour out pure wine.' <br />He spoke, and all the <a href=/people/590 target=_blank>Nereids</a>, <a href=/people/2436 target=_blank>Phorcus</a>'s choir, and virgin Panopea, <br />heard him in the wave's depths, and father <a href=/people/5923 target=_blank>Portunus</a> drove him <br />on his track, with his great hand: the ship ran to shore, swifter <br />than south wind or flying arrow, and plunged into the deep harbour. </p>                        </div>

<br />When he had finished they took their places and, suddenly, <br />on hearing the signal, they left the barrier and shot onto the course, <br />streaming out like a storm cloud, gaze fixed on the goal. <br /><a href=/people/563 target=_blank>Nisus</a> was off first, and darted away, ahead of all the others, <br />faster than the wind or the winged lightning-bolt: <br /><a href=/people/3464 target=_blank>Salius</a> followed behind him, but a long way behind: <br />then after a space <a href=/people/893 target=_blank>Euryalus</a> was third: <a href=/people/4552 target=_blank>Helymus</a><br />pursued <a href=/people/893 target=_blank>Euryalus</a>, and there was <a href=/people/2379 target=_blank>Diores</a> speeding near him, <br />now touching foot to foot, leaning at his shoulder: <br />if the course had been longer he'd have <br />slipped past him, and left the outcome in doubt. <br />Now, wearied, almost at the end of the track, <br />they neared the winning post itself, when the unlucky <a href=/people/563 target=_blank>Nisus</a><br />fell in some slippery blood, which when the bullocks were killed <br />had chanced to drench the ground and the green grass. <br />Here the youth, already rejoicing at winning, failed to keep <br />his sliding feet on the ground, but fell flat, <br />straight in the slimy dirt and sacred blood. <br />But he didn't forget <a href=/people/893 target=_blank>Euryalus</a> even then, nor his love: <br />but, picking himself up out of the wet, obstructed <a href=/people/3464 target=_blank>Salius</a>, <br />who fell head over heels onto the thick sand. <br /><a href=/people/893 target=_blank>Euryalus</a> sped by and, darting onwards to applause and the shouts <br />of his supporters, took first place, winning with his friend's help. <br /><a href=/people/4552 target=_blank>Helymus</a> came in behind him, then <a href=/people/2379 target=_blank>Diores</a>, now in third place. <br />At this <a href=/people/3464 target=_blank>Salius</a> filled the whole vast amphitheatre, and the faces <br />of the foremost elders, with his loud clamour, <br />demanding to be given the prize stolen from him by a trick. <br />His popularity protects <a href=/people/893 target=_blank>Euryalus</a>, and fitting tears, <br />and ability is more pleasing in a beautiful body. <br /><a href=/people/2379 target=_blank>Diores</a> encourages him, and protests in a loud voice, <br />having reached the palm, but claiming the last prize in vain, <br />if the highest honour goes to <a href=/people/3464 target=_blank>Salius</a>. <br />Then <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> the leader said, 'Your prizes are still yours, <br />lads, and no one is altering the order of attainment: <br />but allow me to take pity on an unfortunate friend's fate.' <br />So saying he gives <a href=/people/3464 target=_blank>Salius</a> the huge pelt of a <a href=/people/12044 target=_blank>Gaetulian</a> <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>, <br />heavy with shaggy fur, its claws gilded. <br />At this <a href=/people/563 target=_blank>Nisus</a> comments: 'If these are the prizes for losing, <br />and you pity the fallen, what fitting gift will you grant to <a href=/people/563 target=_blank>Nisus</a>, <br />who would have earned first place through merit <br />if ill luck had not dogged me, as it did <a href=/people/3464 target=_blank>Salius</a>?' <br />And with that he shows his face and limbs drenched <br />with foul mud. The best of leaders smiles at him, <br />and orders a shield to be brought, the work of Didymaon, <br />once unpinned by the Greeks from <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a>'s sacred threshold: <br />this outstanding prize he gives to the noble youth. </p>                        </div>

Order me to lead <br />your gift away.' All the Trojans together shout their approval, <br />and demand that what was promised be granted him. <br />At this <a href=/people/12123 target=_blank>Entellus</a> upbraids <a href=/people/1149 target=_blank>Acestes</a>, sitting next to him <br />on a stretch of green grass, with grave words: <br />'<a href=/people/12123 target=_blank>Entellus</a>, once the bravest of heroes, was it all in vain, <br />will you let so great a prize be carried off without a struggle, <br />and so tamely? Where's our divine master, <a href=/people/2282 target=_blank>Eryx</a>, now, <br />famous to no purpose? Where's your name throughout <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, <br />and why are those spoils of battle hanging in your house?' <br />To this <a href=/people/12123 target=_blank>Entellus</a> replies: 'It's not that quelled by fear, pride or love <br />of fame has died: but my chill blood is dull with age's sluggishness, <br />and the vigour in my body is lifeless and exhausted. <br />If I had what I once had, which that boaster enjoys <br />and relies on, if that youthfulness were mine now, <br />then I'd certainly have stepped forward, but not seduced <br />by prizes or handsome bullocks: I don't care about gifts.' <br />Having spoken he throws a pair of gloves of immense weight <br />which fierce <a href=/people/2282 target=_blank>Eryx</a>, binding the tough hide onto his hands, <br />used to fight in, into the middle of the ring. Their minds <br />are stunned: huge pieces of hide from seven massive <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a><br />are stiff with the iron and lead sewn into them. Above all <br /><a href=/people/12136 target=_blank>Dares</a> himself is astonished, and declines the bout from a distance, <br />and <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a>'s noble son turns the huge volume <br />and weight of the gloves backwards and forwards. <br />Then the older man speaks like this, from his heart: <br />'What if you'd seen the arms and gloves of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a><br />himself, and the fierce fight on this very shore? <br />Your brother <a href=/people/2282 target=_blank>Eryx</a> once wore these (you see that <br />they're still stained with blood and brain matter) <br />He faced great <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> in them: I used to fight in them <br />when more vigorous blood granted me strength, <br />and envious age had not yet sprinkled my brow with snow. <br />But if a Trojan, <a href=/people/12136 target=_blank>Dares</a>, shrinks from these gloves of ours, <br />and good <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> accepts it, and <a href=/people/1149 target=_blank>Acestes</a> my sponsor agrees, <br />let's level the odds. I'll forgo the gloves of <a href=/people/2282 target=_blank>Eryx</a><br />(banish your fears): you, throw off your Trojan ones.' <br />So speaking he flings his double-sided cloak from his shoulders, <br />baring the massive muscles of his limbs, his thighs <br />with their huge bones, and stands, a giant, in the centre of the arena. <br />Then our ancestor, <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a>'s son, lifts up a like pair of gloves, <br />and protects the hands of both contestants equally. <br />Immediately each takes up his stance, poised on his toes, <br />and fearlessly raises his arms high in front of him. <br />Keeping their heads up and well away from the blows <br />they begin to spar, fist to fist, and provoke a battle, <br />the one better at moving his feet, relying on his youth, <br />the other powerful in limbs and bulk: but his slower legs quiver, <br />his knees are unsteady, and painful gasps shake his huge body. <br />They throw many hard punches at each other but in vain, <br />they land many on their curved flanks, or their chests <br />are thumped loudly, gloves often stray to ears <br />and brows, and jaws rattle under the harsh blows. <br /><a href=/people/12123 target=_blank>Entellus</a> stands solidly, not moving, in the same stance, <br />avoiding the blows with his watchful eyes and body alone. <br /><a href=/people/12136 target=_blank>Dares</a>, like someone who lays siege to a towering city, <br />or surrounds a mountain fortress with weapons, <br />tries this opening and that, seeking everywhere, with his art, <br />and presses hard with varied but useless assaults. <br />Then <a href=/people/12123 target=_blank>Entellus</a> standing up to him, extends his raised right: <br />the other, foreseeing the downward angle of the imminent blow, <br />slides his nimble body aside, and retreats: <br />Entellus wastes his effort on the air and the heavy man <br />falls to the ground heavily, with his whole weight, <br />as a hollow pine-tree, torn up by its roots, sometimes falls <br />on Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380218LEry class=place long=21.8333 lat=37.9667>Erymanthus</a> or mighty Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397268LIda class=place long=26.8423 lat=39.6922>Ida</a>. <br />The Trojans and the Sicilan youths leap up eagerly: <br />a shout lifts to the sky, and <a href=/people/1149 target=_blank>Acestes</a> is the first to run forward <br />and with sympathy raises his old friend from the ground. <br />But that hero, not slowed or deterred by his fall, <br />returns more eagerly to the fight, and generates power from anger. <br />Then shame and knowledge of his own ability revive his strength, <br />and he drives <a href=/people/12136 target=_blank>Dares</a> in fury headlong across the whole arena, <br />doubling his punches now, to right and left. No pause, or rest: <br />like the storm clouds rattling their dense hailstones on the roof, <br />as heavy are the blows from either hand, as the hero <br />continually batters at <a href=/people/12136 target=_blank>Dares</a> and destroys him. <br />Then <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, their leader, would not allow the wrath to continue <br />longer, nor <a href=/people/12123 target=_blank>Entellus</a> to rage with such bitterness of spirit, <br />but put an end to the contest, and rescued the weary <a href=/people/12136 target=_blank>Dares</a>, <br />speaking gently to him with these words: <br />'Unlucky man, why let such savagery depress your spirits? <br />Don't you see another has the power: the gods have changed sides? <br />Yield to the gods.' He spoke and, speaking, broke up the fight. <br />But Dare's loyal friends led him away to the ships, <br />his weakened knees collapsing, his head swaying from side to side, <br />spitting out clots of blood from his mouth, teeth amongst them. <br />Called back they accept the helmet and sword, <br />leaving the winner's palm and the bullock for <a href=/people/12123 target=_blank>Entellus</a>. <br />At this the victor exultant in spirit and glorying in the bullock, <br />said: 'Son of the Goddess, and all you Trojans, <br />know now what physical strength I had in my youth, <br />and from what fate you've recalled and rescued <a href=/people/12136 target=_blank>Dares</a>.' <br />He spoke and planted himself opposite the bullock, <br />still standing there as prize for the bout, then, drawing back <br />his right fist, aimed the hard glove between the horns <br />and broke its skull scattering the brains: the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a><br />fell quivering to the ground, stretched out lifeless. <br />Standing over it he poured these words from his chest: <br />'<a href=/people/2282 target=_blank>Eryx</a>, I offer you this, the better animal, for <a href=/people/12136 target=_blank>Dares</a>'s life: <br />the winner here, I relinquish the gloves and my art.' </p>                        </div>

Then <br />a sudden wonder appeared before their eyes, destined to be <br />of great meaning: the time to come unveiled its crucial outcome, <br />and great seers of the future celebrated it as an omen. <br />The arrow, flying through the passing clouds, caught fire <br />marked out its path with flames, then vanished into thin air, <br />as shooting stars, loosed from heaven often transit <br />the sky, drawing their tresses after them.

While they, <br />with their various games, are paying due honours to the tomb, <br />Saturnian <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a> sends <a href=/people/403 target=_blank>Iris</a> down from the sky to the Trojan fleet, <br />breathing out a breeze for her passage, thinking deeply <br />about her ancient grievance which is yet unsatisfied. <br /><a href=/people/403 target=_blank>Iris</a>, hurrying on her way along a rainbow's thousand colours <br />speeds swiftly down her track, a girl unseen. <br />She views the great crowd, and scans the shore, <br />sees the harbour deserted, and the ships abandoned. <br />But far away on the lonely sands the Trojan women <br />are weeping <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a>'s loss, and all, weeping, gaze <br />at the deep ocean. 'Ah, what waves and seas are still left <br />for weary folk!' They are all of one voice. They pray for <br />a city: they tire of enduring suffering on the waves. <br />So <a href=/people/403 target=_blank>Iris</a>, not ignorant of mischief, darts among them, <br />setting aside the appearance and robes of a goddess: <br />becoming <a href=/people/1089 target=_blank>Beroe</a>, the old wife of Tmarian <a href=/people/4382 target=_blank>Doryclus</a>, <br />who had once had family, sons, and a famous name. <br />and as such moves among the Trojan mothers, saying: <br />'O wretched ones, whom Greek hands failed to drag <br />to death in the war beneath our native walls! <br />O unhappy people what fate does <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> reserve for you? <br />The seventh summer is on the turn since <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>'s destruction, <br />and we endure the crossing of every sea and shore, so many <br />inhospitable stones and stars, while we chase over the vast sea <br />after an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> that flees from us, tossing upon the waves. <br />Here are the borders of our brother <a href=/people/2282 target=_blank>Eryx</a> and our host <a href=/people/1149 target=_blank>Acestes</a>: <br />what stops us building walls and granting our citizens a city? <br />O fatherland, O gods of our houses, rescued from the enemy <br />in vain, will no city now be called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>?

Now is the time for deeds, <br />not delay, given such portents. See, four altars to <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a>: <br />the god himself lends us fire and the courage.' <br />So saying she first of all firmly seizes the dangerous flame <br />and, straining to lift it high, brandishes it, and hurls it. <br />The minds of the Trojan women are startled, and their wits <br />stunned. Here, one of the crowd, <a href=/people/10157 target=_blank>Pyrgo</a>, the eldest, <br />the royal nurse of so many of <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>'s sons, says: <br />'This is not <a href=/people/1089 target=_blank>Beroe</a>, you women, this is no wife <br />of Rhoetitian <a href=/people/4382 target=_blank>Doryclus</a>: look at the signs of divine beauty <br />and the burning eyes, the spirit she possesses, <br />her form, the sound of her voice, her footsteps as she moves. <br />Just now I myself left <a href=/people/1089 target=_blank>Beroe</a>, sick and unhappy, that she alone <br />was missing so important a rite and could not pay <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a><br />the offerings due to him.' So she speaks. At first the women <br />gaze in uncertainty at the ships, with angry glances, <br />torn between a wretched yearning for the land <br />they have reached, and the kingdom fate calls them to, <br />when the goddess, climbs the sky on soaring wings, <br />cutting a giant rainbow in her flight through the clouds. <br />Then truly amazed at the wonder, and driven by madness, <br />they cry out and some snatch fire from the innermost hearths, <br />others strip the altars, and throw on leaves and twigs <br />and burning brands. Fire rages unchecked among <br />the benches, and oars, and the hulls of painted pine. </p>                        </div>

Hidden in a dark tree <br />is a golden bough, golden in leaves and pliant stem, <br />sacred to <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Persephone</a>, the underworld's <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>, all the groves <br />shroud it, and shadows enclose the secret valleys. <br />But only one who's taken a gold-leaved fruit from the tree <br />is allowed to enter earth's hidden places. <br />This lovely <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Proserpine</a> has commanded to be brought to her <br />as a gift: a second fruit of gold never fails to appear <br />when the first one's picked, the twig's leafed with the same metal. <br />So look for it up high, and when you've found it with your eyes, <br />take it, of right, in your hand: since, if the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> have chosen you, <br />it will come away easily, freely of itself: otherwise you <br />won't conquer it by any force, or cut it with the sharpest steel. <br />And the inanimate body of your friend lies there <br />(Ah! You do not know) and taints your whole fleet with death, <br />while you seek advice and hang about our threshold. <br />Carry him first to his place and bury him in the tomb. <br />Lead black <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> there: let those be your first offerings of atonement. <br />Only then can you look on the Stygian groves, and the realms <br />forbidden to the living.' She spoke and with closed lips fell silent. </p>                        </div>

Loyal Achates walked at his side <br />and fashioned his steps with similar concern. <br />They engaged in intricate discussion between them, <br />as to who the dead friend, the body to be interred, was, <br />whom the priestess spoke of. And as they passed along <br />they saw <a href=/people/5795 target=_blank>Misenus</a>, ruined by shameful death, on the dry sand, <br /><a href=/people/5795 target=_blank>Misenus</a>, son of <a href=/people/289 target=_blank>Aeolus</a>, than whom none was more outstanding <br />in rousing men with the war-trumpet, kindling conflict with music. <br />He was great <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>'s friend: with <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a><br />he went to battle, distinguished by his spear and trumpet. <br />When victorious <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> despoiled <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a> of life, <br />this most courageous hero joined the company <br />of Trojan <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, serving no lesser a man. But when, <br />by chance, he foolishly made the ocean sound <br />to a hollow conch-shell, and called gods to compete <br />in playing, if the tale can be believed, <a href=/people/664 target=_blank>Triton</a> overheard him <br />and drowned him in the foaming waves among the rocks. <br />So, with pious <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> to the fore, they all mourned <br />round the body with loud clamour. Then, without delay, weeping, <br />they hurried to carry out the <a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibyl</a>'s orders, and laboured to pile <br />tree-trunks as a funeral pyre, raising it to the heavens. <br />They enter the ancient wood, the deep coverts of wild creatures: <br />the pine-trees fell, the oaks rang to the blows of the axe, <br />ash trunks and fissile oak were split with wedges, <br />and they rolled large rowan trees down from the hills. </p>                        </div>

For the prophetess <br />spoke truly of you <a href=/people/5795 target=_blank>Misenus</a>, alas, only too truly.' <br />He had barely spoken when by chance a pair of doves <br />came flying down from the sky, beneath his very eyes, <br />and settled on the green grass. Then the great hero knew <br />they were his mother's birds, and prayed in his joy: <br />'O be my guides, if there is some way, and steer a course <br />through the air, to that grove where the rich branch <br />casts its shadow on fertile soil. And you mother, O goddess, <br />don't fail me in time of doubt.' So saying he halted his footsteps, <br />observing what signs the doves might give, and which direction <br />they might take. As they fed they went forward in flight <br />just as far as, following, his eyes could keep them in sight. <br />Then, when they reached the foul jaws of stinking <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141WAve class=place long=14.0822 lat=40.8393>Avernus</a>, <br />they quickly rose and, gliding through the clear air, <br />perched on the longed-for dual-natured tree, from which <br />the alien gleam of gold shone out, among the branches. <br />Just as mistletoe, that does not form a tree of its own, <br />grows in the woods in the cold of winter, with a foreign leaf, <br />and surrounds a smooth trunk with yellow berries: <br />such was the vision of this leafy gold in the dark <br />oak-tree, so the foil tinkled in the light breeze. <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> immediately plucked it, eagerly breaking the tough <br />bough, and carried it to the cave of the <a href=/people/12187 target=_blank>Sibylline</a> prophetess. <br />Meanwhile, on the shore, the Trojans were weeping bitterly <br />for <a href=/people/5795 target=_blank>Misenus</a> and paying their last respects to his senseless ashes. <br />First they raised a huge pyre, heavy with cut oak and pine, <br />weaving the sides with dark foliage, set funereal cypress in front, <br />and decorated it above with shining weapons. <br />Some heated water, making the cauldrons boil on the flames, <br />and washed and anointed the chill corpse. They made lament. <br />Then, having wept, they placed his limbs on the couch, <br />and threw purple robes over them, his usual dress. <br />Some raised the great bier, a sad duty, <br />and, with averted faces, set a torch below, <br />in ancestral fashion. Gifts were heaped on the flames, <br />of incense, foodstuffs, bowls brimming with olive-oil. <br />When the ashes collapsed, and the blaze died, they washed <br />the remains of the parched bones in wine, and Corynaeus, <br />collecting the fragments, closed them in a bronze urn. <br />Also he circled his comrades three times with pure water <br />to purify them, sprinkling fine dew from a full olive branch, <br />and spoke the words of parting. And virtuous <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a><br />heaped up a great mound for his tomb, with the hero's <br />own weapons, his trumpet and oar, beneath a high mountain <br />which is called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141HMis class=place long=14.0847 lat=40.7874>Misenus</a> now after him, and preserves <br />his ever-living name throughout the ages. </p>                        </div>

The seamed skiff groaned with the weight <br />and let in quantities of marsh-water through the chinks. <br />At last, the river crossed, he landed the prophetess and the hero <br />safe, on the unstable mud, among the blue-grey sedge. </p>                        </div>

But divine omens, with their many <br />terrors, prevented it. There was a laurel, with sacred leaves, <br />in the high inner court in the middle of the palace, <br />that had been guarded with reverence for many years. <br />It was said that Lord <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a> himself had discovered it, <br />when he first built his fortress, and dedicated it to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, <br />and from it had named the settlers <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417123ULau class=ethnic long=12.3467 lat=41.711>Laurentines</a>. <br />A dense cloud of <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> (marvellous to tell) borne <br />through the clear air, with a mighty humming, <br />settled in the very top of the tree, and hung there, <br />their feet all tangled together, in a sudden swarm. <br />Immediately the prophet cried: 'I see a foreign hero, <br />approaching, and, from a like direction, an army <br />seeks this same place, to rule from the high citadel.' <br />Then as he lit the altars with fresh pine torches, <br />as virgin <a href=/people/1059 target=_blank>Lavinia</a> stood there next to her father <br />she seemed (horror!) to catch the fire in her long tresses, <br />and all her finery to burn in crackling flame, her royally <br />dressed tresses set alight, her crown alight, remarkable <br />for its jewels: then wreathed in smoke and yellow light, <br />she seemed to scatter sparks through all the palace. <br />Truly it was talked of as a shocking and miraculous sight: <br />for they foretold she would be bright with fame and fortune, <br />but it signified a great war for her people. <br />Then the king, troubled by the wonder, visited the oracle <br />of <a href=/people/800 target=_blank>Faunus</a>, his far-speaking father, and consulted the groves <br />below high Albunea, mightiest of forests, that echoed <br />with the sacred fountain, and breathed a deadly vapour from the dark. <br />The people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401162ROen class=demonym long=16.2 lat=40.1>Oenotrian</a> lands, sought answers <br />to their doubts, from that place: when the priest brought <br />offerings there, and, found sleep, in the silent night, lying <br />on spread fleeces of sacrificed <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, he saw there many ghosts <br />flitting in marvellous forms, and heard various voices, had speech <br />with the gods, and talked with <a href=/people/3122 target=_blank>Acheron</a>, in the depths of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141WAve class=place long=14.0822 lat=40.8393>Avernus</a>. <br />And here the king, <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a>, himself seeking an answer, <br />slaughtered a hundred woolly <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> according to the rite, <br />and lay there supported by their skins and woolly fleeces: <br />Suddenly a voice emerged from the deep wood: <br />'O my son, don't try to ally your daughter in a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> marriage, <br />don't place your faith in the intended wedding: <br />strangers will come to be your kin, who'll lift our name <br />to the stars by their blood, and the children <br />of whose race shall see all, where the circling sun <br />views both oceans, turning obediently beneath their feet.' <br /><a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a> failed to keep this reply of his Father's quiet, <br />this warning given in the silent night, and already <br /><a href=/people/1271 target=_blank>Rumour</a> flying far and wide had carried it through <br />the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410155RAus class=demonym long=15.5 lat=41>Ausonian</a> cities, when the children of <a href=/people/1277 target=_blank>Laomedon</a><br />came to moor their ships by the river's grassy banks. </p>                        </div>

Hot with rage, three times he circled the whole <br /><a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LAve class=place long=12.4792 lat=41.8835>Aventine</a> Hill, three times he tried the stony doorway in vain, <br />three times he sank down, exhausted, in the valley. <br />A sharp pinnacle of flint, the rock shorn away <br />on every side, stood, tall to see, rising behind <br />the cave, a suitable place for vile birds to nest. <br />He shook it, where it lay, it's ridge sloping towards the river <br />on the left, straining at it from the right, loosening its deepest <br />roots, and tearing it out, then suddenly hurling it away, <br />the highest heavens thundered with the blow, <br />the banks broke apart, and the terrified river recoiled. <br />But <a href=/people/12088 target=_blank>Cacus</a>'s den and his vast realm stood revealed, <br />and the shadowy caverns within lay open, <br />no differently than if earth, gaping deep within, <br />were to unlock the infernal regions by force, and disclose <br />the pallid realms, hated by the gods, and the vast abyss <br />be seen from above, and the spirits tremble at incoming light. <br />So <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, calling upon all his weapons, hurled missiles <br />at <a href=/people/12088 target=_blank>Cacus</a> from above, caught suddenly in unexpected daylight, <br />penned in the hollow rock, with unaccustomed howling, <br />and rained boughs and giant blocks of stone on him. <br />He on the other hand, since there was no escape now <br />from the danger, belched thick smoke from his throat <br />(marvellous to tell) and enveloped the place in blind darkness, <br />blotting the view from sight, and gathering <br />smoke-laden night in the cave, a darkness mixed with fire. <br /><a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> in his pride could not endure it, and he threw himself, <br />with a headlong leap, through the flames, where the smoke <br />gave out its densest billows, and black mist heaved in the great cavern. <br />Here, as <a href=/people/12088 target=_blank>Cacus</a> belched out useless flame in the darkness, <br /><a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> seized him in a knot-like clasp, and, clinging, choked him <br />the eyes squeezed, and the throat drained of blood. <br />Immediately the doors were ripped out, and the dark den exposed, <br />the stolen <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, and the theft <a href=/people/12088 target=_blank>Cacus</a> denied, were revealed <br />to the heavens, and the shapeless carcass dragged out <br />by the feet. The people could not get their fill of gazing <br />at the hideous eyes, the face, and shaggy bristling chest <br />of the half-man, and the ashes of the jaw's flames. <br />Because of that this rite is celebrated, and happy posterity <br />remembers the day: and <a href=/people/3239 target=_blank>Potitius</a>, the first, the founder, with <br />the Pinarian House as guardians of the worship of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, <br />set up this altar in the grove, which shall be spoken of for ever <br />by us as 'The Mightiest', and the mightiest it shall be for ever. <br />Come now, O you young men, wreathe your hair with leaves, <br />hold out wine-cups in your right hands, in honour of such great glory, <br />and call on the god we know, and pour out the wine with a will.' <br />He spoke, while grey-green poplar veiled his hair <br />with <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>'s own shade, hanging down in a knot of leaves, <br />and the sacred cup filled his hand. Quickly they all poured <br />a joyful libation on the table, and prayed to the gods. <br />Meanwhile, evening drew nearer in the heavens, <br />and now the priests went out, <a href=/people/3239 target=_blank>Potitius</a> leading, <br />clothed in pelts as customary, and carrying torches. <br />They restarted the feast, bringing welcome offerings <br />as a second course, and piled the altars with heaped plates. <br />Then the Salii, the dancing priests, came to sing round <br />the lighted altars, their foreheads wreathed with sprays <br />of poplar, one band of youths, another of old men, who praised <br />the glories and deeds of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> in song: how as an infant he strangled <br />the twin <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> in his grip, monsters sent by <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a> his stepmother: <br />how too he destroyed cities incomparable in war, <br /><a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368228UOic class=place long=21.947 lat=37.268>Oechalia</a>: how he endured a thousand hard labours <br />destined for him by cruel <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>, through King <a href=/people/247 target=_blank>Eurystheus</a>: <br />'You, unconquerable one, you slew the cloud-born <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a>, <br />bi-formed <a href=/people/5047 target=_blank>Hylaeus</a> and Pholus, with your hand: the monstrous <br /><a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>Bull</a>: and the huge <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> below the cliffs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378227SNem class=place long=22.7108 lat=37.8085>Nemea</a>. <br />The Stygian Lake trembled before you: <a href=/people/752 target=_blank>Cerberus</a>, Hell's guardian, <br />lying on half-eaten bones in his blood-drenched cave: <br />No shape, not Typheus himself, armed and towering <br />upwards, daunted you: your brains were not lacking <br />when <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375227ULer class=place long=22.7182 lat=37.5511>Lerna</a>'s <a href=/people/1205 target=_blank>Hydra</a> surrounded you with its swarm of heads. <br />Hail, true child of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>, a glory added to the gods, <br />visit us and your rites with grace and favouring feet.' <br />Such things they celebrated in song, adding to all this <br /><a href=/people/12088 target=_blank>Cacus</a>'s cave, and the fire-breather himself. <br />All the grove rang with sound, and the hills echoed. </p>                        </div>

marvelled, and scanned his eyes about <br />eagerly, captivated by the place, and delighted <br />to enquire about and learn each tale of the men of old. <br />So King <a href=/people/686 target=_blank>Evander</a>, founder of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>'s citadel, said: <br />'The local <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> and Fauns once lived in these groves, <br />and a race of men born of trees with tough timber, <br />who had no laws or culture, and didn't know how <br />to yoke <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> or gather wealth, or lay aside a store, <br />but the branches fed them, and the hunter's wild fare. <br /><a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a> was the

class=place long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latium</a>, <br />from latere, 'to hide', since he had hidden in safety on these shores. <br />Under his reign was the Golden Age men speak of: <br />in such tranquil peace did he rule the nations, <br />until little by little an inferior, tarnished age succeeded, <br />with war's madness, and desire for possessions. <br />Then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410155RAus class=demonym long=15.5 lat=41>Ausonian</a> bands came, and the Siconian tribes, <br />while <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a>'s land of <a

target=_blank>Nymph</a> <a href=/people/2504 target=_blank>Carmentis</a>'s <br />dire warnings, and my guardian god <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>.' <br />He had scarcely spoken when

then the dreadful holiness of the place awed the fearful <br />country folk, even then they trembled at the wood and the rock. <br />'A god inhabits this grove,' he said, ' and this hill with its leafy summit, <br />(which god is unknown): my Arcadians believe they have seen <br /><a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> himself, as his right hand has often shaken <br />his darkening shield, and called up the storm clouds. <br />Moreover you can see in these two townships <br />with broken walls, the memorials and relics of men of old. <br />Father <a href=/people/983

yourself worthy too <br />to be a god: don't be scathing about the lack of possessions.' <br />He spoke, and led mighty <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> beneath the confines <br />of his

It is <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Vulcan</a>'s home <br />and called Vulcania. Here then the god <br />with the power of fire descended from the heavens. <br />In the huge cave the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclopes</a>, <a href=/people/4029 target=_blank>Brontes</a>, <a href=/people/3115 target=_blank>Steropes</a>, <br />and bare-limbed Pyrcamon, were forging iron. <br />They held a lightning-bolt, shaped with their hands, <br />like many of those the Father hurls from all over <br />the sky, part of it polished, part still left to do. <br />They'd added three shafts of spiralling rain, three of watery <br />cloud, three of reddening fire, and the winged south wind. <br />now they were blending terrifying flashes, into the work, <br />sounds and fears, and fury with following flames. <br />Elsewhere they pressed on with a chariot for <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, with winged wheels, <br />with which he rouses men, with which he rouses cities: <br />and a chilling aegis, the breastplate of <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a>, <br />competing to burnish its <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> scales of gold, <br />its interwoven <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a>, and the <a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Gorgon</a> herself <br />on the goddess's breast, with severed neck and rolling eyes: <br />'Away with all this,' he shouts, 'remove the work <br />you've started, <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclopes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377150LAit class=person long=15.001 lat=37.748>Etna</a>, and turn your minds to this: <br />you're to make arms for a brave hero. Now you <br />need strength, swift hands now, all the art now of a master. <br />An end to delay.' He said no more, but they all <br />bent quickly to the toil, and shared the labour equally. <br />Bronze and golden ore flowed in streams, <br />and steel, that deals wounds, melted in a vast furnace. <br />They shaped a giant shield, one to stand against all <br />the weapons of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=place long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latium</a>, layering it seven times, <br />disc on disc. Some sucked in air and blew it out <br />again with panting bellows, others dipped the hissing bronze <br />in the lake: the cavern groaned beneath the weight of anvils. <br />With mighty force they lifted their arms together in rhythm, <br />and turned the mass of metal, gripping it with pincers. </p>                        </div>

They clasped hands as they met, <br />sat down among the houses, and finally enjoyed <br />open conversation. The king was the first to begin, so: <br />'Greatest leader of the Teucrians, for my part while you're safe <br />and sound I'll never accept that the kingdom and power of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a><br />have been overthrown, our strength in war is inadequate to such <br />a name: on this side we are shut in by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscan</a> river, while on that <br />the Rutulian presses us, and thunders in arms round our walls. <br />But I propose to affiliate mighty peoples to you, <br />and a war-camp rich in kingships, help that chance <br />unpredictably reveals. You arrive at fate's command. <br />Not far from here is the site of Argylla's city, <br />built of ancient stone, where the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> race, <br />famous in war, once settled the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Etruscan</a> heights. <br />For many years it flourished, until King <a href=/people/1189 target=_blank>Mezentius</a><br />ruled it with arrogant power, and savage weaponry. <br />Why recount the tyrant's wicked murders and vicious acts? <br />May the gods reserve such for his life and race! <br />He even tied corpses to living bodies, as a means <br />of torture, placing hand on hand and face against face, <br />so killing by a lingering death, in that wretched <br />embrace, that ooze of disease and decomposition. <br />But the weary citizens at last armed themselves <br />surrounded the atrocious madman in his palace, <br />mowed down his supporters, and fired the roof. <br />Amongst the carnage he escaped and fled <br />to Rutulian soil, protected by <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>'s allied army. <br />So all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Etruria</a> has risen in rightful anger, demanding <br />the king for punishment, with the threat of immediate war. <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, I'll make you leader of those thousands. <br />For their ships clamour densely on the shore, <br />and they order the banners to advance, but an aged <br />soothsayer holds them back, singing of destiny: <br />'O chosen warriors of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388283RMai class=place long=28 lat=38.6>Maeonia</a>, the flower, the honour <br />of our ancient race, whom just resentment sends against <br />the enemy, and whom <a href=/people/1189 target=_blank>Mezentius</a> fires with rightful anger, <br />no man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> may control such a people as you: choose <br />foreigners as leaders.' So the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Etruscan</a> ranks camped <br />on that plain, fearful of this warning from the gods. <br /><a href=/people/2790 target=_blank>Tarchon</a> himself has sent ambassadors to me, with the royal <br />sceptre and crown, entrusting me with the insignia: <br />I to come to the camp, and take the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscan</a> throne. <br />But the slow frost of old age wearied by the years, and strength <br />now beyond acts of valour, begrudge me the command. <br />I would urge my son to it, except that of mixed blood <br />with a <a href=/people/11083 target=_blank>Sabine</a> mother, he takes part of his nationality from her. <br />You, O bravest leader of Trojans and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>, to whose race <br />and years destiny is favourable, whom the divine will calls, <br />accept. Moreover I'll add <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a> here, our hope and comfort: <br />let him become accustomed under your guidance <br />to endure military service, and the grave work of war, <br />witness your actions, and admire you from his early years. <br />I'll grant him two hundred <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a> horsemen, the choice flower <br />of our manhood, and <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a> will grant the same to you himself.' </p>                        </div>

Their spirits affected, the Trojans <br />shed tears, noble <a href=/people/1160 target=_blank>Iulus</a> above all, and this image <br />of filial love touched his heart.

And <a href=/people/9661 target=_blank>Lamyrus</a> too, and Lamum, <br />and young <a href=/people/1640 target=_blank>Serranus</a>, noted for his beauty, who had sported <br />much that night, and lay there limbs drowned by much wine — <br />happy if he'd carried on his game all night till dawn: <br />So a starving <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> churning through a full sheepfold, (driven <br />by its raging hunger) gnaws and tears at the feeble flock <br />mute with fear, and roars from its bloodstained mouth. <br />Nor was <a href=/people/893 target=_blank>Euryalus</a>'s slaughter any less: he too raged, ablaze, <br />and among the nameless crowd he attacked <a href=/people/2617 target=_blank>Fadus</a>, <br />and Herbesus, and <a href=/people/11001 target=_blank>Abaris</a>, while they were unconscious: <br />and Rhoetus, but Rhoetus was awake and saw it all, <br />but crouched in fear behind a huge wine-bowl. As he rose, <br />in close encounter, <a href=/people/893 target=_blank>Euryalus</a> plunged his whole blade <br />into Rhoetus's chest, and withdrew it red with death. Rhoetus <br />choked out his life in dark blood, and, dying, brought up wine <br />mixed with gore: the other pressed on fervently and stealthily. <br />Now he approached Messapus's followers: there he saw <br />the outermost fires flickering, and the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, duly tethered, <br />cropping the grass: <a href=/people/563 target=_blank>Nisus</a> (seeing him carried away <br />by slaughter and love of the sword's power) said briefly: <br />'Let's go, since unhelpful dawn is near. Enough: vengeance <br />has been satisfied: a path has been made through the enemy.' <br />They left behind many of the men's weapons <br />fashioned from solid silver, and wine-bowls and splendid hangings. <br /><a href=/people/893 target=_blank>Euryalus</a> snatched Rhamnes's trappings, and gold-studded <br />sword-belt, gifts that wealthy <a href=/people/7413 target=_blank>Caedicus</a> had once sent to <a href=/people/3243 target=_blank>Remulus</a><br />of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a>, expressing friendship in absence: he when dying <br />gave them to his grandson as his own, and after his death in turn <br />the <a href=/people/1141 target=_blank>Rutulians</a> captured them during the war in battle: now <br /><a href=/people/893 target=_blank>Euryalus</a> fitted them over his brave shoulders, though in vain. <br />Then he put on Messapus's excellent helmet with its handsome <br />plumes. The left the camp and headed for safety. </p>                        </div>

Who are you, <br />you're armed? Where are you off to?' They offered no response, <br />but hastened their flight to the woods, trusting to the dark. <br />The riders closed off the known junctions, on every side, <br />and surrounded each exit route with guards. <br />The forest spread out widely, thick with brambles <br />and holm-oaks, the dense thorns filling it on every side: <br />there the path glinted through the secret glades. <br /><a href=/people/893 target=_blank>Euryalus</a> was hampered by shadowy branches, and the weight <br />of his plunder, and his fear confused the path's direction. <br /><a href=/people/563 target=_blank>Nisus</a> was clear: and already unaware had escaped the enemy, <br />and was at the place later called Alba from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=place long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alba Longa</a><br />(at that time King <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a> had his noble stalls there) <br />when he stopped, and looked back vainly for his missing friend. <br />'<a href=/people/893 target=_blank>Euryalus</a>, unhappy boy, where did I separate from you? <br />Which way shall I go?' he said, considering all the tangled tracks <br />of the deceptive wood, and at the same time scanning <br />the backward traces he could see, criss-crossing the silent thickets. <br />He heard <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, heard the cries and signals of pursuit: <br />and it was no great time before a shout reached his ears <br />and he saw <a href=/people/893 target=_blank>Euryalus</a>, betrayed by the ground and the night, <br />confused by the sudden tumult, whom the whole troop <br />were dragging away, overpowered, struggling violently in vain. <br />What can he do? With what force, or weapons, can he dare <br />to rescue the youth? Should he hurl himself to his death among <br />the swords, and by his wounds hasten to a glorious end? <br />He swiftly drew back his spear arm and gazing upwards <br />at the moon above, prayed, with these words: <br />'O you, goddess, O you, <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Latona</a>'s daughter, glory of the stars, <br />and keeper of the woods, be here and help us in our trouble. <br />If ever my father, <a href=/people/2625 target=_blank>Hyrtacus</a>, brought offerings on my behalf <br />to your altars, if ever I added to them from my own hunting, <br />hung them beneath your dome, or fixed them to the sacred eaves, <br />let me throw their troop into confusion, guide my spear through the air.' <br />He spoke and flung the steel, straining with his whole body. <br />The flying javelin divided the shadows, struck <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420139USul class=place long=13.9256 lat=42.0468>Sulmo</a>'s back, <br />as he turned, and snapped, the broken shaft piercing the heart. <br />He rolled over, a hot stream pouring from his chest, <br />and deep gasps shook his sides, as he grew cold. <br />They gazed round them, in every direction. See, <a href=/people/563 target=_blank>Nisus</a>, <br />all the more eager, levelled another spear against his ear. <br />While they hesitated, the javelin hissed through both <br />of <a href=/people/900 target=_blank>Tagus</a>'s temples, and fixed itself still warm in the pierced <br />brain. Fierce <a href=/people/4741 target=_blank>Volcens</a> raged, but could not spy out the author <br />of the act, nor any place that he could vent his fire. <br />He rushed at <a href=/people/893 target=_blank>Euryalus</a> with his naked sword, as he <br />cried out: 'In the mean time you'll pay in hot blood <br />and give me revenge for both your crimes.' <br />Then, truly maddened with fear, <a href=/people/563 target=_blank>Nisus</a> shouted aloud, unable <br />to hide himself in the dark any longer, or endure such agony: <br />On me, <a href=/people/1141 target=_blank>Rutulians</a>, turn your steel on me, me who did the deed! <br />The guilt is all mine, he neither dared nor had the power: <br />the sky and the all-knowing stars be witnesses: <br />he only loved his unfortunate friend too much.' <br />He was still speaking, but the sword, powerfully driven, <br />passed through the ribs and tore the white breast. <br /><a href=/people/893 target=_blank>Euryalus</a> rolled over in death, and the blood flowed <br />down his lovely limbs, and his neck, drooping, <br />sank on his shoulder, like a bright flower scythed <br />by the plough, bowing as it dies, or a poppy weighed <br />down by a chance shower, bending its weary head. <br />But <a href=/people/563 target=_blank>Nisus</a> rushed at them, seeking <a href=/people/4741 target=_blank>Volcens</a><br />above all, intent on <a href=/people/4741 target=_blank>Volcens</a> alone. <br />The enemy gathered round him, to drive him off, <br />in hand to hand conflict. He attacked none the less, whirling <br />his sword like lightning, until he buried it full in the face <br />of the shrieking Rutulian, and, dying, robbed his enemy of life. <br />Then, pierced through, he threw himself on the lifeless body <br />of his friend, and found peace at last in the calm of death. <br />Happy pair! If my poetry has the power, <br />while the House of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> lives beside the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>'s <br />immobile stone, and a Roman leader rules the Empire, <br />no day will raze you from time's memory. <br />The victorious <a href=/people/1141 target=_blank>Rutulians</a>, gaining new plunder, and the spoils, <br />weeping carried the lifeless <a href=/people/4741 target=_blank>Volcens</a> to the camp. <br />Nor was there less grief in that camp when Rhamnes <br />was discovered, drained of blood, and so many other leaders, <br />killed in a single slaughter, with <a href=/people/1640 target=_blank>Serranus</a> and <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a>. A huge <br />crowd rushed towards the corpses and the dying, and the place <br />fresh with hot killing, and foaming streams full of blood. <br />Between them they identified the spoils, Messapus's <br />gleaming helmet, and his trappings re-won with such sweat. </p>                        </div>

You who brought peace <br />at last to my old age, how could you bring yourself <br />to leave me alone, cruel child? Why did you not give <br />your poor mother the chance for a final goodbye <br />when you were being sent into so much danger? <br />Ah, you lie here in a strange land, given as prey to the carrion <br />birds and <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=place long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latium</a>!

What earth now holds your body, <br />your torn limbs, your mangled corpse? My son, <br />is this what you bring home to me? Is this why I followed you <br />by land and sea? O <a href=/people/1141 target=_blank>Rutulians</a>, if you have feelings, pierce me: <br />hurl all your spears at me: destroy me above all with your steel: <br />or you, great father of the gods, pity me, and with <br />your lightning bolt, hurl this hated being down to <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a>, <br />since I can shatter this cruel life no other way.' <br />This wailing shook their hearts, and a groan of sorrow swept <br />them all: their strength for battle was numbed and weakened. <br />She was igniting grief and <a href=/people/5713 target=_blank>Idaeus</a> and <a href=/people/929 target=_blank>Actor</a>, <br />at Ilioneus's order, with <a href=/people/1160 target=_blank>Iulus</a> weeping bitterly, <br />caught her up, and carried her inside in their arms. <br />But the war-trumpet, with its bronze singing, rang out <br />its terrible sound, a clamour followed, that the sky re-echoed. <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416133RVol class=ethnic long=13.3 lat=41.6>Volscians</a>, raising their shields in line, ran forward, <br />ready to fill in the ditches, and tear down the ramparts: <br />Some tried for an entrance, and to scale the wall with ladders, <br />where the ranks were thin, and a less dense cordon of men <br />allowed the light through. The Trojans accustomed to defending <br />their walls by endless warfare, hurled missiles at them <br />of every sort, and fended them off with sturdy poles. <br />They rolled down stones too, deadly weights, <br />in the hope of breaking through the well-protected ranks, <br />which under their solid shields, however, rejoiced <br />in enduring every danger. But soon even they were inadequate <br />since the Trojans rolled a vast rock to where a large formation <br />threatened, and hurled it down, felling the <a href=/people/1141 target=_blank>Rutulians</a><br />far and wide, and breaking their armoured shell. <br />The brave <a href=/people/1141 target=_blank>Rutulians</a> no longer cared to fight blindly, <br />but tried to clear the ramparts with missiles. <br />Elsewhere, <a href=/people/1189 target=_blank>Mezentius</a>, deadly to behold, brandished <br /><a href=/people/2554 target=_blank>Tuscan</a> pine, and hurled smoking firebrands: <br />while Messapus, tamer of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, scion of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a>, <br />tore at the rampart, and called for scaling ladders. </p>                        </div>

Amazed, the Trojan son <br />of <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a> marvelled, yet his spirits lifted at the omen. <br />Then looking up to the arching heavens he briefly prayed: <br />'Kind <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>, <a href=/people/11088 target=_blank>Mother of the Gods</a>, to whom <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393318LDin class=place long=29.697 lat=38.94>Dindymus</a>, <br />tower-crowned cities, and harnessed <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> are dear, <br />be my leader now in battle, duly further this omen, <br />and be with your Trojans, goddess, with your favouring step.' <br />He prayed like this, and meanwhile the wheeling day <br />rushed in with a flood of light, chasing away the night: <br />first he ordered his comrades to obey his signals, <br />prepare their spirits for fighting, and ready themselves for battle. </p>                        </div>

When <a href=/people/2790 target=_blank>Tarchon</a> had finished <br />speaking so, his comrades rose to the oars and drove <br />their foam-wet ships onto the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> fields, <br />till the rams gained dry ground and all the hulls <br />came to rest unharmed.

We are mortals driven before a mortal foe: <br />we have as many lives, as many hands as they do. <br />Look, the ocean closes us in with a vast barrier of water, <br />there's no land left to flee to: shall we seek the seas or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>?' <br />He spoke, and rushed into the midst of the close-packed enemy. <br /><a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a> met him first, drawn there by a hostile fate. <br />As he tore at a huge weight of stone, <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a> pierced him <br />where the spine parts the ribs in two, with the spear he hurled, <br />and plucked out the spear again as it lodged in the bone. <br />Nor did Hisbo surprise him from above, hopeful though he was, <br />since, as he rushed in, raging recklessly at his friend's cruel death, <br /><a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a> intercepted him first, and buried his sword in his swollen chest. <br />Next <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a> attacked <a href=/people/784 target=_blank>Sthenius</a>, and Anchemolus, of Rhoetus's <br />ancient line, who had dared to violate his step-mother's bed. <br />You, twin brothers, also fell in the Rutulian fields, Laridus <br />and Thymber, the sons of Daucus, so alike you were <br />indistinguishable to kin, and a dear confusion to your parents: <br />but now <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a> has given you a cruel separateness. <br />For <a href=/people/686 target=_blank>Evander</a>'s sword swept off your head, Thymber: <br />while your right hand, Laridus, sought its owner, <br />and the dying fingers twitched and clutched again at the sword. <br />Fired by his rebuke and seeing his glorious deeds, a mixture <br />of remorse and pain roused the Arcadians against their enemy. <br />Then <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a> pierced Rhoetus as he shot past in his chariot. <br /><a href=/people/995 target=_blank>Ilus</a> gained that much time and that much respite, <br />since he had launched his solid spear at <a href=/people/995 target=_blank>Ilus</a> from far off, <br />which Rhoetus received, as he fled from you, noble <a href=/people/1433 target=_blank>Teuthras</a><br />and your brother Tyres, and rolling from the chariot <br />he struck the Rutulian fields with his heels as he died. <br />As in summer, when a hoped-for wind has risen, <br />the shepherd sets scattered fires in the woods, <br />the spaces between catch light, and <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Vulcan</a>'s bristling <br />ranks extend over the broad fields, while the shepherd sits <br />and gazes down in triumph over the joyful flames: <br />so all your comrades' courage united as one <br />to aid you <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a>. But Halaesus, fierce in war, <br />advanced against them and gathered himself behind his shield. <br />He killed <a href=/people/4342 target=_blank>Ladon</a>, <a href=/people/1414 target=_blank>Pheres</a> and <a href=/people/1474 target=_blank>Demodocus</a>, struck off <br />Strymonius's right hand, raised towards his throat, <br />with his shining sword, and smashed <a href=/people/533 target=_blank>Thoas</a> in the face <br />with a stone, scattering bone mixed with blood and brain. <br />Halaesus's father, prescient of fate, had hidden him in the woods: <br />but when, in white-haired old age, the father closed his eyes in death, <br />the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> laid their hands on Halaesus and doomed him <br />to <a href=/people/686 target=_blank>Evander</a>'s spear. <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a> attacked him first praying: <br />'Grant luck to the spear I aim to throw, father <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, <br />and a path through sturdy Halaesus's chest. Your oak <br />shall have the these weapons and the soldier's spoils.' <br />The god heard his prayer: while Halaesus covered Imaon <br />he sadly exposed his unshielded chest to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a> spear. </p>                        </div>

Here, <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a> pressed and urged, <br />there <a href=/people/2166 target=_blank>Lausus</a> opposed him, not many years between them, <br />both of outstanding presence, but <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> had denied them <br />a return to their country. Yet the king of great <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympos</a><br />did not allow them to meet face to face: their fate <br />was waiting for them soon, at the hand of a greater opponent. <br />Meanwhile <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>'s gentle sister <a href=/people/2237 target=_blank>Juturna</a> adjured him to help <br /><a href=/people/2166 target=_blank>Lausus</a>, and he parted the ranks between in his swift chariot. <br />When he saw his comrades he cried: 'It's time to hold back <br />from the fight: it's for me alone to attack <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a>, <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a><br />is mine alone: I wish his father were here to see it.' <br />And his comrades drew back from the field as ordered. <br />When the <a href=/people/1141 target=_blank>Rutulians</a> retired, then the youth, amazed at that proud <br />command, marvelled at <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>, casting his eyes over <br />the mighty body, surveying all of him from the distance <br />with a fierce look, and answered the ruler's words with these: <br />'I'll soon be praised for taking rich spoils, or for a glorious death: <br />my father is equal to either fate for me: away with your threats.' <br />So saying he marched down the centre of the field: <br />the blood gathered, chill, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a> hearts. <br /><a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> leapt from his chariot, preparing to close on foot, <br />and the sight of the advancing <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>, was no different <br />than that of a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>, seeing from a high point a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> far off <br />on the plain contemplating battle, and rushing down. <br />But <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a> came forward first, when he thought <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> might <br />be within spear-throw, so that chance might help him, in venturing <br />his unequal strength, and so he spoke to the mighty heavens: <br />'I pray you, <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, by my father's hospitality and the feast <br />to which you came as a stranger, assist my great enterprise. <br />Let me strip the blood-drenched armour from his dying limbs, <br />and let <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>'s failing sight meet its conqueror.' <br /><a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> heard the youth, and stifled a heavy sigh <br />deep in his heart, and wept tears in vain. <br />Then <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> the father spoke to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, his son, <br />with kindly words: 'Every man has his day, the course <br />of life is brief and cannot be recalled: but virtue's task <br />is this, to increase fame by deeds. So many sons of gods <br />fell beneath the high walls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, yes, and my own son <br /><a href=/people/1279 target=_blank>Sarpedon</a> among them: fate calls even for <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>, <br />and he too has reached the end of the years granted to him.' <br />So he spoke, and turned his eyes from the Rutulian fields. <br />Then <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a> threw his spear with all his might, <br />and snatched his gleaming sword from its hollow sheath. <br />The shaft flew and struck <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>, where the top of the armour <br />laps the shoulder, and forcing a way through the rim <br />of his shield at last, even grazed his mighty frame. <br />At this, <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> hurled his oak spear tipped <br />with sharp steel, long levelled at <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a>, saying: <br />'See if this weapon of mine isn't of greater sharpness.' <br />The spear-head, with a quivering blow, tore through <br />the centre of his shield, passed through all the layers <br />of iron, of bronze, all the overlapping <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>'s-hide, <br />piercing the breastplate, and the mighty chest. <br />Vainly he pulled the hot spear from the wound: <br />blood and life followed, by one and the same path. <br />He fell in his own blood (his weapons clanged over him) <br />and he struck the hostile earth in death with gory lips. <br />Then <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>, standing over him, cried out: <br />'Arcadians, take note, and carry these words of mine <br />to <a href=/people/686 target=_blank>Evander</a>: I return <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a> to him as he deserves. <br />I freely give whatever honours lie in a tomb, whatever <br />solace there is in burial. His hospitality to <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a><br />will cost him greatly.' So saying he planted his left foot on the corpse, <br />and tore away the huge weight of <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a>'s belt, engraved <br />with the <a href=/people/1622 target=_blank>Danaids</a>' crime: that band of young men foully murdered <br />on the same wedding night: the blood-drenched marriage chambers: <br />that Clonus, son of <a href=/people/1124 target=_blank>Eurytus</a> had richly chased in gold. <br />Now <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> exulted at the spoil, and gloried in winning. <br />Oh, human mind, ignorant of fate or fortune to come, <br />or of how to keep to the limits, exalted by favourable events! <br />The time will come for <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> when he'd prefer to have bought <br />an untouched <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a> at great price, and will hate those spoils <br />and the day. So his friends crowded round <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a> with many <br />groans and tears, and carried him back, lying on his shield. <br />O the great grief and glory in returning to your father: <br />that day first gave you to warfare, the same day took you from it, <br />while nevertheless you left behind vast heaps of Rutulian dead! </p>                        </div>

Seeking you, <br /><a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>, you, proud of your fresh slaughter, he mowed down <br />his nearest enemies, with the sword, and fiercely drove a wide path <br />through the ranks with its blade. <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a>, <a href=/people/686 target=_blank>Evander</a>, all was before <br />his eyes, the feast to which he had first come as a stranger, <br />the right hands pledged in friendship. Then he captured <br />four youths alive, sons of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420139USul class=place long=13.9256 lat=42.0468>Sulmo</a>, and as many reared <br />by <a href=/people/3274 target=_blank>Ufens</a>, to sacrifice to the shades of the dead, and sprinkle <br />the flames of the pyre with the prisoners' blood. <br />Next he aimed a hostile spear at <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magus</a> from a distance: <br />Magus moved in cleverly, and the spear flew over him, quivering, <br />and he clasped the hero's knees as a suppliant, and spoke as follows: <br />'I beg you, by your father's shade, by your hope in your boy <br /><a href=/people/1160 target=_blank>Iulus</a>, preserve my life, for my son and my father. <br />I have a noble house: talents of chased silver lie buried there: <br />I have masses of wrought and unwrought gold. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>'s victory <br />does not rest with me: one life will not make that much difference.' <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> replied to him in this way: 'Keep those many talents <br />of silver and gold you mention for your sons. <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>, before we spoke, <br />did away with the courtesies of war, the moment he killed <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a>. <br />So my father <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a>'s spirit thinks, so does <a href=/people/1160 target=_blank>Iulus</a>.' <br />Saying this he held the helmet with his left hand and, bending <br />the suppliant's neck backwards, drove in his sword to the hilt. <br /><a href=/people/1178 target=_blank>Haemon</a>'s son, a priest of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> and <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a>, was not far away, <br />the band with its sacred ribbons circling his temples, and all <br />his robes and emblems shining white. <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> met him and drove him <br />over the plain, then, standing over the fallen man, killed him and cloaked <br />him in mighty darkness: <a href=/people/3959 target=_blank>Serestus</a> collected and carried off <br />his weapons on his shoulders, a trophy for you, King Gradivus. <br />Caeculus, born of the race of <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Vulcan</a>, and Umbro <br />who came from the <a href=/people/1401 target=_blank>Marsian</a> hills restored order, <br />the Trojan raged against them: his sword sliced off <a href=/people/3762 target=_blank>Anxur</a>'s <br />left arm, it fell to the ground with the whole disc of his shield <br />(<a href=/people/3762 target=_blank>Anxur</a> had shouted some boast, trusting the power <br />of words, lifting his spirit high perhaps, promising <br />himself white-haired old age and long years): <br />then Tarquitus nearby, proud in his gleaming armour, <br />whom the nymph <a href=/people/2820 target=_blank>Dryope</a> had born to <a href=/people/800 target=_blank>Faunus</a> of the woods, <br />exposed himself to fiery <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>. He, drawing back his spear, <br />pinned the breastplate and the huge weight of shield together: <br />then as the youth begged in vain, and tried to utter a flow of words, <br />he struck his head to the ground and, rolling the warm trunk over, <br />spoke these words above him, from a hostile heart: <br />'Lie there now, one to be feared. No noble mother will bury you <br />in the earth, nor weight your limbs with an ancestral tomb: <br />you'll be left for the carrion birds, or, sunk in the abyss, <br />the flood will bear you, and hungry fish suck your wounds.' <br />Then he caught up with <a href=/people/931 target=_blank>Antaeus</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/471010ULuc class=place long=0.9986 lat=47.1268>Lucas</a>, in <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>'s <br />front line, brave <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> and auburn Camers, son of noble <a href=/people/4741 target=_blank>Volcens</a>, <br />the wealthiest in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410155RAus class=demonym long=15.5 lat=41>Ausonian</a> land, who ruled silent <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370224UAmy class=place long=22.4502 lat=37.0363>Amyclae</a>. <br />Once his sword was hot, victorious <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> raged <br />over the whole plain, like Aegeaon, who had a hundred <br />arms and a hundred hands they say, and breathed fire <br />from fifty chests and mouths, when he clashed <br />with as many like shields of his and drew as many swords <br />against <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>'s lightning-bolts. See now he was headed <br />towards the four <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> team of Niphaeus's chariot <br />and the opposing front. And when the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> saw him taking <br />great strides in his deadly rage, they shied and galloped in fear, <br />throwing their master, and dragging the chariot to the shore. <br />Meanwhile <a href=/people/6623 target=_blank>Lucagus</a> and his brother <a about=https://topostext.org/place/471-15WLig class=place long=-1.4731 lat=47.231>Liger</a> entered the fray <br />in their chariot with two white <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>: <a about=https://topostext.org/place/471-15WLig class=place long=-1.4731 lat=47.231>Liger</a> handling <br />the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>' reins, fierce <a href=/people/6623 target=_blank>Lucagus</a> waving his naked sword. <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> could not tolerate such furious hot-headedness: <br />he rushed at them, and loomed up gigantic with levelled spear. <br /><a about=https://topostext.org/place/471-15WLig class=place long=-1.4731 lat=47.231>Liger</a> said to him: 'These are not <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a>'s <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a><br />that you see, nor Achille's chariot, nor <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>'s plain: <br />now you'll be dealt an end to your war and life.' <br />Such were the words that flew far, from foolish <br /><a about=https://topostext.org/place/471-15WLig class=place long=-1.4731 lat=47.231>Liger</a>'s lips. But the Trojan hero did not ready <br />words in reply, he hurled his spear then against his enemies. <br />While <a href=/people/6623 target=_blank>Lucagus</a> urged on his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, leaning forward <br />towards the spear's blow, as, with left foot advanced, <br />he prepared himself for battle, the spear entered the lower <br />rim of his bright shield, then pierced the left thigh: <br />thrown from the chariot he rolled on the ground in death: <br />while noble <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> spoke bitter words to him: <br />'<a href=/people/6623 target=_blank>Lucagus</a>, it was not the flight of your <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> in fear that betrayed <br />your chariot, or the enemy's idle shadow that turned them: <br />it was you, leaping from the wheels, who relinquished the reins.' <br />So saying he grasped at the chariot: the wretched brother, <br /><a about=https://topostext.org/place/471-15WLig class=place long=-1.4731 lat=47.231>Liger</a>, who had fallen as well, held, out his helpless hands: <br />'Trojan hero, by your own life, by your parents who bore <br />such a son, take pity I beg you, without taking this life away.' <br />As he begged more urgently, Aeaneas said: 'Those were not <br />the words you spoke before. Die and don't let brother desert brother.' <br />Then he sliced open his chest where the life is hidden. <br />Such were the deaths the Trojan leader caused across <br />that plain, raging like a torrent of water or a dark <br />tempest. At last his child, <a href=/people/387 target=_blank>Ascanius</a>, and the men <br />who were besieged in vain, breaking free, left the camp. </p>                        </div>

Then from the cavernous mist <br />the goddess decked out a weak and tenuous phantom, <br />in the likeness of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, with Trojan weapons (a strange <br />marvel to behold), simulated his shield, and the plumes <br />on his godlike head, gave it insubstantial speech, <br />gave it sound without mind, and mimicked the way <br />he walked: like shapes that flit, they say, after death, <br />or dreams that in sleep deceive the senses. <br />And the phantom flaunted itself exultantly <br />in front of the leading ranks, provoking <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a><br />with spear casts, and exasperating him with words. <br /><a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> ran at it, and hurled a hissing spear <br />from the distance: it turned its heels in flight. <br />Then, as <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> thought that <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> had retreated <br />and conceded, and in his confusion clung to this idle hope <br />in his mind, he cried: 'Where are you off to, <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>? <br />Don't desert your marriage pact: this hand of mine <br />will grant you the earth you looked for over the seas.' <br />He pursued him, calling loudly, brandishing his naked sword, <br />not seeing that the wind was carrying away his glory. <br />It chanced that the ship, in which King Osinius sailed <br />from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430119UClu class=place long=11.9488 lat=43.0152>Clusium</a>'s shores, was moored to a high stone pier, <br />with ladders released and gangway ready. The swift phantom <br />of fleeing <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> sank into it to hide, and <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> followed <br />no less swiftly, conquering all obstacles and leapt <br />up the high gangway. He had barely reached the prow <br />when <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a>'s daughter snapped the cable, <br />and, snatching the ship, swept it over the waters. <br />Then the vague phantom no longer tried to hide <br />but, flying into the air, merged with a dark cloud. <br />Meanwhile <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> himself was challenging his missing enemy <br />to battle: and sending many opposing warriors to their deaths, <br />while the storm carried <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> over the wide ocean. <br />Unaware of the truth, and ungrateful for his rescue, <br />he looked back and raised clasped hands and voice to heaven: <br />'All-powerful father, did you think me so worthy of punishment, <br />did you intend me to pay such a price? Where am I being taken? <br />From whom am I escaping? Why am I fleeing: how will I return? <br />Will I see the walls and camp of Laurentium again? <br />What of that company of men that followed me, and my standard? <br />Have I left them all (the shame of it) to a cruel death, <br />seeing them scattered now, hearing the groans as they fall? <br />What shall I do? Where is the earth that could gape <br />wide enough for me? Rather have pity on me, O winds: <br />Drive the ship on the rocks, the reefs (I, <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>, beg you, freely) <br />or send it into the vicious quicksands, where no Rutulian, <br />nor any knowing rumour of my shame can follow me? <br />So saying he debated this way and that in his mind, <br />whether he should throw himself on his sword, mad <br />with such disgrace, and drive the cruel steel through his ribs, <br />or plunge into the waves, and, by swimming, gain <br />the curving bay, and hurl himself again at the Trojan weapons. <br />Three times he attempted each: three times great <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a><br />held him back, preventing him from heartfelt pity. He glided on, <br />with the help of wave and tide, cutting the depths, <br />and was carried to his father <a href=/people/1808 target=_blank>Daunus</a>'s ancient city. </p>                        </div>

Great as <a href=/people/297 target=_blank>Orion</a>, <br />when he strides through Ocean's deepest chasms, forging a way, <br />his shoulders towering above the waves, or carrying <br />an ancient manna ash down from the mountain heights, <br />walking the earth, with his head hidden in the clouds, <br />so <a href=/people/1189 target=_blank>Mezentius</a> advanced in his giant's armour. <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, opposite, catching sight of him in the far ranks <br />prepared to go and meet him. <a href=/people/1189 target=_blank>Mezentius</a> stood there unafraid, <br />waiting for his great-hearted enemy, firm in his great bulk: <br />and measuring with his eye what distance would suit his spear, <br />saying: 'Now let this right hand that is my god, and the weapon <br />I level to throw, aid me!

He spoke, and threw the hissing spear <br />from far out. But, flying on, it glanced from the shield, <br />and pierced the handsome <a href=/people/7257 target=_blank>Antores</a>, nearby, between flank <br />and thigh, <a href=/people/7257 target=_blank>Antores</a>, friend of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, sent from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a><br />who had joined <a href=/people/686 target=_blank>Evander</a>, and settled in an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> city. <br />Unhappy man, he fell to a wound meant for another, <br />and dying, gazing at the sky, remembered sweet <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>. <br />Then virtuous <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> hurled a spear: it passed through <br /><a href=/people/1189 target=_blank>Mezentius</a>'s curved shield of triple-bronze, through linen, <br />and the interwoven layers of three <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>'s hides, and lodged <br />deep in the groin, but failed to drive home with force. <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, joyful at the sight of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscan</a> blood, <br />snatched the sword from his side, and pressed <br />his shaken enemy hotly. <a href=/people/2166 target=_blank>Lausus</a>, seeing it, groaned heavily <br />for love of his father, and tears rolled down his cheeks — <br />and here I'll not be silent, for my part, about your harsh death, <br />through fate, nor, if future ages place belief in such deeds, your actions, <br />so glorious, nor you yourself, youth, worthy of remembrance — <br />his father was retreating, yielding ground, helpless, <br />hampered, dragging the enemy lance along with his shield. <br />The youth ran forward, and plunged into the fray, <br />and, just as <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>'s right hand lifted to strike a blow, <br />he snatched at the sword-point, and checked him in delay: <br />his friends followed with great clamour, and, with a shower <br />of spears, forced the enemy to keep his distance till the father <br />could withdraw, protected by his son's shield. <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> raged, but kept himself under cover. <br />As every ploughman and farmer runs from the fields <br />when storm-clouds pour down streams of hail, <br />and the passer by shelters in a safe corner, under a river <br />bank or an arch of high rock, while the rain falls to earth, <br />so as to pursue the day's work when the sun returns: <br />so, overwhelmed by missiles from every side, <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> endured the clouds of war, while they all thundered, <br />and rebuked <a href=/people/2166 target=_blank>Lausus</a>, and threatened <a href=/people/2166 target=_blank>Lausus</a>, saying: <br />'Why are you rushing to death, with courage beyond your strength? <br />Your loyalty's betraying you to foolishness.' Nevertheless <br />the youth raged madly, and now fierce anger rose higher <br />in the Trojan leader's heart, and the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> gathered together <br />the last threads of <a href=/people/2166 target=_blank>Lausus</a>'s life. For <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> drove his sword <br />firmly through the youth's body, and buried it to the hilt: <br />the point passed through his shield, too light for his threats, <br />and the tunic of soft gold thread his mother had woven, <br />blood filled its folds: then life left the body and fled, <br />sorrowing, through the air to the spirits below. <br />And when <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a>'s son saw the look on his dying face, <br />that face pale with the wonderment of its ending, <br />he groaned deeply with pity and stretched out his hand, <br />as that reflection of his own love for his father touched <br />his heart. 'Unhappy child, what can loyal <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> grant <br />to such a nature, worthy of these glorious deeds of yours? <br />Keep the weapons you delighted in: and if it is something you are <br />anxious about, I return you to the shades and ashes of your ancestors. <br />This too should solace you, unhappy one, for your sad death: <br />you died at the hands of great <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>.' Also he rebuked <br /><a href=/people/2166 target=_blank>Lausus</a>'s comrades, and lifted their leader from the earth, <br />where he was soiling his well-ordered hair with blood. </p>                        </div>

His bronze helmet hung <br />on a nearby branch, and his heavy armour lay peacefully on the grass. <br />The pick of his warriors stood around: he himself, weak and panting <br />eased his neck, his flowing beard streaming over his chest. <br />Many a time he asked for <a href=/people/2166 target=_blank>Lausus</a>, and many times sent men <br />to carry him a sorrowing father's orders and recall him. <br />But his weeping comrades were carrying the dead <a href=/people/2166 target=_blank>Lausus</a>, <br />on his armour, a great man conquered by a mighty wound. <br />The mind prescient of evil, knew their sighs from far off. <br /><a href=/people/1189 target=_blank>Mezentius</a> darkened his white hair with dust, and lifted <br />both hands to heaven, clinging to the body: <br />'My son, did such delight in living possess me, <br />that I let you face the enemy force in my place, <br />you whom I fathered? Is this father of yours alive <br />through your death, saved by your wounds? Ah, now at last <br />my exile is wretchedly driven home: and my wound, deeply! <br />My son, I have also tarnished your name by my crime, <br />driven in hatred from my fathers' throne and sceptre. <br />I have long owed reparation to my country and my people's hatred: <br />I should have yielded my guilty soul to death in any form! <br />Now I live: I do not leave humankind yet, or the light, <br />but I will leave.' So saying he raised himself weakly on his thigh, <br />and, despite all, ordered his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> to be brought, though his strength <br />ebbed from the deep wound. His mount was his pride, <br />and it was his solace, on it he had ridden victorious from every battle. <br />He spoke to the sorrowful creature, in these words: <br />'Rhaebus, we have lived a long time, if anything lasts long <br />for mortal beings. Today you will either carry the head of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, <br />and his blood-stained spoils, in victory, and avenge <a href=/people/2166 target=_blank>Lausus</a>'s pain <br />with me, or die with me, if no power opens that road to us: <br />I don't think that you, the bravest of creatures, will deign <br />to suffer a stranger's orders or a Trojan master.' <br />He spoke, then, mounting, disposed his limbs as usual, <br />and weighted each hand with a sharp javelin, <br />his head gleaming with bronze, bristling with its horsehair crest. <br />So he launched himself quickly into the fray. In that one heart <br />a vast flood of shame and madness merged with grief. <br />And now he called to <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> in a great voice. <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> knew him and offered up a joyous prayer: <br />'So let the father of the gods himself decree it, so <br />noble <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>! You then begin the conflict ... .' <br />He spoke those words and moved against him with level spear. <br />But <a href=/people/1189 target=_blank>Mezentius</a> replied: 'How can you frighten me, most savage <br />of men, me, bereft of my son? That was the only way you could <br />destroy me: I do not shrink from death, or halt for any god. <br />Cease, since I come here to die, and bring you, first, <br />these gifts.' He spoke, and hurled a spear at his enemy: <br />then landed another and yet another, wheeling <br />in a wide circle, but the gilded shield withstood them. <br />He rode three times round his careful enemy, widdershins, <br />throwing darts from his hand: three times the Trojan hero <br />dragged round the huge thicket of spears fixed in his bronze shield. <br />Then tired of all that drawn-out delay, and burdened <br />by the unequal conflict, he thought hard, and finally broke free, <br />hurling his spear straight between the war <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>'s curved temples. <br />The animal reared, and lashed the air with its hooves, <br />and throwing its rider, followed him down, from above, <br />entangling him, collapsing headlong onto him, its shoulder thrown. <br />Trojans and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> ignited the heavens with their shouts. <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> ran to him, plucking his sword from its sheath <br />and standing over him, cried: 'Where is fierce <a href=/people/1189 target=_blank>Mezentius</a>, now, <br />and the savage force of that spirit?' The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscan</a> replied, as, lifting <br />his eyes to the sky, and gulping the air, he regained his thoughts: <br />'Bitter enemy, why taunt, or threaten me in death? <br />There is no sin in killing: I did not come to fight believing so, <br />nor did my <a href=/people/2166 target=_blank>Lausus</a> agree any treaty between you and me. <br />I only ask, by whatever indulgence a fallen enemy might claim, <br />that my body be buried in the earth. I know that my people's <br />fierce hatred surrounds me: protect me, I beg you, <br />from their anger, and let me share a tomb with my son.' <br />So he spoke, and in full awareness received the sword in his throat, <br />and poured out his life, over his armour, in a wave of blood. </p>                        </div>

Alas, how great <br />was the protector, who is lost to you, Ausonia, and you, <a href=/people/1160 target=_blank>Iulus</a>.' <br />When he had ended his lament, he ordered them to lift <br />the sad corpse, and he sent a thousand men, chosen <br />from the ranks, to attend the last rites, and share the father's tears, <br />a meagre solace for so great a grief, but owed a father's sorrow. <br />Others, without delay, interwove the frame of a bier <br />with twigs of oak, and shoots of arbutus, shading <br />the bed they constructed with a covering of leaves. <br />Here they placed the youth high on his rustic couch: <br />like a flower plucked by a young girl's fingers, <br />a sweet violet or a drooping hyacinth, whose brightness <br />and beauty have not yet faded, but whose native earth <br />no longer nourishes it, or gives it strength. <br />Then <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> brought two robes of rigid gold and purple <br />that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/336354PSid class=person long=35.371 lat=33.56>Sidonian</a> <a href=/people/433 target=_blank>Dido</a> had made for him once, with her own hands, <br />delighting in the labour, interweaving the fabric with gold thread. <br />Sorrowing, he draped the youth with one of these as a last honour, <br />and veiled that hair, which would be burned, with its cloth, <br />and heaped up many gifts as well from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417123ULau class=demonym long=12.3467 lat=41.711>Laurentine</a> battle <br />and ordered the spoils to be carried in a long line: <br />he added <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and weapons stripped from the enemy. <br />He had the hands of those he sent as offerings to the shades, <br />to sprinkle the flames with blood in dying, bound behind their backs, <br />and ordered the leaders themselves to carry tree-trunks <br />draped with enemy weapons, with the names of the foe attached. <br />Unhappy <a href=/people/3748 target=_blank>Acoetes</a>, wearied with age, was led along, <br />now bruising his chest with his fists, now marring his face <br />with his nails, until he fell, full-length on the ground: <br />and they led chariots drenched with Rutulian blood. <br />Behind went the war-horse, <a href=/people/2490 target=_blank>Aethon</a>, without his trappings, <br />mourning, wetting his face with great tear drops. <br />Others carried <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a>'s spear and helmet, the rest <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a><br />held as victor. Then a grieving procession followed, <br />Trojans, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Etruscans</a>, and Arcadians with weapons reversed. <br />When all the ranks of his comrades had advanced far ahead, <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> halted, and added this, with a deep sigh: <br />'This same harsh fate of warfare calls me from here <br />to other weeping: my salute for eternity to you, noble <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a>, <br />and for eternity, farewell.' Without speaking more he turned <br />his steps toward the camp and headed for the walls. </p>                        </div>

The harsh trumpet gave the cruel call to war. <br />Then a diverse circle of mothers and sons <br />ringed the walls: this final trial summoned them all. <br />Moreover the Queen, with a great crowd of women, <br />drove to <a href=/people/429 target=_blank>Pallas</a>'s temple on the heights of the citadel <br />carrying gifts, virgin <a href=/people/1059 target=_blank>Lavinia</a> next to her as her companion, <br />a source of so much trouble, her beautiful eyes cast down. <br />The women climbed to the temple, filled it with incense <br />fumes, and poured out sad prayers from the high threshold: <br />'Tritonian Virgin, mighty in weapons, ruler of war, shatter <br />the spear of the Trojan robber, with your hand, hurl him flat <br />on the earth, stretch him prone beneath our high gates.' <br /><a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>, in a fury of zeal, armed himself for battle. <br />He was already dressed in his glowing breastplate, <br />bristling with bronze scales, his legs sheathed in gold, <br />his temples still bare, his sword buckled to his side, <br />shining, splendid, as he ran down from the citadel's heights, <br />exultant in spirit, already anticipating the enemy in hope: <br />like a stallion, breaking his tether and fleeing his stall, <br />free at last, lord of the open plain, who either heads <br />for the pastures and the herds of mares, or, used to bathing <br />in some familiar river, gallops away, and, with head held high, <br />neighs with pleasure, his mane playing over neck and shoulder. <br /><a href=/people/11004 target=_blank>Camilla</a> sped to meet him, accompanied by her <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416133RVol class=demonym long=13.3 lat=41.6>Volscian</a><br />troops, and alighted from her <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> close by the gates, <br />all her company leaving their mounts at her example, <br />and slipping to earth: then she spoke as follows: <br />'<a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>, if the brave may rightly have faith in themselves, <br />I dare to, and promise to, encounter <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>'s cavalry, <br />and ride to meet the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Etruscan</a> horsemen alone. <br />Let me attempt the first dangers of the battle with my hand <br />while you stay by the walls and protect the ramparts.' <br /><a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> replied, his gaze fixed on this amazing girl: <br />'O virgin glory of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, how should I attempt <br />to thank you or repay you? But as your spirit <br />soars beyond us all, share the task with me. <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, so rumour says, and scouts sent out confirm, <br />has deployed his light cavalry to search the plains <br />thoroughly: he himself climbing the ridge, marches <br />through the desolate heights towards the town. <br />I am preparing an ambush on a deep track in the woods, <br />so as to block both entrances to the gorge with armed men: <br />you must wait for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Etruscan</a> cavalry charge: <br />brave Messapus will be with you, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> troops, <br />and Tiburtus's band, and you must take command as leader.' <br />So he spoke, and exhorted Messapus and all the allied generals <br />to battle, with similar words, then moved against the enemy. <br />There's a valley with a winding bend, suitable for the tricks <br />and stratagems of warfare, crowded on both sides <br />by a dark wall of dense leaves, to which a narrow track <br />leads: it has a confined floor, and a difficult entrance. <br />Above it, among the look-outs of the high mountain tops, <br />lies a hidden level and a secure shelter, <br />whether one wishes to attack to right or left, <br />or make a stand on the ridge and roll huge boulders down. <br />Here the warrior hurried by a well known network of paths <br />and taking position he occupied the treacherous woods. </p>                        </div>

She's dearer to me than all others, <br />and this is no new love that comes to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a>, <br />or moves my spirit with sudden sweetness. <br />When Metabus was driven from his throne by hatred <br />of his tyrannical power, and was leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415132UPri class=place long=13.1849 lat=41.4905>Privernum</a>, <br />his ancient city, fleeing amidst the conflict of war, <br />he took his child to share his exile, and, slightly altering <br />her mother's name Casmilla, called her <a href=/people/11004 target=_blank>Camilla</a>. <br />Carrying her in front of him at his breast he sought a long ridge <br />of lonely forests: fierce weapons threatened him on every side, <br />and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416133RVol class=ethnic long=13.3 lat=41.6>Volscians</a> hovered round him with their troops. <br />While they were still in mid-flight, see, the Ausenus overflowed, <br />foaming to the top of its banks, so great a downpour burst <br />from the clouds. He, preparing to swim across, was held back <br />by love of his child, and fear for his dear burden. Quickly, <br />debating all options with himself, he settled reluctantly <br />on this idea: the warrior fastened his daughter to the giant spear, <br />solid with knots and of seasoned oak, he chanced to be carrying <br />in his strong hand, wrapping her in the bark of a cork-tree <br />from the woods, and tying her wisely to the middle of the shaft: <br />then balancing it in his mighty hand he cried out to the heavens: <br />'Kind virgin daughter of <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Latona</a>, dweller in the woods, I her father <br />dedicate this child to your service: fleeing the enemy through the air, <br />yours is the first weapon she clasps as a suppliant. Goddess I beg you <br />to accept as your own this that I now commit to the uncertain breeze.' <br />He spoke, and drawing back his arm hurled the spinning shaft: <br />the waters roared, and the wretched <a href=/people/11004 target=_blank>Camilla</a> flew <br />over the rushing river on the hissing steel. And Metabus, <br />with a great crowd of his enemies pressing him closely, <br />gave himself to the flood, and victoriously snatched his gift <br />to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a> from the grassy turf, the spear and the little maid. <br />No city would accept him within their houses or their walls, <br />(nor would he in his savagery have given himself up to them) <br />he passed his life among shepherds on the lonely mountains. <br />Here, among the thickets of savage lairs, he nourished <br />his child at the udders of a mare from the herd, and milk <br />from wild creatures, squeezing the teats into her delicate mouth. <br />As soon as the infant had taken her first steps, <br />he placed a sharp lance in her hands, and hung <br />bow and quiver from the little one's shoulder. <br />A tiger's pelt hung over head and down her back <br />instead of a gold clasp for her hair, and a long trailing robe. <br />Even then she was hurling childish spears with tender hand, <br />whirling a smooth-thonged sling round her head, <br />bringing down <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409253PStr class=demonym long=25.2823 lat=40.9366>Strymonian</a> cranes and snowy swans. <br />Many a mother in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Etruscan</a> fortresses wished for her <br />as a daughter-in-law in vain: she, pure, content with <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a><br />alone, cherished her love of her weapons and maidenhood. <br />I wish she had not been swept up into such warfare, <br />trying to challenge the Trojans: she would be <br />my darling, and one of my company still. <br />Come now, nymph, since bitter fate drives her on, <br />slip from the sky and seek out the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> borders, <br />where with evil omen they join in sad battle. <br />Take these weapons and draw an avenging arrow from the quiver, <br />and if anyone violates her sacred flesh by wounding her, <br />Trojan or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a>, pay me with their equal punishment in blood. <br />Then I'll carry the body and untouched weapons of the poor girl <br />in a cavernous cloud to a sepulchre, and bury her in her own land.' <br />She spoke, and <a href=/people/1652 target=_blank>Opis</a> slid down with a sound through <br />heaven's light air, her body veiled in a dark whirlwind. </p>                        </div>

May even you not die by <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a>'s weapons?' <br />She spoke: then the Thracian goddess took a winged arrow <br />from her golden quiver, and stretched the bow in anger, <br />drawing it far back, until the curving horns met, <br />and now with levelled arms she touched the steel tip <br />with her left hand, and her breast and the bow-string with her right. <br />At the same moment as <a href=/people/2720 target=_blank>Arruns</a> heard the hissing dart, <br />and the rushing air, both one, the steel was fixed in his body. <br />His allies, oblivious, left him on the unmemorable dust <br />of the plain, gasping and groaning in extremity: <br />while <a href=/people/1652 target=_blank>Opis</a> winged her way to heavenly <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a>. <br /><a href=/people/11004 target=_blank>Camilla</a>'s light cavalry were first to flee, their mistress lost, <br />the <a href=/people/1141 target=_blank>Rutulians</a> fled in turmoil, brave Atinas fled, <br />scattered leaders and abandoned troops sought safety, <br />and, wheeling their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> about, headed for the walls. <br />No one could check the pursuing, death-dealing <br />Trojans with weapons, or stand against them <br />but slung their unstrung bows on bowed shoulders, <br />and their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>' hooves shook the crumbling earth in flight. <br />A cloud of dark murky dust rolled towards the walls, <br />and mothers, from the watchtowers, raised the womens' <br />cry to the stars in heaven, as they beat their breasts. <br />The enemy host pressed hard on those who first broke at speed <br />through the open gates, mixing with their lines, so they did not <br />escape a pitiful death, but, pierced through, gasped away their lives <br />on the very threshold, their country's walls around them, within <br />the shelter of their houses. Some closed the gates, and dared not <br />open a path for their friends or let them inside the walls, <br />though they begged, and the most pitiful death followed, of those <br />defending the entrance in arms, and those rushing onto the swords. <br />Some driven by the rout, shut out, in front of the gaze <br />and the weeping faces of their parents, rolled headlong <br />into the ditches, others charging blindly with loose reins <br />battered at the gates and the tough gate-posts barring their way. <br />The women themselves when they saw <a href=/people/11004 target=_blank>Camilla</a> from the walls <br />in fierce emulation (true love of country guided them) <br />threw weapons with their weak hands, and in their haste <br />used poles of tough oak and fire-hardened stakes instead of steel, <br />and were ablaze to die in the forefront defending the walls. <br />Meanwhile in the forest, the bitterest of messages filled <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>'s <br />thoughts: <a href=/people/2488 target=_blank>Acca</a> had brought the warrior her news of the mighty rout: <br />the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416133RVol class=demonym long=13.3 lat=41.6>Volscian</a> ranks annihilated, <a href=/people/11004 target=_blank>Camilla</a> killed, the enemy <br />advancing fiercely, sweeping all before them <br />in the fortune of war, panic now reaching the city. <br />Maddened he abandoned the ambush among the hills <br />(so <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>'s cruel will demanded) and left the wild forest. <br />He had scarcely passed from view, in reaching the plain, <br />when <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, the leader, mounted the ridge, after entering <br />the unguarded gorge, and emerging from the dense woods. <br />So they both marched quickly towards the walls, <br />in full force, and with no great distance between them: <br />and at that moment <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> saw the plain, far off, <br />smoking with dust, and caught sight of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417123ULau class=demonym long=12.3467 lat=41.711>Laurentine</a> army, <br />and <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> realised that fatal <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> was in arms, <br />and heard the march of feet, and the sound of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. <br />They would have joined battle at once and attempted combat, <br />but rosy <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a> was already bathing his weary team <br />in the Spanish deeps, and, day waning, brought back the night. <br />They camped before the city, and strengthened their defences. </p>                        </div>

/>winged its way towards him, launched by what hand, <br />sent whirling by whom, was unknown, as was the chance <br />or god that brought the <a href=/people/1141 target=_blank>Rutulians</a> such honour: <br />the glorious pride in it was kept concealed, <br />and no one boasted of wounding <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>. <br />As soon as <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> saw <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> leave the ranks, his captains <br />in confusion, he blazed with the fervour of sudden hope: <br />he called for weapons and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> as one, leapt proudly <br />into his chariot, and gripped the reins in his hands. <br />He gave many a brave man death in his swift passage. <br />Many he overturned half-alive, crushed the ranks under his chariot, <br />or seizing his spears showered them on those fleeing. <br />Just as when blood-drenched <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> is roused, and clashes <br />his shield, by the icy streams of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407260WHeb class=place long=26.1825 lat=40.78557>Hebrus</a> and, inciting war, <br />gives rein to his frenzied <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, so that they fly over the open plain <br />outrunning the south and west winds, and farthest <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> groans <br />to the beat of their hooves, while around him the forms of black <br /><a href=/people/1731 target=_blank>Terror</a>, Anger and Treachery, speed, the companions of the god: <br />with the same swiftness <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> lashed his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, <br />smoking with sweat, through the midst of the conflict, <br />trampling on enemies piteously slain, while the galloping hooves <br />splashed bloody dew, and trampled the gore mixed with sand. <br />Next he gave <a href=/people/844 target=_blank>Sthenelus</a> to death, Thamyrus, and Pholus, the latter <br />close to, the former at a distance, from a distance too <br />both sons of Imbrasus, <a href=/people/1197 target=_blank>Glaucus</a> and Laudes, whom Imbrasus <br />himself had raised in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=place long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycia</a>, and equipped with matching armour, <br />to fight hand to hand, or outstrip the wind on horseback. <br />Elsewhere <a href=/people/2878 target=_blank>Eumedes</a> rode through the midst of the battle, <br />famous in warfare, the son of aged <a href=/people/10979 target=_blank>Dolon</a>, <br />recalling the grandfather in name, his father in courage <br />and skill, he who, in going as a spy that time to the Greek camp, <br />dared to ask for <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>'s chariot as his reward: <br />but <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> paid him a different reward for his daring <br />and he no longer aspired to <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>'s team. <br />When <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> saw <a href=/people/2878 target=_blank>Eumedes</a>, far over the open plain, he first <br />sent a light javelin after him across the long space between, <br />then halted his paired <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, leapt from his chariot, <br />onto the half-dead, fallen man, and, planting his foot on his neck, <br />tore the sword from his hand, and bloodied the bright blade <br />deep in his throat, adding these words as well: <br />'See the fields, that Western Land, you sought in war: <br />lie there and measure it: this is the prize for those <br />who dare to cross swords with me, thus they build their walls.' <br />Then with a cast of his spear he sent Asbytes to keep him company, <br />Chloreus and Sybaris, <a href=/people/12136 target=_blank>Dares</a> and <a href=/people/4801 target=_blank>Thersilochus</a>, and <a href=/people/2577 target=_blank>Thymoetes</a><br />who was flung from the neck of his rearing <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. <br />As when the blast of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408238UEdo class=demonym long=23.9 lat=40.9>Edonian</a> northerly sounds <br />over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381253WAeg class=place long=25.3 lat=38.1>Aegean</a> deep, and drives the breakers to shore, <br />while brooding gusts in the sky put the clouds to flight, <br />so, wherever <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> cut a path, the lines gave way, <br />and the ranks turned and ran: his own speed carried him on, <br />and, as the chariot met it, the wind tossed his flowing plume. <br /><a href=/people/1542 target=_blank>Phegeus</a> could not endure his attack or his spirited war-cry: <br />he threw himself at the chariot and with his right hand wrenched <br />the heads of the swift <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> aside, as they foamed at the bit. <br />While he was dragged along, hanging from the yoke, <br /><a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>'s broad-headed lance reached for his exposed flank, <br />tore open the double-stranded mail where it entered, <br />and grazed the surface of the flesh in a wound. <br /><a href=/people/1542 target=_blank>Phegeus</a> still turned towards his enemy, his shield raised, <br />and was trying to protect himself with his drawn sword, <br />when the wheel and the onrush of the spinning axle <br />sent him headlong, throwing him to the ground, and <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>, <br />following through, struck off his head with a sweep of his blade <br />between the rim of the helmet and the chain-mail's <br />upper edge, and left the body lying on the sand. </p>                        </div>

The aged <a href=/people/2318 target=_blank>Iapyx</a>, his robe rolled back <br />in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415220RPai class=demonym long=22.01 lat=41.5>Paeonian</a> fashion, tried hard in vain with healing fingers <br />and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>'s powerful herbs: he worked at the arrow uselessly <br />with his hand, and tugged at the metal with tightened pincers. <br />No luck guided his course, nor did <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> his patron help, <br />while cruel terror grew greater and greater over the plain, <br />and evil drew near. Now they saw the sky standing on <br />columns of dust: the horsemen neared and arrows fell <br />thickly in the midst of the camp. A dismal cry rose to heaven <br />of men fighting and falling under <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>'s harsh hand. <br />At this <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>'s mother, <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>, shaken by her son's <br />cruel pain, culled a dittany plant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352248LIda class=place long=24.7708 lat=35.2263>Ida</a>, <br />with downy leaves and purple flowers: a herb <br />not unknown to the wild <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> when winged <br />arrows have fixed themselves in their sides. <br />This <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> brought, her face veiled in dark mist, <br />this, with its hidden curative powers, she steeped <br />in river water, poured into a glittering basin, and sprinkled <br />there healing ambrosial juice and fragrant panacea. <br />Aged <a href=/people/2318 target=_blank>Iapyx</a> bathed the wound with this liquid, <br />not knowing its effect, and indeed all pain fled <br />from <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>'s body, all the flow of blood ceased deep <br />in the wound. Now, without force, the arrowhead <br />slipped from the wound, following the motion of his hand, <br />and fresh strength returned to <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, such as before. <br /><a href=/people/2318 target=_blank>Iapyx</a> cried: 'Quickly, bring our hero weapons. Why are you <br />standing there?' and was first to excite their courage against <br />the enemy. '<a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, this cure does not come by human aid, <br />nor guiding art, it is not my hand that saved you: a god, <br />a greater one, worked this, and sends you out again to glorious deeds.' <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, eager for battle, had sheathed his legs in gold, <br />left and right, and scornful of delay, brandished his spear. <br />As soon as his shield was fixed at his side, the chain mail <br />to his back, he clasped <a href=/people/387 target=_blank>Ascanius</a> in his armed embrace, <br />and, kissing his lips lightly through the helmet, said: <br />'My son, learn courage from me and true labour: <br />good fortune from others. Now my hand will protect you <br />in war, and lead you to great rewards. Make sure later, <br />when your years have reached maturity, that you remember: <br />let your father <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, and your uncle <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a><br />inspire your soul, by recalling their example.' <br />When he spoken these words, he rushed out through the gate, <br />in all his strength, brandishing a great spear in his hand: <br /><a href=/people/2566 target=_blank>Antheus</a> and <a href=/people/12120 target=_blank>Mnestheus</a> with him, and their massed ranks, and all <br />the army streamed from the camp. Then the plain was a chaos <br />of blinding dust, and the quaking earth shook under the tramp of feet. <br /><a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> saw them advance, from the rampart opposite: <br />the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410155RAus class=ethnic long=15.5 lat=41>Ausonians</a> saw, and a cold tremor ran to the marrow <br />of their bones: <a href=/people/2237 target=_blank>Juturna</a> was the first of all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a><br />to hear and recognise the sound, and she fled in fear. <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> flew ahead, racing his dark ranks over the open plain, <br />As when the weather breaks and a storm cloud moves towards <br />land, over the deep ocean (ah, the hearts of wretched farmers <br />know if from far off, and shudder: it brings ruin to trees, <br />and havoc to harvests, everything far and wide is destroyed), <br />the gales run before it and carry their roar to the shore: <br />so the Trojan leader drove his ranks against the foe, <br />thickly they all gathered to him in dense columns. <br />Thymbreus struck mighty <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> with his sword, <br /><a href=/people/12120 target=_blank>Mnestheus</a> killed Arcetius: Achates killed Epulo, <br /><a href=/people/2623 target=_blank>Gyas</a> killed <a href=/people/3274 target=_blank>Ufens</a>: even <a href=/people/5290 target=_blank>Tolumnius</a> the augur fell, <br />first to hurl his spear straight at the enemy. <br />A shout rose to heaven, and in turn the routed <a href=/people/1141 target=_blank>Rutulians</a><br />turned their backs in a cloud of dust, fleeing over the field. <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> himself did not deign to send the fugitives to their death, <br />nor did he attack the foot-soldiers, cavalry or those hurling <br />missiles: he tracked only <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>, searching through <br />the dense gloom, <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> alone he summoned to combat. </p>                        </div>

So <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> spoke: <br />so, with humble look, the Saturnian goddess replied: <br />'Great <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, truly, it was because I knew it was your wish <br />that I parted reluctantly from <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> and the <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>: <br />or you would not see me alone now, on my celestial perch, <br />enduring the just and the unjust, but I'd be standing, wreathed in flame, <br />in the battle line itself, and drawing the Trojans into deadly combat. <br />I counselled <a href=/people/2237 target=_blank>Juturna</a> (I confess) to help her unfortunate brother <br />and approved greater acts of daring for the sake of his life, <br />yet not for her to contend with the arrow or the bow: <br />I swear it by the implacable fountainhead of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380222WSty class=place long=22.2039 lat=37.9836>Styx</a>, <br />that alone is held in awe by the gods above. <br />And now I yield, yes, and leave the fighting I loathe. <br />Yet I beg this of you, for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=place long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latium</a>'s sake, for the majesty <br />of your own kin: since it is not prohibited by any law of fate: <br />when they soon make peace with happy nuptials (so be it) <br />when they join together soon in laws and treaties, <br />don't order the native <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> to change their ancient name, <br />to become Trojans or be called Teucrians, <br />or change their language, or alter their clothing. <br />Let <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=place long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latium</a> still exist, let there be <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=demonym long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alban</a> kings through the ages, <br />let there be Roman offspring strong in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> virtue: <br /><a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> has fallen, let her stay fallen, along with her name.' <br />Smiling at her, the creator of men and things replied: <br />'You are a true sister of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>, another child of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a>, <br />such waves of anger surge within your heart. <br />Come, truly, calm this passion that was needlessly roused: <br />I grant what you wish, and I relent, willingly defeated. <br />Ausonia's sons will keep their father's speech and manners, <br />as their name is, so it will be: the Trojans shall sink, merged <br />into the mass, only. I will add sacred laws and rites, <br />and make them all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> of one tongue. <br />From them a race will rise, merged with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410155RAus class=demonym long=15.5 lat=41>Ausonian</a> blood, <br />that you will see surpass men and gods in virtue, <br />no nation will celebrate your rites with as much devotion.' <br /><a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a> agreed it, and joyfully altered her purpose: <br />then left her cloud, and departed from the sky. </p>                        </div>

They wait by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>'s throne on the fierce king's <br />threshold, and sharpen the fears of weak mortals <br />whenever the king of the gods sends plagues <br />and death's horrors, or terrifies guilty cities with war. <br /><a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> sent one of them quickly down from heaven's heights <br />and ordered her to meet with <a href=/people/2237 target=_blank>Juturna</a> as a sign: <br />she flew, and darted to earth in a swift whirlwind. <br />Like an arrow loosed from the string, through the clouds, <br />that a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a>, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> or a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355240PKyd class=demonym long=24.0187 lat=35.5158>Cydonian</a>, fired, <br />hissing, and leaping unseen through the swift shadows, <br />a shaft beyond all cure, armed with cruel poison's venom: <br />so sped the daughter of <a href=/people/12253 target=_blank>Night</a>, seeking the earth. <br />As soon as she saw the Trojan ranks and <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>'s troops, <br />she changed her shape, suddenly shrinking to the form of that <br />small bird that perching at night on tombs or deserted rooftops, <br />often sings her troubling song so late among the shadows — <br />and the fiend flew screeching to and fro in front <br />of <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>'s face, and beat at his shield with her wings. <br />A strange numbness loosed his limbs in dread, <br />his hair stood up in terror, and his voice clung to his throat. <br />But when his wretched sister <a href=/people/2237 target=_blank>Juturna</a> recognised the Dread One's <br />whirring wings in the distance, she tore at her loosened hair, marring <br />her face with her nails, and her breasts with her clenched hands: <br />'What help can your sister give you now, <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>? <br />What is left for me who have suffered so? With what art <br />can I prolong your life? Can I stand against such a portent? <br />Now at last I leave the ranks. Bird of ill-omen, do not you <br />terrify me who already am afraid: I know your wing-beats <br />and their fatal sound, and I do not mistake the proud command <br />of great-hearted <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>. Is this his reward for my virginity? <br />Why did he grant me eternal life? Why is the mortal condition <br />taken from me? Then, at least, I could end such pain <br />and go through the shadows at my poor brother's side! <br />An immortal, I? Can anything be sweet to me without you <br />my brother? Oh what earth can gape deep enough for me, <br />to send a goddess down to the deepest Shades?' <br />So saying she veiled her head in a grey mantle, and the goddess, <br />with many a cry of grief, plunged into the river's depths. </p>                        </div>

Why do you still retreat, <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>? <br />We must compete hand to hand with fierce weapons, not by running. <br />Change into every form: summon up all your powers <br />of mind and art, wing your way if you wish <br />to the high stars, or hide in earth's hollow prison.' <br /><a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> shook his head: 'Fierce man, your fiery words <br />don't frighten me: the gods terrify me and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>'s enmity.' <br />Saying no more he looked round seeing a great rock, <br />a vast ancient stone, that happened to lie there in the plain, <br />set up as a boundary marker, to distinguish fields in dispute. <br />Twelve picked men, men of such form as <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a><br />now produces, could scarcely have lifted it on their shoulders, <br />but the hero, grasping it quickly, rising to his full height <br />and as swiftly as he could, hurled it at his enemy. <br />But he did not know himself, running or moving <br />raising the great rock in his hands, or throwing: <br />his knees gave way, his blood was frozen cold. <br />The stone itself, whirled by the warrior through the empty air, <br />failed to travel the whole distance, or drive home with force. <br />As in dreams when languid sleep weighs down our eyes at night, <br />we seem to try in vain to follow our eager path, <br />and collapse helpless in the midst of our efforts, <br />the tongue won't work, the usual strength is lacking <br />from our limbs, and neither word nor voice will come: <br />so the dread goddess denied <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> success, <br />however courageously he sought to find a way. <br />Then shifting visions whirled through his brain: <br />he gazed at the <a href=/people/1141 target=_blank>Rutulians</a>, and at the city, faltered <br />in fear, and shuddered at the death that neared, <br />he saw no way to escape, no power to attack his enemy, <br />nor sign of his chariot, nor his sister, his charioteer. <br />As he wavered, <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> shook his fateful spear, <br />seeing a favourable chance, and hurled it from the distance <br />with all his might. Stone shot from a siege engine <br />never roared so loud, such mighty thunder never burst <br />from a lightning bolt. Like a black hurricane the spear flew on <br />bearing dire destruction, and pierced the outer circle <br />of the seven-fold shield, the breastplate's lower rim, <br />and, hissing, passed through the centre of the thigh. <br />Great <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> sank, his knee bent beneath him, under the blow. <br />The <a href=/people/1141 target=_blank>Rutulians</a> rose up, and groaned, and all the hills around <br />re-echoed, and, far and wide, the woods returned the sound. <br />He lowered his eyes in submission and stretched out his right hand: <br />'I have earned this, I ask no mercy' he said, <br />'seize your chance. If any concern for a parent's grief <br />can touch you (you too had such a father, in <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a>) <br />I beg you to pity <a href=/people/1808 target=_blank>Daunus</a>'s old age and return me, <br />or if you prefer it my body robbed of life, to my people. <br />You are the victor, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410155RAus class=ethnic long=15.5 lat=41>Ausonians</a> have seen me <br />stretch out my hands in defeat: <a href=/people/1059 target=_blank>Lavinia</a> is your wife, <br />don't extend your hatred further.' <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> stood, fierce <br />in his armour, his eyes flickered, and he held back his hand: <br />and even now, as he paused, the words began to move him <br />more deeply, when high on <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>'s shoulder young <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a>'s <br />luckless sword-belt met his gaze, the strap glinting with its familiar <br />decorations, he whom <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>, now wearing his enemy's emblems <br />on his shoulder, had wounded and thrown, defeated, to the earth. <br />As soon as his eyes took in the trophy, a memory of cruel grief, <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, blazing with fury, and terrible in his anger, cried: <br />'Shall you be snatched from my grasp, wearing the spoils <br />of one who was my own? <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a> it is, <a href=/people/1006 target=_blank>Pallas</a>, who sacrifices you <br />with this stroke, and exacts retribution from your guilty blood.' <br />So saying, burning with rage, he buried his sword deep <br />in <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>'s breast: and then <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>'s limbs grew slack <br />with death, and his life fled, with a moan, angrily, to the Shades. </p>                        </div>
