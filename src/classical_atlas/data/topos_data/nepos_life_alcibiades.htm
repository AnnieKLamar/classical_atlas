In him nature seems to have tried what she could do; for it is agreed among all who have written concerning him, that no one was ever more remarkable than he, either for vices or virtues. Born in a most distinguished city, of a very high family, and by far the most handsome of all the men. of his age, he was qualified for any occupation, and abounded in practical intelligence. He was eminent as a commander by sea and land; he was eloquent, so as to produce the greatest effect by his speeches; for such indeed was the persuasiveness of his looks and language, that in oratory no one was a match for him. He was rich, and, when occasion required, laborious, patient, liberal, and splendid, no less in his public than in his private life; he was also affable and courteous, conforming dexterously to circumstances; but, when he had unbent himself, and no reason offered why he should endure the labour of thought, was seen to be luxurious, dissolute, voluptuous, and self-indulgent, so that all wondered there should be such dissimilitude, and so contradictory a nature, in the same man. </p>                        </div>

For his father-in-law he had <a href=/people/919 target=_blank>Hipponicus</a>, the richest man of all that spoke the Greek language; so that, even if he had contrived for himself, he could neither have thought of more advantages, nor have secured greater, than those which fortune or nature had bestowed upon him. At his entrance on manhood he was beloved by many, after the manner of the Greeks, and among them by <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, whom <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> mentions in his Symposium; for he introduces <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a>, saying that he had passed the night with <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, and had not risen up from him otherwise than a son should rise from a father. When he was of maturer age, he had himself no fewer objects of affection, his intercourse with whom, as far as was possible, he did many acts of an objectionable character, in a delicate and agreeable manner; which acts we would relate, had we not other things to tell of a higher and better nature. </p>                        </div>

Two colleagues were besides assigned him, <a href=/people/115 target=_blank>Nicias</a> and <a href=/people/712 target=_blank>Lamachus</a>. While the expedition was in preparation, and before the fleet sailed, it happened one night that all the statues of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a> that were in the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> were thrown down, except one, which was before the gate of <a href=/people/998 target=_blank>Andocides</a>, and which, in consequence, was afterwards generally called the <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a> of <a href=/people/998 target=_blank>Andocides</a>. As it appeared that this could not have been done without a strong confederacy of many persons, since it had respect not to a private but to a public matter, great dread was excited among the multitude, lest some sudden tumult should arise in the city to destroy the people's liberty. The suspicion of this seemed chiefly to attach to <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a>, because he was considered both more influential, and of higher standing, than any private person; for he had secured many adherents by his generosity, and had made still more his friends by assisting them in legal proceedings. Hence it happened, that as often as he appeared in public, he drew the eyes of all people upon him; nor was any man in the whole city thought equal to him. They accordingly had not only the greatest hope of him, but also the greatest fear, because he was able to do much harm as well as much good. He was sullied also by ill report, for it was said that he celebrated the mysteries in his own house, a practice which, according to public opinion among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, was regarded as impious; and this matter was thought to have reference, not to religion, but to a conspiracy.67 </p>                        </div>

But the time for him to set out to the war was drawing near; and he considering this, and being aware of the habit of his countrymen, requested that, if they wished anything to be done concerning him, an examination should rather be held upon him while he was pre sent, than that he should be accused in his absence of a crime against which there was a strong public feeling. But his enemies resolved to continue quiet for the present, because they were aware that no hurt could then be done him, and to wait for the time when he should have gone abroad, that they might thus attack him while he was absent. They accordingly did so; for after they supposed that he had reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, they impeached him, during his absence, of having profaned the sacred rites. In consequence of this affair, a messenger, to desire him to return home to plead his cause, being despatched into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> to him by the government, at a time when he had great hopes of managing his province successfully, he yet did not refuse to obey, but went on board a trireme which had been sent to convey him. Arriving in this vessel at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397164PTho class=place long=16.49 lat=39.716>Thurii</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and reflecting much with himself on the ungovernable license of his countrymen, and their violent feelings towards the aristocracy, and deeming it most advantageous to avoid the impending storm, he secretly withdrew from his guards, and went from thence first to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=place long=21.374 lat=37.89>Elis</a>, and afterwards to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>. But when he heard that he was condemned to death, his property having been confiscated, and as had been usual, that the priests called <a href=/people/1941 target=_blank>Eumolpidae</a> had been obliged by the people to curse him, and that a copy of the curse, engraven on a stone pillar, had been set up in a public place, in order that the memory of it might be better attested, he removed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemon</a>. There, as he was accustomed to declare, he carried on a war, not against his country, but against his enemies, because the same persons were enemies to their own city; for though they knew that he could be of the greatest service to the republic, they had expelled him from it, and consulted their own animosity more than the common advantage. By his advice, in consequence, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> made an alliance with the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, and afterwards fortified <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382238DDek class=place long=23.794 lat=38.151>Deceleia</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, and having placed a constant garrison there, kept <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> in a state of blockade. By his means, also, they detached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a> from its alliance with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, and after this was done, they began to have greatly the advantage in the contest. </p>                        </div>

They therefore determined to seek an opportunity for killing him. But this determination could not long be concealed from <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a>; for he was a man of such sagacity that he could not be deceived, especially when he turned his attention to putting himself on his guard.
