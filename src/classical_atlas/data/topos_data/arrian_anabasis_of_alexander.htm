There he assembled all the Greeks who were within the limits of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a>, and asked from them the supreme command of the expedition against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, an office which they had already conferred upon <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a>. He received the honour which he asked from all except the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>, who replied that it was an hereditary custom of theirs, not to follow others but to lead them. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> also attempted to bring about some political change; but they were so alarmed at the very approach of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, that they conceded to him even more ample public honours than those which had been bestowed upon <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a>. He then returned into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> and busied himself in preparing for the expedition into Asia. However, at the approach of spring he marched towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, into the lands of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425220RTri class=ethnic long=22 lat=42.5>Triballians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a>, because he ascertained that these nations were meditating a change of policy; and at the same time, as they were lying on his frontier, he thought it inexpedient, when he was about to start on a campaign so far away from his own land, to leave them behind him without having been entirely subjugated. Setting out then from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408238PAmp class=place long=23.847 lat=40.822>Amphipolis</a>, he invaded the land of the people who were called independent <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a>, keeping the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410243PPhi class=place long=24.285 lat=41.012>Philippi</a> and Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410245LOrb class=place long=23.595 lat=41.377>Orbelus</a> on the left. Crossing the river <a href=/people/1052 target=_blank>Nessus</a>, they say he arrived at mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/428247LHae class=place long=24.659 lat=42.773>Haemus</a> on the tenth day. Here, along the defiles up the ascent to the mountain, he was met by many of the traders equipped with arms, as well as by the independent <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a>, who had made preparations to check the further advance of his expedition by seizing the summit of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/428247LHae class=place long=24.659 lat=42.773>Haemus</a>, along which was the route for the passage of his army. They had collected their waggons, and placed them in front of them, not only using them as a rampart from which they might defend themselves, in case they should be forced back, but also intending to let them loose upon the phalanx of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, where the mountain was most precipitous, if they tried to ascend. They had come to the conclusion that the denser the phalanx was with which the waggons rushing down came into collision, the more easily would they scatter it by the violence of their fall upon it. </p>                        </div>

And it turned out just as <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had conjectured and exhorted. For some of the men made gaps in the phalanx (and others locked their shields together). The waggons rolled over the shields without doing much injury, not a single man being killed under them. Then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> regained their courage, inasmuch as the waggons, which they had excessively dreaded, had inflicted no damage upon them. With a loud cry they assaulted the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a>. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ordered his archers to march from the right wing in front of the rest of the phalanx, because there the passage was easier, and to shoot at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> wherever they advanced. He himself took his own guard, the shield-bearing infantry and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>, and led them to the left. Then the archers shot at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> who sallied forward, and repulsed them; and the phalanx, coming to close fighting, easily drove away from their position men who were light-armed and badly-equipped barbarians. The consequence was, they no longer waited to receive <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> marching against them from the left, but casting away their arms they fled down the mountain as each man best could. About 1,500 of them were killed; but only a few were taken prisoners on account of their swiftness of foot and acquaintance with the country. However, all the women who were accompanying them were captured, as were also their children and all their booty. </p>                        </div>

And those who were surprised drew themselves up in battle array in a woody glen along the bank of the river. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> drew out his phalanx into a deep column, and led it on in person. He also ordered the archers and slingers to run forward and discharge arrows and stones at the barbarians, hoping to provoke them by this to come out of the woody glen into the ground unencumbered with trees. When they were within reach of the missiles, and were struck by them, they rushed out against the archers, who were undefended by shields, with the purpose of fighting them hand-to-hand. But when <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had drawn them thus out of the woody glen, he ordered <a href=/people/591 target=_blank>Philotas</a> to take the cavalry which came from upper <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, and to charge their right wing, where they had advanced furthest in their sally.

Accordingly he gave the signal to the heavy-armed infantry in the first place to hold their spears erect, and then to couch them at the concerted sign; at one time to incline their spears to the right, closely locked together, and at another time towards the left. He then set the phalanx itself into quick motion forward, and marched it towards the wings, now to the right, and then to the left. After thus arranging and re-arranging his lines many times very rapidly, he at last formed his phalanx into a sort of wedge, and led it towards the left against the enemy, who had long been in a state of amazement at seeing both the order and the rapidity of his evolutions. Consequently they did not sustain <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s attack, but quitted the first ridges of the mountain. Upon this, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ordered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> to raise the battle-cry and make a clatter with their spears upon their shields; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415195RTau class=ethnic long=19.5 lat=41.5>Taulantians</a>, being still more alarmed at the noise, led their army back to the city with all speed. </p>                        </div>

Thence he proceeded through Paetica to the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406269WMel class=place long=26.8628 lat=40.6028>Melas</a>, having crossed which he arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264USes class=place long=26.4172 lat=40.2284>Sestus</a>, in twenty days altogether from the time of his starting from home. When he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401262UEla class=place long=26.2233 lat=40.0545>Elaeus</a> he offered sacrifice to <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaus</a> upon the tomb of that hero, both for other reasons and because <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaus</a> seemed to have been the first of the Greeks who took part with <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> in the expedition to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a> to disembark in Asia. The design of this sacrifice was that disembarking in Asia might be more fortunate to himself than that it had been to <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaus</a>. He then committed to <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a> the duty of conveying the cavalry and the greater part of the infantry across from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264USes class=place long=26.4172 lat=40.2284>Sestus</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264PAby class=place long=26.4091 lat=40.1951>Abydus</a>; and they crossed over in 160 triremes, besides many trading vessels. The prevailing account is that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> started from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401262UEla class=place long=26.2233 lat=40.0545>Elaeus</a> and put into the Port of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a>, that with his own hand he steered the general's ship across, and that when he was about the middle of the channel of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a> he sacrificed a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> to <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> and the <a href=/people/590 target=_blank>Nereids</a>, and poured forth a libation to them into the sea from a golden goblet. They say also that he was the first man to step out of the ship in full armour on the land of Asia, and that he erected altars to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, Apobaterios, to <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, and to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, at the place in Europe whence he started, and at the place in Asia where he disembarked. It is also said that he went up to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a> and offered sacrifice to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=person long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>; that he set up his own panoply in the temple as a votive offering, and in exchange for it took away some of the consecrated arms which had been preserved from the time of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> war. It is also said that the shield-bearing guards used to carry these arms in front of him into the battles. A report also prevails that he offered sacrifice to <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> upon the altar of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> Herkeios, deprecating the wrath of <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> against the progeny of <a href=/people/385 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a>, from whom <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself was descended. </p>                        </div>

There is indeed a report that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> pronounced <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> fortunate in getting <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> as the herald of his fame to posterity. And in truth it was meet that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> should deem <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> fortunate for this reason especially; for to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself this privilege was wanting, a thing which was not in accordance with the rest of his good fortune. His achievements have, therefore, not been related to mankind in a manner worthy of the hero. Neither in prose nor in verse has any one suitably honoured him; nor has he ever been sung of in a Lyric poem, in which style of poetry <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hiero</a>, <a href=/people/1134 target=_blank>Gelo</a>, <a href=/people/2575 target=_blank>Thero</a>, and many others not at all comparable with <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, have been praised. Consequently <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s deeds are far less known than the meanest achievements of antiquity. For instance, the march of the ten thousand with <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> up to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> against King <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a>, the tragic fate of <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> and those who were captured along with him, and the march of the same men down to the sea, in which they were led by <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, are events much better known to men through <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>'s narrative than are <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and his achievements. And yet <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> neither accompanied another man's expedition, nor did he in flight from the Great King overcome those who obstructed his march down to the sea. And, indeed, there is no other single individual among Greeks or barbarians who achieved exploits so great or important either in regard to number or magnitude as he did. This was the reason which induced me to undertake this history, not thinking myself incompetent to make <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s deeds known to men. For whoever I may be, this I know about myself, that there is no need for me to assert my name, for it is not unknown to men; nor is it needful for me to say what my native land and family are, or if I have held any public office in my own country. But this I do assert, that this historical work is and has been from my youth up, equivalent to native land, family, and public offices for me; and for this reason I do not deem myself unworthy to rank among the first authors in the Greek language, if <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> indeed is among the first in arms. </p>                        </div>

For I think that the enemy, being much inferior to us in infantry, will not dare to pass the night near us, and therefore they will permit the army to cross the ford with ease at daybreak. For we shall then pass over before they can put themselves in order of battle; whereas, I do not think that we can now attempt the operation without evident risk, because it is not possible to lead the army through the river with its front extended. For it is clear that many parts of the stream are deep, and you see that these banks are very steep and in some places abrupt. Therefore the enemy's cavalry, being formed into a dense square, will attack us as we emerge from the water in broken ranks and in column, in the place where we are weakest.

Then ensued a violent struggle on the part of the cavalry, on the one side to emerge from the river, and on the other to prevent the landing. From the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> there was a terrible discharge of darts; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> fought with spears. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, being far inferior in number, suffered severely at the first onset, because they were obliged to defend them selves from the river, where their footing was unsteady, and where they were below the level of their assailants; whereas the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> were fighting from the top of the bank, which gave them an advantage, especially as the best of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> had been posted there. <a href=/people/1753 target=_blank>Memnon</a> himself, as well as his sons, were running every risk with these; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> who first came into conflict with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, though they showed great valour, were cut down by them, except those who retreated to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, who was now approaching.

Taking all these things into consideration, he declared that he did not think that it was a suitable time for fighting a sea-battle; and for his part, he expounded the divine omen in a different way.

Then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> from all sides pressed close upon the citizens and the Grecian mercenaries, who took to flight; some of them, casting themselves into the sea, floated along upon their shields with the hollow upwards to an unnamed islet which lies near the city; others getting into their skiffs and hastening to get the start of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> triremes, were captured by them at the mouth of the harbour.

On this account he was unwilling to run the risk of losing even a part of his armament. Besides, he considered, that now he was occupying Asia with his land force, he would no longer be in need of a fleet; and that he would be able to break up that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, if he captured the maritime cities; since they would neither have any ports from which they could recruit their crews, nor any harbour in Asia to which they could bring their ships. Thus he explained the omen of the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> to signify that he should get the mastery over the enemy's ships by his land force. After doing this, he set forth into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=place long=28.7 lat=37.01>Caria</a>, because it was reported that a considerable force, both of foreigners and of Grecian auxiliaries, had collected in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal class=place long=27.4238 lat=37.0323>Halicarnassus</a>. Having taken all the cities between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=place long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal class=place long=27.4238 lat=37.0323>Halicarnassus</a> as soon as he approached them, he encamped near the latter city, at a distance from it of about five stades, as if he expected a long siege. For the natural position of the place made it strong; and wherever there seemed to be any deficiency in regard to security, it had been entirely supplied long before by <a href=/people/1753 target=_blank>Memnon</a>, who was there in person, having now been proclaimed by <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> governor of lower Asia and commander of the entire fleet. Many Grecian mercenary soldiers had been left in the city, as well as many <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> troops; the triremes also were moored in the harbour, so that the sailors might render him valuable aid in the operations. On the first day of the siege, while <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was leading his men up to the wall in the direction of the gate leading towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373278PMyl class=place long=27.781 lat=37.315>Mylasa</a> the men in the city made a sortie, and a skirmish took place; but <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s men making a rush upon them repulsed them with ease, and shut them up in the city. A few days after this, the king took the shield-bearing guards, the Cavalry Companions, the infantry regiments of <a href=/people/246 target=_blank>Amyntas</a>, <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a> and <a href=/people/315 target=_blank>Meleager</a>, and in addition to these the archers and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>, and went round to the part of the city which is in the direction of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=place long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndus</a>, both for the purpose of inspecting the wall, to see if perchance it could be more easily assaulted there than elsewhere; and at the same time to see if he could get hold of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=place long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndus</a> by a sudden and secret attack. For he thought that if <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=place long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndus</a> became his own, it would be no small help in the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal class=place long=27.4238 lat=37.0323>Halicarnassus</a>; moreover, an offer to surrender had been made by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=ethnic long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndians</a> if he would approach the town secretly, under the cover of night. About midnight, therefore, he approached the wall, according to the plan agreed on; but as no sign of surrender was made by the men within, and though he had with him no military engines or ladders, inasmuch as he had not set out to besiege the town, but an offer to betray it was made to him, he nevertheless led the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> phalanx near and ordered them to undermine the wall. They threw down one of the towers, which, however, in its fall did not make a breach in the wall. But the men in the city stoutly defending themselves, and at the same time many from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal class=place long=27.4238 lat=37.0323>Halicarnassus</a> having already come to their aid by sea, made it impossible for <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> to capture <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=place long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndus</a> either by surprise or sudden assault.

Hence a quarrel arose between them as to which of them was the braver, and, being somewhat inflamed with wine, they agreed to arm themselves, and of their own accord go and assault the wall facing the citadel, which for the most part was turned towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373278PMyl class=place long=27.781 lat=37.315>Mylasa</a>. This they did rather to make a display of their own valour than to engage in a dangerous conflict with the enemy. Some of the men in the city, however, perceiving that there were only two of them, and that they were approaching the wall inconsiderately, rushed out upon them; but they slew those who came near, and hurled darts at those who stood at a distance. At last, however, they were overmatched both by the number of their assailants and the disadvantage of their own position; for the enemy made the attack upon them, and threw darts at them from a higher level. Meanwhile some other men from the brigade of <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a>, and others from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal class=place long=27.4238 lat=37.0323>Halicarnassus</a>, rushed out against each other; and a sharp contest ensued near the wall.

The city also narrowly escaped capture; for the walls at that time were not under strict guard, and two towers, with the whole intermediate space, having already fallen to the ground, would have offered an easy entrance within the wall to the army, if the whole of it had undertaken the task. The third tower, which had been thoroughly shaken, would likewise have been easily thrown down if it had been undermined; but the enemy easily succeeded in building inside a crescent-shaped brick wall to take the place of the one which had fallen. This they were able to do so quickly because of the multitude of hands at their disposal. On the following day <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> brought his engines up to this wall also; and the men in the city made another sally to set them on fire. A part of the wicker-work shed near the wall and a piece of one of the wooden towers were burnt, but the rest were protected by <a href=/people/591 target=_blank>Philotas</a> and <a href=/people/637 target=_blank>Hellanicus</a>, to whom the charge of them had been committed. But as soon as those who were making the sally saw <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, the men who had come out to render aid by holding torches threw them away, and the majority of them cast away their arms and fled within the walls of the city. And yet at first they had the advantage from the nature of their position, which was commanding on account of its height; for not only did they cast missiles right in front against the men who were fighting in defence of the engines, but also from the towers which alone had been left standing at each end of the battered-down wall they were able to cast them against the sides, and almost against the backs, of those who were assaulting the wall which had just been built in place of the ruined one. </p>                        </div>

The king then, having collected his friends, proposed to them as a subject for deliberation what decision he ought to make in regard to this <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. The Companions thought that formerly he had not resolved wisely in confiding the best part of his cavalry to a faithless man, and that now it was advisable to put him out of the way as speedily as possible, before he became even more popular among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> and should try to effect some revolutionary plan with their aid. Moreover they were terrified by a certain divine portent. For, while <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the king was still besieging <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal class=place long=27.4238 lat=37.0323>Halicarnassus</a>, it is said that he was once taking rest at mid-day, when a swallow flew about over his head loudly twittering, and perched now on this side of his couch and now on that, chirping more noisily than usual. On account of his fatigue he could not be roused from sleep, but being disquieted by the sound he brushed her away gently with his hand. But though struck she was so far from trying to escape, that she perched upon the very head of the king, and did not desist until he was wide awake. Thinking the affair of the swallow of no trivial import, he communicated it to a soothsayer, <a href=/people/1772 target=_blank>Aristander</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370273UTel class=person long=27.3178 lat=37.0397>Telmissian</a>, who told him that it signified a plot formed by one of his friends. He said it also signified that the plot would be discovered, because the swallow was a bird fond of man's society and well disposed to him as well as more loquacious than any other bird. Therefore, comparing this with the depositions of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, the king sent <a href=/people/3736 target=_blank>Amphoterus</a>, son of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and brother of <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a>, to <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a>; and with him he sent some Pergaeans to show him the way. <a href=/people/3736 target=_blank>Amphoterus</a>, putting on a native dress, so that he should not be recognized on the road, reached <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a> by stealth. He did not carry a letter from <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, because it did not appear to the king advisable to write openly about any such matter; but he reported the message entrusted to him by word of mouth. Consequently this <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was arrested and kept under guard. </p>                        </div>

The people of this city are foreigners, of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=demonym long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidian</a> race, inhabiting a very lofty place, precipitous on every side; and the road to the city is a difficult one. For a mountain stretches from the city as far as the road, where it suddenly stops short; and over against it rises another mountain, no less precipitous. These mountains form gates, as it were, upon the road; and it is possible for those who occupy these eminences even with a small guard to render the passage impracticable. On this occasion the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370305PTer class=ethnic long=30.465 lat=36.982>Termessians</a> had come out in a body, and were occupying both the mountains; seeing which, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ordered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> to encamp there, armed as they were, imagining that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370305PTer class=ethnic long=30.465 lat=36.982>Termessians</a> would not remain in a body when they saw them bivouacking, but that most of them would withdraw into their city, which was near, leaving upon the mountains only sufficient men to form a guard. And it turned out just as he conjectured; for most of them retired, and only a guard remained. He forthwith took the archers, the regiments of javelin-throwers, and the lighter hoplites, and led them against those who were guarding the pass. When these were attacked with missiles, they did not stand their ground, but abandoned the position. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> then passed through the defile, and encamped near the city. </p>                        </div>

He made a treaty with them, and from this time found them faithful allies in all his proceedings. Despairing of being able to capture <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370305PTer class=place long=30.465 lat=36.982>Termessus</a> without a great loss of time, he marched on to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377305USag class=place long=30.5179 lat=37.6772>Sagalassus</a>. This was also a large city, inhabited likewise by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=ethnic long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidians</a>; and though all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=ethnic long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidians</a> are warlike, the men of this city were deemed the most so. On this occasion they had occupied the hill in front of the city, because it was no less strong than the walls, from which to ward off the enemy; and there they were awaiting him. But <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> drew up the phalanx of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> in the following way: on the right wing, where he had himself taken up his position, he held the shield-bearing guards, and next to these he extended the foot Companions as far as the left wing, in the order that each of the generals had precedence in the array that day. On the left wing he stationed <a href=/people/246 target=_blank>Amyntas</a>, son of <a href=/people/2390 target=_blank>Arrhabaeus</a>, as commander. In front of his right wing were posted the archers and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>, and in front of the left wing the Thracian javelin-throwers under the command of <a href=/people/1252 target=_blank>Sitalces</a>. But the cavalry were no use to him in a place so rough and unfavourable. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370305PTer class=ethnic long=30.465 lat=36.982>Termessians</a> also had come to the aid of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=ethnic long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidians</a>, and arrayed themselves with them. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had already made an attack upon the mountain which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=ethnic long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidians</a> were occupying, advancing up the most abrupt part of the ascent, when the barbarians in column attacked him on both wings, in a place where it was very easy for themselves to advance, but where the route was very difficult for their enemy. The archers, who were the first to approach, were put to rout, inasmuch as they were insufficiently armed; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a> stood their ground, for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> phalanx was already drawing near, at the head of which <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself was seen. When the battle became a hand-to-hand one, though the barbarians were destitute of armour, they rushed against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> hoplites, and fell wounded on all sides. Then, indeed, they gave way, after about five hundred of them had been killed. As they were nimble and well-acquainted with the locality, they effected their retreat without difficulty; whereas the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, on account of the heaviness of their arms and their ignorance of the roads, durst not pursue them vigorously. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> therefore held off from the fugitives, and took their city by storm. Of those with him, <a href=/people/857 target=_blank>Cleander</a>, the general of the archers, and about twenty others were slain. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> then marched against the rest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=ethnic long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidians</a>, and took some of their strongholds by force; others he won over to him by granting them terms of capitulation. </p>                        </div>

He was also desirous of seeing the wagon of <a href=/people/1944 target=_blank>Gordius</a> and the cord of the yoke of this wagon. There was a great deal of talk about this wagon among the neighbouring population. It was said that <a href=/people/1944 target=_blank>Gordius</a> was a poor man among the ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a>, who had a small piece of land to till, and two yoke of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>. He used one of these in ploughing and the other to draw the wagon. On one occasion, while he was ploughing, an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> settled upon the yoke, and remained sitting there until the time came for unyoking the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>.

He offered the sacrifice in the way the girl suggested, and afterwards married her. A son was born to them named <a href=/people/410 target=_blank>Midas</a>. When <a href=/people/410 target=_blank>Midas</a> was grown to be a man, handsome and valiant, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a> were harassed by civil discord, and consulting the oracle, they were told that a wagon would bring them a king, who would put an end to their discord. </p>                        </div>

They, comparing the oracular response with this occurrence, decided that this was the person whom the god told them the wagon would bring. They therefore appointed <a href=/people/410 target=_blank>Midas</a> king; and he, putting an end to their discord, dedicated his father's wagon in the citadel as a thank-offering to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the king for sending the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>. In addition to this the following saying was current concerning the wagon, that whosoever could loosen the cord of the yoke of this wagon, was destined to gain the rule of Asia. The cord was made of cornel bark, and neither end nor beginning to it could be seen. It is said by some that when <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> could find out no way to loosen the cord and yet was unwilling to allow it to remain unloosened, lest this should exercise some disturbing influence upon the multitude, he struck it with his sword and cutting it through, said that it had been loosened. But <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> says that he pulled out the pin of the wagon-pole, which was a wooden peg driven right through it, holding the cord together. Having done this, he drew out the yoke from the wagon-pole. How <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> performed the feat in connection with this cord, I cannot affirm with confidence. At any rate both he and his troops departed from the wagon as if the oracular prediction concerning the loosening of the cord had been fulfilled. Moreover, that very night, the thunder and lightning were signs of its fulfilment; and for this reason <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> offered sacrifice on the following day to the gods who had revealed the signs and the way to loosen the cord. </p>                        </div>

Then indeed he collected the Companions and told them what was reported about <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> and his army. They urged him to lead them on as they were, without delay. At that time he commended them, and broke up the conference; but next day he led them forward against <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>. On the second day he passed through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373348LCil class=place long=34.8005 lat=37.2692>the Gates</a> and encamped near the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/366362UMyr class=place long=36.056 lat=36.522>Myriandrus</a>; but in the night a heavy tempest and a violent storm of wind and rain occurred which detained him in his camp. <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, on the other hand, up to this time was delaying with his army, having chosen a plain in the land of <a href=/people/454 target=_blank>Assyria</a> which stretched out in every direction, suitable for the immense size of his army and convenient for the evolutions of cavalry. <a href=/people/246 target=_blank>Amyntas</a>, son of <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, the deserter from <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, advised him not to abandon this position, because the open country was favourable to the great multitude of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and the vast quantity of their baggage. So <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> remained.

He was also not unwilling to be led to form whatever decision was most agreeable to his own wishes; and being urged on by those who for the gratification of pleasure associated with him, and will associate for their injury with those who for the time are reigning, he came to the conclusion that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was no longer desirous of advancing further, but was shrinking from an encounter on learning that <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> himself was marching against him. On all sides they were urging him on, asserting that he would trample down the army of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> with his cavalry. Nevertheless, <a href=/people/246 target=_blank>Amyntas</a>, at any rate, confidently affirmed that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> would certainly come to any place where he heard <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> might be; and he exhorted him by all means to stay where he was. But the worse advice, because at the immediate time it was more pleasant to hear, prevailed; moreover perhaps he was led by some divine influence into that locality where he derived little advantage from his cavalry and from the very number of his men, javelins and bows, and where he could not even exhibit the mere magnificence of his army, but surrendered to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and his troops an easy victory. For it was already decreed by fate that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> should be deprived of the rule of Asia by the Macedonians, just as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> had been deprived of it by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, and still earlier the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>. </p>                        </div>

Having reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368362UIss class=place long=36.216 lat=36.752>Issus</a>, he captured as many of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> as had been left behind there on account of illness. These he cruelly mutilated and slew. Next day he proceeded to the river <a href=/people/4270 target=_blank>Pinarus</a>. As soon as <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> heard that <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> was in his rear, because the news did not seem to him trustworthy, he embarked some of the Companions in a ship with thirty oars, and sent them back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368362UIss class=place long=36.216 lat=36.752>Issus</a>, to observe whether the report was true. The men who sailed in the thirty-oared ship discovered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> encamped there more easily, because the sea in this part takes the form of a bay. They therefore brought back word to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> that <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> was at hand. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> then called together the generals, the commanders of cavalry, and the leaders of the Grecian allies, and exhorted them to take courage from the dangers which they had already surmounted, asserting that the struggle would be between themselves who had been previously victorious and a foe who had already been beaten; and that the deity was acting the part of general on their behalf better than himself, by putting it into the mind of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> to move his forces from the spacious plain and shut them up in a narrow place, where there was sufficient room for themselves to deepen their phalanx by marching from front to rear, but where their vast multitude would be useless to the enemy in the battle. He added that their foes were similar to them neither in strength nor in courage; for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, who had long been practised in warlike toils accompanied with danger, were coming into close conflict with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, men who had become enervated by a long course of luxurious ease; and, to crown all, they, being freemen, were about to engage in battle with men who were slaves. He said, moreover, that the Greeks who were coming into conflict with Greeks would not be fighting for the same objects; for those with <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> were braving danger for pay, and that pay not high; whereas, those on their side were voluntarily defending the interests of Greece. Again, of foreigners, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415220RPai class=ethnic long=22.01 lat=41.5>Paeonians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>, who were the most robust and warlike of men in Europe, were about to be arrayed against the most sluggish and effeminate races of Asia.

After this conflict nothing would be left for them to do, except to take possession of all Asia, and to put an end to their many labours. In addition to this, he reminded them of their brilliant achievements in their collective capacity in days gone by; and if any man had individually performed any distinguished feat of valour from love of glory, he mentioned him by name in commendation of the deed. He then recapitulated as modestly as possible his own daring deeds in the various battles. He is also said to have reminded them of <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> and the 10,000 men who accompanied him, asserting that the latter were in no way comparable with them either in number or in general excellence.

When about midnight he had again got possession of it, he caused the army to rest the remainder of the night there upon the rocks, having posted vigilant sentries. At the approach of dawn he began to descend from the pass along the road; and as long as the space was narrow everywhere, he led his army in column, but when the mountains parted so as to leave a plain between them, he kept on opening out the column into the phalanx, marching one line of heavy armed infantry after another up into line towards the mountain on the right and towards the sea on the left. Up to this time his cavalry had been ranged behind the infantry; but when they advanced into the open country, he began to draw up his army in order of battle.

In front of the cavalry on the right, he posted the lancers under the command of <a href=/people/2439 target=_blank>Protomachus</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415220RPai class=ethnic long=22.01 lat=41.5>Paeonians</a> under that of <a href=/people/884 target=_blank>Aristo</a>; and of the infantry, the archers under the direction of <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a> under that of <a href=/people/90 target=_blank>Attalus</a>. Some of the cavalry and archers also he drew up so as to form an angle with the centre towards the mountain which was in the rear; so that on the right, his phalanx had been drawn up separated into two wings, the one fronting <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> and the main body of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> beyond the river, and the other facing those who had been posted at the mountain in their rear. On the left wing the infantry consisting of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> archers and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> under command of <a href=/people/1252 target=_blank>Sitalces</a> were posted in front; and before these the cavalry towards the left. The Grecian mercenaries were drawn up as a reserve for all of them. When he perceived that the phalanx towards the right was too thin, and it seemed likely that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> would outflank him here considerably, he ordered two squadrons of the Companion cavalry, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404233PAnt class=demonym long=23.2542 lat=40.4449>Anthemusian</a>, of which Peroedas, son of <a href=/people/865 target=_blank>Menestheus</a>, was captain, and that which was called Leugaean, under the command of <a href=/people/10903 target=_blank>Pantordanus</a>, son of <a href=/people/857 target=_blank>Cleander</a>, to proceed from the centre to the right without being seen.

As they fled to the summit he decided that he could make use of the men who had been drawn up to keep these in check, to fill up the ranks of his phalanx. He thought it quite sufficient to post 300 horsemen to watch the men on the mountain. </p>                        </div>

For <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> was no longer leading the foreigners against him, as he had arranged them at first, but he remained in his position, upon the bank of the river, which was in many parts steep and precipitous; and in certain places, where it seemed more easy to ascend, he extended a stockade along it. By this it was at once evident to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s men that <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> had become cowed in spirit. But when the armies were at length close to each other, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> rode about in every direction to exhort his troops to show their valour, mentioning with befitting epithets the names, not only of the generals, but also those of the captains of cavalry and infantry, and of the Grecian mercenaries as many as were more distinguished either by reputation or any deed of valour. From all sides arose a shout not to delay but to attack the enemy. At first he still led them on in close array with measured step, although he had the forces of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> already in distant view, lest by a too hasty march any part of the phalanx should fluctuate from the line and get separated from the rest. But when they came within range of darts, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself and those around him, being posted on the right wing, dashed first into the river with a run, in order to alarm the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> by the rapidity of their onset, and by coming sooner to close conflict to avoid being much injured by the archers. And it turned out just as <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had conjectured; for as soon as the battle became a hand-to-hand one, the part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> army stationed on the left wing was put to rout; and here <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and his men won a brilliant victory. But the Grecian mercenaries serving under <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> attacked the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> at the point where they saw their phalanx especially disordered. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> phalanx had been broken and had disjoined towards the right wing, because <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had dashed into the river with eagerness, and engaging in a hand-to-hand conflict was already driving back the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> posted there; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> in the centre had not prosecuted their task with equal eagerness; and finding many parts of the bank steep and precipitous, they were unable to preserve the front of the phalanx in the same line. Here then the struggle was desperate; the Grecian mercenaries of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> fighting in order to push the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> back into the river, and regain the victory for their allies who were already flying; the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> struggling in order not to fall short of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s success, which was already manifest, and not to tarnish the glory of the phalanx, which up to that time had been commonly pro claimed invincible. Moreover the feeling of rivalry which existed between the Grecian and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> races inspired each side in the conflict.

Inquiring therefore who the women were, and why they were in a tent so near, he was answered by some one as follows, O king, the mother, wife, and children of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> are lamenting for him as slain, since they have been informed that you have his bow and his royal mantle, and that his shield has been brought back. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> heard this, he sent <a href=/people/1114 target=_blank>Leonnatus</a>, one of his Companions, to them, with injunctions to tell them, <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> is still alive; in his flight he left his arms and mantle in the chariot; and these are the only things of his that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> has. <a href=/people/1114 target=_blank>Leonnatus</a> entered the tent and told them the news about <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, saying, moreover, that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> would allow them to retain the state and retinue befitting their royal rank, as well as the title of queens; for he had not undertaken the war against <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> from a feeling of hatred, but he had conducted it in a legitimate manner for the empire of Asia. Such are the statements of <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> and <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a>. But there is another report, to the effect that on the following day <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself went into the tent, accompanied alone by <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> one of his Companions. The mother of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, being in doubt which of them was the king (for they had both arrayed themselves in the same style of dress), went up to <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>, because he appeared to her the taller of the two, and prostrated herself before him. But when he drew back, and one of her attendants pointed out <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, saying he was the king, she was ashamed of her mistake, and was going to retire. But the king told her she had made no mistake, for <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> was also <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. This I record neither being sure of its truth nor thinking it altogether unreliable. If it really occurred, I commend <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> for his compassionate treatment of the women, and the confidence he felt in his companion, and the honour bestowed on him; but if it merely seems probable to historians that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> would have acted and spoken thus, even for this reason I think him worthy of commendation. </p>                        </div>

This was interpreted by <a href=/people/1772 target=_blank>Aristander</a> to mean that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a> would be taken with labour, because the deeds of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> were accomplished with labour. Certainly, the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a> appeared to be a great enterprise; for the city was an island and fortified all round with lofty walls. Moreover naval operations seemed at that time more favourable to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a>, both because the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> still possessed the sovereignty of the sea and many ships were still remaining with the citizens themselves. However, as these arguments of his had prevailed, he resolved to construct a mole from the mainland to the city. The place is a narrow strait full of pools; and the part of it near the mainland is shallow water and muddy, but the part near the city itself, where the channel was deepest, was about eighteen feet in depth. But there was an abundant supply of stones and wood, which they put on the top of the stones. Stakes were easily fixed down firmly in the mud, which itself served as a cement to the stones to hold them firm. The zeal of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> in the work was great, and it was increased by the presence of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself, who took the lead in everything, now rousing the men to exertion by speech, and now by presents of money lightening the labour of those who were toiling more than their fellows from the desire of gaining praise for their exertions. As long as the mole was being constructed near the mainland, the work made easy and rapid progress, as the material was poured into a small depth of water, and there was no one to hinder them; but when they began to approach the deeper water, and at the same time came near the city itself, they suffered severely, being assailed with missiles from the walls, which were lofty, inasmuch as they had been expressly equipped for work rather than for fighting. Moreover, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a> still retained command of the sea, they kept on sailing with the triremes to various parts of the mole, and made it impossible in many places for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> to pour in the material. But the latter erected two towers upon the mole, which they had now projected over a long stretch of sea, and upon these towers they placed engines of war. Skins and prepared hides served as coverings in front of them, to prevent them being struck by fire-bearing missiles from the wall, and at the same time to be a screen against ar rows to those who were working. It was likewise intended that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a> who might sail near to injure the men engaged in the construction of the mole should not retire easily, being assailed by missiles from the towers. </p>                        </div>

They filled a vessel, which had been used for transporting <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, with dry twigs and other combustible wood, fixed two masts on the prow, and fenced it round in the form of a circle as large as possible, so that it might contain as much chaff and as many torches as possible. Moreover they placed upon this vessel quantities of pitch, brimstone, and whatever else was calculated to foment a great flame. They also stretched out a double yard-arm upon each mast; and from these they hung caldrons into which they had poured or cast materials likely to kindle flame which would extend to a great distance. They then put ballast into the stern, in order to raise the prow aloft, the vessel being weighed down abaft. Then watching for a wind bearing towards the mole, they fastened the vessel to some triremes which towed it before the breeze. As soon as they approached the mole and the towers, they threw fire among the wood, and at the same time ran the vessel, with the triremes, aground as violently as possible, dashing against the end of the mole. The men in the vessel easily swam away, as soon as it was set on fire. A great flame soon caught the towers; and the yard-arms being twisted round poured out into the fire the materials that had been prepared for kindling the flame. The men also in the triremes tarrying near the mole kept on shooting arrows into the towers, so that it was not safe for the men to approach who were bringing materials to quench the fire. Upon this, when the towers had already caught fire, many men hastened from the city, and embarking in light vessels, and striking against various parts of the mole, easily tore down the stockade which had been placed in front of it for protection, and burned up all the engines of war which the fire from the vessel did not reach. But <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> began to construct a wider mole from the mainland, capable of containing more towers; and he ordered the engine-makers to prepare fresh engines. While this was being performed, he took the shieldbearing guards and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a> and set out to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/336354PSid class=place long=35.371 lat=33.56>Sidon</a>, to collect there all the triremes he could; since it was evident that the successful conclusion of the siege would be much more difficult to attain, so long as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a> retained the superiority at sea. </p>                        </div>

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a> erected wooden towers on their battlements opposite the mole, from which they might annoy the enemy; and if the engines of war were brought near any other part, they defended themselves with missiles and shot at the very ships with fire-bearing arrows, so that they deterred the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> from approaching the wall.

Then, fastening slipknots to the stones, they dragged them out of the sea from the mole; and having raised them aloft with cranes, they discharged them into deep water, where they were no longer likely to do injury by being hurled forward.

At the first onset they at once sank the quinquereme of king <a href=/people/3667 target=_blank>Pnytagoras</a>, that of <a href=/people/10996 target=_blank>Androcles</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347331PAma class=person long=33.144 lat=34.712>Amathusian</a> and that of <a href=/people/5867 target=_blank>Pasicrates</a> the Courian; and they shattered the other ships by pushing them ashore. But when <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> perceived the sailing out of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=demonym long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrian</a> triremes, he ordered most of the ships under his command whenever each was manned, to take position at the mouth of the harbour, so that the rest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=demonym long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrian</a> ships might not sail out. He then took the quinqueremes which he had and about five of the triremes, which were manned by him in haste before the rest were ready, and sailed round the city against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a> who had sailed out of the harbour. The men on the wall, perceiving the enemy's attack and observing that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself was in the fleet, began to shout to those in their own ships, urging them to return; but as their shouts were not audible, on account of the noise of those who were engaged in the ac tion, they exhorted them to retreat by various kinds of signals. At last after a long time, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a>, perceiving the impending attack of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s fleet, tacked about and began to flee into the harbour; and a few of their ships succeeded in escaping, but <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s vessels assaulted the greater number, and rendered some of them unfit for sailing; and a quinquereme and a quadrireme were captured at the very mouth of the harbour. But the slaughter of the marines was not great; for when they perceived that the ships were in possession of the enemy, they swam off without difficulty into the harbour. As the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a> could no longer derive any aid from their ships, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> now brought up their military engines to the wall itself. Those which were brought near the city along the mole did no damage worth mentioning on ac count of the strength of the wall there. Others brought up some of the ships conveying military engines opposite the part of the city turned towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/336354PSid class=place long=35.371 lat=33.56>Sidon</a>. But when even there they met with no success, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> passed round to the wall projecting towards the south wind and towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and tried everywhere to make a breach. Here first a large piece of the wall was thoroughly shaken, and a part of it was even broken and thrown down. Then indeed for a short time he tried to make a storm to the extent of throwing a draw-bridge upon the part of the wall where a breach had been made. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a> without much difficulty beat the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> back. </p>                        </div>

In the first place he shook down a large piece of the wall; and when the breach appeared to be sufficiently wide, he ordered the vessels conveying the military engines to retire, and brought up two others, which carried the bridges, which he intended to throw upon the breach in the wall. The shieldbearing guards occupied one of these vessels, which he had put under the command of <a href=/people/996 target=_blank>Admetus</a>; and the other was occupied by the regiment of <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a>, called the foot Companions. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself, with the shield-bearing guards, intended to scale the wall where it might be practicable. He ordered some of his triremes to sail against both of the harbours, to see if by any means they could force an entrance when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a> had turned themselves to oppose him. He also ordered those of his triremes which contained the missiles to be hurled from engines, or which were carrying archers upon deck, to sail right round the wall and to run aground wherever it was practicable, and to take up position within shooting range, where it was impossible to run aground, so that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a>, being shot at from all quarters, might become distracted, and not know whither to turn in their distress. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s ships drew close to the city and the bridges were thrown from them upon the wall, the shield-bearing guards mounted valiantly along these upon the wall; for their captain, <a href=/people/996 target=_blank>Admetus</a>, proved himself brave on that occasion, and <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> accompanied them, both as a courageous participant in the action itself, and as a witness of brilliant and dangerous feats of valour performed by others. The first part of the wall that was captured was where <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had posted himself, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a> being easily beaten back from it, as soon as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> found firm footing, but at the same time a way of entrance not abrupt on every side. Adm etus was the first to mount the wall; but while cheering on his men to mount, he was struck with a spear and died on the spot. After him, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> with the Companions got possession of the wall; and when some of the towers and the parts of the wall between them were in his hands, he advanced through the battlements to the royal palace, because the descent into the city that way seemed the easiest. </p>                        </div>

The ships also took part in this religious procession in honour of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>. He moreover held a gymnastic contest in the temple, and celebrated a torch race. The military engine, also, with which the wall had been battered down, was brought into the temple and dedicated as a thank-offering; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=demonym long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrian</a> ship sacred to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, which had been captured in the naval attack, was likewise dedicated to the god.

The city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/315344UGaz class=place long=34.432 lat=31.523>Gaza</a> was large, and had been built upon a lofty mound, around which a strong wall had been carried.

When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> arrived near the city, on the first day he encamped at the spot where the wall seemed to him most easy to assail, and ordered his military engines to be constructed. But the engineers expressed the opinion that it was not possible to capture the wall by force, on account of the height of the mound. However the more impracticable it seemed to be, the more resolutely <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> determined that it must be captured. For he said that the action would strike the enemy with great alarm from its being contrary to their expectation; whereas his failure to Capture the place would redound to his disgrace when mentioned either to the Greeks or to <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>. He therefore resolved to construct a mound right round the city, so as to be able to bring his military engines up to the walls on the same level on the artificial mound which had been raised. The mound was constructed especially over against the southern wall of the city, where it appeared easiest to make an assault. When he thought that the mound had been raised to the proper level with the walls, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> placed their military engines upon it, and brought them close to the wall of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/315344UGaz class=place long=34.432 lat=31.523>Gaza</a>. At this time while <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was offering sacrifice, and, crowned with a garland, was about to commence the first sacred rite according to custom, a certain carnivorous bird, flying over the altar, let a stone which it was carrying with its claws fall upon his head. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> asked <a href=/people/1772 target=_blank>Aristander</a>, the soothsayer, what this omen meant.

When his engines had been prepared, and brought up along the mound, they shook down a large extent of wall; and mines being dug in various places, and the earth being drawn out by stealth, the wall fell down in many parts, subsiding into the emptied space. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> then commanded a large extent of ground with their missiles, driving back the men who were defending the city from the towers. Nevertheless, the men of the city sustained three assaults, though many of their number were killed or wounded; but at the fourth attack, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> led up the phalanx of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> from all sides, threw down the part of the wall which was undermined, and shook down another large portion of it by battering it with his engines, so that he rendered the assault an easy matter through the breaches with his scaling ladders. Accordingly the ladders were brought up to the wall; and then there arose a great emulation among those of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> who laid any claim to valour, to see who should be the first to scale the wall. The first to do so was <a href=/people/385 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a>, one of the Companions, of the family of the <a href=/people/1328 target=_blank>Aeacidae</a>; and after him mounted one rank after another with their officers. When once some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> got within the wall, they split open in succession the gates which each party happened to light upon, and thus admitted the whole army into the city. But though their city was now in the hands of the enemy, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/315344UGaz class=ethnic long=34.432 lat=31.523>Gazaeans</a> nevertheless stood together and fought; so that they were all slain fighting there, as each man had been stationed. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> sold their wives and children into slavery; and having peopled the city again from the neighbouring settlers, he made use of it as a fortified post for the war. </p>                        </div>

The position seemed to him a very fine one in which to found a city, and he foresaw that it would become a prosperous one. Therefore he was seized by an ardent desire to undertake the enterprise, and himself marked out the boundaries of the city, pointing out the place where the agora was to be constructed, where the temples were to be built, stating how many there were to be, and to what Grecian gods they were to be dedicated, and specially marking a spot for a temple to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>.

One of the builders hit upon the plan of collecting in vessels the barley which the soldiers were carrying, and throwing it upon the ground where the king led the way; and thus the circle of the fortification which he was making for the city was completely marked out. The soothsayers, and especially <a href=/people/1772 target=_blank>Aristander</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370273UTel class=person long=27.3178 lat=37.0397>Telmissian</a>, who was said already to have given many other true predictions, pondering this, told <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> that the city would become prosperous in every respect, but especially in regard to the fruits of the earth.

He also deduced his pedigree from <a href=/people/577 target=_blank>Ammon</a>, just as the legends traced that of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> and <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a> to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. Accordingly he made the expedition to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/292255SAmm class=place long=25.5435 lat=29.2052>Ammon</a> with the design of learning his own origin more certainly, or at least that he might be able to say that he had learned it. According to <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a>, he advanced along the seashore to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/314272UPar class=place long=27.245 lat=31.359>Paraetonium</a> through a country which was a desert, but not destitute of water, a distance of about 1,600 stades. Thence he turned into the interior, where the oracle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/292255SAmm class=place long=25.5435 lat=29.2052>Ammon</a> was located. The route is desert, and most of it is sand and destitute of water. But there was a copious supply of rain for <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, a thing which was attributed to the influence of the deity; as was also the following occurrence. Whenever a south wind blows in that district, it heaps up the sand upon the route far and wide, rendering the tracks of the road invisible, so that it is impossible to discover where one ought to direct one's course in the sand, just as if one were at sea; for there are no landmarks along the road, neither mountain anywhere, nor tree, nor permanent hill standing erect, by which travellers might be able to form a conjecture of the right course, as sailors do by the stars. Consequently, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s army lost the way, and even the guides were in doubt about the course to take. <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, says that two <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a> went in front of the army, uttering a voice, and <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ordered the guides to follow them, trusting in the divine portent. He says too that they showed the way to the oracle and back again. But <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a>, whose account is generally admitted as correct, says that two ravens flew in front of the army, and that these acted as <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s guides. I am able to assert with confidence that some divine assistance was afforded him, for probability also coincides with the supposition; but the discrepancies in the details of the various narratives have deprived the story of certainty. </p>                        </div>

The fertile spot in the midst of this desert, is not extensive; for where it stretches into its greater expanse, it is only about forty stades broad. It is full of cultivated trees, olives and palms; and it is the only place in those parts which is refreshed with dew. A spring also rises from it, quite unlike all the other springs which issue from the earth. For at midday the water is cold to the taste, and still more so to the touch, as cold as cold can be. But when the sun has sunk into the west, it gets warmer, and from the evening it keeps on growing warmer until midnight, when it reaches the warmest point. After midnight it goes on getting gradually colder; at daybreak it is already cold; but at midday it reaches the coldest point. Every day it undergoes these alternate changes in regular succession. In this place also natural salt is procured by digging, and certain of the priests of <a href=/people/577 target=_blank>Ammon</a> convey quantities of it into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. For whenever they set out for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> they put it into little boxes plaited out of palm, and carry it as a present to the king, or some other great man.

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> and others who are respectful to the deity, use this salt in their sacrifices, as it is clearer than that which is procured from the sea. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> then was struck with wonder at the place, and consulted the oracle of the god.

He then settled the affairs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, by appointing two <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, <a href=/people/9281 target=_blank>Doloaspis</a> and Petisis, governors of the country, dividing between them the whole land; but as Petisis declined his province, <a href=/people/9281 target=_blank>Doloaspis</a> received the whole. He appointed two of the Companions to be commandants of garrisons: <a href=/people/1893 target=_blank>Pantaleon</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404226PPyd class=person long=22.6173 lat=40.3973>Pydnaean</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>, and <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>, son of <a href=/people/789 target=_blank>Megacles</a>, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225PPel class=demonym long=22.518 lat=40.754>Pellaean</a>, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/310325UPel class=place long=32.5462 lat=31.0424>Pelusium</a>.

This last was ordered to allow the governors to rule their respective districts according to the ancient custom; but to collect from them the tribute due to him. The native governors were also ordered to pay it to <a href=/people/81 target=_blank>Cleomenes</a>. He appointed <a href=/people/1899 target=_blank>Peucestas</a>, son of <a href=/people/1331 target=_blank>Macartatus</a>, and <a href=/people/2498 target=_blank>Balacrus</a>, son of <a href=/people/246 target=_blank>Amyntas</a>, generals of the army which he left behind in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>; and he placed <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>, son of <a href=/people/378 target=_blank>Theramenes</a>, over the fleet as admiral. He made <a href=/people/1114 target=_blank>Leonnatus</a>, son of Anteas, one of his body-guards instead of Arrhybas, who had died of disease. <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, the commander of the archers, also died; and in his stead Ombrion the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=person long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> was appointed. When <a href=/people/2498 target=_blank>Balacrus</a> was left behind in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, the allied Grecian infantry, which had been under his command, was put under that of <a href=/people/1817 target=_blank>Calanus</a>. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was said to have divided the government of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> among so many men, because he was surprised at the natural strength of the country, and he thought it unsafe to entrust the rule of the whole to a single person. The Romans also seem to me to have learned a lesson from him, and therefore keep <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> under strong guard; for they do not send any of the senators thither as proconsul for the same reason, but only men who have the rank among them of Equites (Knights). </p>                        </div>

Being informed that revolutionary plans had been carried out in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a>, he sent <a href=/people/3736 target=_blank>Amphoterus</a> thither to assist those of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=ethnic long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesians</a> who were firm in their support of his war against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, and were not under the control of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a>.

For this man at first had been banished, while <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a> was still king, because he was an adherent of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; as also was <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, for the same reason; likewise <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a>, son of Androtimus, <a href=/people/2739 target=_blank>Erigyius</a>, son of <a href=/people/6594 target=_blank>Larichus</a>, and his brother <a href=/people/781 target=_blank>Laomedon</a>.

But after <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a>'s death those who had been banished on <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s account returned from exile and were received into favour. He made <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> one of his confidential body-guards; he placed <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a> over the money, because his bodily strength was unequal to the fatigues of war. <a href=/people/2739 target=_blank>Erigyius</a> was made commander of the allied Grecian cavalry; and his brother <a href=/people/781 target=_blank>Laomedon</a>, because he could speak both the Greek and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> languages and could read <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> writings, was put in charge of the foreign prisoners. <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a> also was appointed viceroy of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=place long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycia</a> and of the land adjacent to it as far as mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a>.

When he came back, he not only received no punishment, but was even reinstated in the office of treasurer. <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>, one of the Companions, was sent away into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a> as viceroy; and <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> was put in command of the Grecian auxiliaries who had been under <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>. <a href=/people/1585 target=_blank>Asclepiodorus</a>, son of <a href=/people/3597 target=_blank>Eunicus</a>, was also appointed viceroy of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> instead of Arimmas, because the latter seemed to have been remiss in collecting the supplies which he had been ordered to collect for the army which the king was about to lead into the interior. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/2170 target=_blank>Mazaeus</a>, to whom <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> had committed the duty of guarding the river, with about 3,000 cavalry, 2,000 of which were Grecian mercenaries, was up to that time keeping guard there at the river. For this reason the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> had not constructed the complete bridge as far as the opposite bank, being afraid that <a href=/people/2170 target=_blank>Mazaeus</a> might make an assault upon the bridge where it ended. But when he heard that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was approaching, he went off in flight with all his army. As soon as he had fled, the bridges were completed as far as the further bank, and <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> crossed upon them with his army. Thence he marched up into the interior through the land called <a href=/people/290 target=_blank>Mesopotamia</a>, having the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> and the mountains of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a> on his left. When he started from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> he did not march to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> by the direct road; because by going the other route he found all things easier for the march of his army, and it was also easier to obtain fodder for the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and provisions for the men from the country. Besides this, the heat was not so scorching on the indirect route. Some of the men from <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>'s army, who were dispersed for the purpose of scouting, were taken prisoners; and they reported that <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> was encamped near the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a>, having resolved to prevent <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> from crossing that stream. They also said that he had a much larger army than that with which he had fought in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>. Hearing this, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> went with all speed towards the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a>; but when he reached it he found neither <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> himself nor any guard which he had left. However he experienced great difficulty in crossing the stream, on account of the swiftness of the current, though no one tried to stop him. There he made his army rest, and while so doing, an eclipse of the moon nearly total occurred. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> thereupon offered sacrifice to the moon, the sun and the earth, whose deed this was, according to common report. <a href=/people/1772 target=_blank>Aristander</a> thought that this eclipse of the moon was a portent favourable to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>; that there would be a battle that very month, and that victory for <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was signified by the sacrificial victims. Having therefore decamped from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a>, he went through the land of <a href=/people/4446 target=_blank>Aturia</a>, having the mountains of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375433RGor class=ethnic long=43.3 lat=37.5>Gordyaeans</a> on the left and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a> itself on the right; and on the fourth day after the passage of the river, his scouts brought word to him that the enemy's cavalry were visible there along the plain, but how many of them there were they could not guess. Accordingly he drew his army up in order and advanced prepared for battle. Other scouts again riding forward and taking more accurate observations, told him that the cavalry did not seem to them to be more than 1,000 in number. </p>                        </div>

He meanwhile fortified his camp with a ditch and stockade, as he intended to leave behind the baggage and all the soldiers who were unfit for fighting, and to go into the contest accompanied by his warriors carrying with them nothing except their weapons. Accordingly he took his forces by night, and began the march about the second watch, in order to come into collision with the foreigners at break of day. As soon as <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> was informed of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s approach, he at once drew out his army for battle; and <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> led on his men drawn up in like manner. Though the armies were only sixty stades from each other, yet they were not in sight of each other, for between the hostile forces some hills intervened. But when <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was only thirty stades distant from the enemy, and his army was already marching down from the hills just mentioned, catching sight of the foreigners, he caused his phalanx to halt there. Calling a council of the Companions, generals, cavalry officers, and leaders of the Grecian allies and mercenaries, he deliberated with them, whether he should at once lead on the phalanx without delay, as most of them urged him to do; or, whether, as <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a> thought preferable, to pitch their tents there for the present, to reconnoitre all the ground, in order to see if there was anything there to excite suspicion or to impede their progress, or if there were ditches or stakes firmly fixed in the earth out of sight, as well as to make a more accurate survey of the enemy's tactical arrangements. <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a>'s opinion prevailed, so they encamped there, drawn up in the order in which they intended to enter the battle. But <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> took the light infantry and the cavalry Companions and went all round, reconnoitring the whole country where he was about to fight the battle. Having returned, he again called together the same leaders, and said that they did not require to be encouraged by him to enter the contest; for they had been long before encouraged by their own valour, and by the gallant deeds which they had already so often achieved. He thought it expedient that each of them individually should stir up his own men separately; the infantry captain the men of his company, the cavalry captain his own squadron, the brigadiers their various brigades, and each of the leaders of the infantry the phalanx entrusted to him. He assured them that in this battle they were going to fight, not as before, either for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335360RCSy class=place long=36 lat=33.5>Coele-Syria</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a>, or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, but for the whole of Asia. For he said this battle would decide who were to be the rulers of that continent. It was not necessary for him to stir them up to gallant deeds by many words, since they had this valour by nature; but they should see that each man took care, so far as in him lay, to preserve discipline in the critical moment of action, and to keep perfect silence when it was expedient to advance in silence. On the other hand, they should see that each man uttered a sonorous shout, where it would be advantageous to shout, and to raise as terrible a battle-cry as possible, when a suitable opportunity occurred of raising the battle-cry. He told them to take care to obey his orders as quickly as possible, and to transmit the orders they had received to the ranks with all rapidity; each man remembering that both as an individual and in the aggregate he was increasing the general danger if he was remiss in the discharge of his duty, and that he was assisting to gain a victory if he zealously put forth his utmost exertions. </p>                        </div>

With these words and others like them he briefly exhorted his officers, and in return was exhorted by them to feel confidence in their valour. He then ordered the soldiers to take dinner and to rest themselves. It is said that <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a> came to him in his tent, and urged him to make a night attack on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>; saying that thus he would fall upon them unprepared and in a state of confusion, and at the same time more liable to a panic in the dark. But the reply which he made, as others were listening to their conversation, was, that it would be mean to steal a victory, and that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ought to conquer in open daylight, and without any artifice. This vaunting did not appear any arrogance on his part, but rather to indicate self-confidence amid dangers. To me at any rate, he seems to have used correct reasoning in such a matter. For in the night many accidents have occurred unexpectedly to those who were sufficiently prepared for battle as well as to those who were deficiently prepared, which have caused the superior party to fail in their plans, and have handed the victory over to the inferior party, contrary to the expectations of both sides. Though <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was generally fond of encountering danger in battle, the night appeared to him perilous; and, besides, if <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> were again defeated, a furtive and nocturnal attack on the part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> would relieve him of the necessity of confessing that he was an inferior general and commanded inferior troops. Moreover, if any unexpected defeat befell his army, the circumjacent country was friendly to the enemy, and they were acquainted with the locality, whereas the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> were unacquainted with it, and surrounded by nothing but foes, of whom there were a great number prisoners. These would be a great source of anxiety, as they would be likely to assist in attacking them in the night, not only if they should meet with defeat, but even if they did not appear to be gaining a decisive victory. For this way of reasoning I commend <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; and I think him no less worthy of admiration for his excessive desire to fight in open daylight. </p>                        </div>

Thus had <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> arranged matters on the right wing.

Next stood the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417265ROdr class=demonym long=26.5 lat=41.7>Odrysian</a> cavalry, under the command of <a href=/people/2032 target=_blank>Agatho</a>, son of <a href=/people/8468 target=_blank>Tyrimmas</a>. In this part, in front of all, were posted the auxiliary cavalry of the Grecian mercenaries, under the direction of <a href=/people/1040 target=_blank>Andromachus</a>, son of <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hiero</a>. Near the baggage the infantry from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> were posted as a guard. The whole of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s army numbered 7,000 cavalry and about 40,000 infantry. </p>                        </div>

Then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> cavalry rode along the line, and came into conflict with the front men of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s array; but he nevertheless still continued to march towards the right, and almost entirely got beyond the ground which had been cleared and levelled by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>. Then <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, fearing that his chariots would become useless, if the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> advanced into uneven ground, ordered the front ranks of his left wing to ride round the right wing of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, where <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was commanding, to prevent him from marching his wing any further. This being done, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ordered the cavalry of the Grecian mercenaries under the command of <a href=/people/3631 target=_blank>Menidas</a> to attack them. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> cavalry and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=ethnic long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrians</a>, who had been drawn up with them sallied forth against them, and being much more numerous they put the small body of Greeks to rout. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> then ordered <a href=/people/884 target=_blank>Aristo</a> at the head of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415220RPai class=ethnic long=22.01 lat=41.5>Paeonians</a> and Grecian auxiliaries to attack the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>; and the barbarians gave way. But the rest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=ethnic long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrians</a> drawing near to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415220RPai class=ethnic long=22.01 lat=41.5>Paeonians</a> and Grecian auxiliaries, caused their own comrades who were already in flight to turn and renew the battle; and thus they brought about a general cavalry engagement, in which many of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s men fell, not only being overwhelmed by the multitude of the barbarians, but also because the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> themselves and their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> were much more completely protected with armour for guarding their bodies. Notwithstanding this, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> sustained their assaults, and assailing them violently squadron by squadron, they succeeded in pushing them out of rank. Meantime the foreigners launched their scythe-bearing chariots against <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself, for the purpose of throwing his phalanx into confusion; but in this they were grievously deceived. For as soon as some of them approached, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a> and the javelin-men with <a href=/people/2498 target=_blank>Balacrus</a>, who had been posted in front of the Companion cavalry, hurled their javelins at them; others they seized by the reins and pulled the drivers off, and standing round the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> killed them. Yet some rolled right through the ranks; for the men stood apart and opened their ranks, as they had been instructed, in the places where the chariots assaulted them. In this way it generally happened that the chariots passed through safely, and the men by whom they were driven were uninjured. But these also were afterwards overpowered by the grooms of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s army and by the royal shield-bearing guards. </p>                        </div>

But when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> had made a break in the front line of their army, in consequence of the cavalry sallying forth to assist those who were surrounding the right wing, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> wheeled round towards the gap, and forming a wedge as it were of the Companion cavalry and of the part of the phalanx which was posted here, he led them with a quick charge and loud battle-cry straight towards <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> himself. For a short time there ensued a hand-to-hand fight; but when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> cavalry, commanded by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself, pressed on vigorously, thrusting themselves against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and striking their faces with their spears, and when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> phalanx in dense array and bristling with long pikes had also made an attack upon them, all things at once appeared full of terror to <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, who had already long been in a state of fear, so that he was the first to turn and flee. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> also who were riding round the wing were seized with alarm when <a href=/people/5455 target=_blank>Aretes</a> made a vigorous attack upon them. In this quarter indeed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> took to speedy flight; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> followed up the fugitives and slaughtered them. <a href=/people/386 target=_blank>Simmias</a> and his brigade were not yet able to start with <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> in pursuit, but causing the phalanx to halt there, he took part in the struggle, because the left wing of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> was reported to be hard pressed. In this part of the field, their line being broken, some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> and of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> cavalry burst through the gap towards the baggage of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>; and there the action became desperate. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> fell boldly on the men, who were most of them unarmed, and never expected that any men would cut through the double phalanx and break through upon them. When the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> made this attack, the foreign prisoners also assisted them by falling upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> in the midst of the action. But the commanders of the men who had been posted as a reserve to the first phalanx, learning what was taking place, quickly moved from the position which they had been ordered to take, and coming upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> in the rear, killed many of them there collected round the baggage. But the rest of them gave way and fled. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> on the right wing, who had not yet become aware of the flight of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, rode round <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s left wing and attacked <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a> in flank. </p>                        </div>

When this news was brought to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, he immediately turned back again from the pursuit, and wheeling round with the Companion cavalry, led them with great speed against the right wing of the foreigners. In the first place he assaulted the fleeing cavalry of the enemy, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, and the most numerous and the bravest division of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>. Then ensued the most obstinately contested cavalry fight in the whole engagement. For being drawn up by squadrons as it were, the foreigners wheeled round and falling on <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s men face to face, they no longer relied on the hurling of javelins or the dexterous deploying of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, as is the common practice in cavalry battles, but every one on his own account strove eagerly to break through what stood in his way, as if this were their only means of safety. They struck and were struck without quarter, as if they were no longer struggling to secure the victory for another, but were contending for their own personal safety. Here about sixty of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s Companions fell; and <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> himself, as well as <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> and <a href=/people/3631 target=_blank>Menidas</a>, was wounded. But even these troops were overcome by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; and as many of them as could force their way through his ranks fled with all their might. And now <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had nearly come into conflict with the enemy's right wing, but in the meantime the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> cavalry in a splendid struggle, had not fallen short of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s success in the engagement. For the foreigners on the right wing were already beginning to fly when he came on the scene of conflict; so that he wheeled round again and started off in pursuit of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> once more, keeping up the chase as long as there was daylight. <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a>'s brigade also followed in pursuit of those who were opposed to them. But <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> crossed the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360435WLyk class=place long=43.4882 lat=36.042>Lycus</a> and pitched his camp there, to give his men and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> a little rest; while <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a> seized the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> camp with their baggage, elephants, and <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a>. After giving his horsemen rest until midnight, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> again advanced by a forced march towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362440UArb class=place long=44.009 lat=36.191>Arbela</a>, with the hope of seizing <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> there, together with his money and the rest of his royal property. He reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362440UArb class=place long=44.009 lat=36.191>Arbela</a> the next day, having pursued altogether about 600 stades from the battle-field. But as <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> went on fleeing without taking any rest, he did not find him at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362440UArb class=place long=44.009 lat=36.191>Arbela</a>. However the money and all the other property were captured, as was also the chariot of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>. His spear and bow were likewise taken, as had been the case after the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368362UIss class=place long=36.216 lat=36.752>Issus</a>. Of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s men about 100 were killed, and more than 1,000 of his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> were lost either from wounds or from fatigue in the pursuit, nearly half of them belonging to the Companion cavalry. Of the foreigners there were said to have been about 300,000 slain, and far more were taken prisoners than were killed. The elephants and all the chariots which had not been destroyed in the battle were also captured. Such was the result of this battle, which was fought in the archonship of <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, in the month <a href=/people/2658 target=_blank>Pyanepsion</a>; and thus <a href=/people/1772 target=_blank>Aristander</a>'s prediction was accomplished, that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> would both fight a battle and gain a victory in the same month in which the moon was seen to be eclipsed. </p>                        </div>

He then appointed <a href=/people/2170 target=_blank>Mazaeus</a> viceroy of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a>, <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408238PAmp class=person long=23.847 lat=40.822>Amphipolitan</a> general of the soldiers who were left behind with <a href=/people/2170 target=_blank>Mazaeus</a>, and <a href=/people/1585 target=_blank>Asclepiodorus</a>, son of <a href=/people/486 target=_blank>Philo</a>, collector of the revenue.

He then marched away to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus class=place long=48.247 lat=32.191>Susa</a>; and on the way he was met by the son of the viceroy of the Susians, and a man bearing a letter from <a href=/people/489 target=_blank>Philoxenus</a>, whom he had despatched to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus class=place long=48.247 lat=32.191>Susa</a> directly after the battle. In the letter <a href=/people/489 target=_blank>Philoxenus</a> had written that the Susians had surrendered their city to him, and that all the money was safe for <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. In twenty days the king arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus class=place long=48.247 lat=32.191>Susa</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>; and entering the city he took possession of the money, which amounted to 50,000 talents, as well as the rest of the royal property. Many other things were also captured there, which <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> brought with him from Greece, especially the brazen <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237AHaA class=place long=23.7234 lat=37.97513>statues</a> of <a href=/people/600 target=_blank>Harmodius</a> and <a href=/people/496 target=_blank>Aristogeiton</a>.

He also established two companies in each squadron of cavalry, whereas before this time companies did not exist in the cavalry; and over them he set as captains those of the Companions who were pre-eminent for merit. </p>                        </div>

Some of these people who inhabit the plains were under the rule of the viceroy of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, and on this occasion surrendered to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; but those who are called the mountaineers were not in subjection to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, and at this time sent word to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> that they would not permit him to march with his forces into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persis</a>, unless they received from him as much as they were in the habit of receiving from the king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> for the passage through their mountains. He sent the messengers back with instructions to come to the defiles, the possession of which made them think that the passage into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persis</a> was in their power, promising them that they should there receive from him the prescribed toll. He then took the royal body-guards, the shield-bearing infantry, and 8,000 men from the rest of his army, and, under the guidance of the Susians, marched by night along a different road from the frequented one. Advancing by a route rough and difficult, on the same day he fell upon the villages of the Uxians, where he captured much booty and killed many of the people while still in their beds; but others escaped into the mountains. He then made a forced march to the defiles, where the Uxians resolved to meet him in mass in order to receive the prescribed toll. But he had already previously despatched <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> to seize the heights, to which he thought the Uxians would retire if they were repelled by force; and he himself went, with great celerity, and got possession of the pass before their arrival. He then drew up his men in battle array, and led them from the higher and more commanding position against the barbarians. They, being alarmed at <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s celerity, and finding themselves deprived by stratagem of the position in which they had especially confided, took to flight without ever coming to close combat. Some of them were killed by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s men in their flight, and many lost their lives by falling over the precipices along the road; but most of them fled up into the mountains for refuge, and falling in with <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a>, were destroyed by his men. Having received these gifts of honour from <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, they with difficulty, after much entreaty, procured from him the privilege of retaining possession of their own land on condition of paying him an annual tribute. <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, says that the mother of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, on their behalf, entreated <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> to grant them the privilege of inhabiting the land. The tribute agreed upon was a hundred <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, five hundred <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, and 30,000 <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> a year; for the Uxians had no money, nor was their country fit for tillage; but most of them were shepherds and herdsmen. </p>                        </div>

He himself took the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> infantry, the Companion cavalry, the light cavalry used for skirmishing, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>, and the archers, and made a forced march through the mountains. But when he arrived at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> Gates, he found that <a href=/people/642 target=_blank>Ariobarzanes</a>, the viceroy of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persis</a>, with 40,000 infantry and 700 cavalry, had built a wall across the pass, and had pitched his camp there near the wall to block <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s passage. Then indeed he pitched his camp there; but next day he marshalled his army, and led it up to the wall. When it was evident that it would be difficult to capture it on account of the rugged nature of the ground, and as many of his men were being wounded, the enemy assailing them with missiles from engines of war placed upon higher ground, which gave them an advantage over their assailants, he retreated to his camp. He was informed by the prisoners that they could lead him round by another route, so that he might get to the other end of the pass; but when he ascertained that this road was rough and narrow, he left <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> there at the camp with his own brigade and that of <a href=/people/315 target=_blank>Meleager</a>, as well as a few archers and 500 cavalry, with orders that when he perceived he had got right round and was approaching the camp of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> (which he could easily perceive, because the trumpets would give him the signal), he should then assault the wall. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> advanced by night, and travelling about 100 stades, he took the shield-bearing guards, the brigade of <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a>, the lightest armed of the archers, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>, the royal squadron of cavalry Companions, and one regiment of cavalry besides these, containing four companies; and wheeling round with these troops, he marched towards the pass in the direction the prisoners led him. He ordered <a href=/people/246 target=_blank>Amyntas</a>, <a href=/people/591 target=_blank>Philotas</a>, and <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> to lead the rest of the army towards the plain, and to make a bridge over the river which one must cross to go into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persis</a>. He himself went by a route difficult and rough, along which he nevertheless marched for the most part at full speed. Falling upon the first guard of the barbarians before daylight, he destroyed them, and so he did most of the second; but the majority of the third guard escaped, not indeed by fleeing into the camp of <a href=/people/642 target=_blank>Ariobarzanes</a>, but into the mountains as they were, being seized with a sudden panic. Consequently He fell upon the enemy's camp at the approach of dawn without being observed. At the very time he began to assault the trench, the trumpets gave the signal to <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a>, who at once attacked the advanced fortification. The enemy then, being in a state of confusion from being attacked on all sides, fled without coming to close conflict; but they were hemmed in on all hands, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> pressing upon them in one direction and the men of <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> running up in another. Therefore most of them were compelled to wheel round and flee into the fortifications, which were already in the hands of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>. For <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, expecting the very thing which really occurred, had left <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> there with three thousand infantry; so that most of the barbarians were cut to pieces by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> at close quarters. Others perished in the terrible flight which ensued, hurling themselves over the precipices; but <a href=/people/642 target=_blank>Ariobarzanes</a> himself, with a few horsemen, escaped into the mountains. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> now marched back with all speed to the river, and finding the bridge already constructed over it, he easily crossed with his army. Thence he again continued his march to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/299529PPer class=place long=52.8909 lat=29.9352>Persepolis</a>, so that he arrived before the guards of the city could pillage the treasury. He also captured the money which was at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/302532UPas class=place long=53.1672 lat=30.1939>Pasargadae</a> in the treasury of the first <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, and appointed <a href=/people/6811 target=_blank>Phrasaortes</a>, son of <a href=/people/5226 target=_blank>Rheomithres</a>, viceroy over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>. He burnt down the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> palace, though <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a> advised him to preserve it, for many reasons, and especially because it was not well to destroy what was now his own property, and because the men of Asia would not by this course of action be induced to come over to him, thinking that he himself had decided not to retain the rule of Asia, but only to conquer it and depart. But <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> said that he wished to take vengeance on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, in retaliation for their deeds in the invasion of Greece, when they razed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> to the ground and burnt down the temples. He also desired to punish the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> for all the other injuries they had done the Greeks. But <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> does not seem to me to have acted on this occasion with prudence; nor do I think that this was any retributive penalty at all on the ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>. </p>                        </div>

When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348485UEcb class=place long=48.5166 lat=34.8054>Ecbatana</a>, he sent the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> cavalry and the other Grecian allies back to the sea, paying them the full hire which had been stipulated, and making them an additional donation from himself of 2,000 talents. He issued an order that if any man of his own accord wished still to continue to serve for hire with him, he should enlist; and those who enlisted in his service were not a few. He then ordered Epocillus, son of Polyeides, to conduct the rest down to the sea, taking other cavalry as a guard for them, since the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> sold their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> there.

He also sent word to <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a>, the commander of the royal squadron of cavalry, who had been left behind at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus class=place long=48.247 lat=32.191>Susa</a> ill, that when he arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348485UEcb class=place long=48.5166 lat=34.8054>Ecbatana</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus class=place long=48.247 lat=32.191>Susa</a> he should take the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> who had been left there in charge of the money, and go in the direction of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a>, where also he himself intended soon to arrive. </p>                        </div>

He nevertheless pressed on, and on the eleventh day arrived at Rhagae. This place is distant from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353522LCas class=place long=52.15 lat=35.2852>Caspian Gates</a> one day's journey to one marching as <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> did. But <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> had already passed through this defile before <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> came up, though many of those who were his companions in flight deserted him on the way and retired to their own abodes. Many also surrendered to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>.

These men informed him that <a href=/people/8008 target=_blank>Nabarzanes</a>, the commander of the cavalry which accompanied <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> in his flight, <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a>, viceroy of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=place long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactria</a>, and <a href=/people/6286 target=_blank>Barsaentes</a>, viceroy of the Arachotians and Drangians, had jointly arrested the king. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> heard this, he marched with still greater speed than ever, taking with him only the Companions and the skirmishing cavalry, as well as some of the foot-soldiers selected as the strongest and lightest men. He did not even wait for <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> to return from the foraging expedition; but placed <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> over the men left behind, with instructions to follow in short marches. His own men took with them nothing but their arms and provisions for two days. After marching the whole night and till noon of the next day, he gave his army a short rest, then went on again all night, and when day began to break reached the camp from which Bagistanes had set out to meet him; but he did not catch the enemy. However, in regard to <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, he ascertained that he had been arrested and was being conveyed in a covered carriage; that <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> possessed the command instead of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, and had been nominated leader by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=demonym long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrian</a> cavalry and all the other barbarians who were companions of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> in his flight, except <a href=/people/667 target=_blank>Artabazus</a> and his sons, together with the Grecian mercenaries, who still remained faithful to <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>; but they, not being able to prevent what was being done, had turned aside their march from the public thoroughfare and were marching towards the mountains by themselves, refusing to take part with <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> and his adherents in their enterprise. He also learnt that those who had arrested <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> had come to the decision to surrender him to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, and to procure some advantage for themselves, if they should find that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was pursuing them; but if they should learn that he had gone back again, they had resolved to collect as large an army as they could and to preserve the rule for the commonwealth. He also ascertained that for the present <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> held the supreme command, both on account of his relationship to <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> and because the war was being carried on in his viceregal province. Hearing this, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> thought it was advisable to pursue with all his might; and though his men and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> were already quite fatigued by the incessant severity of their labours, he nevertheless proceeded, and, travelling a long way all through the night and the next day till noon, arrived at a certain village, where those who were leading <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> had encamped the day before. Hearing there that the barbarians had decided to continue their march by night, he inquired of the natives if they knew any shorter road to the fugitives. They said they did know one, but that it ran through a country which was desert through lack of water. He nevertheless ordered them to show him this way, and perceiving that the infantry could not keep up with him if he marched at full speed, he caused 500 of the cavalry to dismount from their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>; and selecting the officers of the infantry and the best of the other foot-soldiers, he ordered them to mount the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> armed just as they were. He also directed <a href=/people/401 target=_blank>Nicanor</a>, the commander of the shield-bearing guards, and <a href=/people/90 target=_blank>Attalus</a>, commander of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>, to lead their men who were left behind, by the same route which <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> had taken, having equipped them as lightly as possible; and he ordered that the rest of the infantry should follow in regular marching order. He himself began to march in the afternoon, and led the way with great rapidity. Having travelled 400 stades in the night, he came upon the barbarians just before daybreak, going along without any order and unarmed; so that few of them rushed to defend themselves, but most of them, as soon as they saw <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself, took to flight without even coming to blows. A few of those who turned to resist being killed, the rest of these also took to flight. Up to this time <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> and his adherents were still conveying <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> with them in a covered carriage; but when <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was already close upon their heels <a href=/people/8008 target=_blank>Nabarzanes</a> and <a href=/people/6286 target=_blank>Barsaentes</a> wounded him and left him there, and with 600 horsemen took to flight. <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> died from his wounds soon after, before <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had seen him. </p>                        </div>

This king was a man pre-eminently effeminate and lacking in self-reliance in military enterprises; but as to civil matters he never exhibited any disposition to indulge in arbitrary conduct; nor indeed was it in his power to exhibit it. For it happened that he was involved in a war with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> and Greeks at the very time he succeeded to the regal power; and consequently it was no longer possible for him to act the tyrant towards his subjects, even if he had been so inclined, standing as he did in greater danger than they. As long as he lived, one misfortune after another was accumulated upon him; nor did he experience any cessation of calamity from the time when he first succeeded to the rule. At the beginning of his reign the cavalry defeat was sustained by his viceroys at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403273WGra class=place long=27.2716 lat=40.3067>Granicus</a>, and forthwith <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390271RAio class=place long=27.1 lat=39>Aeolis</a>, both the <a href=/people/4660 target=_blank>Phrygias</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a>, and all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=place long=28.7 lat=37.01>Caria</a> except <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal class=place long=27.4238 lat=37.0323>Halicarnassus</a> were occupied by his foe; soon after, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal class=place long=27.4238 lat=37.0323>Halicarnassus</a> also was captured, as well as all the littoral as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>. Then came his own discomfiture at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368362UIss class=place long=36.216 lat=36.752>Issus</a>, where he saw his mother, wife, and children taken prisoners.

After this, wandering as an exile from his own dominions, he died after being betrayed by his personal attendants to the worst treatment possible, being at the same time king and a prisoner ignominiously led in chains; and at last he perished through a conspiracy formed of those most intimately acquainted with him. Such were the misfortunes that befell <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> in his lifetime; but after his death he received a royal burial; his children received from <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> a princely rearing and education, just as if their father had still been king; and <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself became his son-in-law.

On one side it is bounded by lofty mountains densely covered with wood, and on the other it is a plain stretching as far as the Great Sea in this part of the world. He led his army by this route, because he ascertained that the Grecian mercenaries serving under <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> had succeeded in escaping by it into the mountains of <a href=/people/3472 target=_blank>Tapuria</a>; at the same time he resolved to subdue the Tapurians themselves. Having divided his army into three parts, he himself led the way by the shortest and most difficult route, at the head of the most numerous and at the same time the lightest division of his forces.

To <a href=/people/1365 target=_blank>Autophradates</a> he restored his viceregal office; but <a href=/people/667 target=_blank>Artabazus</a> and his sons he kept near himself in a position of honour, both on account of their fidelity to <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> and because they were among the first nobles of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>. To the envoys from the Greeks, begging him to make a truce with them on behalf of the whole mercenary force, he replied that he would not make any agreement with them; because they were acting with great guilt in serving as soldiers on the side of the barbarians against Greece, in contravention of the resolution of the Greeks. He commanded them to come in a body and surrender, leaving it to him to treat them as he pleased, or to preserve themselves as best they could. The envoys said that they yielded both themselves and their comrades to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, and urged him to send some one with them to act as their leader, so that they might be conducted to him with safety. They said they were 1,500 in number. Accordingly he sent <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronicus</a>, son of Agerrhus, and <a href=/people/667 target=_blank>Artabazus</a> to them. </p>                        </div>

Traversing the greater part of the land of the Mardians, he killed many of them in their flight, some indeed having turned to defend themselves; and many were taken prisoners. No one for a long time had invaded their land in a hostile manner, not only on account of its ruggedness, but also because the people were poor, and besides being poor were warlike. Therefore they never feared that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> would attack them, especially as he had already advanced further than their country. For this reason they were caught more easily off their guard. Many of them, however, escaped into the mountains, which in their land are very lofty and craggy, thinking that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> would not penetrate to these at any rate. But when he was approaching them even here, they sent envoys to surrender both the people and their land to him. He pardoned them, and appointed <a href=/people/1365 target=_blank>Autophradates</a>, whom he had also recently placed over the Tapurians, viceroy over them.

An obstinately contested battle then took place between the troops of <a href=/people/2739 target=_blank>Erigyius</a> and <a href=/people/1379 target=_blank>Caranus</a> and those of <a href=/people/2442 target=_blank>Satibarzanes</a>; nor did the barbarians give way until <a href=/people/2442 target=_blank>Satibarzanes</a>, encountering <a href=/people/2739 target=_blank>Erigyius</a>, was struck in the face with a spear and killed. Then the barbarians gave way and fled with headlong speed. Meantime <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was leading his army towards Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>, where he founded a city and named it Alexandreia. Having offered sacrifice here to the gods to whom it was his custom to sacrifice, he crossed Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>, after appointing Proexes, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, viceroy over the land, and leaving Neiloxenus son of <a href=/people/397 target=_blank>Satyrus</a>, one of the Companions, with an army as superintendent. According to the account of <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a>, Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a> is as lofty as any in Asia, and most of it is bare, at any rate in that part where <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> crossed it. This range of mountains stretches out so far that they say even that Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a>, which forms the boundary of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=place long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylia</a>, springs from it, as do other great ranges which have been distinguished from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a> by various names according to the position of each. <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> says that in this part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a> nothing grew except terebinth trees and silphium; notwithstanding which, it was inhabited by many people, and many <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> graze there; because <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> are very fond of silphium. For if a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> smells it even from a distance, it runs to it and feeds upon the flower. They also dig up the root, which is devoured by the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>. For this reason in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a>, some drive their flocks as far as possible away from the places where their silphium is growing; others even enclose the place with a fence, so that even if the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> should approach it they would not be able to get within the enclosure. For the silphium is very valuable to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=ethnic long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrenaeans</a>. <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a>, accompanied by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> who had taken part with him in the seizure of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, and by 7,000 of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=ethnic long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrians</a> themselves and the Daans who dwelt on this side the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/473393WTan class=place long=39.336 lat=47.268>Tanais</a>, was laying waste the country at the foot of Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>, in order to prevent <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> from marching any further, both by the desolation of the land between the enemy and himself and by the lack of provisions. But none the less did <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> keep up the march, though with difficulty, both on account of the deep snow and from the want of necessaries; but yet he persevered in his journey. When <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> was informed that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was now not far off, he crossed the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372673WOxu class=place long=67.2653 lat=37.1923>Oxus</a>, and having burnt the boats upon which he had crossed, he withdrew to <a href=/people/8020 target=_blank>Nautaca</a> in the land of <a href=/people/5978 target=_blank>Sogdiana</a>. He was followed by <a href=/people/1793 target=_blank>Spitamenes</a> and <a href=/people/1954 target=_blank>Oxyartes</a>, with the cavalry from <a href=/people/5978 target=_blank>Sogdiana</a>, as well as by the Daans from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/473393WTan class=place long=39.336 lat=47.268>Tanais</a>. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=demonym long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrian</a> cavalry, perceiving that <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> had resolved to take to flight, all dispersed in various directions to their own abodes. </p>                        </div>

These he took at the first assault; and left a garrison in the citadel of Aornus, over which he placed <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> son of <a href=/people/10996 target=_blank>Androcles</a>, one of the Companions. He appointed <a href=/people/667 target=_blank>Artabazus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=person long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, viceroy over the rest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=ethnic long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrians</a>, who were easily reduced to submission. Then he marched towards the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372673WOxu class=place long=67.2653 lat=37.1923>Oxus</a>, which flows from mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>, and is the largest of all the rivers in Asia which <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and his army reached, except the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> rivers; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> rivers are the largest in the world. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372673WOxu class=place long=67.2653 lat=37.1923>Oxus</a> discharges its water into the great sea which is near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370546RHyr class=place long=54.6 lat=37>Hyrcania</a>. When he attempted to cross the river it appeared altogether impassable; for its breadth was about six stades, and its depth was much greater than the proportion of its breadth. The bed of the river was sandy, and the stream so rapid, that stakes fixed deep into the bottom were easily rooted up from the earth by the mere force of the current, inasmuch as they could not be securely fixed in the sand. Besides this, there was a scarcity of timber in the locality, and he thought it would take a long time and cause great delay, if they brought from a distance the materials needful for making a bridge over the river. Therefore he collected the skins which the soldiers used for tent-coverings, and ordered them to be filled with chaff as dry as possible, and tied and stitched tightly together, so that the water might not penetrate into them. When these were filled and stitched together, they were sufficient to convey the army across in five days. But before he crossed the river, he selected the oldest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, who were now unfit for military service, and such of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> as had volunteered to remain in the army, and sent them back home. He then dispatched <a href=/people/2939 target=_blank>Stasanor</a>, one of the Companions, into the land of the Areians, with instructions to arrest <a href=/people/1988 target=_blank>Arsames</a>, the viceroy of that people, because he thought him disaffected, and to assume the office of viceroy of <a href=/people/2692 target=_blank>Areia</a> himself. After passing over the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372673WOxu class=place long=67.2653 lat=37.1923>Oxus</a>, he made a forced march to the place where he heard that <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> was with his forces; but at this time messengers reached him from <a href=/people/1793 target=_blank>Spitamenes</a> and <a href=/people/6417 target=_blank>Dataphernes</a>, to announce that they would arrest <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> and hand him over to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> if he would send to them a small army and a commander for it; since even at that very time they were holding him under guard, though they had not bound him with fetters. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> heard this, he gave his army rest, and marched more slowly than before. But he despatched <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, at the head of three troops of the Companion cavalry and all the horse-lancers, and of the infantry, the brigade of <a href=/people/591 target=_blank>Philotas</a>, one regiment of 1,000 shield-bearing guards, all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>, and half the archers, with orders to make a forced march to <a href=/people/1793 target=_blank>Spitamenes</a> and <a href=/people/6417 target=_blank>Dataphernes</a>. <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> went according to his instructions, and completing ten days' march in four days, arrived at the camp where on the preceding day the barbarians under <a href=/people/1793 target=_blank>Spitamenes</a> had bivouacked. </p>                        </div>

He therefore left the infantry behind with orders to follow him in regular order, and advanced with the cavalry till he arrived at a certain village, where <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> was with a few soldiers; for <a href=/people/1793 target=_blank>Spitamenes</a> and his party had already retired from thence, being ashamed to betray <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> themselves. <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> posted his cavalry right round the village, which was enclosed by a wall supplied with gates. He then issued a proclamation to the barbarians in the village, that they would be allowed to depart uninjured if they surrendered <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> to him. They accordingly admitted <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> and his men into the village. He then seized <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> and departed; but sent a messenger on before to ask <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> how he was to conduct <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> into his presence. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ordered him to bind the prisoner naked in a wooden collar, and thus to lead him and place him on the right-hand side of the road along which he was about to march with the army. Thus did <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> saw <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a>, he caused his chariot to stop, and asked him, for what reason he had in the first place arrested <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, his own king, who was also his kinsman and benefactor, and then led him as a prisoner in chains, and at last killed him? <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> said that he was not the only person who had decided to do this, but that it was the joint act of those who were at the time in attendance upon <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, with the view of procuring safety for themselves from <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. For this <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ordered that he should be scourged, and that the herald should repeat the very same reproaches which he had himself made to <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> in his inquiry. After being thus disgracefully tortured, he was sent away to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=place long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactria</a> to be put to death.

The perpetrators of this deed escaped to a mountain, which was very rugged and precipitous on all sides. In number they were about 30,000. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> took the lightest men in his army and marched against these. Then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> made many ineffectual assaults upon the mountain. At first they were beaten back by the missiles of the barbarians, and many of them were wounded, including <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself, who was shot right through the leg with an arrow, and the fibula of his leg was broken. Notwithstanding this, he captured the place, and some of the barbarians were cut to pieces there by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, while many also cast themselves down from the rocks and perished; so that out of 30,000 not more than 8,000 were preserved. </p>                        </div>

Moreover he thought that the city would become great, both by reason of the multitude of those who would join in colonizing it, and on account of the celebrity of the name conferred upon it. Meantime the barbarians dwelling near the river seized upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> soldiers who were garrisoning their cities and killed them; after which they began to strengthen the cities for their greater security.

These men were so energetic that they even induced some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=ethnic long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrians</a> to join in the rebellion, either because they were afraid of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, or because their seducers assigned as a reason for their revolt, that he had sent instructions to the rulers of that land to assemble for a conference at <a href=/people/3278 target=_blank>Zariaspa</a>, the chief city; which conference, they said, would be for no good purpose. </p>                        </div>

He then started from the camp and advanced to the nearest city, the name of which was <a about=https://topostext.org/place/315344UGaz class=place long=34.432 lat=31.523>Gaza</a>; for the barbarians of the land were said to have fled for refuge into seven cities. He sent <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> to the one called <a href=/people/7568 target=_blank>Cyropolis</a>, the largest of them all, into which most of the barbarians had gathered. The orders of <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> were to encamp near the city, to dig a trench round it, to surround it with a stockade, and to fix together the military engines which were required for use, so that the men in this city, having had their attention drawn to his forces, might be unable to render aid to the other cities. As soon as <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/315344UGaz class=place long=34.432 lat=31.523>Gaza</a>, without any delay he gave the signal to his men to place the ladders against the wall all round and to take it by assault at once, as it was made merely of earth and was not at all high. Simultaneously with the assault of the infantry, his slingers, archers, and javelin-throwers assailed the defenders on the wall, and missiles were hurled from the military engines, so that the wall was quickly cleared of its defenders by the multitude of the missiles. Then the fixing of the ladders against the wall and the mounting of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> were matters soon effected. They killed all the men, according to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s injunctions; but the women, the children, and the rest of the booty they carried off as plunder. Thence he immediately marched to the city situated next to that one; and this he took in the same way and on the same day, treating the captives in the same manner. Then he marched against the third city, and took it on the next day at the first assault. While he was thus occupied by these matters with the infantry, he sent out his cavalry to the two neighbouring cities, with orders to guard the men within them closely, so that when they heard of the capture of the neighbouring cities, and at the same time of his own near approach, they should not betake themselves to flight and render it impossible for him to pursue them. It turned out just as he had conjectured; and his despatch of the cavalry was made just at the nick of time. For when the barbarians who occupied the two cities still uncaptured, saw the smoke rising from the city in front of them which was then on fire, (and some men, escaping even from the midst of the calamity itself, became the reporters of the capture which they had themselves witnessed,) they began to flee in crowds out of the cities as fast as each man could; but falling in with the dense body of cavalry drawn up in array of battle, most of them were cut to pieces. </p>                        </div>

It was fortified with a wall higher than those of the others, as it had been founded by <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>. The majority of the barbarians of this district, and at the same time the most warlike of them, had fled for refuge thither, and consequently it was not possible for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> to capture it so easily at the first assault. Wherefore <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> brought his military engines up to the wall with the determination of battering it down in this way, and of making assaults wherever breaches might be made in it. When he observed that the channel of the river, which flows through the city when it is swollen by the winter rains, was at that time nearly dry and did not reach up to the wall, and would thus afford his soldiers a passage by which to penetrate into the city, he took the body-guards, the shield-bearing guards, the archers, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>, and made his way secretly into the city along the channel, at first with a few men, while the barbarians had turned their attention towards the military engines and those who were assailing them in that quarter. Having from within broken open the gates which were opposite this position, he gave an easy admittance to the rest of his soldiers. Then the barbarians, though they perceived that their city was already in the hands of the enemy, nevertheless turned against <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and his men and made a desperate assault upon them, in which <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself received a violent blow on the head and neck with a stone, and <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> was wounded with an arrow, as were also many other officers. Notwithstanding this, however, they drove the barbarians out of the market-place. Meantime, those who had made the assault upon the wall, took it, as it was now void of defenders. In the first capture of the city about 8,000 of the enemy were killed. The rest fled for refuge into the citadel; for 15,000 warriors in all had gathered together in the city. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> encamped around these and besieged them for one day, and then they surrendered through lack of water. The seventh city he took at the first assault. <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> says that the men in it surrendered; but <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> asserts that this city was also taken by storm, and that he slew all who were captured therein. <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> also says that he distributed the men among the army and ordered that they should be kept guarded in chains until he should depart from the country, so that none of those who had effected the revolt should be left behind. Meantime an army of the Asiatic <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> arrived at the bank of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/473393WTan class=place long=39.336 lat=47.268>Tanais</a>, because most of them had heard that some of the barbarians on the opposite side of the river had revolted from <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. They intended to attack the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, if any revolutionary movement worthy of consideration were effected. News was also brought that <a href=/people/1793 target=_blank>Spitamenes</a> was besieging the men who had been left in the citadel at <a href=/people/3880 target=_blank>Maracanda</a>. Against him <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> then despatched <a href=/people/1040 target=_blank>Andromachus</a>, <a href=/people/707 target=_blank>Menedemus</a>, and <a href=/people/1379 target=_blank>Caranus</a> with sixty of the Companion cavalry, 800 of the mercenary cavalry under the command of <a href=/people/1379 target=_blank>Caranus</a>, and 1,500 mercenary infantry.

He then offered sacrifice to the gods in his customary manner and celebrated an equestrian and gymnastic contest. When he saw that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> were not retiring from the river's bank, but were seen to be shooting arrows into the river, which was not wide here, and were uttering audacious words in their barbaric tongue to insult <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, to the effect that he durst not touch <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, or if he did, he would learn what was the difference between them and the Asiatic barbarians, he was irritated by these remarks, and having resolved to cross over against them, he began to prepare the skins for the passage of the river. But when he offered sacrifice with a view to crossing, the victims proved to be unfavourable; and though he was vexed at this, he nevertheless controlled himself and remained where he was. But as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> did not desist from their insults, he again offered sacrifice with a view to crossing; and <a href=/people/1772 target=_blank>Aristander</a> told him that the omens still portended danger to himself. But <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> said that it was better for him to come into extreme danger than that, after having subdued almost the whole of Asia, he should be a laughing-stock to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, as <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, the father of <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, had been in days of yore. <a href=/people/1772 target=_blank>Aristander</a> refused to explain the will of the gods contrary to the revelations made by the deity simply because <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> wished to hear the contrary. When the skins had been prepared for the passage, and the army, fully equipped, had been posted near the river, the military engines, at the signal pre-concerted, began to shoot at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> riding along the river's bank. Some of them were wounded by the missiles, and one was struck right through the wicker-shield and breastplate and fell from his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. The others, being alarmed at the discharge of missiles from so great a distance, and at the death of their champion, retreated a little from the bank. But <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, seeing them thrown into confusion by the effect of his missiles, began to cross the river with trumpets sounding, himself leading the way; and the rest of the army followed him. Having first got the archers and slingers across, he ordered them to sling and shoot at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, to prevent them approaching the phalanx of infantry stepping out of the water, until all his cavalry had passed over. When they were upon the bank in dense mass, he first of all launched against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> one regiment of the Grecian auxiliary cavalry and four squadrons of pike-men. These the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> received, and in great numbers riding round them in circles, wounded them, as they were few in number, themselves escaping with ease. But <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> mixed the archers, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>, and other light troops under the command of <a href=/people/2498 target=_blank>Balacrus</a>, with the cavalry, and then led them against the enemy. As soon as they came to close quarters, he ordered three regiments of the cavalry Companions and all the horse-lancers to charge them. The rest of the cavalry he himself led, and made a rapid attack with his squadrons in column. Accordingly the enemy were no longer able as before to wheel their cavalry force round in circles, for at one and the same time the cavalry and the light-armed infantry mixed with the horsemen pressed upon them, and did not permit them to wheel about in safety. Then the flight of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> was already apparent. 1,000 of them fell, including Satraces, one of their chiefs; and 150 were captured. But as the pursuit was keen and fatiguing on account of the excessive heat, the entire army was seized with thirst; and <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself while riding drank of such water as was procurable in that country. He was seized with an incessant diarrhoea; for the water was bad; and for this reason he could not pursue all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>. Otherwise I think all of them would have perished in the flight, if <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had not fallen ill. He was carried back to the camp, having fallen into extreme danger; and thus <a href=/people/1772 target=_blank>Aristander</a>'s prophecy was fulfilled. </p>                        </div>

They also assured him that their king was willing to obey the commands laid upon him. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> sent to him a courteous reply, because it did not seem honourable for him to abstain from marching against him if he distrusted him, and at that time there was not an convenient opportunity to do so. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> who were garrisoning the citadel at <a href=/people/3880 target=_blank>Maracanda</a>, when an assault was made upon it by <a href=/people/1793 target=_blank>Spitamenes</a> and his adherents, sallied forth, and killing some of the enemy and repulsing all the rest, retreated into the citadel without any loss. But when <a href=/people/1793 target=_blank>Spitamenes</a> was informed that the men despatched by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> to <a href=/people/3880 target=_blank>Maracanda</a> were now drawing near, he raised the siege of the citadel, and retired to the capital of <a href=/people/5978 target=_blank>Sogdiana</a>. <a href=/people/4658 target=_blank>Pharnuches</a> and the generals with him, being eager to drive him out altogether, followed him up as he was retreating towards the frontiers of <a href=/people/5978 target=_blank>Sogdiana</a>, and without due consideration made a joint attack upon the Nomad <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>. Then <a href=/people/1793 target=_blank>Spitamenes</a>, having received a reinforcement of 600 <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> horsemen, was further emboldened by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> alliance to wait and receive the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> who were advancing upon him. Posting his men in a level place near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> desert, he was not willing either to wait for the enemy or to attack them himself; but rode round and discharged arrows at the phalanx of infantry. When the forces of <a href=/people/4658 target=_blank>Pharnuches</a> made a charge upon them, they easily escaped, since at that time their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> were swifter and more vigorous, while the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> of <a href=/people/1040 target=_blank>Andromachus</a> had been damaged by the incessant marching, as well as by lack of fodder; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> pressed upon them with all their might whether they halted or retreated. Many of them then were wounded by the arrows, and some were killed. They therefore arranged the soldiers into the form of a square and proceeded to the river <a href=/people/6841 target=_blank>Polytimetus</a>, because there was a woody glen near it, and it would consequently no longer be easy for the barbarians to shoot arrows at them, and their infantry would be more useful to them. But <a href=/people/1379 target=_blank>Caranus</a>, the commander of the cavalry, without communicating with <a href=/people/1040 target=_blank>Andromachus</a>, attempted to cross the river in order to put the cavalry in a place of safety on the other side. The infantry followed him without any word of command; their descent into the river being made in a panic and without any discipline down the precipitous banks. When the barbarians perceived the error of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, they sprang into the ford here and there, <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and all. Some of them seized and held tight those who had already crossed and were departing; others being posted right in front of those who were crossing, rolled them over into the river; others shot arrows at them from the flanks; while others pressed upon the men who were just entering the water. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> being thus encompassed with difficulty on all sides, fled for refuge into one of the small islands in the river, where they were entirely surrounded by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> and the cavalry of <a href=/people/1793 target=_blank>Spitamenes</a>, and all killed with arrows, except a few of them, whom they reduced to slavery.

He also alleged that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> officers present were the king's Companions.

Returning thence, he laid the land waste, and slew the barbarians who had fled for refuge into the fortified places, because they were reported to have taken part in the attack upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>.

Other large and perennial rivers in that region disappear in a similar way: the Epardus, which flows through the land of the Mardians; the <a href=/people/2693 target=_blank>Areius</a>, after which the country of the Areians is named; and the Etymander, which flows through the territory of the <a href=/people/7662 target=_blank>Euergetae</a>.

Though it occurred a little while after this, it will not be out of place here. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> kept a day sacred to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, and on that day <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> used to offer sacrifice to him every year. But they say that on this occasion he was neglectful of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, and sacrificed to the <a href=/people/526 target=_blank>Dioscuri</a> instead; for he had resolved to offer sacrifice to those deities for some reason or other. When the drinking-party on this occasion had already gone on too long (for <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had now made innovations even in regard to drinking, by imitating the custom of foreigners), and in the midst of the carouse a discussion had arisen about the <a href=/people/526 target=_blank>Dioscuri</a>, how their procreation had been taken away from <a href=/people/362 target=_blank>Tyndareus</a> and ascribed to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, some of those present, in order to flatter <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, maintained that <a href=/people/327 target=_blank>Polydeuces</a> and <a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a> were in no way worthy to compare with him who had performed so many exploits. Such men have always corrupted the character of kings and will never cease to ruin the interests of those who happen to be reigning. In their carousal they did not even abstain from (comparing him with) <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>; saying that envy prevented the living from receiving the honours due to them from their associates. It was well known that <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a> had long been vexed at <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> for the change in his style of living in imitation of foreign kings, and at those who flattered him with their speech. At that time also, being heated with wine, he would not permit them either to insult the deity or, by depreciating the deeds of the ancient heroes, to confer upon <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> a gratification which deserved no thanks. He affirmed <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s deeds were neither in fact so great or marvellous as they represented in their laudation; nor had he achieved them by himself, but for the most part they were the deeds of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>. The delivery of this speech annoyed <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; and I do not commend it, for I think, in such a drunken bout, it would have been sufficient if, so far as he was personally concerned, he had kept silence, and not committed the error of indulging in the same flattery as the others. But when some even mentioned <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>'s actions without exercising a just judgment, declaring that he had performed nothing great or marvellous, they gratified <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; but <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a> being then no longer able to contain himself, began to put <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>'s achievements in the first rank, and to depreciate <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and his performances. <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a> being now quite intoxicated, made other insolent remarks and even greatly reviled him, because forsooth he had saved his life, when the cavalry battle had been fought with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403273WGra class=place long=27.2716 lat=40.3067>Granicus</a>. Then indeed, arrogantly stretching out his right hand, he said: This hand, O <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, preserved thee on that occasion. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> could now no longer endure the drunken insolence of <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a>; but jumped up against him in a great rage. He was however restrained by his boon-companions. As <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a> did not desist from his insulting remarks, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> shouted out a summons for his shield-bearing guards to attend him; but when no one obeyed him, he said that he was reduced to the same position as <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, when he was led about under arrest by <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> and his adherents, and that he now possessed the mere name of king. Then his companions were no longer able to restrain him; for according to some he leaped up and snatched a javelin from one of his confidential body-guards; according to others, a long pike from one of his ordinary guards, with which he struck <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a> and killed him. <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> does not say whence the drunken quarrel originated, but asserts that the fault was entirely on the side of <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a>, who, when <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had got so enraged with him as to jump up against him with the intention of making an end of him, was led away by <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, the confidential body-guard, through the gateway, beyond the wall and ditch of the citadel where the quarrel occurred. He adds that <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a> could not control himself, but went back again, and falling in with <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> who was calling out for <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a>, he exclaimed: <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, here is <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a>! Thereupon he was struck with a long pike and killed. </p>                        </div>

I think <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a> deserving of severe censure for his insolent behaviour to his king, while at the same time I pity <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> for his mishap, because on that occasion he showed himself the slave of two vices, anger and drunkenness, by neither of which is it seemly for a prudent man to be enslaved <br />But then on the other hand I think his subsequent behaviour worthy of praise, because directly after he had done the deed he recognised that it was a horrible one. Some of his biographers even say that he propped the pike against the wall with the intention of falling upon it himself, thinking that it was not proper for him to live who had killed his friend when under the influence of wine. Most historians do not mention this, but say that he went off to bed and lay there lamenting, calling <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a> himself by name, and his sister <a href=/people/9663 target=_blank>Lanice</a>, daughter of Dropidas, who had been his nurse. He exclaimed that having reached man's estate he had forsooth bestowed on her a noble reward for her care in rearing him, as she lived to see her own sons die fighting on his behalf, and the king slaying her brother with his own hand. He did not cease calling himself the murderer of his friends; and for three days rigidly abstained from food and drink, and paid no attention whatever to his personal appearance. Some of the soothsayers revealed that the avenging wrath of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> had been the cause of his conduct, because he had omitted the sacrifice to that deity. At last with great difficulty he was induced by his companions to touch food and to pay proper attention to His person. He then paid to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> the sacrifice due to him, since he was not at all unwilling to attribute the fatality rather to the avenging wrath of the deity than to his own depravity. I think <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> deserves great praise for this, that he did not obstinately persevere in evil, or still worse become a defender and advocate of the wrong which had been done, but confessed that he had committed a crime, being a man and not a god. There are some who say that <a href=/people/955 target=_blank>Anaxarchus</a> the Sophist was summoned into <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s presence to give him consolation. Finding him lying down and groaning, he laughed at him, and said that he did not know that the wise men of old for this reason made <a href=/people/194 target=_blank>Justice</a> an assessor of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, because whatever was done by him was justly done; and therefore also that which was done by the Great King ought to be deemed just, in the first place by the king himself, and then by the rest of men. They say that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was then greatly consoled by these remarks. But I assert that <a href=/people/955 target=_blank>Anaxarchus</a> did <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> a great injury and one still greater than that by which he was then oppressed, if he really thought this to be the opinion of a wise man, that forsooth it is proper for a king to come to hasty conclusions and act unjustly, and that whatever is done by a king must be deemed just, no matter how it is done. There is also a current report that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> wished men to prostrate themselves before him as to a god, entertaining the notion that <a href=/people/577 target=_blank>Ammon</a> was his father, rather than <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>; and that he now showed his admiration of the customs of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> by changing the style of his dress, and by the alteration he made in the general etiquette of his court. There were not wanting those who in regard to these matters gave way to his wishes with the design of flattering him; among others being <a href=/people/955 target=_blank>Anaxarchus</a>, one of the philosophers attending his court, and <a href=/people/175 target=_blank>Agis</a>, an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=person long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a> who was an epic poet. </p>                        </div>

But the following remark of his, if indeed it has been correctly recorded, I do not think at all proper, when he declared that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and his exploits were dependent upon him and his history, and that he had not come to him to acquire reputation from him, but to make him renowned in the eyes of men; consequently that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s participation in divinity did not depend on the false assertion of <a href=/people/272 target=_blank>Olympias</a> in regard to the author of his birth, but on what he might report to mankind in his history of the king. There are some writers also who have said that on one occasion <a href=/people/591 target=_blank>Philotas</a> forsooth asked him, what man he thought to be held in especial honour by the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>; and that he replied: <a href=/people/600 target=_blank>Harmodius</a> and <a href=/people/496 target=_blank>Aristogeiton</a>; because they slew one of the two despots, and put an end to the despotism. <a href=/people/591 target=_blank>Philotas</a> again asked: If it happened now that a man should kill a despot, to which of the Grecian States would you wish him to flee for preservation? <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a> again replied: If not among others, at any rate among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> an exile would find preservation; for they waged war on behalf of the sons of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> against <a href=/people/247 target=_blank>Eurystheus</a>, who at that time was ruling as a despot over Greece. How he resisted <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> in regard to the ceremony of prostration, the following is the most received account. An arrangement was made between <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and the Sophists in conjunction with the most illustrious of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> who were in attendance upon him, that this topic should be mentioned at a wine-party. <a href=/people/955 target=_blank>Anaxarchus</a> commenced the discussion by saying that he considered <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> much more worthy of being deemed a god than either <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> or <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, not only on account of the very numerous and mighty exploits which he had performed, but also because <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> was only a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=person long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Theban</a>, in no way related to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>; and <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> was an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=person long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a>, not at all related to them, except that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> deduced his descent from him.

But <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a> interposed and said: O <a href=/people/955 target=_blank>Anaxarchus</a>, I openly declare that there is no honour which <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> is unworthy to receive, provided that it is consistent with his being human; but men have made distinctions between those honours which are due to men, and those due to gods, in many different ways, as for instance by the building of temples and by the erection of statues. Moreover for the gods sacred enclosures are selected, to them sacrifice is offered, and to them libations are made. Hymns also are composed in honour of the gods, and eulogies for men. But the greatest distinction is made by the custom of prostration. For it is the practice that men should be kissed by those who salute them; but because the deity is located somewhere above, it is not lawful even to touch him, and this is the reason no doubt why he is honoured by prostration. Bands of choral dancers are also appointed for the gods, and paeans are sung in their honour. And this is not at all wonderful, seeing that certain honours are specially assigned to some of the gods and certain others to other gods, and, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, quite different ones again are assigned to heroes, which are very distinct from those paid to the deities. It is not therefore reasonable to confound all these distinctions without discrimination, exalting men to a rank above their condition by extravagant accumulation of honours, and debasing the gods, as far as lies in human power, to an unseemly level, by paying them honours only equal to those paid to men. He said that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> would not endure the affront, if some private individual were to be thrust into his royal honours by an unjust vote, either by show of hand or by ballot. Much more justly then would the gods be indignant at those mortals who usurp divine honours or suffer themselves to be thrust into them by others. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> not only seems to be, but is in reality beyond any competition the bravest of brave men, of kings the most kingly, and of generals the most worthy to command an army. O <a href=/people/955 target=_blank>Anaxarchus</a>, it was thy duty, rather than any other man's, to become the special advocate of these arguments now adduced by me, and the opponent of those contrary to them, seeing that thou associatest with him for the purpose of imparting philosophy and instruction. Therefore it was unseemly to begin this discussion, when thou oughtest to have remembered that thou art not associating with and giving advice to <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a> or <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, but to the son of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, who derives his origin from <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> and <a href=/people/255 target=_blank>Aeacus</a>, whose ancestors came into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>, and have continued to rule the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, not by force, but by law. Not even to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> himself while still alive were divine honours paid by the Greeks; and even after his death they were withheld until a decree had been published by the oracle of the god at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> that men should honour <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> as a god. But if, because the discussion is held in the land of foreigners, we ought to adopt the sentiments of foreigners, I demand, O <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, that thou shouldst bethink thyself of Greece, for whose sake the whole of this expedition was undertaken by thee, that thou mightest join Asia to Greece. Therefore make up thy mind whether thou wilt return thither and compel the Greeks, who are men most devoted to freedom, to pay thee the honour of prostration, or whether thou wilt keep aloof from Greece, and inflict this honour on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> alone, or thirdly whether thou wilt thyself make a difference in every respect as to the honours to be paid thee, so as to be honoured by the Greeks and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> as a human being and after the manner of the Greeks, and by foreigners alone after the foreign fashion of prostration. But if it is said that <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, son of <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a>, was the first man to whom the honour of prostration was paid, and that afterwards this degrading ceremony continued in vogue among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, we ought to bear in mind that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, men poor but independent, chastised that <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>; that other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> again chastised <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> did <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, as <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> and <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> with their 10,000 followers did <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a>; and finally, that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, though not honoured with prostration, has conquered this <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>. </p>                        </div>

When the king perceived this, he sent to prevent the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> from making any farther mention of the ceremony of prostration. But after the discussion silence ensued; and then the most honourable of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> arose in due order and prostrated their bodies before him. But when one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> seemed to have performed the ceremony in an awkward way, <a href=/people/1114 target=_blank>Leonnatus</a>, one of the Companions, laughed at his posture as mean. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> at the time was angry with him for this, but was afterwards reconciled to him. The following account has also been given: <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> drank from a golden goblet the health of the circle of guests, and handed it first to those with whom he had concerted the ceremony of prostration. The first who drank from the goblet rose up and performed the act of prostration, and received a kiss from him. This ceremony proceeded from one to another in due order. But when the pledging of health came to the turn of <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a>, he rose up and drank from the goblet, and drew near, wishing to kiss the king without performing the act of prostration. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> happened then to be conversing with <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>, and consequently did not observe whether <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a> performed the ceremony properly or not. But when <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a> was approaching to kiss him, <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, son of Pythonax, one of the Companions, said that he was doing so without having prostrated himself. So the king would not permit him to kiss him; whereupon the philosopher said: I am going away only with the loss of a kiss. I by no means approve any of these proceedings, which manifested both the insolence of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> on the present occasion and the churlish nature of <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a>. But I think that, so far as regards himself, it would have been quite sufficient if he had given his opinion discreetly, magnifying as much as possible the exploits of the king, with whom no one thought it a dishonour to associate. Therefore I consider that not without reason <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a> became odious to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> on account of the unseasonable freedom of speech in which he indulged, as well as from the egregious fatuity of his conduct. I surmise that this was the reason why such easy credit was given to those who accused him of participating in the conspiracy formed against <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> by his pages, and to those also who affirmed that they had been incited to engage in the conspiracy by him alone. The facts of this conspiracy were as follows: </p>                        </div>

These youths were entrusted with the general attendance on the king's person and the protection of his body while he was asleep. Whenever the king rode out, some of them received the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> from the grooms, and brought them to him, and others assisted him to mount in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> fashion. They were also companions of the king in the emulation of the chase. Among these youths was <a href=/people/2624 target=_blank>Hermolaus</a>, son of <a href=/people/2665 target=_blank>Sopolis</a>, who seemed to be applying his mind to the study of philosophy, and to be cultivating the society of <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a> for this purpose. There is current a tale about this youth to the effect that in the chase, a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> rushed at <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, and that <a href=/people/2624 target=_blank>Hermolaus</a> anticipated him by casting a javelin at the beast, by which it was smitten and killed. But <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, having lost the opportunity of distinguishing himself by being too late in the assault, was indignant with <a href=/people/2624 target=_blank>Hermolaus</a>, and in his wrath ordered him to receive a scourging in sight of the other pages; and also deprived him of his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. This <a href=/people/2624 target=_blank>Hermolaus</a>, being chagrined at the disgrace he had incurred, told <a href=/people/988 target=_blank>Sostratus</a>, son of <a href=/people/246 target=_blank>Amyntas</a>, who was his equal in age and intimate confidential friend, that life would be insupportable to him unless he could take vengeance upon <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> for the affront. He easily persuaded <a href=/people/988 target=_blank>Sostratus</a> to join in the enterprise, since he was fondly attached to him. They gained over to their plans <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, son of <a href=/people/1585 target=_blank>Asclepiodorus</a>, viceroy of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, Epimenes son of <a href=/people/8889 target=_blank>Arseas</a>, <a href=/people/1985 target=_blank>Anticles</a> son of <a href=/people/759 target=_blank>Theocritus</a>, and <a href=/people/591 target=_blank>Philotas</a> son of Carsis the Thracian. They therefore agreed to kill the king by attacking him in his sleep, on the night when the nocturnal watch came round to <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>'s turn. Some say that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> accidentally happened to be drinking until daybreak; but <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> has given the following account: A Syrian woman, who was under the inspiration of the deity, used to follow <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> about. At first she was a subject of mirth to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and his courtiers; but when all that she said in her inspiration was seen to be true, he no longer treated her with neglect, but she was allowed to have free access to him both by night and day, and she often took her stand near him even when he was asleep. And indeed on that occasion, when he was withdrawing from the drinking-party she met him, being under the inspiration of the deity at the time, and besought him to return and drink all night. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, thinking that there was something divine in the warning, returned and went on drinking; and thus the enterprise of the pages fell through. The next day, Epimenes son of <a href=/people/8889 target=_blank>Arseas</a>, one of those who took part in the conspiracy, spoke of the undertaking to <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> son of <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>, who had become his confidential friend; and <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> told it to <a href=/people/904 target=_blank>Eurylochus</a>, brother of Epimenes. <a href=/people/904 target=_blank>Eurylochus</a> went to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s tent and related the whole affair to <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, one of the confidential body-guards. He told <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, who ordered those whose names had been mentioned by <a href=/people/904 target=_blank>Eurylochus</a> to be arrested. These, being put on the rack, confessed their own conspiracy, and mentioned the names of certain others. </p>                        </div>

Most writers, however, do not agree with this, but represent that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> readily believed the worst about <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a>, from the hatred which he already felt towards him, and because <a href=/people/2624 target=_blank>Hermolaus</a> was known to be exceedingly intimate with him. Some authors have also recorded the following particulars: that <a href=/people/2624 target=_blank>Hermolaus</a> was brought before the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, to whom he confessed that he had conspired against the king's life, because it was no longer possible for a free man to bear his insolent tyranny. He then recounted all his acts of despotism, the illegal execution of <a href=/people/591 target=_blank>Philotas</a>, the still more illegal one of his father <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a> and of the others who were put to death at that time, the murder of <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a> in a fit of drunkenness, his assumption of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=demonym long=48 lat=35.5>Median</a> garb, the introduction of the ceremony of prostration, which had been planned and not yet relinquished, and the drinking-bouts and lethargic sleep arising from them, to which he was addicting himself. He said that, being no longer able to bear these things, he wished to free both himself and the other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>. These same authors say that <a href=/people/2624 target=_blank>Hermolaus</a> himself and those who had been arrested with him were stoned to death by those who were present. <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> says that <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a> was carried about with the army bound with fetters, and afterwards died a natural death; but <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, says that he was stretched upon the rack and then hanged.

Following them up closely, he overtook those very men and more than 1,000 other <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetian</a> horsemen, not far from the desert. A fierce battle ensued, in which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> were victorious. Of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, 150 horsemen were slain; but the rest of them easily escaped into the desert, for it was impossible for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> to pursue them any further. At this time, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> relieved <a href=/people/667 target=_blank>Artabazus</a> of the viceroyalty of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=ethnic long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrians</a>, at his own request, on the ground of his advanced age; and <a href=/people/246 target=_blank>Amyntas</a>, son of <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nicolaus</a>, was appointed viceroy in his stead. <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> was left with his own brigade and that of <a href=/people/315 target=_blank>Meleager</a>, 400 of the Companion cavalry, and all the horse-archers, besides the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=ethnic long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrians</a>, <a href=/people/5978 target=_blank>Sogdianians</a>, and others who were under the command of <a href=/people/246 target=_blank>Amyntas</a>. They were all under strict injunctions to obey <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> and to winter there in <a href=/people/5978 target=_blank>Sogdiana</a>, in order to protect the country and to arrest <a href=/people/1793 target=_blank>Spitamenes</a>, if anyhow they might be able to draw him into an ambush, as he was wandering about during the winter. But when <a href=/people/1793 target=_blank>Spitamenes</a> saw that every place was occupied by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> for a garrison, and that there would soon be no way of flight left open to him, he turned round against <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> and the army with him, thinking that he would be better able to fight in this way.

It is an easy matter to induce these <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> to engage in one war after another, because they are pinched by poverty, and at the same time have no cities or settled abodes, to give them cause for anxiety about what is most dear to them. When <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> ascertained that <a href=/people/1793 target=_blank>Spitamenes</a> was advancing with his cavalry, he went to meet him with his army. A sharp contest ensued, in which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> were victorious, so that of the barbarian cavalry over 800 fell in the battle, while <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> lost 25 horsemen and twelve foot-soldiers. The consequence was, that the <a href=/people/5978 target=_blank>Sogdianians</a> who were still left with <a href=/people/1793 target=_blank>Spitamenes</a>, as well as most of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=ethnic long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrians</a>, deserted him in the flight, and came to <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> to surrender.

When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> approached it, he found it precipitous on all sides against assault, and that the barbarians had collected provisions for a long siege. The great quantity of snow which had fallen helped to make the approach more difficult to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, while at the same time it kept the barbarians supplied with plenty of water. But notwithstanding all this, he resolved to assault the place; for a certain overweening and insolent boast uttered by the barbarians had thrown him into a wrathful state of ambitious pertinacity. For when they were invited to come to terms of capitulation, and it was held out to them as an inducement, that if they surrendered the place, they would be allowed to withdraw in safety to their own abodes, they burst out laughing, and in their barbaric tongue bade <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> seek winged soldiers, to capture the mountain for him, since they had no apprehension of danger from other men. He then issued a proclamation that the first man who mounted should have a reward of twelve talents, the man who came next to him the second prize, and the third so on in proportion, so that the last reward should be three hundred darics to the last prize-taker who reached the top. This proclamation excited the valour of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> still more, though they were even before very eager to commence the assault. </p>                        </div>

Tying strong ropes made of flax to these pegs, they advanced in the night towards the most precipitous part of the rock, which was also most unguarded; and fixing some of these pegs into the earth, where it made itself visible, and others into the snow where it seemed least likely to break up, they hoisted themselves up the rock, some in one place and some in another. Thirty of them perished in the ascent; and as they fell into various parts of the snows, not even could their bodies be found for burial. The rest, however, reached the top of the mountain at the approach of dawn; and taking possession of it, they waved linen flags towards the camp of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, as <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had directed them to do. He now sent a herald with instructions to shout to the sentries of the barbarians to make no further delay, but surrender at once; since the winged men had been found, and the summits of the mountain were in their possession. At the same time the herald pointed at the soldiers upon the crest of the mountain. The barbarians, being alarmed by the unexpectedness of the sight, and suspecting that the men who were occupying the peaks were more numerous than they really were, and that they were completely armed, surrendered, so frightened did they become at the sight of those few <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>.

They also say that no sooner did <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> see her than he fell in love with her; but though he was in love with her, he refused to offer violence to her as a captive, and did not think it derogatory to his dignity to marry her. This conduct of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> I think worthy rather of praise than blame. Moreover, in regard to the wife of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, who was said to be the most beautiful woman in Asia, he either did not entertain a passion for her, or else he exercised control over himself, though he was young, and in the very meridian of success, when men usually act with insolence and violence. On the contrary, he acted with modesty and spared her honour, exercising a great amount of chastity, and at the same time exhibiting a very proper desire to obtain a good reputation. </p>                        </div>

Upon this <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> stretched his hands towards heaven and prayed as follows: O King <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, to whom power has been assigned to regulate the affairs of kings among men, do thou now protect for me especially the empire of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, as indeed thou didst give it to me. But if I am no longer king of Asia according to thy behest, at any rate do thou hand over my power to no other man but <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. Thus not even to enemies, I ween, are chaste actions a matter of unconcern. <a href=/people/1954 target=_blank>Oxyartes</a>, hearing that his children were in the power of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, and that he was treating his daughter <a href=/people/1966 target=_blank>Roxana</a> with respect, took courage and came to him. He was held in honour at the king's court, as was natural after such a piece of good fortune. </p>                        </div>

This was called the rock of <a href=/people/4485 target=_blank>Chorienes</a>; and to it <a href=/people/4485 target=_blank>Chorienes</a> himself and many other chiefs had fled for refuge. The height of this rock was about twenty stades, and the circuit about sixty. It was precipitous on all sides, and there was only one ascent to it, which was narrow and not easy to mount, since it had been constructed in spite of the nature of the place. It was therefore difficult to ascend even by men in single file and when no one barred the way. A deep ravine also enclosed the rock all round, so that whoever intended to lead an army up to it, must long before make a causeway of earth over this ravine in order that he might start from level ground, when he led his troops to the assault. Notwithstanding all this, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> undertook the enterprise. To so great a pitch of audacity had he advanced through his career of success, that he thought every place ought to be accessible to him, and to be captured by him. He cut down the pines, which were very abundant and lofty all round the mountain, and made ladders of them, so that by means of them the soldiers might be able to descend into the ravine; for otherwise it was impossible for them to do so. During the daytime he himself superintended the work, keeping half of his army engaged in it; and during the night his confidential body-guards, <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a>, <a href=/people/1114 target=_blank>Leonnatus</a>, and <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, in turn with the other half of the army, divided into three parts, performed the duty which had been assigned to each for the night. But they could complete no more than twenty cubits in a day, and not quite so much in a night, though the whole army engaged in the labour; so difficult was the place to approach and so hard was the work in it. Descending into the ravine, they fastened pegs into the sharpest and narrowest part of it, distant from each other as far as was consistent with strength to support the weight of what was placed upon them. Upon these they placed hurdles made of willow and osiers, very much in the form of a bridge. Binding these together, they loaded earth above them, so that there might be an approach to the rock for the army on level ground. At first the barbarians derided, as if the attempt was altogether abortive; but when the arrows began to reach the rock, and they were unable to drive back the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, though they themselves were on a higher level, because the former had constructed screens to ward off the missiles, that they might carry on their labour under them without receiving injury, <a href=/people/4485 target=_blank>Chorienes</a> grew alarmed at what was being done, and sent a herald to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, beseeching him to send <a href=/people/1954 target=_blank>Oxyartes</a> up to him. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> accordingly sent <a href=/people/1954 target=_blank>Oxyartes</a>, who on his arrival persuaded <a href=/people/4485 target=_blank>Chorienes</a> to entrust himself and the place to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; for he told him that there was nothing which <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and his army could not take by storm; and as he himself had entered into an alliance of fidelity and friendship with him, he commended the king's honour and justice in high terms, adducing other examples, and above all his own case for the confirmation of his arguments. By these representations <a href=/people/4485 target=_blank>Chorienes</a> was persuaded and came himself to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, accompanied by some of his relations and companions. When he arrived, the king gave him a courteous answer to his inquiries, and retained him after pledging his fidelity and friendship. But he bade him send to the rock some of those who came down with him to order his men to surrender the place; and it was surrendered by those who had fled to it for refuge. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> therefore took 500 of his shield-bearing guards and went up to get a view of the rock; and was so far from inflicting any harsh treatment upon <a href=/people/4485 target=_blank>Chorienes</a> that he entrusted that very place to him again, and made him governor of all that he had ruled before. It happened that the army suffered much hardship from the severity of the winter, a great quantity of snow having fallen during the siege; while at the same time the men were reduced to great straits from lack of provisions. But <a href=/people/4485 target=_blank>Chorienes</a> said he would give the army food for two months; and he gave the men in every tent corn, wine, and salted meat out of the stores in the rock. When he had given them this, he said he had not exhausted even the tenth part of what had been laid up for the siege. Hence <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> held him in still greater honour, inasmuch as he had surrendered the rock, not so much from compulsion as from his own inclination. </p>                        </div>

A sharp battle was fought with them, in which <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> was victorious; <a href=/people/9087 target=_blank>Catanes</a> being killed there while fighting, and Austanes being captured and brought to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>.

He crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a> in ten days and arrived at the city of Alexandria, which had been founded in the land of the Parapamisadae when he made his first expedition to <a href=/people/1066 target=_blank>Bactra</a>. He dismissed from office the governor whom he had then placed over the city, because he thought he was not ruling well. He also settled in Alexandria others from the neighbouring tribes and the soldiers who were now unfit for service in addition to the first settlers, and commanded <a href=/people/401 target=_blank>Nicanor</a>, one of the Companions, to regulate the affairs of the city itself. Moreover he appointed Tyriaspes viceroy of the land of the Parapamisadae and of the rest of the country as far as the river <a href=/people/3565 target=_blank>Cophen</a>. Arriving at the city of <a href=/people/1952 target=_blank>Nicaea</a>, he offered sacrifice to <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> and then advanced towards the <a href=/people/3565 target=_blank>Cophen</a>, sending a herald forward to <a href=/people/1357 target=_blank>Taxiles</a> and the other chiefs on this side the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>, to bid them come and meet him as each might find it convenient. <a href=/people/1357 target=_blank>Taxiles</a> and the other chiefs accordingly did come to meet him, bringing the gifts which are reckoned of most value among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>.

Assaulting the first of these cities which was situated on his route, he routed, at the first attack without any delay, the men whom he found drawn up in front of the city, and shut them up in it. He was himself wounded by a dart which penetrated through the breastplate into his shoulder; but the wound was only a slight one, for the breastplate prevented the dart from penetrating right through his shoulder. <a href=/people/1114 target=_blank>Leonnatus</a> and <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, were also wounded.

After a long journey he arrived at the city on the second day. When the barbarians ascertained that he was approaching they set fire to the city and fled to the mountains. But <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> followed close upon the fugitives as far as the mountains, and slaughtered many of them before they could manage to get away into the places which were difficult of access. <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, observing that the leader himself of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> of that district was on a certain hill, and that he had some of his shield-bearing guards round him, though he had with himself far fewer men, yet he still continued to pursue him on horseback. But as the hill was difficult for his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> to run up, he left it there, handing it over to one of the shield-bearing guards to lead.

When his men saw their leader lying dead, they stood their ground no longer; but the men on the mountains, seeing their chieftain's corpse being carried off by the enemy, were seized with indignation, and running down engaged in a desperate conflict over him on the hill. For <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself was now on the hill with the infantry who had dismounted from the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. These, falling upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, drove them away to the mountains after a hard struggle, and remained in possession of the corpse.

There <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> with his army reached him, after accomplishing all the king's orders; and because this city seemed to be built in a convenient place, he directed that general to fortify it well, and settle in it as many of the neighbouring people as were willing to live there, together with any of the soldiers who were unfit for service. He then advanced to the place where he heard that most of the barbarians of the district had fled for refuge; and coming to a certain mountain, he encamped at the foot of it.

But the latter did not believe in the multitude of the enemy's fires. Discovering, however, that the barbarians of the district had joined their forces into one body, he left a part of his army there near the mountain, encamped as they were, and taking as many men as seemed sufficient, according to the reports he had received, as soon as they could descry the fires near at hand, he divided his army into three parts.

In the same way did <a href=/people/1114 target=_blank>Leonnatus</a> with the third division of the army; for his men also defeated those opposed to them. <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> indeed says that all the men were captured, to a number exceeding 40,000, and that 230,000 <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> were also taken, of which <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> picked out the finest, because they seemed to him to excel both in beauty and size, wishing to send them into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> to till the soil. Thence he marched towards the land of the <a href=/people/8903 target=_blank>Assacenians</a>; for he received news that these people had made preparations to fight him, having 20,000 cavalry, more than 30,000 infantry, and 30 elephants. When <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> had thoroughly fortified the city, for the founding of which he had been left behind, he brought the heavier armed men of his army for <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> as well as the military engines, in case it might be necessary to lay siege to any place. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> then marched against the <a href=/people/8903 target=_blank>Assacenians</a> at the head of the Companion cavalry, the horse-archers, the brigades of <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> and <a href=/people/1140 target=_blank>Polysperchon</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>, the light-armed troops, and the archers. Passing through the land of the Guraeans, he crossed the river Guraeus, which gives its name to the land, with difficulty, both on account of its depth, and because its current is swift, and the stones in the river being round caused those who stepped upon them to stumble. When the barbarians perceived <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> approaching, they durst not take their stand for a battle in close array, but dispersed one by one to their various cities with the determination of preserving these by resolute fighting. </p>                        </div>

When therefore he saw the barbarians running out, he ordered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> to turn round and retreat to a certain hill distant something about seven stades from the place where he had resolved to encamp. The enemy being emboldened, as if the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> had already given way, rushed upon them with a run and with no kind of order. But when the arrows began to reach them, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> at once wheeled round at the appointed signal, and led his phalanx against them with a run. His horse-lancers, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>, and archers first ran forward and engaged with the barbarians, while he himself led the phalanx in regular order. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> were alarmed at this unexpected manoeuvre, and as soon as the battle became a hand-to-hand conflict, they gave way and fled into the city. About 200 of them were killed, and the rest were shut up within the walls. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> then led his phalanx up to the wall, from which he was soon after slightly wounded in the ankle with an arrow. On the next day he brought up his military engines and easily battered down a piece of the wall; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> so gallantly kept back the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> who were trying to force an entrance where the breach had been made, that he recalled the army for this day. But on the morrow the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> themselves made a more vigorous assault, and a wooden tower was drawn up to the walls, from which the archers shot at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, and missiles were hurled from the military engines which repulsed them to a great distance. But not even thus were they able to force their way within the wall. On the third day he led the phalanx near again, and throwing a bridge from a military engine over to the part of the wall where the breach had been made, by this he led up the shield-bearing guards, who had captured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a> for him in a similar way. But as many were urged on by their ardour, the bridge received too great a weight, and was snapped asunder, so that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> fell with it. The barbarians, seeing what was taking place, raised a great shout, and shot at them from the wall with stones, arrows, and whatever else any one happened to have at hand, or whatever any one could lay hold of at the time. Others issued forth by the small gates which they had between the towers in the wall, and at close quarters struck the men who had been thrown into confusion by the fall. </p>                        </div>

On the fourth day he brought up another bridge against the wall in like manner upon another military engine. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, as long as the ruler of the place survived, defended themselves gallantly; but when he was struck and killed with a missile hurled from an engine, and as some of their number had fallen in the siege, which had gone on without any cessation, while most of them were wounded and unfit for service, they sent a herald to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. He was glad to preserve the lives of brave men; so he came to terms with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> mercenaries on this condition, that they should be admitted into the ranks with the rest of his army and serve as his soldiers. They therefore came out of the city with their arms, and encamped by themselves upon a hill which was facing the camp of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>; but they resolved to arise by night and run away to their own abodes, because they were unwilling to take up arms against the other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> received intelligence of this, he placed the whole of his army round the hill in the night, and intercepting them in the midst of their flight, cut them to pieces. He then took the city by storm, denuded as it was of defenders; and captured the mother and daughter of <a href=/people/8903 target=_blank>Assacenus</a>. In the whole siege five-and-twenty of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s men were killed. Thence he despatched <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> to <a href=/people/4455 target=_blank>Bazira</a>, entertaining an opinion that the inhabitants would surrender, when they heard of the capture of <a href=/people/6647 target=_blank>Massaga</a>. He also despatched <a href=/people/90 target=_blank>Attalus</a>, <a href=/people/738 target=_blank>Alcetas</a>, and <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> the cavalry officer to another city, named Ora, with instructions to blockade it until he himself arrived. The men of this city made a sortie against the forces of <a href=/people/738 target=_blank>Alcetas</a>; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> easily routed them, and drove them into the city within the wall. But affairs at <a href=/people/4455 target=_blank>Bazira</a> were not favourable to <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a>, for the inhabitants showed no sign of capitulating, trusting to the strength of the place, because not only was it situated on a lofty eminence, but it was also thoroughly fortified all round. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> learnt this, he started off to <a href=/people/4455 target=_blank>Bazira</a>; but ascertaining that some of the neighbouring barbarians were about to get into the city of Ora by stealth, being despatched thither by Abisares for that very purpose, he first marched to Ora. He ordered <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> to fortify a certain strong position to serve as a basis of operations against the city of <a href=/people/4455 target=_blank>Bazira</a>, and then to come to him with the rest of his army, after leaving in that place a sufficient garrison to restrain the men in the city from enjoying the free use of their land. But when the men of <a href=/people/4455 target=_blank>Bazira</a> saw <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> departing with the larger part of his army, they despised the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, as not being able to contend with them, and sallied forth into the plain. A sharply contested battle ensued, in which 500 of the barbarians fell, and over seventy were taken prisoners. But the rest, fleeing for refuge into the city, were now more securely shut off from the country by the men in the fort. The siege of Ora proved an easy matter to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, for he no sooner attacked the walls than at the first assault he got possession of the city, and captured the elephants which had been left there. </p>                        </div>

For all the inhabitants deserted the cities and began to flee to the rock which is in their land, and is called Aornus. For stupendous is this rock in this land, about which the current report is, that it was found impregnable even by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, the son of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. I cannot affirm with confidence either way, whether the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=person long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Theban</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=demonym long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrian</a>, or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> penetrated into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> or not; but I am rather inclined to think that he did not penetrate so far; for men are wont to magnify the difficulty of difficult enterprises to such a degree as to assert that they would have been impracticable even to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>. Therefore, I am inclined to think, that in regard to this rock the name of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> was mentioned simply to add to the marvellousness of the tale. The circuit of the rock is said to be about 200 stades (i.e. about twenty-three miles), and its height where it is lowest, eleven stades (i.e., about a mile and a quarter). There was only one ascent, which was artificial and difficult; on the summit of the rock there was abundance of pure water, a spring issuing from the ground, from which the water flowed; and there was also timber, and sufficient good arable land for 1,000 men to till. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> heard this, he was seized with a vehement desire to capture this mountain also, especially on account of the legend which was current about <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>. He then made Ora and <a href=/people/6647 target=_blank>Massaga</a> fortresses to keep the land in subjection, and fortified the city of <a href=/people/4455 target=_blank>Bazira</a>. <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> and <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a> also fortified for him another city, named Orobatis, and leaving a garrison in it marched towards the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>. When they reached that river they at once began to carry out <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s instructions in regard to bridging it. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> then appointed <a href=/people/401 target=_blank>Nicanor</a>, one of the Companions, viceroy of the land on this side the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>; and in the first place leading his army towards that river, he brought over on terms of capitulation the city of <a href=/people/8132 target=_blank>Peucelaotis</a>, which was situated not far from it. In this city he placed a garrison of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, under the command of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, and then reduced to subjection some other small towns situated near the same river, being accompanied by Cophaeus and Assagetes, the chieftains of the land. Arriving at the city of Embolima, which was situated near the rock Aornus, he left <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> there with a part of the army, to gather as much corn as possible into the city, as well as all the other things requisite for a long stay, so that making this their base of operations, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> might be able by a long siege to wear out the men who were holding the rock, supposing it were not captured at the first assault. He then took the bowmen, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>, and the brigade of <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a>, and selecting the lightest as well as the best-armed men from the rest of the phalanx, with 200 of the Companion cavalry and 100 horse-bowmen, he advanced to the rock. This day he encamped where it appeared to him convenient; but on the morrow he approached a little nearer to the rock, and encamped again. </p>                        </div>

With these he sent <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, the confidential body-guard, in command of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a> and the other light-armed troops, together with picked men from the shield-bearing guards. He gave this officer instructions, as soon as he had got possession of the place, to occupy it with a strong guard, and signal to him that it was held. <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> proceeded along a road which was rough and difficult to pass, and occupied the position without the knowledge of the barbarians. After strengthening his position with a stockade and a ditch all round, he raised a beacon from the mountain, whence it was likely to be seen by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. The flame was at once seen, and on the following day the king led his army forward; but as the barbarians disputed his advance, he could do nothing further on account of the difficult nature of the ground. When the barbarians perceived that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> could not make an assault, they turned round and attacked <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, and a sharp battle ensued between them and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> making great efforts to demolish the stockade, and <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> to preserve his position. But the barbarians, getting the worst of it in the skirmish, withdrew as the night came on. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> now selected from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> deserters a man who was not only devoted to him but acquainted with the locality, and sent him by night to <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, carrying a letter, in which it was written that as soon as the king attacked the rock, <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> was to come down the mountain upon the barbarians, and not be contented with holding his position in guard; so that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, being assailed from both sides at once, might be in perplexity what course to pursue. Accordingly, starting from his camp at daybreak, he led his army up the path by which <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> had ascended by stealth, entertaining the opinion that if he could force his way in this direction and join his forces with those of <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, the work would no longer be difficult for him; and so it turned out. For until midday a smart battle was kept up between the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, the latter striving to force a way of approach, and the former hurling missiles at them as they ascended. But as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> did not relax their efforts, advancing one after another, and those who were in advance rested till their comrades came up, after great exertions they gained possession of the pass early in the afternoon, and formed a junction with <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>'s forces. As the whole army was now united, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> led it thence against the rock itself. But the approach to it was still impracticable. Such then was the result of this day's labours. At the approach of the dawn he issued an order that each soldier individually should cut 100 stakes; and when this had been done he heaped up a great mound against the rock, beginning from the top of the hill where they had encamped. From this mound he thought the arrows as well as the missiles launched from the military engines would be able to reach the defenders of the rock. Every one in the army assisted him in this work of raising the mound; while he himself superintended it, as an observer, not only commending the man who completed his task with zeal and alacrity, but also chastising him who was dilatory in the pressing emergency. </p>                        </div>

He remained quiet until they began their retreat; then taking 700 of the body-guards and shield-bearing infantry, he was the first to scale the rock at the part of it abandoned by the enemy; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> ascended after him, one in one place another in another, drawing each other up. These men at the concerted signal turned themselves upon the retreating barbarians, and killed many of them in their flight. Others retreating with panic terror perished by leaping down the precipices; and thus the rock which had been inexpugnable to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> was occupied by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. He offered sacrifice upon it, and arranged a fort, committing the superintendence of the garrison to Sisicottus, who long before had deserted from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> to <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> in <a href=/people/1066 target=_blank>Bactra</a>, and after <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had acquired possession of the country of <a href=/people/1066 target=_blank>Bactra</a>, entered his army and appeared to be eminently trustworthy. He now set out from the rock and invaded the land of the <a href=/people/8903 target=_blank>Assacenians</a>; for he was informed that the brother of <a href=/people/8903 target=_blank>Assacenus</a>, with his elephants and many of the neighbouring barbarians had fled into the mountains in this district. When he arrived at the city of Dyrta, he found none of the inhabitants either in it or in the land adjacent. On the following day he sent out <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a> and <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, the colonels of the shield-bearing guards, giving the former the command of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a> and the light-armed troops, and the latter the command of his own regiments and two others besides. They were despatched both to reconnoitre the locality and to try if they could capture some of the barbarians anywhere in order to get information about the general affairs of the country; and he was especially anxious to learn news of the elephants. He now directed his march towards the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>, the army going in advance to make a road for him, as otherwise this district would have been impassable. Here he captured a few of the barbarians, from whom he learnt that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> of that land had fled for safety to Abisares, but that they had left their elephants there to pasture near the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>. He ordered these men to show him the way to the elephants. Many of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> are elephant-hunters, and these <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> kept in attendance upon him in high honour, going out to hunt the elephants in company with them. Two of these animals perished in the chase, by leaping down a precipice, but the rest were caught and being ridden by drivers were marshalled with the army. He also as he was marching along the river lighted upon a wood the timber of which was suitable for building ships; this was cut down by the army, and ships were built for him, which were brought down the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> to the bridge, which had long since been constructed by <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> and <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a> at his command. </p>                        </div>

But I do not think we ought to make a minute examination of the legends which were promulgated in ancient times about the divinity; for things which are not credible to the man who examines them according to the rule of probability, do not appear to be wholly incredible, if one adds the divine agency to the story. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> came to <a href=/people/1673 target=_blank>Nysa</a> the citizens sent out to him their president, whose name was <a href=/people/3749 target=_blank>Acuphis</a>, accompanied by thirty of their most distinguished men as envoys, to entreat <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> to leave their city free for the sake of the god. The envoys entered <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s tent and found him seated in his armour still covered with dust from the journey, with his helmet on his head, and holding his spear in his hand. When they beheld the sight they were struck with astonishment, and falling to the earth remained silent a long time. But when <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> caused them to rise, and bade them be of good courage, then at length <a href=/people/3749 target=_blank>Acuphis</a> began thus to speak: The Nysaeans beseech thee, O king, out of respect for <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, to allow them to remain free and independent; for when <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> had subjugated the nation of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, and was returning to the Grecian sea, he founded this city from the soldiers who had become unfit for military service, and were under his inspiration as Bacchanals, so that it might be a monument both of his wandering and of his victory, to men of after times; just as thou also hast founded Alexandria near mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>, and another <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> in the country of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>. Many other cities thou hast already founded, and others thou wilt found hereafter, in the course of time, inasmuch as thou hast achieved more exploits than <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>. The god indeed called the city <a href=/people/1673 target=_blank>Nysa</a>, and the land Nysaea after his nurse <a href=/people/1673 target=_blank>Nysa</a>. The mountain also which is near the city he named <a href=/people/4206 target=_blank>Meros</a> (i.e. thigh), because, according to the legend, he grew in the thigh of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. From that time we inhabit <a href=/people/1673 target=_blank>Nysa</a>, a free city, and we ourselves are independent, conducting our government with constitutional order. And let this be to thee a proof that our city owes its foundation to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>; for ivy, which does not grow in the rest of the country of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, grows among us. </p>                        </div>

He also thought that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> would not decline still to share his labours if he advanced further, from a desire to surpass the achievements of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>. He therefore granted the inhabitants of <a href=/people/1673 target=_blank>Nysa</a> the privilege of remaining free and independent; and when he inquired about their laws, he commended them because the government was in the hands of the aristocracy. He required them to send 300 of their horsemen to accompany him, and to select and send 100 of the aristocrats who presided over the government of the State, who also were 300 in number. He ordered <a href=/people/3749 target=_blank>Acuphis</a> to make the selection, and appointed him governor of the land of Nysaea. When <a href=/people/3749 target=_blank>Acuphis</a> heard this, he is said to have smiled at the speech; whereupon <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> asked him why he laughed. <a href=/people/3749 target=_blank>Acuphis</a> replied: How, O king, could a single city deprived of 100 of its good men be still well governed? But if thou carest for the welfare of the Nysaeans, lead with thee the 300 horsemen, and still more than that number if thou wishest: but instead of the hundred of the best men whom thou orderest me to select lead with thee double the number of the others who are bad, so that when thou comest here again the city may appear in the same good order in which it now is. By these remarks he persuaded <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; for he thought he was speaking with prudence. So he ordered them to send the horsemen to accompany him, but no longer demanded the hundred select men, nor indeed others in their stead. But he commanded <a href=/people/3749 target=_blank>Acuphis</a> to send his own son and his daughter's son to accompany him. He was now seized with a strong desire of seeing the place where the Nysaeans boasted to have certain memorials of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>. So he went to Mount <a href=/people/4206 target=_blank>Merus</a> with the Companion cavalry and the foot guard, and saw the mountain, which was quite covered with ivy and laurel and groves thickly shaded with all sorts of timber, and on it were chases of all kinds of wild animals. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> were delighted at seeing the ivy, as they had not seen any for a long time; for in the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> there was no ivy, even where they had vines. They eagerly made garlands of it, and crowned themselves with them, as they were, singing hymns in honour of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, and invoking the deity by his various names. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> there offered sacrifice to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, and feasted in company with his companions. Some authors have also stated, but I do not know if any one will believe it, that many of the distinguished <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> in attendance upon him, having crowned themselves with ivy, while they were engaged in the invocation of the deity, were seized with the inspiration of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, uttered cries of Evoi in honour of the god, and acted as Bacchanals. </p>                        </div>

They proved that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> whom <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> visited with his army, and he visited many tribes of them, were destitute of gold; and also that they were by no means luxurious in their mode of living. Moreover, they discovered that they were tall in stature, in fact as tall as any men throughout Asia, most of them being five cubits in height, or a little less. They were blacker than the rest of men, except the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a>; and in war they were far the bravest of all the races inhabiting Asia at that time. For I cannot with any justice compare the race of the ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> with those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, though at the head of the former <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, son of <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a>, set out and deprived the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> of the empire of Asia, and subdued many other races partly by force and partly by voluntary surrender on their own part. For at that time the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> were a poor people and inhabitants of a rugged land, having laws and customs very similar to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconian</a> discipline. Nor am I able with certainty to conjecture whether the defeat sustained by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> land was due to the difficult nature of the country invaded or to some other error on the part of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, or whether the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> were really inferior in warlike matters to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> of that district. </p>                        </div>

Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a> divides Asia, beginning from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377271LMyc class=place long=27.0833 lat=37.6667>Mycale</a>, the mountain which lies opposite the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>; then, cutting through the country of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=ethnic long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=ethnic long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicians</a>, it extends into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a>. From this country it stretches into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a> and through the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> and Chorasmians. In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=place long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactria</a> it unites with mount <a href=/people/3653 target=_blank>Parapamisus</a>, which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> who served in <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s army called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>, in order, as it is said, to enhance their king's glory; asserting that he went even beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a> with his victorious arms. Perhaps it is a fact that this mountain range is a continuation of the other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a>, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a> is of the same. For this reason I have on a previous occasion called this range <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>, and by the same name I shall continue to call it in the future.

Of the rivers in Asia worth consideration which take their rise from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>, some have their course turned towards the north, discharging themselves either into the lake <a about=https://topostext.org/place/460370WMai class=place long=37 lat=46>Maeotis</a>, or into the sea called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400516WHyr class=demonym long=51.6 lat=40>Hyrcanian</a>, which in reality is a gulf of the Great Sea.

Southern Asia again may be divided into four parts, of which <a href=/people/132 target=_blank>Eratosthenes</a> and <a href=/people/1316 target=_blank>Megasthenes</a> make <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> the largest. The latter author lived with <a href=/people/3080 target=_blank>Sibyrtius</a>, the viceroy of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/315650RAra class=place long=65 lat=31.5>Arachosia</a>, and says that he frequently visited Sandracotus, king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>. These authors say that the smallest of the four parts is that which is bounded by the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> and extends to our inland sea. The other two lying between the rivers <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> are scarcely worthy to be compared with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, if they were joined together. They say that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> is bounded towards the east and the east wind as far as the south by the Great Sea, towards the north by mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>, as far as its junction with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a>; and that the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> cuts it off towards the west and the north-west wind, as far as the Great Sea. The greater part of it is a plain, which, as they conjecture, has been formed by the alluvial deposits of the rivers; just as the plains in the rest of the earth lying near the sea are for the most part due to the alluvial action of the rivers taken singly. Consequently, the names by which the countries are called were attached in ancient times to the rivers. For instance, a certain plain was called after the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385281WHer class=place long=28.1113 lat=38.5178>Hermus</a>, which rises in the country of Asia from the mountain of Mother <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393318LDin class=person long=29.697 lat=38.94>Dindymene</a>, and after flowing past the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390271RAio class=demonym long=27.1 lat=39>Aeolian</a> city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> discharges its water into the sea. Another <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> plain is named after the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380274WKau class=place long=27.4412 lat=38.0305>Cayster</a>, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> river; another from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389270WKai class=place long=27.011 lat=38.957>Caicus</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=place long=28 lat=40>Mysia</a>; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=demonym long=28.7 lat=37.01>Carian</a> plain, extending as far as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=demonym long=27.3 lat=38>Ionian</a> city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=place long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a>, is named from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376275WMae class=place long=27.4713 lat=37.622>Maeander</a>. Both <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> and <a href=/people/745 target=_blank>Hecataeus</a> the historians (unless the work about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> country is by another person, and not by <a href=/people/745 target=_blank>Hecataeus</a>) in like manner call <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> a gift of the river; and <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> has shown by no uncertain proofs that such is the case; so that even the country itself perhaps received its name from the river. For that the river which both the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> and men outside <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> now name the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, was in ancient times called <a href=/people/1582 target=_blank>Aegyptus</a>, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> is sufficient to prove; since he says that <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> stationed his ships at the outlet of the river <a href=/people/1582 target=_blank>Aegyptus</a>. If therefore single rivers by themselves, and those not large ones, are sufficient to form an extensive tract of country, while flowing forward into the sea, since they carry down slime and mud from the higher districts whence they derive their sources, surely it is unbecoming to exhibit incredulity about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, how it has come to pass that most of it is a plain, which has been formed by the alluvial deposits of its rivers. For if the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385281WHer class=place long=28.1113 lat=38.5178>Hermus</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380274WKau class=place long=27.4412 lat=38.0305>Cayster</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389270WKai class=place long=27.011 lat=38.957>Caicus</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376275WMae class=place long=27.4713 lat=37.622>Maeander</a>, and all the other rivers of Asia which discharge their waters into the midland sea were all put together, they would not be worthy of comparison for volume of water with one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> rivers. Not only do I mean the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/38898WGan class=place long=89.8009 lat=23.7818>Ganges</a>, which is the largest, and with which neither the water of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> nor the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> flowing through Europe is worthy to compare; but if all those rivers were mingled together they would not even then become equal to the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>, which is a large river as soon as it issues from its springs, and after receiving fifteen rivers, all larger than those in the province of Asia, discharges its water into the sea, retaining its own name and absorbing those of its tributaries. Let these remarks which I have made about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> suffice for the present, and let the rest be reserved for my Description of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>. </p>                        </div>

To me it seems probable that the bridge was made of boats; for the depth of the water would not have admitted of the construction of a regular bridge, nor could so enormous a work have been completed in so short a time. If the passage was bridged with boats, I cannot decide whether the vessels being fastened together with ropes and moored in a row were sufficient to form the bridge, as <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal class=person long=27.4238 lat=37.0323>Halicarnassian</a> says the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a> was bridged, or whether the work was effected in the way in which the bridge upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> and that upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=demonym long=7 lat=49>Celtic</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> are made by the Romans, and in the way in which they bridged the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a>, as often as necessity compelled them. However, as I know myself, the Romans find the quickest way of making a bridge to be with vessels; and this method I shall on the present occasion explain, because it is worth describing. At a pre-concerted signal they let the vessels loose down the stream, not with their prows forward, but as if backing water. As might naturally be expected, the stream carries them down, but a skiff furnished with oars holds them back, until it settles them in the place assigned to them. Then pyramidal wicker-baskets made of willow, full of unhewn stones, are let down into the water from the prow of each vessel, in order to hold it up against the force of the stream. As soon as any one of these vessels has been held fast, another is in the same way moored with its prow against the stream, distant from the first as far as is consistent with their supporting what is put upon them. On both of them are placed pieces of timber with sharp ends projecting out, on which cross-planks are placed to bind them together; and so proceeds the work through all the vessels which are required to bridge the river. At each end of this bridge firmly fixed gangways are thrown forward, so that the approach may be safer for the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and beasts of burden, and at the same time to serve as a bond to the bridge. In a short time the whole is finished with a great noise and bustle; but yet discipline is not relaxed while the work is going on. In each vessel the exhortations of the overseers to the men, or their censures of sluggishness, neither prevent the orders being heard nor impede the rapidity of the work. </p>                        </div>

But I should think that the bridge was made as near as possible as I have described, or if it were effected by some other contrivance so let it be. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had crossed to the other side of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>, he again offered sacrifice there, according to his custom. Then starting from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>, he arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/337728UTax class=place long=72.8193 lat=33.7462>Taxila</a>, a large and prosperous city, in fact the largest of those situated between the rivers <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> and <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>. He was received in a friendly manner by <a href=/people/1357 target=_blank>Taxiles</a>, the governor of the city, and by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> of that place; and he added to their territory as much of the adjacent country as they asked for. Thither also came to him envoys from Abisares, king of the mountaineer <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, the embassy including the brother of Abisares as well as the other most notable men. Other envoys also came from Doxareus, the chief of the province, bringing gifts with them.

Having appointed <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, son of <a href=/people/2758 target=_blank>Machatas</a>, viceroy of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> of that district, he left a garrison in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/337728UTax class=place long=72.8193 lat=33.7462>Taxila</a>, as well as the soldiers who were invalided by sickness, and then marched towards the river <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>. For he was informed that <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>, with the whole of his army was on the other side of that river, having determined either to prevent him from making the passage, or to attack him while crossing. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ascertained this, he sent <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a>, son of <a href=/people/3238 target=_blank>Polemocrates</a>, back to the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>, with instructions to cut in pieces all the vessels which he had prepared for the passage of that river, and to bring them to the river <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>. <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> cut the vessels in pieces and conveyed them thither, the smaller ones being cut into two parts, and the thirty-oared galleys into three. The sections were conveyed upon waggons, as far as the bank of the <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>; and there the vessels were fixed together again, and seen as a fleet upon that river. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> took the forces which he had when he arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/337728UTax class=place long=72.8193 lat=33.7462>Taxila</a>, and the 5,000 <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> under the command of <a href=/people/1357 target=_blank>Taxiles</a> and the chiefs of that district, and marched towards the same river. </p>                        </div>

He remained to guard the passage at the place where he saw <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had encamped; and sent guards to all the other parts of the river which were easily fordable, placing officers over each detachment, being resolved to obstruct the passage of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> saw this, he thought it advisable to move his army in various directions, to distract the attention of <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>, and render him uncertain what to do. Dividing his army into many parts, he led some of his troops now in one direction and now in another, at one time ravaging the enemy's country, at another looking out for a place where the river might appear easier for him to ford it. The rest of his troops he entrusted to his different generals, and sent them about in many directions. He also conveyed corn from all quarters into his camp from the land on this side the <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>, so that it might be evident to <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> that he had resolved to remain quiet near the bank until the water of the river subsided in the winter, and afforded him a passage in many places. As his vessels were sailing up and down the river, and skins were being filled with hay, and the whole bank appeared to be covered in one place with cavalry and in another with infantry, <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> was not allowed to keep at rest, or to bring his preparations together from all sides to any one point if he selected this as suitable for the defence of the passage. Besides at this season all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> rivers were flowing with swollen and turbid waters and with rapid currents; for it was the time of year when the sun is wont to turn towards the summer solstice. At this season incessant and heavy rain falls in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>; and the snows on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>, whence most of the rivers have their sources, melt and swell their streams to a great degree.

But he perceived that it was impossible for him to cross at the place where <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> himself had encamped near the bank of the <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>, not only on account of the multitude of his elephants, but also because his large army, arranged in order of battle and splendidly accoutred, was ready to attack his men as they emerged from the water. Moreover he thought that his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> would not be willing to mount the opposite bank, because the elephants would at once fall upon them and frighten them both by their aspect and trumpeting; nor even before that would they remain upon the inflated hides during the passage of the river; but when they looked across and saw the elephants they would become frantic and leap into the water. He therefore resolved to steal a crossing by the following manoeuvre: In the night he led most of his cavalry along the bank in various directions, making a clamour and raising the battle-cry in honour of <a href=/people/1664 target=_blank>Enyalius</a>. Every kind of noise was raised, as if they were making all the preparations necessary for crossing the river. <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> also marched along the river at the head of his elephants opposite the places where the clamour was heard, and <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> thus gradually got him into the habit of leading his men along opposite the noise. But when this occurred frequently, and there was merely a clamour and a raising of the battle-cry, <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> no longer continued to move about to meet the expected advance of the cavalry; but perceiving that his fear had been groundless, he kept his position in the camp. However he posted his scouts at many places along the bank. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had brought it about that the mind of <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> no longer entertained any fear of his nocturnal attempts, he devised the following stratagem. </p>                        </div>

It was densely covered by a grove, containing all sorts of trees; and over against it in the river was an island full of trees and without a foot-track, on account of its being uninhabited. Perceiving that this island was right in front of the headland, and that both the spots were woody and adapted to conceal his attempt to cross the river, he resolved to convey his army over at this place. The headland and island were 150 stades distant from his great camp. Along the whole of the bank, he posted sentries, separated as far as was consistent with keeping each other in sight, and easily hearing when any order should be sent along from any quarter. From all sides also during many nights clamours were raised and fires were burnt. But when he had made up his mind to undertake the passage of the river, he openly prepared his measures for crossing opposite the camp. <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> had been left behind at the camp with his own division of cavalry, and the horsemen from the Arachotians and <a href=/people/3653 target=_blank>Parapamisadians</a>, as well as the brigades of <a href=/people/738 target=_blank>Alcetas</a> and <a href=/people/1140 target=_blank>Polysperchon</a> from the phalanx of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> infantry, together with the chiefs of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> dwelling this side of the <a href=/people/2053 target=_blank>Hyphasis</a>, who had with them 5,000 men. He gave <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> orders not to cross the river before <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> moved off with his forces against them, or before he ascertained that <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> was in flight and that they were victorious. If however, said he, <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> should take only a part of his army and march against me, and leave the other part with the elephants in his camp, in that case do thou also remain in thy present position. But if he leads all his elephants with him against me, and a part of the rest of his army is left behind in the camp, then do thou cross the river with all speed. For it is the elephants alone, said he, which render it impossible for the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> to land on the other bank. The rest of the army can easily cross. </p>                        </div>

He then picked the select body-guard called the Companions, as well as the cavalry regiments of <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>, <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a>, and <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, the cavalry from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=place long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactria</a>, <a href=/people/5978 target=_blank>Sogdiana</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a>, and the Daan horse-archers; and from the phalanx of infantry the shield-bearing guards, the brigades of <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a> and <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a>, with the archers and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>, and made a secret march, keeping far away from the bank of the river, in order not to be seen marching towards the island and headland, from which he had determined to cross. There the skins were filled in the night with the hay which had been procured long before, and they were tightly stitched up. In the night a furious storm of rain occurred, by which his preparations and attempt to cross were rendered still more unobserved, since the noise of the thunder and the storm drowned with its din the clatter of the weapons and the noise which arose from the orders given by the officers. Most of the vessels, the thirty-oared galleys included with the rest, had been cut in pieces by his order and conveyed to this place, where they had been fixed together again and hidden in the wood. At the approach of daylight, both the wind and the rain calmed down; and the rest of the army went over opposite the island, the cavalry mounting upon the skins, and as many of the foot soldiers as the boats would receive getting into them. They went so secretly that they were not observed by the sentinels posted by <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>, before they had already got beyond the island and were only a little way from the other bank. </p>                        </div>

When the soldiers got beyond the island, they openly directed their course to the bank; and when the sentinels perceived that they had started, they at once rode off to <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> as fast as each man's <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> could gallop. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself was the first to land, and he at once took the cavalry as they kept on landing from his own and the other thirty-oared galleys, and drew them up in proper order. For the cavalry had received orders to land first; and at the head of these in regular array he advanced. But through ignorance of the locality he had effected a landing on ground which was not a part of the mainland, but an island, a large one indeed and where from the fact that it was an island, he more easily escaped notice. It was cut off from the rest of the land by a part of the river where the water was shallow. However, the furious storm of rain, which lasted the greater part of the night, had swelled the water so much that his cavalry could not find out the ford; and he was afraid that he would have to undergo another labour in crossing as great as the first. But when at last the ford was found, he led his men through it with much difficulty; for where the water was deepest, it reached higher than the breasts of the infantry; and of the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> only the heads rose above the river. When he had also crossed this piece of water, he selected the choice guard of cavalry, and the best men from the other cavalry regiments, and brought them up from column into line on the right wing. In front of all the cavalry he posted the horse-archers, and placed next to the cavalry in front of the other infantry the royal shield-bearing guards under the command of <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>. Near these he placed the royal foot-guard, and next to these the other shield-bearing guards, as each happened at the time to have the right of precedence.

He also instructed <a href=/people/8373 target=_blank>Tauron</a>, the commander of the archers, to lead them on also with speed to back up the cavalry. He had come to the conclusion that if <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> should engage him with all his forces, he would easily be able to overcome him by attacking with his cavalry, or to stand on the defensive until his infantry arrived in the course of the action; but if the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> should be alarmed at his extraordinary audacity in making the passage of the river and take to flight, he would be able to keep close to them in their flight, so that the slaughter of them in the retreat being greater, there would be only a slight work left for him. <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> says that the son of <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> arrived with about sixty chariots, before <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> made his later passage from the large island, and that he could have hindered <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s crossing (for he made the passage with difficulty even when no one opposed him); if the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> had leaped down from their chariots and assaulted those who first emerged from the water.

But <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, with whom I agree, gives a different account. This author also says that <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> despatched his son, but not at the head of merely sixty chariots; nor is it indeed likely that <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> hearing from his scouts that either <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself or at any rate a part of his army had effected the passage of the <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>, would despatch his son against him with only sixty chariots. These indeed were too many to be sent out as a reconnoitring party, and not adapted for speedy retreat; but they were by no means a sufficient force to keep back those of the enemy who had not yet got across, as well as to attack those who had already landed. <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> says that the son of <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> arrived at the head of 2000 cavalry and 120 chariots; but that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had already made even the last passage from the island before he appeared. </p>                        </div>

But as soon as he had ascertained with accuracy the number of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, he immediately made a rapid charge upon them with the cavalry around him. When they perceived that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself and the body of cavalry around him had made the assault, not in line of battle regularly formed, but by squadrons, they gave way; and 400 of their cavalry, including the son of <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>, fell in the contest. The chariots also were captured, <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and all, being heavy and slow in the retreat, and useless in the action itself on account of the clayey ground. When the horsemen who had escaped from this rout brought news to <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself had crossed the river with the strongest part of his army, and that his son had been slain in the battle, he nevertheless could not make up his mind what course to take, because the men who had been left behind under <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> were seen to be attempting to cross the river from the great camp which was directly opposite his position. However, at last he preferred to march against <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself with all his army, and to come into a decisive conflict with the strongest division of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, commanded by the king in person. But nevertheless he left a few of the elephants together with a small army there at the camp to frighten the cavalry under <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> from the bank of the river. He then took all his cavalry to the number of 4,000 men, all his chariots to the number of 300, with 200 of his elephants and 30,000 choice infantry, and marched against <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. When he found a place where he saw there was no clay, but that on account of the sand the ground was all level and hard, and thus fit for the advance and retreat of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, he there drew up his army. First he placed the elephants in the front, each animal being not less than a plethrum apart, so that they might be extended in the front before the whole of the phalanx of infantry, and produce terror everywhere among <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s cavalry. Besides he thought that none of the enemy would have the audacity to push themselves into the spaces between the elephants, the cavalry being deterred by the fright of their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>; and still less would the infantry do so, it being likely they would be kept off in front by the heavy-armed soldiers falling upon them, and trampled down by the elephants wheeling round against them. Near these he had posted the infantry, not occupying a line on a level with the beasts, but in a second line behind them, only so far distant that the companies of foot might be pushed forward a short distance into the spaces between them. He had also bodies of infantry standing beyond the elephants on the wings; and on both sides of the infantry he had posted the cavalry, in front of which were placed the chariots on both wings of his army. </p>                        </div>

On the contrary, he caused his infantry to rest until their strength was recruited, riding along round the lines to inspect them. When he had surveyed the arrangement of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, he resolved not to advance against the centre, in front of which the elephants had been posted, and in the gaps between them a dense phalanx of men; for he was alarmed at the very arrangements which <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> had made here with that express design. But as he was superior in the number of his cavalry, he took the greater part of that force, and marched along against the left wing of the enemy for the purpose of making an attack in this direction. Against the right wing he sent <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> with his own regiment of cavalry and that of <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, with instructions to keep close behind the barbarians when they, seeing the dense mass of cavalry opposed to them, should ride out to fight them. <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>, <a href=/people/1198 target=_blank>Antigenes</a>, and <a href=/people/8373 target=_blank>Tauron</a> were ordered to lead the phalanx of infantry, but not to engage in the action until they observed the enemy's cavalry and phalanx of infantry thrown into disorder by the cavalry under his own command.

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, observing this, were compelled to make the line of their cavalry face both ways; the largest and best part against <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, while the rest wheeled round against <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> and his forces. This therefore at once threw the ranks as well as the decisions of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> into confusion. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, seeing his opportunity, at the very moment the cavalry was wheeling round in the other direction, made an attack on those opposed to him with such vigour that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> could not sustain the charge of his cavalry, but were scattered and driven to the elephants, as to a friendly wall, for refuge. Upon this, the drivers of the elephants urged forward the beasts against the cavalry; but now the phalanx itself of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> was advancing against the elephants, the men casting darts at the riders and also striking the beasts themselves, standing round them on all sides. The action was unlike any of the previous contests; for wherever the beasts could wheel round, they rushed forth against the ranks of infantry and demolished the phalanx of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, dense as it was. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> cavalry also, seeing that the infantry were engaged in the action, rallied again and advanced against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> cavalry. But when <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s men, who far excelled both in strength and military discipline, got the mastery over them the second time, they were again repulsed towards the elephants and cooped up among them. By this time the whole of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s cavalry had collected into one squadron, not by any command of his, but having settled into this arrangement by the mere effect of the struggle itself; and wherever it fell upon the ranks of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> they were broken up with great slaughter. The beasts being now cooped up into a narrow space, their friends were no less injured by them than their foes, being trampled down in their wheeling and pushing about. Accordingly there ensued a great slaughter of the cavalry, cooped up as it was in a narrow space around the elephants. Most of the keepers of the elephants had been killed by the javelins, and some of the elephants themselves had been wounded, while others no longer kept apart in the battle on account of their sufferings or from being destitute of keepers. But, as if frantic with pain, rushing forward at friends and foes alike, they pushed about, trampled down and killed them in every kind of way. However, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> retired whenever they were assailed, for they rushed at the beasts in a more open space, and in accordance with their own plan; and when they wheeled round to return, they followed them closely and hurled javelins at them; whereas the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> retreating among them were now receiving greater injury from them. But when the beasts were tired out, and they were no longer able to charge with any vigour, they began to retire, facing the foe like ships backing water, merely uttering a shrill piping sound. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself surrounded the whole line with his cavalry, and gave the signal that the infantry should link their shields together so as to form a very densely closed body, and thus advance in phalanx. By this means the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> cavalry, with the exception of a few men, was quite cut up in the action; as was also the infantry, since the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> were now pressing upon them from all sides. Upon this, all who could do so turned to flight through the spaces which intervened between the parts of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s cavalry. </p>                        </div>

Of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> little short of 20,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry were killed in this battle.

All the elephants which were not killed there, were captured. Of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s forces, about 80 of the 6,000 foot-soldiers who were engaged in the first attack, were killed; 10 of the horse-archers, who were also the first to engage in the action; about 20 of the Companion cavalry, and about 200 of the other horsemen fell. When <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>, who exhibited great talent in the battle, performing the deeds not only of a general but also of a valiant soldier, observed the slaughter of his cavalry, and some of his elephants lying dead, others destitute of keepers straying about in a forlorn condition, while most of his infantry had perished, he did not depart as <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> the Great King did, setting an example of flight to his men; but as long as any body of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> remained compact in the battle, he kept up the struggle. But at last, having received a wound on the right shoulder, which part of his body alone was unprotected during the battle, he wheeled round. His coat of mail warded off the missiles from the rest of his body, being extraordinary both for its strength and the close fitting of its joints, as it was afterwards possible for those who saw him to observe. Then indeed he turned his elephant round and began to retire. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, having seen that he was a great man and valiant in the battle, was very desirous of saving his life. He accordingly sent first to him <a href=/people/1357 target=_blank>Taxiles</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=person long=74 lat=30>Indian</a>; who rode up as near to the elephant which was carrying <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> as seemed to him safe, and bade him stop the beast, assuring him that it was no longer possible for him to flee, and bidding him listen to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s message. But when he saw his old foe <a href=/people/1357 target=_blank>Taxiles</a>, he wheeled round and was preparing to strike him with a javelin; and he would probably have killed him, if he had not quickly driven his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> forward out of the reach of <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> before he could strike him.

He was also surprised that he did not seem to be cowed in spirit, but advanced to meet him as one brave man would meet another brave man, after having gallantly struggled in defence of his own kingdom against another king. Then indeed <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was the first to speak, bidding him say what treatment he would like to receive. The report goes that <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> replied: Treat me, O <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, in a kingly way! <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> being pleased at the expression, said: For my own sake, O <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>, thou shalt be thus treated; but for thy own sake do thou demand what is pleasing to thee! But <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> said that everything was included in that. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, being still more pleased at this remark, not only granted him the rule over his own <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, but also added another country to that which he had before, of larger extent than the former. Thus he treated the brave man in a kingly way, and from that time found him faithful in all things.

This <a href=/people/4904 target=_blank>Bucephalas</a> had shared many hardships and incurred many dangers with <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> during many years, being ridden by none but the king, because he rejected all other riders. He was both of unusual size and generous in mettle. The head of an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> had been engraved upon him as a distinguishing mark, and according to some this was the reason why he bore that name; but others say, that though he was black he had a white mark upon his head which bore a great resemblance to the head of an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>. In the land of the Uxians this <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> vanished from <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, who thereupon sent a proclamation throughout the country that he would kill all the inhabitants, unless they brought the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> back to him.

He then left <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> behind with a part of the army, to erect and fortify the cities which he was founding there; but he himself marched against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> conterminous with the dominion of <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>. According to <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> the name of this nation was Glauganicians; but <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> calls them Glausians. I am quite indifferent which name it bore. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> traversed their land with half the Companion cavalry, the picked men from each phalanx of the infantry, all the horse-bowmen, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>, and the archers. All the inhabitants came over to him on terms of capitulation; and he thus took thirty-seven cities, the inhabitants of which, where they were fewest, amounted to no less than 5,000, and those of many numbered above 10,000. He also took many villages, which were no less populous than the cities. This land also he granted to <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> to rule; and sent <a href=/people/1357 target=_blank>Taxiles</a> back to his own abode after affecting a reconciliation between him and <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>. At this time arrived envoys from Abisares, who told him that their king was ready to surrender himself and the land which he ruled. And yet before the battle which was fought between <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>, Abisares intended to join his forces with those of the latter. On this occasion he sent his brother with the other envoys to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, taking with them money and forty elephants as a gift. Envoys also arrived from the independent <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, and from a certain other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> ruler named <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ordered Abisares to come to him as soon as possible, threatening that unless he came he would see him arrive with his army at a place where he would not rejoice to see him. At this time <a href=/people/3451 target=_blank>Phrataphernes</a>, viceroy of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370546RHyr class=place long=54.6 lat=37>Hyrcania</a>, came to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> at the head of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> who had been left with him. Messengers also came from Sisicottus, viceroy of the <a href=/people/8903 target=_blank>Assacenians</a>, to inform him that those people had slain their governor and revolted from <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. Against these he despatched <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> and Tyriaspes with an army, to arrange and set in order the affairs of their land. He himself advanced towards the river <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a>. <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, has described the size of this river alone of those in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, stating that where <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> crossed it with his army upon boats and skins, the stream was rapid and the channel was full of large and sharp rocks, over which the water being violently carried seethed and dashed. He says also that its breadth amounted to fifteen stades; that those who went over upon skins had an easy passage; but that not a few of those who crossed in the boats perished there in the water, many of the boats being wrecked upon the rocks and dashed to pieces. From this description then it would be possible for one to come to a conclusion by comparison, that the size of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> has been stated not far from the fact by those who think that its mean breadth is forty stades, but that it contracts to fifteen stades where it is narrowest and therefore deepest; and that this is the width of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> in many places. I come then to the conclusion that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> chose a part of the <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a> where the passage was widest, so that he might find the stream slower than elsewhere. </p>                        </div>

He now sent <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> away to his own abode, commanding him to select the most warlike of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> and take all the elephants he had and come to him. He resolved to pursue the other <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>, the bad one, with the lightest troops in his army, because he was informed that he had left the land which he ruled and had fled. For this <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>, while hostilities subsisted between <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and the other <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>, sent envoys to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> offering to surrender both himself and the land subject to him, rather out of enmity to <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> than from friendship to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. But when he ascertained that the former had been released, and that he was ruling over another large country in addition to his own, then, fearing not so much <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> as the other <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>, his namesake, he fled from his own land, taking with him as many of his warriors as he could persuade to share his flight. Against this man <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> marched, and arrived at the <a href=/people/2109 target=_blank>Hydraotes</a>, which is another <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> river, not less than the <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a> in breadth, but less in swiftness of current. He traversed the whole country as far as the <a href=/people/2109 target=_blank>Hydraotes</a>, leaving garrisons in the most suitable places, in order that <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> and <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> might advance with safety, scouring most of the land for forage. Then he despatched <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> into the land of the <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> who had revolted, giving him a part of the army, comprising two brigades of infantry, his own regiment of cavalry with that of <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> and half of the archers, with instructions to hand the country over to the other <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>, to subdue any independent tribes of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> which dwelt near the banks of the river <a href=/people/2109 target=_blank>Hydraotes</a>, and to give them also into the hands of <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> to rule. He himself then crossed the river <a href=/people/2109 target=_blank>Hydraotes</a>, not with difficulty, as he had crossed the <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a>. As he was advancing into the country beyond the <a href=/people/2109 target=_blank>Hydraotes</a>, it happened that most of the people yielded themselves up on terms of capitulation; but some came to meet him with arms, while others who tried to escape he captured and forcibly reduced to obedience. </p>                        </div>

He was also informed that the city, <a href=/people/4679 target=_blank>Sangala</a> by name, near which they were thinking of having the struggle, was a strong one. The Cathaeans themselves were considered very daring and skilful in war; and two other tribes of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, the Oxydracians and Mallians, were in the same temper as the Cathaeans. For a short time before it happened that <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> and Abisares had marched against them with their own forces and had roused many other tribes of the independent <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> to arms, but were forced to retreat without effecting anything worthy of the preparations they had made. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was informed of this, he made a forced march against the Cathaeans, and on the second day after starting from the river <a href=/people/2109 target=_blank>Hydraotes</a> he arrived at a city called Pimprama, inhabited by a tribe of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> named Adraistaeans, who yielded to him on terms of capitulation. Giving his army a rest the next day, he advanced on the third day to <a href=/people/4679 target=_blank>Sangala</a>, where the Cathaeans and the other neighbouring tribes had assembled and marshalled themselves in front of the city upon a hill which was not precipitous on all sides. They had posted their waggons all round this hill and were encamping within them in such a way that they were surrounded by a triple palisade of waggons. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> perceived the great number of the barbarians and the nature of their position, he drew up his forces in the order which seemed to him especially adapted to his present circumstances, and sent his horse-archers at once without any delay against them, ordering them to ride along and shoot at them from a distance; so that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> might not be able to make any sortie, before his army was in proper array, and that even before the battle commenced they might be wounded within their stronghold. Upon the right wing he posted the guard of cavalry and the cavalry regiment of <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a>; next to these the shield-bearing guards, and then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>. Towards the left he had stationed <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a> with his own regiment of cavalry, and the battalions of foot Companions. The archers he divided into two parts and placed them on each wing. While he was marshalling his army, the infantry and cavalry of the rear-guard came up. Of these, he divided the cavalry into two parts and led them to the wings, and with the infantry which came up he made the ranks of the phalanx more dense and compact. He then took the cavalry which had been drawn up on the right, and led it towards the waggons on the left wing of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>; for here their position seemed to him more easy to assail, and the waggons had not been placed together so densely. </p>                        </div>

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> without difficulty forced the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> from the first row of waggons; but then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, taking their stand in front of the second row, more easily repulsed the attack, because they were posted in denser array in a smaller circle. Moreover the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> were attacking them likewise in a confined space, while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> were secretly creeping under the front row of waggons, and without regard to discipline were assaulting their enemy through the gaps left between the waggons as each man found a chance. But nevertheless even from these the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> were forcibly driven by the phalanx of infantry. They no longer made a stand at the third row, but fled as fast as possible into the city and shut themselves up in it. During that day <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> with his infantry encamped round the city, as much of it, at least, as his phalanx could surround; for he could not with his camp completely encircle the wall, so extensive was it. Opposite the part unenclosed by his camp, near which also was a lake, he posted the cavalry, placing them all round the lake, which he discovered to be shallow. Moreover, he conjectured that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, being terrified at their previous defeat, would abandon the city in the night; and it turned out just as he had conjectured; for about the second watch of the night most of them dropped down from the wall, but fell in with the sentinels of cavalry. The foremost of them were cut to pieces by these; but the men behind them perceiving that the lake was guarded all round, withdrew into the city again. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> now surrounded the city with a double stockade, except in the part where the lake shut it in, and round the lake he posted more perfect guards. He also resolved to bring military engines up to the wall, to batter it down. But some of the men in the city deserted to him, and told him that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> intended that very night to steal out of the city and escape by the lake, where the gap in the stockade existed.

When thou perceivest the barbarians forcing their way here, said he, do thou, with the army obstruct their advance, and order the bugler to give the signal. And do you, O officers, as soon as the signal has been given, each being arrayed in battle order with your own men, advance towards the noise, wherever the bugle summons you.

This his soldiers effected in the night. When it was about the fourth watch, the barbarians, just as <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had been informed, opened the gates towards the lake, and made a run in that direction. However they did not escape the notice of the guards there, nor that of <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, who had been placed behind them to render aid. But at this moment the buglers gave him the signal, and he advanced against the barbarians with his army fully equipped and drawn up in battle array. Moreover the waggons and the stockade which had been placed in the intervening space, were an obstruction to them. When the bugle sounded and <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> attacked them, killing the men as they kept on stealing out through the waggons, then indeed they were driven back again into the city; and in their retreat 500 of them were killed.

In the capture 17,000 of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> were killed, and above 70,000 were captured, besides 300 chariots and 500 cavalry. In the whole siege a little less than 100 of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s army were killed; but the number of the wounded was greater than the proportion of the slain, being more than 1,200, among whom were <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a>, the confidential body-guard, and other officers. After burying the dead according to his custom, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> sent <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a>, the secretary, with 300 cavalry to the two cities which had joined <a href=/people/4679 target=_blank>Sangala</a> in revolt, to tell those who held them about the capture of <a href=/people/4679 target=_blank>Sangala</a>, and to inform them that they would receive no harsh treatment from <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> if they stayed there and received him as a friend; for no harm had happened to any of the other independent <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> who had surrendered to him of their own accord. But they had become frightened, and had abandoned the cities and were fleeing; for the news had already reached them that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had taken <a href=/people/4679 target=_blank>Sangala</a> by storm. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was informed of their flight he pursued them with speed; but most of them were too quick for him, and effected their escape, because the pursuit began from a distant starting-place. But all those who were left behind in the retreat from weakness, were seized by the army and killed, to the number of about 500. Then, giving up the design of pursuing the fugitives any further, he returned to <a href=/people/4679 target=_blank>Sangala</a>, and razed the city to the ground. He added the land to that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> who had formerly been independent, but who had then voluntarily submitted to him.

It was also stated that the men of that district possessed a much greater number of elephants than the other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, and that those men were of very great stature, and excelled in valour. These reports excited in <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> an ardent desire to advance farther; but the spirit of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> now began to flag, when they saw the king raising one labour after another, and incurring one danger after another. Conferences were held throughout the camp, in which those who were the most moderate bewailed their lot, while others resolutely declared that they would not follow <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> any farther, even if he should lead the way. When he heard of this, before the disorder and pusillanimity of the soldiers should advance to a great degree, he called a council of the officers of the brigades and addressed them as follows: O <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> and Grecian allies, seeing that you no longer follow me into dangerous enterprises with a resolution equal to that which formerly animated you, I have collected you together into the same spot, so that I may either persuade you to march forward with me, or may be persuaded by you to return. If indeed the labours which you have already undergone up to our present position seem to you worthy of disapprobation, and if you do not approve of my leading you into them, there can be no advantage in my speaking any further.

I, for my part, think, that to a brave man there is no end to labours except the labours themselves, provided they lead to glorious achievements <br />But if any one desires to hear what will be the end to the warfare itself, let him learn that the distance still remaining before we reach the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/38898WGan class=place long=89.8009 lat=23.7818>Ganges</a> and the Eastern Sea is not great; and I inform you that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400516WHyr class=place long=51.6 lat=40>Hyrcanian Sea</a> will be seen to be united with this, because the Great Sea encircles the whole earth. I will also demonstrate both to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> and to the Grecian allies, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> Gulf is confluent with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400516WHyr class=place long=51.6 lat=40>Hyrcanian Sea</a> with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> Gulf. From the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> Gulf our expedition will sail round into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> as far as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361000LPHe class=place long=-5.3464 lat=36.123>Pillars of Heracles</a>. From the pillars all the interior of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> becomes ours, and so the whole of Asia will belong to us, and the limits of our empire, in that direction, will be those which God has made also the limits of the earth. But, if we now return, many warlike nations are left unconquered beyond the <a href=/people/2053 target=_blank>Hyphasis</a> as far as the Eastern Sea, and many besides between these and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370546RHyr class=place long=54.6 lat=37>Hyrcania</a> in the direction of the north wind, and not far from these the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> races. Wherefore, if we go back, there is reason to fear that the races which are now held in subjection, not being firm in their allegiance, may be excited to revolt by those who are not yet subdued. Then our many labours will prove to have been in vain; or it will be necessary for us to incur over again fresh labours and dangers, as at the beginning. But, O <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> and Grecian allies, stand firm! Glorious are the deeds of those who undergo labour and run the risk of danger; and it is delightful to live a life of valour and to die leaving behind immortal glory. Do ye not know that our ancestor reached so great a height of glory as from being a man to become a god, or to seem to become one, not by remaining in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376228PTir class=place long=22.7997 lat=37.6003>Tiryns</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>, or even in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a> or at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>? The labours of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> were not few, and he was too exalted a deity to be compared with <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>. But we, indeed, have penetrated into regions beyond <a href=/people/1673 target=_blank>Nysa</a>; and the rock of Aornus, which <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> was unable to capture, is in our possession. Do ye also add the parts of Asia still left unsubdued to those already acquired, the few to the many. But what great or glorious deed could we have performed, if, sitting at ease in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, we had thought it sufficient to preserve our own country without any labour, simply repelling the attacks of the nations on our frontiers, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425220RTri class=ethnic long=22 lat=42.5>Triballians</a>, or even those Greeks who were unfriendly to our interests? If, indeed, without undergoing labour and being free from danger I were acting as your commander, while you were undergoing labour and incurring danger, not without reason would you be growing faint in spirit and resolution, because you alone would be sharing the labours, while procuring the rewards of them for others. But now the labours are common to you and me, we have an equal share of the dangers, and the rewards are open to the free competition of all. For the land is yours, and you act as its viceroys. The greater part also of the money now comes to you; and when we have traversed the whole of Asia, then, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, not merely having satisfied your expectations, but having even exceeded the advantages which each man hopes to receive, those of you who wish to return home I will send back to their own land, or I will myself lead them back; while those who remain here, I will make objects of envy to those who go back. </p>                        </div>

Hereupon, he repeatedly urged any one who wished it, to speak, if he entertained different views from those which he had himself expressed. Nevertheless the silence still continued a long time; but at last, <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a>, son of <a href=/people/3238 target=_blank>Polemocrates</a>, plucked up courage and spoke as follows: O king, inasmuch as thou dost not wish to rule <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> by compulsion, but sayest thou wilt lead them by persuasion, or yielding to their persuasion wilt not use violence towards them, I am going to make a speech, not on my own behalf and that of my colleagues here present, who are held in greater honour than the other soldiers, and most of us have already carried off the rewards of our labours, and from our pre-eminence are more zealous than the rest to serve thee in all things; but I am going to speak on behalf of the bulk of the army. On behalf of this army I am not going to say what may be gratifying to the men, but what I consider to be both advantageous to thee at present, and safest for the future. I feel it incumbent upon me not to conceal what I think the best course to pursue, both on account of my age, the honour paid to me by the rest of the army at thy behest, and the boldness which I have without any hesitation displayed up to the present time in incurring dangers and undergoing labours. The more numerous and the greater the exploits have been, which were achieved by thee as our commander, and by those who started from home with thee, the more advantageous does it seem to me that some end should be put to our labours and dangers. For thou thyself seest how many <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> and Greeks started with thee, and how few of us have been left. Of our number thou didst well in sending back home the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> at once from <a href=/people/1066 target=_blank>Bactra</a>, because thou didst perceive that they were no longer eager to undergo labours. Of the other Greeks, some have been settled as colonists in the cities which thou hast founded; where they remain not indeed all of them of their own free will. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> soldiers and the other Greeks who still continued to share our labours and dangers, have either perished in the battles, become unfit for war on account of their wounds, or been left behind in the different parts of Asia. The majority, however, have perished from disease, so that few are left out of many; and these few are no longer equally vigorous in body, while in spirit they are much more exhausted. All those whose parents still survive, feel a great yearning to see them once more; they feel a yearning after their wives and children, and a yearning for their native land itself; which it is surely pardonable for them to yearn to see again with the honour and dignity they have acquired from thee, returning as great men, whereas they departed small, and as rich men instead of being poor. Do not lead us now against our will; for thou wilt no longer find us the same men in regard to dangers, since free-will will be wanting to us in the contests. But, rather, if it seem good to thee, return to thy own land, see thy mother, regulate the affairs of the Greeks, and carry to the home of thy fathers these victories so many and great. Then start afresh on another expedition, if thou wishest, against these very tribes of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> situated towards the east; or, if thou wishest, into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Euxine</a> Sea; or else against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carchedon</a> and the parts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> beyond the Carchedonians. It is now thy business to manage these matters; and the other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> and Greeks will follow thee, young men in place of old, fresh men in place of exhausted ones, and men to whom warfare has no terrors, because up to the present time they have had no experience of it; and they will be eager to set out, from hope of future reward. The probability also is, that they will accompany thee with still more zeal on this account, when they see that those who in the earlier expedition shared thy labours and dangers have returned to their own abodes as rich men instead of being poor, and renowned instead of being obscure as they were before. Self-control in the midst of success is the noblest of all virtues, O king! For thou hast nothing to fear from enemies, while thou art commanding and leading such an army as this; but the visitations of the deity are unexpected, and consequently men can take no precautions against them. </p>                        </div>

But the next day he called the same men together again in wrath, and told them that he intended to advance farther, but would not force any <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> to accompany him against his will; that he would have those only who followed their king of their own accord; and that those who wished to return home were at liberty to return and carry back word to their relations that they were come back, having deserted their king in the midst of his enemies. Having said this, he retired into his tent, and did not admit any of the Companions on that day, or until the third day from that, waiting to see if any change would occur in the minds of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> and Grecian allies, as is wont to happen, as a general rule among a crowd of soldiers, rendering them more disposed to obey.

Some of them even approached the royal tent, and prayed for many blessings upon <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; because by them alone he suffered himself to be conquered. Then he divided the army into brigades, and ordered twelve altars to be prepared, equal in height to very large towers, and in breadth much larger than towers, to serve as thank-offerings to the gods who had led him so far as a conqueror, and also to serve as monuments of his own labours. When the altars were completed, he offered sacrifice upon them according to his custom, and celebrated a gymnastic and equestrian contest. After adding the country as far as the river <a href=/people/2053 target=_blank>Hyphasis</a> to the dominion of <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>, he marched back to the <a href=/people/2109 target=_blank>Hydraotes</a>. Having crossed this river, he continued his return march to the <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a>, where he found the city which <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> had been ordered to fortify, quite built. In this city he settled as many of the neighbouring people as volunteered to live in it, as well as those of the Grecian mercenaries who were now unfit for military service; and then began to make the necessary preparations for a voyage down the river into the Great Sea. At this time <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a>, the ruler of the land bordering on that of Abisares, and the brother of the latter, with his other relations, came to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, bringing the gifts which are reckoned most valuable among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, including some elephants from Abisares, thirty in number. They declared that Abisares himself was unable to come on account of illness; and with these men the ambassadors sent by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> to Abisares agreed. Readily believing that such was the case, he granted that prince the privilege of ruling his own country as his viceroy, and placed <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a> also under his power. After arranging what tribute they were to pay, he again offered sacrifice near the river <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a>. He then crossed that river again, and came to the <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>, where he employed the army in repairing the damage caused to the cities of <a href=/people/1952 target=_blank>Nicaea</a> and <a href=/people/4904 target=_blank>Bucephala</a> by the rain, and put the other affairs of the country in order. </p>                        </div>

At first he thought he had discovered the origin of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, when he saw crocodiles in the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>, which he had seen in no other river except the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, as well as beans growing near the banks of the <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a> of the same kind as those which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> land produces. This conjecture was confirmed when he heard that the <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a> falls into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>. He thought the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> rises somewhere or other in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, and after flowing through an extensive tract of desert country loses the name of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> there; but afterwards when it begins to flow again through the inhabited land, it is called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> both by the Aethiopians of that district and by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, and finally empties itself into the Inner Sea. In like manner <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> made the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> give its name to the country of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. Accordingly when he wrote to <a href=/people/272 target=_blank>Olympias</a> about the country of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, after mentioning other things, he said that he thought he had discovered the sources of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, forming his conclusions about things so great from such small and trivial premisses. However, when he had made a more careful inquiry into the facts relating to the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>, he learned the following details from the natives: That the <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> unites its water with the <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a>, as the latter does with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>, and that they both yield up their names to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>; that the last-named river has two mouths, through which it discharges itself into the Great Sea; but that it has no connection with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> country. He then removed from the letter to his mother the part he had written about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>. Planning a voyage down the rivers as far as the Great Sea, he ordered ships for this purpose to be prepared for him. The crews of his ships were fully supplied from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=ethnic long=33 lat=35>Cyprians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=ethnic long=28.7 lat=37.01>Carians</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> who accompanied the army. </p>                        </div>

Then collecting the Companions and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> envoys who had come to him, he appointed <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> king of the part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> which had already been conquered, seven nations in all, containing more than 2,000 cities.

According to <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, whose statements I chiefly follow, the entire number of the ships was about eighty thirty-oared galleys; but the whole number of vessels, including the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> transports and boats, and all the other river craft, both those previously plying on the rivers and those built at that time, fell not far short of 2,000. </p>                        </div>

When he had embarked he poured a libation into the river from the prow of the ship out of a golden goblet, invoking the <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a> as well as the <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>, because he had ascertained that it is the largest of all the rivers which unite with the <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>, and that their confluence was not far off. He also invoked the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>, into which the <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a> flows after its junction with the <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>. Moreover he poured out libations to his forefather <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, to <a href=/people/577 target=_blank>Ammon</a>, and the other gods to whom he was in the habit of sacrificing, and then he ordered the signal for starting seawards to be given with the trumpet. As soon as the signal was given they commenced the voyage in regular order; for directions had been given at what distance apart it was necessary for the baggage vessels to be arranged, as also for the vessels conveying the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and for the ships of war; so that they might not fall foul of each other by sailing down the channel at random. He did not allow even the fast-sailing ships to get out of rank by outstripping the rest. The noise of the rowing was never equalled on any other occasion, inasmuch as it proceeded from so many ships rowed at the same time; also the shouting of the boatswains giving the time for beginning and stopping the stroke of the oars, and the clamour of the rowers, when keeping time all together with the dashing of the oars, made a noise like a battle-cry. The banks of the river also, being in many places higher than the ships, and collecting the sound into a narrow space, sent back to each other an echo which was very much increased by its very compression. In some parts too the groves of trees on each side of the river helped to swell the sound, both from the solitude and the reverberation of the noise. The <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> which were visible on the decks of the transports struck the barbarians who saw them with such surprise that those of them who were present at the starting of the fleet accompanied it a long way from the place of embarkation.

Here he remained two days, until <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> with the rest of the army came up with him. He then sent this general with the men he brought with him to the river <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a>, with orders to march along the bank of that river. He also sent <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> and <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> off again with instructions how they were to conduct the march. But he himself continued his voyage down the river <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>, the channel of which is nowhere less than twenty stades broad. Mooring his vessels near the banks wherever he could, he received some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> dwelling near into allegiance by their voluntary surrender, while he reduced by force those who came into a trial of strength with him. Then he sailed rapidly towards the country of the Mallians and Oxydracians, having ascertained that these tribes were the most numerous and the most warlike of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> in that region; and having been informed that they had put their wives and children for safety into their strongest cities, with the resolution of fighting a battle with him, he made the voyage with the greater speed with the express design of attacking them before they had arranged their plans, and while there was still lack of preparation and a state of confusion among them. Thence he made his second start, and on the fifth day reached the junction of the <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> and <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a>. Where these rivers unite, one very narrow river is formed out of the two; and on account of its narrowness the current is swift. There are also prodigious eddies in the whirling stream, and the water rises in waves and plashes exceedingly, so that the noise of the swell of waters is distinctly heard by people while they are still far off. These things had previously been reported to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> by the natives, and he had told his soldiers; and yet, when his army approached the junction of the rivers, the noise made by the stream produced so great an impression upon them that the sailors stopped rowing, not from any word of command, but because the very boatswains who gave the time to the rowers became silent from astonishment and stood aghast at the noise. </p>                        </div>

Being of a round form, the merchant vessels which happened to be whirled round by the current received no damage from the eddy, but the men who were on board were thrown into disorder and fright. For being kept upright by the force of the stream itself, these vessels settled again into the onward course. But the ships of war, being long, did not emerge so scatheless from the whirling current, not being raised aloft in the same way as the others upon the plashing swell of water. These ships had two ranks of oars on each side, the lower oars being only a little out of the water. These vessels getting athwart in the eddies, their oars could not be raised aloft in proper time and were consequently caught by the water and came into collision with each other. Thus many of the ships were damaged; two indeed fell foul of each other and were destroyed, and many of those sailing in them perished. But when the river widened out, there the current was no longer so rapid, and the eddies did not whirl round with so much violence. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> therefore moored his fleet on the right bank, where there was a protection from the force of the stream and a roadstead for the ships. A certain promontory also in the river jutted out conveniently for collecting the wrecks. He preserved the lives of the men who were still being conveyed upon them; and when he had repaired the damaged ships, he ordered <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a> to sail down the river until he reached the confines of the nation called Mallians. He himself made an inroad into the territories of the barbarians who would not yield to him, and after preventing them from succouring the Mallians, he again formed a junction with the naval armament. <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>, <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a>, and <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> had already united their forces here. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> then transported the elephants, the brigade of <a href=/people/1140 target=_blank>Polysperchon</a>, the horse-archers, and <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> with his army, across the river <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>, and instructed <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> to lead them. He sent <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a> with the fleet with orders to set sail three days before the army started. He divided the rest of his army into three parts, and ordered <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> to go five days in advance, so that if any should flee before the men under his own command and go rapidly forward they might fall in with <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>'s brigade and thus be captured. He also gave a part of the army to <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, with orders to follow him after the lapse of three days, so that all those who fled from him and turned back again might fall in with <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>'s brigade. He ordered those in advance to wait, when they arrived at the confluence of the rivers <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a> and <a href=/people/2109 target=_blank>Hydraotes</a>, until he himself came up; and he instructed <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> and <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> also to form a junction with him at the same place. </p>                        </div>

On the first day he encamped near a small piece of water which was about 100 stades distant from the river <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a>. Having dined there and caused his army to rest a short time, he ordered every man to fill whatever vessel he had with water. After travelling the remaining part of that day and all the ensuing night a distance of about 400 stades, he at daybreak reached the city into which many of the Mallians had fled for refuge. Most of them were outside the city and unarmed, supposing that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> would never come against them through the waterless country. It was evident that he led his army by this route for this very reason, because it was difficult to lead an army this way, and consequently it appeared incredible to the enemy that he would lead his forces in this direction. He therefore fell upon them unexpectedly, and killed most of them without their even turning to defend themselves, since they were unarmed. He cooped the rest up in the city, and posted his cavalry all round the wall, because the phalanx of infantry had not yet come up with him. He thus made use of his cavalry in place of a stockade. As soon as the infantry arrived, he sent <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a> with his own cavalry regiment and that of <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a>, as well as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>, against another city of the Mallians, whither many of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> of that region had fled for refuge. He ordered <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a> to blockade the men in the city, but not to commence the action until he himself should arrive, so that none might escape from this city and carry news to the rest of the barbarians that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was already approaching. He then began to assault the wall; but the barbarians abandoned it, finding that they were no longer able to defend it, since many had been killed in the capture, and others had been rendered unfit for fighting on account of their wounds. Fleeing for refuge into the citadel, they defended themselves for some time from a position commanding from its height and difficult of access.

There he ascertained that most of the Mallians had already crossed the river; but coming upon those who were still in the act of crossing, he slew many of them in their passage. Having crossed with them in pursuit without any delay by the same ford, he kept close up with those who had outstripped him in their retreat. Many also of these he slew; some he took prisoners; but the majority of them escaped into a place strong by nature and made more so by fortifications. When the infantry reached him, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> despatched <a href=/people/2772 target=_blank>Peithon</a> against the men in the fortress, giving him the command of his own brigade of infantry and two regiments of cavalry. These, attacking the place, took it at the first assault, and made slaves of all those who had fled thither for safety, at least as many of them as had not perished in the attack. After accomplishing this, <a href=/people/2772 target=_blank>Peithon</a> returned again to the camp. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> in person led his forces against a certain city of the <a href=/people/6301 target=_blank>Brachmans</a>, because he ascertained that some of the Mallians had fled for refuge into it. When he reached it, he led his phalanx in serried ranks close up to the wall on all sides. The enemy seeing that their walls were being undermined, and being themselves repulsed by the missiles, abandoned the walls, and having fled for safety into the citadel, began to defend themselves from thence. A few <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> having rushed in with them, turning round and drawing together into a close body, drove some of them back and killed five-and-twenty of them in their retreat. Hereupon <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ordered the scaling-ladders to be placed against the citadel on all sides, and the wall to be undermined; and when one of the towers, being undermined, fell down, and a part of the wall between two towers was breached, and thus rendered the citadel more accessible to assault in this quarter, he was seen to be the first man to scale the wall and get hold of it. The other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> seeing him were ashamed of themselves and mounted the ladders in various places. The citadel was soon in their possession. Some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> began to set fire to the houses, and being caught in them were killed; but most of them were slain fighting.

He found the cities abandoned, and ascertained that the men had fled into the desert. There he again gave the army one day's rest, and on the next day sent <a href=/people/2772 target=_blank>Peithon</a> and <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> the cavalry general back to the river, in command of their own troops, giving them in addition as many battalions of the light-armed infantry as were sufficient for the enterprise. Their instructions were to go along the bank of the river, and if they met any of those who had fled for safety into the woods, of which there were many near the river's bank, to kill all who refused to surrender. <a href=/people/2772 target=_blank>Peithon</a> and <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> captured many of these in the woods and killed them. He himself led his forces against the largest city of the Mallians, whither he was informed many from the other cities had taken refuge. But this also the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> abandoned when they heard that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was marching against it. Crossing the river <a href=/people/2109 target=_blank>Hydraotes</a>, they remained with their forces drawn up upon its bank, because it was high, and they thought they could obstruct <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s passage. When he heard this, he took all the cavalry which he had with him, and went to the part of the river where he was informed that the Mallians had drawn themselves up for battle; and the infantry was ordered to follow. When he reached the river and beheld the enemy drawn up on the opposite bank, he made no delay, but instantly plunged into the ford with the cavalry alone. When they saw that he was now in the middle of the river, though they were drawn up ready for battle, they withdrew from the bank with all speed; and <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> followed them with his cavalry alone. But when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> perceived only cavalry, they wheeled round and fought with desperate valour, being about 50,000 in number. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> perceived that their phalanx was densely compact, and that his own infantry was absent, he rode right round their army and made charges upon them, but did not come to close fighting with them. Meanwhile the archers, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a> and the other battalions of light-armed infantry, being picked men whom he was leading with him, arrived, and his phalanx of infantry was seen not far off. As all kinds of danger were threatening them at once, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> now wheeled round again and began to flee with headlong speed into the strongest of their adjacent cities; but <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> followed them and slew many, while those who escaped into the city were cooped up within it. At first indeed he surrounded the city with the horse-soldiers as they came up from the march; but when the infantry arrived, he encamped all round the wall for this day, because not much of it was left for making the assault, and his army had been exhausted, the infantry by the long march, and the cavalry by the uninterrupted pursuit, and especially by the passage of the river. </p>                        </div>

Upon this the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> did not wait to receive the attack of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, but abandoned the walls of the city and fled for safety into the citadel. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and his troops therefore split open a small gate, and got within the city long before the others; for those who had been put under <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a> were behind time, having experienced difficulty in scaling the walls, as most of them did not bring ladders, thinking that the city had been captured, when they observed that the walls were deserted by the defenders. But when the citadel was seen to be still in the possession of the enemy, and many of them were observed drawn up in front of it to repel attacks, some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> tried to force an entry by undermining the wall, and others by placing scaling ladders against it, wherever it was practicable to do so. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, thinking that the men who carried the ladders were too slow, snatched one from a man who was carrying it, placed it against the wall, and began to mount it, crouching under his shield. After him mounted <a href=/people/1899 target=_blank>Peucestas</a>, the man who carried the sacred shield which <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> took from the temple of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=person long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> and used to keep with him, and have it carried before him in all his battles. After <a href=/people/1899 target=_blank>Peucestas</a>, by the same ladder ascended <a href=/people/1114 target=_blank>Leonnatus</a> the confidential body-guard; and up another ladder went <a href=/people/6155 target=_blank>Abreas</a>, one of the soldiers who received double pay for distinguished services. The king was now near the battlement of the wall, and leaning his shield against it was pushing some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> within the fort, and had cleared that part of the wall, by killing others with his sword. The shield-bearing guards becoming very anxious for the king's safety, pushed each other with ardour up the same ladder and broke it; so that those who were already mounting fell down and made the ascent impracticable for the rest. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> then, standing upon the wall, was being assailed all round from the adjacent towers; for none of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> dared approach him. He was also being assailed by the men in the city, who were throwing darts at him from no great distance; for a mound of earth happened to have been heaped up there opposite the wall. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was conspicuous both by the brightness of his weapons and by his extraordinary display of audacity. He therefore perceived that if he remained where he was, he would be incurring danger without being able to perform anything at all worthy of consideration; but if he leaped down within the fort he might perhaps by this very act strike the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> with terror, and if he did not, but should only thereby be incurring danger, at any rate he would die not ignobly after performing great deeds of valour worthy of recollection by men of after times. Forming this resolution, he leaped down from the wall into the citadel; where, supporting himself against the wall, he struck with his sword and killed some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> who came to close quarters with him, including their leader, who rushed upon him too boldly. Another man who approached him he kept in check by hurling a stone at him, and a third in like manner. Those who advanced nearer to him he again kept off with his sword; so that the barbarians were no longer willing to approach him, but standing round him cast at him from all sides whatever any one happened to have or could get hold of at the time. </p>                        </div>

But although he was faint with exhaustion, he defended himself, as long as his blood was still warm. But the blood streaming out copiously and without ceasing at every expiration of breath, he was seized with a dizziness and swooning, and bending over fell upon his shield. After he had fallen <a href=/people/1899 target=_blank>Peucestas</a> defended him, holding over him in front the sacred shield brought from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>; and on the other side he was defended by <a href=/people/1114 target=_blank>Leonnatus</a>.

For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> had experienced great difficulty in the assault also on this account, because those who saw <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> being shot at upon the wall and then leaping down into the citadel within, in their ardour arising from fear lest their king should meet with any mishap by recklessly exposing himself to danger, broke the ladders. Then some began to devise one plan and others another to mount upon the wall, as well as they could in their state of embarrassment, some fixing pegs into the wall, which was made of earth, and suspending themselves from these hoisted themselves up with difficulty by their means; others got up by mounting one upon the other. The first man who got up threw himself down from the wall into the city, and so on in succession; and when they saw the king lying there on the ground they all raised a loud lamentation and howl of grief.

In the meantime some of the soldiers having shivered in pieces the bar by which the gate in the space of wall between the towers was secured, entered the city a few at the time; while others, inasmuch as a gap had been made in the gate, put their shoulders under it and forced it into the space inside the wall, and thus laid the citadel open in that quarter. </p>                        </div>

Others carried off the king, who was lying in a faint condition, upon his shield; and they could not yet tell whether he was likely to survive. Some authors have stated that <a href=/people/4946 target=_blank>Critodemus</a>, a physician of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369273PKos class=place long=27.2859 lat=36.8914>Cos</a>, an <a href=/people/625 target=_blank>Asclepiad</a> by birth, made an incision into the injured part and drew the weapon out of the wound. Other authors say that as there was no physician present at the critical moment, <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a>, the confidential body-guard, at <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s bidding, made an incision with his sword into the wounded part and removed the weapon. On its removal there was such a copious effusion of blood that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> swooned again; and the effect of the swoon was, that the effusion of blood was stanched. Many other things concerning this catastrophe have been recorded by the historians; and <a href=/people/1271 target=_blank>Rumour</a> having received the statements as they were given by the first falsifiers of the facts, still preserves them even to our times, nor will she desist from handing the falsehoods on to others also in regular succession, unless a stop is put to it by this history. For example, the common account is, that this calamity befell <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> among the Oxydracians; whereas, it really occurred among the Mallians, an independent tribe of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>; the city belonged to the Mallians, and the men who wounded him were Mallians. These people, indeed, had resolved to join their forces with the Oxydracians and then to make a desperate struggle; but he forestalled them by marching against them through the waterless country, before any aid could reach them from the Oxydracians, or they could render any help to the latter. Moreover, the common account is, that the last battle fought with <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> was near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362440UArb class=place long=44.009 lat=36.191>Arbela</a>, at which battle he fled and did not desist from flight until he was arrested by <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a> and put to death at <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s approach; just as the battle before this was at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368362UIss class=place long=36.216 lat=36.752>Issus</a>, and the first cavalry battle near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403273WGra class=place long=27.2716 lat=40.3067>Granicus</a>. The cavalry battle did really take place near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403273WGra class=place long=27.2716 lat=40.3067>Granicus</a>, and the next battle with <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368362UIss class=place long=36.216 lat=36.752>Issus</a>; but those authors who make <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362440UArb class=place long=44.009 lat=36.191>Arbela</a> most distant say that it is 600 stades distant from the place where the last battle between <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> was fought, while those who make it least distant, say that it is 500 stades off. Moreover, <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> and <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> say that the battle was fought at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/366435UGau class=place long=43.481 lat=36.593>Gaugamela</a> near the river Bumodus. But as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/366435UGau class=place long=43.481 lat=36.593>Gaugamela</a> was not a city, but only a large village, the place is not celebrated, nor is the name pleasing to the ear; hence, it seems to me, that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362440UArb class=place long=44.009 lat=36.191>Arbela</a>, being a city, has carried off the glory of the great battle. But if it is necessary to consider that this engagement took place near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362440UArb class=place long=44.009 lat=36.191>Arbela</a>, being in reality so far distant from it, then it is allowable to say that the sea-battle fought at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380236ASSB class=place long=23.573 lat=37.952>Salamis</a> occurred near the isthmus of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=ethnic long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthians</a>, and that fought at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390232SArt class=place long=23.217 lat=39.0097>Artemisium</a>, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a>, occurred near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig class=place long=23.425 lat=37.75>Aegina</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376240LSou class=place long=24.0247 lat=37.6498>Sunium</a>. Moreover, in regard to those who covered <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> with their shields in his peril, all agree that <a href=/people/1899 target=_blank>Peucestas</a> did so; but they no longer agree in regard to <a href=/people/1114 target=_blank>Leonnatus</a> or <a href=/people/6155 target=_blank>Abreas</a>, the soldier in receipt of double pay for his distinguished services. Some say that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, having received a blow on the head with a piece of wood, fell down in a fit of dizziness; and that having risen again he was wounded with a dart through the corselet in the chest. But <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, says that he received only this wound in the chest. However, in my opinion, the greatest error made by those who have written the history of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> is the following. There are some who have recorded that <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, in company with <a href=/people/1899 target=_blank>Peucestas</a>, mounted the ladder with <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; that <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> held his shield over him when he lay wounded, and that he was called <a href=/people/1517 target=_blank>Soter</a> (the preserver) on that account. And yet <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> himself has recorded that he was not even present at this engagement, but was fighting battles against other barbarians at the head of another army. Let me mention these facts as a digression from the main narrative, so that the correct account of such great deeds and calamities may not be a matter of indifference to men of the future. </p>                        </div>

When they ceased their lamentation, they became spiritless, and felt perplexed as to the man who was to become the leader of the army; for many of the officers seemed to have stood in equal rank and merit, both in the opinion of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and in that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>. They were also in a state of perplexity how to get back in safety to their own country, being quite enclosed by so many warlike nations, some of whom had not yet submitted, and who they conjectured would fight stoutly for their freedom; while others would no doubt revolt as soon as they were relieved of their fear of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. Besides, they seemed at that time to be in the midst of impassable rivers, and all things appeared to them uncertain and impracticable now that they were bereft of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. But when at length the news came that he was still alive, they with difficulty acquiesced in it; and did not yet believe that he was likely to survive. Even when a letter came from the king, saying that he was coming down to the camp in a short time, this did not appear to most of them worthy of credit, on account of their excessive fear; for they conjectured that the letter was concocted by his confidential body-guards and generals. </p>                        </div>

For the camp was at the confluence of the <a href=/people/2109 target=_blank>Hydraotes</a> and <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a>, where <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> was at the head of the army, and <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a> of the fleet. When the ship bearing the king approached the camp, he ordered the tent covering to be removed from the stern, that he might be visible to all. But they were still incredulous, thinking, forsooth, that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s corpse was being conveyed on the vessel; until at length he stretched out his hand to the multitude, when the ship was nearing the bank. Then the men raised a cheer, lifting their hands, some towards the sky and others to the king himself. Many even shed involuntary tears at the unexpected sight. Some of the shield-bearing guards brought a litter for him when he was conveyed out of the ship; but he ordered them to fetch his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. When he was seen again mounting his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, the whole army re-echoed with loud clapping of hands, so that the banks of the river and the groves near them reverberated with the sound. On approaching his tent he dismounted from his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, so that he might be seen walking. Then the men came near, some on one side, others on the other, some touching his hands, others his knees, others only his clothes. Some only came close to get a sight of him, and went away having chanted his praise, while others threw garlands upon him, or the flowers which the country of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> supplied at that season of the year. <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a> says that some of his friends incurred his displeasure, reproaching him for exposing himself to danger in the front of the army in battle; which they said was the duty of a private soldier, and not that of the general. It seems to me that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was offended at these remarks, because he knew that they were correct, and that he deserved the censure. However, like those who are mastered by any other pleasure, he had not sufficient self-control to keep aloof from danger, through his impetuosity in battle and his passion for glory. <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a> also says that a certain old <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=demonym long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotian</a>, whose name he does not mention, perceiving that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was offended at the censures of his friends and was looking sullenly at them, came near him, and speaking in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=demonym long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotian</a> dialect, said: O <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, it is the part of heroes to perform great deeds! and repeated a certain Iambic verse, the purport of which is, that the man who performs anything great is destined also to suffer. This man was not only acceptable to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> at the time, but was afterwards received into his more intimate acquaintance. </p>                        </div>

They said that their error in not having sent an embassy to him before was pardonable, because they excelled other races in the desire to be free and independent, and their freedom had been secure from the time <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> came into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> until <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> came; but if it seemed good to him, inasmuch as there was a general report that he also was sprung from gods, they were willing to receive whatever viceroy he might appoint, pay the tribute decreed by him, and give him as many hostages as he might demand. He therefore demanded the thousand best men of the nation, whom he might hold as hostages, if he pleased; and if not, that he might keep them as soldiers in his army, until he had finished the war which he was waging against the other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>. They accordingly selected the thousand best and tallest men of their number, and sent them to him, together with 500 chariots and charioteers, though these were not demanded. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> appointed <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> viceroy over these people and the Mallians who were still surviving. He sent back the hostages to them, but retained the chariots. When he had satisfactorily arranged these matters, since many vessels had been built during the delay arising from his being wounded, he embarked 1,700 of the cavalry Companions, as many of the light-armed troops as before, and 10,000 infantry, and sailed a short distance down the river <a href=/people/2109 target=_blank>Hydraotes</a>. But when that river mingled its waters with the <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a>, the latter giving its name to the united stream, he continued his voyage down the <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a>, until he reached its junction with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>. For these four large rivers, which are all navigable, discharge their water into the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>, though each does not retain its distinct name. For the <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> discharges itself into the <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a>, and after the junction the whole stream forms what is called the <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a>. Again this same river unites with the <a href=/people/2109 target=_blank>Hydraotes</a>, and after absorbing this river, still retains its own name.

From this point I have no doubt that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> proceeds 100 stades, and perhaps more, before it is divided so as to form the Delta; and there it spreads out more like a lake than a river. </p>                        </div>

Meantime, he was joined by other thirty-oared galleys and trading vessels which had been built for him among the Xathrians, another independent tribe of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> who had yielded to him. From the Ossadians, who were also an independent tribe of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, came envoys to offer the submission of their nation. Having fixed the confluence of the <a href=/people/1284 target=_blank>Acesines</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> as the limit of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>'s viceroyalty, he left with him all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> and as many men from the infantry regiments as appeared to him sufficient to provide for the security of the country. He then ordered a city to be founded there at the very junction of the two rivers, expecting that it would become large and famous among men. He also ordered a dockyard to be made there. At this time the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=person long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrian</a> <a href=/people/1954 target=_blank>Oxyartes</a>, father of his wife <a href=/people/1966 target=_blank>Roxana</a>, came to him, to whom he gave the viceroyalty over the <a href=/people/3653 target=_blank>Parapamisadians</a>, after dismissing the former viceroy, Tiryaspes, because he was reported to be exercising his authority improperly. Then he transported <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> with the main body of the army and the elephants to the left bank of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>, both because it seemed easier for a heavy-armed force to march along that side of the river, and the tribes dwelling near were not quite friendly. He himself sailed down to the capital of the <a href=/people/5978 target=_blank>Sogdians</a>; where he fortified another city, made another dockyard, and repaired his shattered vessels.

He advanced against this king because he had not yet come to meet him to offer the submission of himself and his land, nor had he sent envoys to seek his alliance. He had not even sent him the gifts which were suitable for a great king, or asked any favour from him. He accelerated his voyage down the river to such a degree that he succeeded in reaching the confines of the land of <a href=/people/2764 target=_blank>Musicanus</a> before he had even heard that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had started against him. <a href=/people/2764 target=_blank>Musicanus</a> was so greatly alarmed that he went as fast as he could to meet him, bringing with him the gifts valued most highly among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, and taking all his elephants. He offered to surrender both his nation and himself, at the same time acknowledging his error, which was the most effectual way with <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> for any one to get what he requested. Accordingly for these considerations <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> granted him an indemnity for his offences. He also granted him the privilege of ruling the city and country, both of which <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> admired. <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> was directed to fortify the citadel in the capital; which was done while <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was still present.

Certain of the native barbarians attacked these men, and falling upon them unawares slew some of them; but having lost many of their own men, they fled into the desert. The work was therefore accomplished by those who had been sent out, another army having joined them, which <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had despatched to take part in the work, when he heard of the attack of the barbarians. Near Patala the water of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> is divided into two large rivers, both of which retain the name of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> as far as the sea. Here <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> constructed a harbour and dockyard; and when his works had advanced towards completion he resolved to sail down as far as the mouth of the right branch of the river. He gave <a href=/people/1114 target=_blank>Leonnatus</a> the command of 1,000 cavalry and 8,000 heavy and light-armed infantry, and sent him to march through the island of Patala opposite the naval expedition; while he himself took the fastest sailing vessels, having one and a half bank of oars, all the thirty-oared galleys, and some of the boats, and began to sail down the right branch of the river. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> of that region had fled, and consequently he could get no pilot for the voyage, and the navigation of the river was very difficult. On the day after the start a storm arose, and the wind blowing right against the stream made the river hollow and shattered the hulls of the vessels violently, so that most of his ships were injured, and some of the thirty-oared galleys were entirely broken up. But they succeeded in running them aground before they quite fell to pieces in the water; and others were therefore constructed. He then sent the quickest of the light-armed troops into the land beyond the river's bank and captured some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, who from this time piloted him down the channel. But when they arrived at the place where the river expands, so that where it was widest it extended 200 stades, a strong wind blew from the outer sea, and the oars could hardly be raised in the swell; they therefore took refuge again in a canal into which his pilots conducted them. </p>                        </div>

This caused <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and his companions no small alarm, inasmuch as they were previously quite unacquainted with it. But they were much more alarmed when, the time coming round again, the water approached and the hulls of the vessels were raised aloft. The ships which it caught settled in the mud were raised aloft without any damage, and floated again without receiving any injury; but those that had been left on the drier land and had not a firm settlement, when an immense compact wave advanced, either fell foul of each other or were dashed against the land and thus shattered to pieces. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had repaired these vessels as well as his circumstances permitted, he sent some men on in advance down the river in two boats to explore the island at which the natives said he must moor his vessels in his voyage to the sea. They told him that the name of the island was Cilluta. As he was informed that there were harbours in this island, that it was a large one and had plenty of water in it, he made the rest of his fleet put in there; but he himself with the best sailing ships advanced beyond, to see if the mouth of the river afforded an easy voyage out into the open sea. After advancing about 200 stades from the first island, they descried another which was quite out in the sea. Then indeed they returned to the island in the river; and having moored his vessels near the extremity of it, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> offered sacrifice to those gods to whom he said he had been directed by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/292255SAmm class=place long=25.5435 lat=29.2052>Ammon</a> to sacrifice. On the following day he sailed down to the other island which was in the deep sea; and having come to shore here also, he offered other sacrifices to other gods and in another manner. These sacrifices he also offered according to the oracular instructions of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/292255SAmm class=place long=25.5435 lat=29.2052>Ammon</a>.

There he sacrificed some <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> to <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> and cast them into the sea; and having poured out a libation after the sacrifice, he threw the goblet and bowls, which were golden, into the deep as thank-offerings, praying the god to escort safely for him the fleet, which he intended to despatch to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> Gulf and the mouths of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a>. </p>                        </div>

He ordered <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> to prepare what was needful for the fortification of a naval station and the construction of dockyards; for he resolved to leave behind here a fleet of many ships near the city of Patala, where the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> divides itself into two streams. He himself sailed down again into the Great Sea by the other mouth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>, to ascertain which branch of the river is easier to navigate. The mouths of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> are about 1800 stades distant from each other. In the voyage down he arrived at a large lake in the mouth of the river, which the river makes by spreading itself out; or perhaps the waters of the surrounding district draining into it make it large, so that it very much resembles a gulf of the sea. For in it were seen fish like those in the sea, larger indeed than those in our sea. Having moored his ships then in this lake, where the pilots directed, he left there most of the soldiers and all the boats with <a href=/people/1114 target=_blank>Leonnatus</a>; but he himself with the thirty-oared galleys and the vessels with one and a half row of oars passed beyond the mouth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>, and advancing into the sea also this way, ascertained that the outlet of the river on this side (i.e. the west) was easier to navigate than the other. He moored his ships near the shore, and taking with him some of the cavalry went along the sea-coast three days' journey, exploring what kind of country it was for a coasting voyage, and ordering wells to be dug, so that the sailors might have water to drink. He then returned to the ships and sailed back to Patala; but he sent a part of his army along the sea-coast to effect the same thing, instructing them to return to Patala when they had dug the wells. Sailing again down to the lake, he there constructed another harbour and dockyard; and leaving a garrison for the place, he collected sufficient food to supply the army for four months, as well as whatever else he could procure for the coasting voyage. </p>                        </div>

Moreover it was reported that there the sea was fit for navigation after the beginning of winter, from the setting of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> until the winter solstice; for at that season mild breezes usually blow from the land, drenched as it has been with great rains; and these winds are convenient on a coasting voyage both for oars and sails. <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a>, who had been placed in command of the fleet, waited for the coasting season; but <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, starting from Patala, advanced with all his army as far as the river <a href=/people/6227 target=_blank>Arabius</a>. He then took half of the shield-bearing guards and archers, the infantry regiments called foot Companions, the guard of the Companion cavalry, a squadron of each of the other cavalry regiments, and all the horse-bowmen, and turned away thence on the left towards the sea to dig wells, so that there might be abundance of them for the fleet sailing along on the coasting voyage; and at the same time to make an unexpected attack upon the Oritians, a tribe of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> in this region, which had long been independent. This he meditated doing because they had performed no friendly act either to himself or his army. He placed <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> in command of the forces left behind. The Arabitians, another independent tribe dwelling near the river <a href=/people/6227 target=_blank>Arabius</a>, thinking that they could not cope with <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> in battle, and yet being unwilling to submit to him, fled into the desert when they heard that he was approaching. But crossing the river <a href=/people/6227 target=_blank>Arabius</a>, which was both narrow and shallow, and travelling by night through the greater part of the desert, he came near the inhabited country at daybreak. Then ordering the infantry to follow him in regular line, he took the cavalry with him, dividing it into squadrons, that it might occupy a very large part of the plain, and thus marched into the land of the Oritians. All those who turned to defend themselves were cut to pieces by the cavalry, and many of the others were taken prisoners. He then encamped near a small piece of water; but when <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> formed a junction with him, he advanced farther. Arriving at the largest village of the tribe of the Oritians, which was called <a href=/people/10177 target=_blank>Rhambacia</a>, he commended the place and thought that if he colonized a city there it would become great and prosperous.

They had indeed marshalled themselves there; but when it was reported that he was already approaching, most of them fled from the pass, deserting their guard. The chiefs of the Oritians, however, came to him, offering to surrender both themselves and their nation. He instructed these to collect the multitude of their people together and send them to their own abodes, since they were not about to suffer any harm. Over these people he placed <a href=/people/978 target=_blank>Apollophanes</a> as viceroy, and with him he left <a href=/people/1114 target=_blank>Leonnatus</a> the confidential body-guard in Ora, at the head of all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425230RAgr class=ethnic long=23 lat=42.5>Agrianians</a>, some of the bowmen and cavalry, and the rest of the Grecian mercenary infantry and cavalry. He instructed him to wait until the fleet had sailed round the land, to colonize the city, and to regulate the affairs of the Oritians so that they might pay the greater respect to the viceroy. He himself, with the main body of the army (for <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> had arrived at the head of the men who had been left behind), advanced into the land of the Gadrosians by a route most of which was desert. <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> says that in this desert many myrrh-trees grew, larger than the ordinary kind; and that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a>, who accompanied the army for trafficking, gathered the gum of myrrh, and loading the beasts of burden, carried it away. For there was a great quantity of it, inasmuch as it exuded from large stems and had never before been gathered. He also says that this desert produces many odoriferous roots of nard, which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a> likewise gathered; but much of it was trampled down by the army, and a sweet perfume was diffused far and wide over the land by the trampling; so great was the abundance of it. In the desert there were also other kinds of trees, one of which had foliage like that of the bay-tree, and grew in places washed by the waves of the sea. These trees were on ground which was left dry by the ebb-tide; but when the water advanced they looked as if they had grown in the sea. Of others the roots were always washed by the sea, because they grew in hollow places, from which the water could not retire; and yet the trees were not destroyed by the sea. Some of these trees in this region were even thirty cubits high. At that season they happened to be in bloom; and the flower was very much like the white violet, but the perfume was far superior to that of the latter. There was also another thorny stalk growing out of the earth, the thorn on which was so strong that, piercing the clothes of some men just riding past, it pulled the horseman down from his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> rather than be itself torn off the stalk. It is also said that when hares run past these bushes, the thorns cling to their fur; and thus these animals are caught, as birds are with bird-lime, or fish with hooks. However they were easily cut through with steel; and when the thorns are cut the stalk gives forth much juice, still more abundantly than fig-trees do in the springtime, and more pungent. </p>                        </div>

Moreover they were compelled to march most of the way by night, and a great distance from the sea. However he was very desirous of coming to the part of the country along the sea, both to see what harbours were there, and to make what preparations he could on his march for the fleet, either by employing his men in digging wells, or by making arrangements somewhere for a market and anchorage. But the part of the country of the Gadrosians near the sea was entirely desert. He therefore sent <a href=/people/533 target=_blank>Thoas</a>, son of Mandrodorus, with a few horsemen down to the sea, to reconnoitre and see if there happened to be any haven anywhere near, or whether there was water or any other of the necessaries of life not far from the sea. This man returned and reported that he found some fishermen upon the shore living in stifling huts, which were made by putting together mussel-shells, and the back-bones of fishes were used to form the roofs. He also said that these fishermen used little water, obtaining it with difficulty by scraping away the gravel, and that what they got was not at all fresh. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> reached a certain place in Gadrosia, where corn was more abundant, he seized it and placed it upon the beasts of burden; and marking it with his own seal, he ordered it to be conveyed down to the sea. But while he was marching to the halting stage nearest to the sea, the soldiers paying little regard to the seal, the guards made use of the corn themselves, and gave a share of it to those who were especially pinched with hunger. To such a degree were they overcome by their misery that after mature deliberation they resolved to take account of the visible and already impending destruction rather than the danger of incurring the king's wrath, which was not before their eyes and still remote. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ascertained the necessity which constrained them so to act, he pardoned those who had done the deed. He himself hastened forward to collect from the land all he could for victualling the army which was sailing round with the fleet; and sent <a href=/people/1490 target=_blank>Cretheus</a> the Callatian to convey the supplies to the coast. He also ordered the natives to grind as much corn as they could and convey it down from the interior of the country, together with dates and <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> for sale to the soldiers.

Most of the historians of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s reign assert that all the hardships which his army suffered in Asia were not worthy of comparison with the labours undergone here. <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a> alone asserts that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> pursued this route, not from ignorance of the difficulty of the journey, but because he heard that no one had ever hitherto passed that way with an army and emerged in safety from the desert, except <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a>, when she fled from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>. The natives said that even she emerged with only twenty men of her army; and that <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, son of <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a>, escaped with only seven of his men. For they say that <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> also marched into this region for the purpose of invading <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>; but that he did not effect his retreat before losing the greater part of his army, from the desert and the other difficulties of this route. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> received this information he was seized with a desire of excelling <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> and <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a>. <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a> says that he turned his march this way, both for this reason and at the same time for the purpose of conveying provisions near the fleet. The scorching heat and lack of water destroyed a great part of the army, and especially the beasts of burden; most of which perished from thirst and some of them even from the depth and heat of the sand, because it had been thoroughly scorched by the sun. For they met with lofty ridges of deep sand, not closely pressed and hardened, but such as received those who stepped upon it just as if they were stepping into mud, or rather into untrodden snow. At the same time too the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and mules suffered still more, both in going up and coming down the hills, from the unevenness of the road as well as from its instability. The length of the marches between the stages also exceedingly distressed the army; for the lack of water often compelled them to make the marches of unusual length. When they travelled by night on a journey which it was necessary to complete, and at daybreak came to water, they suffered no hardship at all; but if, while still on the march, on account of the length of the way, they were caught by the heat, then they did indeed suffer hardships from the blazing sun, being at the same time oppressed by unassuageable thirst. </p>                        </div>

They ate the flesh of these, and said that they had died of thirst or had perished from the heat. There was no one who divulged the real truth of their conduct, both on account of the men's distress and because all alike were implicated in the same offence. What was being done had not escaped <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s notice; but he saw that the best cure for the present state of affairs would be to pretend to be ignorant of it, rather than to permit it as a thing known to himself. The consequence was, that it was no longer easy to convey the soldiers who were suffering from disease, or those who were left behind on the roads on account of the heat, partly from the want of beasts of burden and partly because the men themselves were knocking the waggons to pieces, not being able to draw them on account of the depth of the sand. They did this also because in the first stages they were compelled on this account to go, not by the shortest routes, but by those which were easiest for the carriages. Thus some were left behind along the roads on account of sickness, others from fatigue or the effects of the heat, or from not being able to bear up against the drought; and there was no one either to show them the way or to remain and tend them in their sickness. For the expedition was being made with great urgency; and the care of individual persons was necessarily neglected in the zeal displayed for the safety of the army as a whole. As they generally made the marches by night, some of the men were overcome by sleep on the road; afterwards rousing up again, those who still had strength followed upon the tracks of the army; but only a few out of many overtook the main body in safety. Most of them perished in the sand, like men shipwrecked on the sea. Another calamity also befell the army, which greatly distressed men, <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and beasts of burden; for the country of the Gadrosians is supplied with rain by the periodical winds, just as that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> is; not the plains of Gadrosia, but only the mountains where the clouds are carried by the wind and are dissolved into rain without passing beyond the summits of the mountains. On one occasion, when the army bivouacked, for the sake of its water, near a small brook which was a winter torrent, about the second watch of the night the brook which flowed there was suddenly swelled by the rains in the mountains which had fallen unperceived by the soldiers. The torrent advanced with so great a flood as to destroy most of the wives and children of the men who followed the army, and to sweep away all the royal baggage as well as all the beasts of burden still remaining. The soldiers, after great exertions, were hardly able to save themselves together with their weapons, many of which they lost beyond recovery. When, after enduring the burning heat and thirst, they lighted upon abundance of water, many of them perished from drinking to excess, not being able to check their appetite for it. For this reason <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> generally pitched his camp, not near the water itself, but at a distance of about twenty stades from it, to prevent the men and beasts from pressing in crowds into the river and thus perishing, and at the same time to prevent those who had no control over themselves from fouling the water for the rest of the army by stepping into the springs or streams. </p>                        </div>

The army was continuing its march through the sand, though the heat of the sun was already scorching, because it was necessary to reach water before halting. They were far on the journey, and <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself, though oppressed with thirst, was nevertheless with great pain and difficulty leading the army on foot, so that his soldiers, as is usual in such a case, might more patiently bear their hardships by the equalization of the distress. At this time some of the light-armed soldiers, starting away from the army in quest of water, found some collected in a shallow cleft, a small and mean spring. Collecting this water with difficulty, they came with all speed to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, as if they were bringing him some great boon. As soon as they approached the king, they poured the water into a helmet and carried it to him. He took it, and commending the men who brought it, immediately poured it upon the ground in the sight of all. As a result of this action, the entire army was re-invigorated to so great a degree that any one would have imagined that the water poured away by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had furnished a draught to every man. This deed beyond all others I commend as evidence of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s power of endurance and self-control, as well as of his skill in managing an army. The following adventure also occurred to the army in that country. At last the guides declared that they no longer remembered the way, because the tracks of it had been rendered invisible by the wind blowing the sand over them. Moreover, in the deep sand which had been everywhere reduced to one level, there was nothing by which they could conjecture the right way, not even the usual trees growing along it, nor any solid hillock rising up; and they had not practised themselves in making journeys by the stars at night or by the sun in the daytime, as sailors do by the constellations of the Bears — the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a> by the Little Bear, and other men by the Greater Bear. Then at length <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> perceived that it was necessary for him to lead the way by declining to the left; and taking a few horsemen with him he advanced in front of the army. But when the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> even of these were exhausted by the heat, he left most of these men behind, and rode away with only five men and found the sea. Having scraped away the shingle on the sea-beach, he found water fresh and pure, and then went and fetched the whole army. For seven days they marched along the sea-coast, supplying themselves with water from the shore. Thence he led his expedition into the interior, for now the guides knew the way. </p>                        </div>

He deposed <a href=/people/978 target=_blank>Apollophanes</a> from the viceroyalty, because he discovered that he had paid no heed to his instructions. <a href=/people/533 target=_blank>Thoas</a> was appointed viceroy over the people of this district; but as he fell ill and died, <a href=/people/3080 target=_blank>Sibyrtius</a> succeeded to the office. The same man had also lately been appointed by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> viceroy of <a href=/people/6329 target=_blank>Carmania</a>; but now the rule over the Arachotians and Gadrosians was given to him, and <a href=/people/760 target=_blank>Tlepolemus</a>, son of Pythophanes, received <a href=/people/6329 target=_blank>Carmania</a>. The king was already advancing into <a href=/people/6329 target=_blank>Carmania</a>, when news was brought to him that <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, the viceroy of the country of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, had been plotted against by the mercenaries and treacherously killed; but that <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>'s <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> body-guards had caught some of the murderers in the very act and others afterwards, and had put them to death. When he had ascertained this, he sent a letter into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> to <a href=/people/1475 target=_blank>Eudemus</a> and <a href=/people/1357 target=_blank>Taxiles</a>, ordering them to administer the affairs of the land which had previously been subordinated to <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> until he could send a viceroy for it. When he arrived in <a href=/people/6329 target=_blank>Carmania</a>, <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> effected a junction with him, bringing with him the rest of the army and the elephants. He also brought Ordanes, whom he had arrested for revolting and trying to effect a revolution. Thither also came <a href=/people/2939 target=_blank>Stasanor</a>, the viceroy of the Areians and Zarangians, accompanied by Pharismanes, son of <a href=/people/3451 target=_blank>Phrataphernes</a>, the viceroy of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370546RHyr class=ethnic long=54.6 lat=37>Hyrcanians</a>. There came also the generals who had been left with <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a> over the army in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a>, <a href=/people/857 target=_blank>Cleander</a>, <a href=/people/1252 target=_blank>Sitalces</a>, and <a href=/people/5035 target=_blank>Heracon</a>, bringing with them the greater part of their army. Both the natives and the soldiers themselves brought many accusations against <a href=/people/857 target=_blank>Cleander</a> and <a href=/people/1252 target=_blank>Sitalces</a>, as for example, that the temples had been pillaged by them, old tombs rifled, and other acts of injustice, recklessness, and tyranny perpetrated against their subjects. As these charges were proved, he put them to death, in order to inspire others who might be left as viceroys, governors, or prefects of provinces with the fear of suffering equal penalties with them if they swerved from the path of duty. This was one of the chief means by which <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> kept in subordination the nations which he had conquered in war or which had voluntarily submitted to him, though they were so many in number and so far distant from each other; because under his regal sway it was not allowed that those who were ruled should be unjustly treated by those who ruled. At that time <a href=/people/5035 target=_blank>Heracon</a> was acquitted of the charge, but soon after, being convicted by the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus class=place long=48.247 lat=32.191>Susa</a> of having pillaged the temple in that city, he also suffered punishment. <a href=/people/2939 target=_blank>Stasanor</a> and <a href=/people/3451 target=_blank>Phrataphernes</a> came to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> bringing a multitude of beasts of burden and many <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a>, when they learnt that he was marching by the route to Gadrosia, conjecturing that his army would suffer the very hardships which it did suffer. Therefore these men arrived just at the very time they were required, as also did their <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a> and beasts of burden. For <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> distributed all these animals to the officers man by man, to all the various squadrons and centuries of the cavalry, and to the various companies of the infantry, as their number allowed him. </p>                        </div>

Food was provided for them, as well as all kinds of dainties which had been brought together along the roads by the <a href=/people/6329 target=_blank>Carmanians</a>. They say that he did this in imitation of the Bacchic revelry of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, because a story was told about that deity, that after subduing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> he traversed the greater part of Asia in this manner and received the appellation of <a href=/people/6994 target=_blank>Thriambus</a>. For the same reason the processions in honour of victories after war were called thriambi.

It is sufficient therefore for me to record it as unworthy of belief. But as to what I am now going to describe I follow the account of <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a>. In <a href=/people/6329 target=_blank>Carmania</a> <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> offered sacrifices to the gods as thank-offerings for his victory over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, and because his army had been brought in safety out of Gadrosia. He also celebrated a musical and gymnastic contest. He then appointed <a href=/people/1899 target=_blank>Peucestas</a> one of his confidential body-guards, having already resolved to make him viceroy of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persis</a>. He wished him, before being appointed to the viceroyalty, to experience this honour and evidence of confidence, as a reward for his exploit among the Mallians. Up to this time the number of his confidential body-guards had been seven: <a href=/people/1114 target=_blank>Leonnatus</a>, son of Anteas, <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>, son of <a href=/people/1607 target=_blank>Amyntor</a>, <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a>, son of <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a>, <a href=/people/3140 target=_blank>Aristonous</a>, son of <a href=/people/8180 target=_blank>Pisaeus</a>, these four being Pellaeans; <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a>, son of <a href=/people/709 target=_blank>Orontes</a>, from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405215ROre class=place long=21.5 lat=40.5>Orestis</a>, <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, and <a href=/people/2772 target=_blank>Peithon</a>, son of Crateas, the Heordaeans. <a href=/people/1899 target=_blank>Peucestas</a>, who had held the shield over <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, was now added to them as an eighth. At this time <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a>, having sailed round the coast of Ora and Gadrosia and that of the <a href=/people/9557 target=_blank>Ichthyophagi</a>, put into port in the inhabited part of the coastland of <a href=/people/6329 target=_blank>Carmania</a>, and going up thence into the interior with a few men he reported to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the particulars of the voyage which he had made along the coasts of the external sea. <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a> was then sent down to the sea again to sail round as far as the country of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405500RSus class=place long=50 lat=40.5>Susiana</a>, and the outlets of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a>. How he sailed from the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> Sea and the mouth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a>, I shall describe in a separate book, following the account of <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a> himself. For he also wrote a history of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> in Greek. Perhaps I shall be able to compose this narrative in the future, if inclination and the divine influence urge me to it. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> now ordered <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> to march into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persis</a> from <a href=/people/6329 target=_blank>Carmania</a> along the seashore with the larger division of the army and the beasts of burden, taking with him also the elephants; because, as he was making the expedition in the season of winter, the part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persis</a> near the sea was warm and possessed abundant supplies of provisions. </p>                        </div>

It was also watered by a stream, and high grass grew in the meadow. The base of the tomb itself had been made of squared stone in the form of a rectangle. Above there was a stone building surmounted by a roof, with a door leading within, so narrow that even a small man could with difficulty enter, after suffering much discomfort. In the building lay a golden coffin, in which the body of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> had been buried, and by the side of the coffin was a couch, the feet of which were of gold wrought with the hammer. A carpet of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=demonym long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonian</a> tapestry with purple rugs formed the bedding; upon it were also a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=demonym long=48 lat=35.5>Median</a> coat with sleeves and other tunics of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=demonym long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonian</a> manufacture. <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> adds that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=demonym long=48 lat=35.5>Median</a> trousers and robes dyed the colour of hyacinth were also lying upon it, as well as others of purple and various other colours; moreover there were collars, sabres, and earrings of gold and precious stones soldered together, and near them stood a table. On the middle of the couch lay the coffin which contained the body of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>. Within the enclosure, near the ascent leading to the tomb, there was a small house built for the <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magians</a> who guarded the tomb; a duty which they had discharged ever since the time of <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a>, son of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, son succeeding father as guard. To these men a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and specified quantities of wheaten flour and wine were given daily by the king; and a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> once a month as a sacrifice to <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>. Upon the tomb an inscription in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> letters had been placed, which bore the following meaning in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> language: O man, I am <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, son of <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a>, who founded the empire of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, and was king of Asia. Do not therefore grudge me this monument. As soon as <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had conquered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, he was very desirous of entering the tomb of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>; but he found that everything else had been carried off except the coffin and couch. They had even maltreated the king's body; for they had torn off the lid of the coffin and cast out the corpse. They had tried to make the coffin itself of smaller bulk and thus more portable, by cutting part of it off and crushing part of it up; but as their efforts did not succeed, they departed, leaving the coffin in that state. <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> says that he was himself commissioned by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> to restore the tomb for <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, to put in the coffin the parts of the body still preserved, to put the lid on, and to restore the parts of the coffin which had been defaced. Moreover he was instructed to stretch the couch tight with bands, and to deposit all the other things which used to lie there for ornament, both resembling the former ones and of the same number. He was ordered also to do away with the door, building part of it up with stone and plastering part of it over with cement; and finally to put the royal seal upon the cement. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> arrested the <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magians</a> who were the guards of the tomb, and put them to the torture to make them confess who had done the deed; but in spite of the torture they confessed nothing either about themselves or any other person. In no other way were they proved to have been privy to the deed; they were therefore released by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. </p>                        </div>

For he said that the kings of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> called themselves Great Kings without any right, since they did not rule the larger part of Asia.

For my own part I cannot conjecture with any certainty what were his plans; and I do not care to guess. But this I think I can confidently affirm, that he meditated nothing small or mean; and that he would never have remained satisfied with any of the acquisitions he had made, even if he had added Europe to Asia, or the islands of the Britons to Europe; but would still have gone on seeking for unknown lands beyond those mentioned. I verily believe that if he had found no one else to strive with, he would have striven with himself. And on this account I commend some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> philosophers, who are said to have been caught by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> as they were walking in the open meadow where they were accustomed to spend their time. At the sight of him and his army they did nothing else but stamp with their feet on the earth, upon which they were stepping. When he asked them by means of interpreters what was the meaning of their action, they replied as follows: O king <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, every man possesses as much of the earth as this upon which we have stepped; but thou being only a man like the rest of us, except in being meddlesome and arrogant, art come over so great a part of the earth from thy own land, giving trouble both to thyself and others. And yet thou also wilt soon die, and possess only as much of the earth as is sufficient for thy body to be buried in. </p>                        </div>

When also in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a> he met <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420351PSin class=person long=35.143 lat=42.025>Sinope</a>, lying in the sun, standing near him with his shield-bearing guards and foot Companions, he asked if he wanted anything. But <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> said that he wanted nothing else, except that he and his attendants would stand out of the sunlight. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> is said to have expressed his admiration of <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>'s conduct. Thus it is evident that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was not entirely destitute of better feelings; but he was the slave of his insatiable ambition. Again, when he arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/337728UTax class=place long=72.8193 lat=33.7462>Taxila</a> and saw the naked sect of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> philosophers, he was exceedingly desirous that one of these men should live with him; because he admired their power of endurance. But the oldest of the philosophers, <a href=/people/2613 target=_blank>Dandamis</a> by name, of whom the others were disciples, refused to come himself to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, and would not allow the others to do so. He is said to have replied that he was himself a son of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, if <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was; and that he wanted nothing from him, because he was quite contented with what he had. And besides he said that he saw his attendants wandering over so much of the land and sea to no advantage, and that there was no end to their many wanderings. Therefore he had no desire that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> should give him anything which was in his own possession, nor on the other hand was he afraid that he should be excluded from anything which <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ruled over. For while he lived the country of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, which produces the fruits in their season, was sufficient for him; and when he died he should be released from the body, an unsuitable associate. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> then did not attempt to force him to come with him, considering that the man was free to do as he pleased. But <a href=/people/1316 target=_blank>Megasthenes</a> has recorded that <a href=/people/1817 target=_blank>Calanus</a>, one of the philosophers of this region, who had very little power over his desires, was induced to do so; and that the philosophers themselves reproached him, for having deserted the happiness existing among them, and serving another lord instead of the God. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly, not being willing to lead the life of a man in infirm health, he told <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> that in such circumstances he thought it best for him to put an end to his existence, before he came into experience of any disease which might compel him to change his former mode of living. For a long time the king tried to dissuade him; however, when he saw that he was not to be overcome, but would find some other way of release, if this were not yielded to him, he ordered a funeral pyre to be heaped up for him, in the place where the man himself directed, and gave instructions that <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, the confidential body-guard, should have the charge of it. They say that a solemn procession, consisting both of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and men, advanced before him, some of the latter being armed and others carrying all kinds of incense for the pyre. They also say that they were carrying gold and silver goblets and royal apparel; and because he was unable to walk through illness, a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> was prepared for him. However, not being able to mount the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, he was conveyed stretched out upon a litter, crowned with a garland after the custom of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, and singing in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> language. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> say that he sang hymns to the gods and eulogiums on his countrymen. Before he ascended the funeral-pyre he presented the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> which he should himself have mounted, being a royal steed of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380582UNis class=demonym long=58.21 lat=37.9511>Nisaean</a> breed, to <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a>, one of those who attended him to learn his philosophy. He distributed among his other disciples the goblets and rugs which <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had ordered to be cast into the pyre as an honour to him. Then mounting the pyre he lay down upon it in a becoming manner, and was visible to the whole army. To <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the spectacle appeared unseemly, as it was being exhibited at the cost of a friend; but to the rest it was a cause of wonder that he did not move any part of his body in the fire. As soon as the men to whom the duty had been assigned set fire to the pyre, <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a> says the trumpets sounded, in accordance with <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s order, and the whole army raised the war-cry as it was in the habit of shouting when advancing to battle. The elephants also chimed in with their shrill and warlike cry, in honour of <a href=/people/1817 target=_blank>Calanus</a>.

The bridegrooms took them by the right hand and kissed them; the king being the first to begin, for the weddings of all were conducted in the same way. This appeared the most popular thing which <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ever did; and it proved his affection for his Companions. Each man took his own bride and led her away; and on all without exception <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> bestowed dowries. He also ordered that the names of all the other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> who had married any of the Asiatic women should be registered. They were over 10,000 in number; and to these <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> made presents on account of their weddings. </p>                        </div>

At first only a few registered their names, fearing that this was being instituted as a test by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, to discover which of the soldiers found their pay insufficient for their expenses, and which of them were extravagant in their mode of living. When he was informed that most of them were not registering their names, but that those who had borrowed money on bonds were concealing the fact, he reproached them for their distrust of him. For he said that it was not right either that the king should deal otherwise than sincerely with his subjects, or that any of those ruled by him should think that he would deal otherwise than sincerely with them. Accordingly, he had tables placed in the camp with money upon them; and he appointed men to manage the distribution of it. He ordered the debts of all who showed a money-bond to be liquidated without the debtors' names being any longer registered. Consequently, the men believed that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was dealing sincerely with them; and the fact that they were not known was a greater pleasure to them than the fact that they ceased to be in debt. This presentation to the army is said to have amounted to 20,000 talents. He also gave presents to particular individuals, according as each man was held in honour for his merit or valour, if he had become conspicuous in crises of danger. Those who were distinguished for their personal gallantry he crowned with golden chaplets: first, <a href=/people/1899 target=_blank>Peucestas</a>, the man who had held the shield over him; second, <a href=/people/1114 target=_blank>Leonnatus</a>, who also had held his shield over him, and moreover had incurred dangers in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> and won a victory in Ora. For he had posted himself with the forces left with him against the Oritians and the tribes living near them, who were trying to effect a revolution, and had conquered them in battle. He also seemed to have managed other affairs in Ora with great success. In addition to these, he crowned <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a> for his successful voyage round the coast from the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> through the Great Sea; for this officer had now arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus class=place long=48.247 lat=32.191>Susa</a>. Besides these three, he crowned <a href=/people/936 target=_blank>Onesicritus</a>, the pilot of the royal ship; as well as <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> and the rest of the confidential body-guards. </p>                        </div>

It is a large river and can be crossed on foot nowhere as far as its mouth, inasmuch as none of its water is used up by irrigation of the country. For the land through which it flows is more elevated than its water, and it is not drawn off into canals or into another river, but rather receives them into itself. It is nowhere possible to irrigate the land from it. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> flows in an elevated channel, and is everywhere on a level with the land through which it passes. Many canals have been made from it, some of which are always kept flowing, and from which the inhabitants on both banks supply themselves with water; others the people make only when requisite to irrigate the land, when they are in need of water from drought. For this country is usually free from rain. The consequence is, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> at last has only a small volume of water, which disappears into a marsh. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> sailed over the sea round the shore of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> Gulf lying between the rivers <a href=/people/2408 target=_blank>Eulaeus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a>; and thence he sailed up the latter river as far as the camp where <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> had settled with all his forces. Thence he sailed again to <a href=/people/1652 target=_blank>Opis</a>, a city situated on that river. In his voyage up he destroyed the weirs which existed in the river, and thus made the stream quite level. These weirs had been constructed by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, to prevent any enemy having a superior naval force from sailing up from the sea into their country. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> had had recourse to these contrivances because they were not a nautical people; and thus by making an unbroken succession of weirs they had rendered the voyage up the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a> a matter of impossibility. But <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> said that such devices were unbecoming to men who are victorious in battle; and therefore he considered this means of safety unsuitable for him; and by easily demolishing the laborious work of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, he proved in fact that what they thought a protection was unworthy of the name. </p>                        </div>

For he found you vagabonds and destitute of means, most of you clad in hides, feeding a few <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> up the mountain sides, for the protection of which you had to fight with small success against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425220RTri class=ethnic long=22 lat=42.5>Triballians</a>, and the border <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a>. Instead of the hides he gave you cloaks to wear, and from the mountains he led you down into the plains, and made you capable of fighting the neighbouring barbarians, so that you were no longer compelled to preserve yourselves by trusting rather to the inaccessible strongholds than to your own valour. He made you colonists of cities, which he adorned with useful laws and customs; and from being slaves and subjects, he made you rulers over those very barbarians by whom you yourselves, as well as your property, were previously liable to be plundered and ravaged. He also added the greater part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, and by seizing the most conveniently situated places on the sea-coast, he spread abundance over the land from commerce, and made the working of the mines a secure employment. He made you rulers over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a>, of whom you had formerly been in mortal fear; and by humbling the nation of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=ethnic long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocians</a>, he rendered the avenue into Greece broad and easy for you, instead of being narrow and difficult.

These were the advantages which accrued to you from my father <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>; great indeed if looked at by themselves, but small if compared with those you have obtained from me.

I have appropriated nothing myself, nor can any one point out my treasures, except these possessions of yours or the things which I am guarding on your behalf. Individually, however, I have no motive to guard them, since I feed on the same fare as you do, and I take only the same amount of sleep. Nay, I do not think that my fare is as good as that of those among you who live luxuriously; and I know that I often sit up at night to watch for you, that you may be able to sleep. </p>                        </div>

Not even on the morrow was any one of them admitted to an audience; but on the third day he summoned the select <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> within, and among them he distributed the commands of the brigades, and made the rule that only those whom he had proclaimed his kinsmen, should have the honour of saluting him with a kiss. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> who heard the speech were thoroughly astonished at the moment, and remained there in silence near the platform; nor when he retired did any of them accompany the king, except his personal Companions and the confidential body-guards. Though they remained, most of them had nothing to do or say; and yet they were unwilling to retire. But when the news was reported to them about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, that the military commands were being given to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, that the foreign soldiers were being selected and divided into companies, that a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> foot-guard, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> foot Companions, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> regiment of men with silver shields, as well as the cavalry Companions, and another royal regiment of cavalry distinct from these, were being called by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> names, they were no longer able to restrain themselves; but running in a body to the palace, they cast their weapons there in front of the gates as a sign of supplication to the king. Standing in front of the gates, they shouted, beseeching to be allowed to enter, and saying that they were willing to surrender the men who had been the instigators of the disturbance on that occasion, and those who had begun the clamour. They also declared they would not retire from the gates either day or night, unless <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> would take some pity upon them. When he was informed of this, he came out without delay; and seeing them lying on the ground in humble guise, and hearing most of them lamenting with loud voice, tears began to flow also from his own eyes. He made an effort to say something to them, but they continued their importunate entreaties. At length one of them, <a href=/people/9062 target=_blank>Callines</a> by name, a man conspicuous both for his age and because he was captain of the Companion cavalry, spoke as follows: O king, what grieves the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> is, that thou hast already made some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> kinsmen to thyself, and that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> are called <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s kinsmen, and have the honour of saluting thee with a kiss; whereas none of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> have as yet enjoyed this honour. Then <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> interrupting him, said: But all of you without exception I consider my kinsmen, and so from this time I shall call you. When he had said this, <a href=/people/9062 target=_blank>Callines</a> advanced and saluted him with a kiss, and so did all those who wished to salute him. Then they took up their weapons and returned to the camp, shouting and singing a song of thanksgiving to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>. After this <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> offered sacrifice to the gods to whom it was his custom to sacrifice, and gave a public banquet, over which he himself presided, with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> sitting around him; and next to them the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>; after whom came the men of the other nations, honoured for their personal rank or for some meritorious action. The king and his guests drew wine from the same bowl and poured out the same libations, both the Grecian prophets and the <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magians</a> commencing the ceremony. He prayed for other blessings, and especially that harmony and community of rule might exist between the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>.

To these <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> gave the pay not only for the time which had already elapsed, but also for that which they would spend in returning home. He also gave to each man a talent in addition to his pay. If any of them had children by Asiatic wives, he ordered them to leave them behind with him, lest they should introduce into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> a cause of discord, taking with them children by foreign women who were of a different race from the children whom they had left behind at home born of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> mothers.

These uncertain and obscure promises were made to them as they were departing; and he thought he was giving a most indubitable proof of the friendship and affection he had for them by sending with them, as their guardian and the leader of the expedition, <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a>, the man most faithful to him, and whom he valued equally with himself. Then, having saluted them all, he with tears dismissed them likewise weeping from his presence. He ordered <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> to lead these men back, and when he had done so, to take upon himself the government of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, and to preside over the freedom of the Greeks. He also ordered <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> to bring to him the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> of manly age as successors to those who were being sent back. He despatched <a href=/people/1140 target=_blank>Polysperchon</a> also with <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a>, as his second in command, so that if any mishap befell <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a> on the march (for he was sending him back on account of the weakness of his health), those who were going might not be in need of a general. A secret report was also going about that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was now overcome by his mother's accusations of <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, and that he wished to remove him from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>. This report was current among those who thought that royal actions are more worthy of honour in proportion to their secrecy, and who were inclined to impute what is worthy of belief to a bad motive rather than to attribute it to the real one; a course to which they were led by appearances and their own depravity. But probably this sending for <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> was not designed for his dishonour, but rather to prevent any unpleasant consequences to <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> and <a href=/people/272 target=_blank>Olympias</a> from their quarrel which he might not himself be able to rectify. For they were incessantly writing to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, the former saying that the arrogance, acerbity, and meddlesomeness of <a href=/people/272 target=_blank>Olympias</a> was exceedingly unbecoming to the king's mother; insomuch that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was related to have used the following remark in reference to the reports which he received about his mother: that she was exacting from him a heavy house-rent for the ten months. The queen wrote that <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> was overweeningly insolent in his pretensions and in the service of his court, no longer remembering the one who had appointed him, but claiming to win and hold the first rank among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> and Greeks. These slanderous reports about <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> appeared to have more weight with <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, since they were more formidable in regard to the regal dignity. However no overt act or word of the king was reported, from which any one could infer that <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> was in any way less in favour with him than before. </p>                        </div>

In this journey <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> is said to have seen the plain which was devoted to the royal mares. <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> says that the plain itself was named <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380582UNis class=demonym long=58.21 lat=37.9511>Nisaean</a>, and that the mares were called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380582UNis class=demonym long=58.21 lat=37.9511>Nisaean</a>; adding that in olden times there were 150,000 of these <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. But at this time <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> found not many above 50,000; for most of them had been carried off by robbers.

These had been equipped with the arms of male horsemen, except that they carried axes instead of spears and targets instead of shields. They also say that they had the right breast smaller than the left, and that they exposed it in battle. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> dismissed them from the army, that no attempt to violate them might be made by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> or barbarians; and he ordered them to carry word to their queen that he was coming to her in order to procreate children by her. But this story has been recorded neither by <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> nor <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, nor any other writer who is a trustworthy authority on such matters. I do not even think that the race of <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a> was surviving at that time; for before <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s time they were not mentioned even by <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, who mentions the Phasians, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=ethnic long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchians</a>, and all the other barbaric races which the Greeks came upon, when they started from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410397PTra class=place long=39.727 lat=40.999>Trapezus</a> or before they marched down to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410397PTra class=place long=39.727 lat=40.999>Trapezus</a>. They would certainly have fallen in with the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a> if they were still in existence. However it does not seem to me credible that this race of women was altogether fictitious, because it has been celebrated by so many famous poets. For the general account is, that <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> marched against them and brought the girdle of their queen <a href=/people/1735 target=_blank>Hippolyte</a> into Greece. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> also under <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a> were the first to conquer and repulse these women as they were advancing into Europe; and the battle of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> and <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a> has been painted by <a href=/people/1672 target=_blank>Micon</a>, no less than that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>. <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> also has frequently written about these women; and so have the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> writers who have honoured the men who perished in war with funeral orations. They have mentioned the exploit of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> against the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a> as one of their special glories. If therefore <a href=/people/3776 target=_blank>Atropates</a> showed any equestrian women to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, I think he must have shown him some other foreign women trained in horsemanship, and equipped with the arms which were said to be those of the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a>. </p>                        </div>

He also held drinking parties with his Companions. At this time <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> fell sick; and they say that the stadium was full of people on the seventh day of his fever, for on that day there was a gymnastic contest for boys. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was informed that <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> was in a critical state, he went to him without delay, but found him no longer alive. Different authors have given different accounts of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s grief on this occasion; but they agree in this, that his grief was great. As to what was done in honour of <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>, they make diverse statements, just as each writer was actuated by good-will or envy towards him, or even towards <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself. Of the authors who have made these reckless statements, some seem to me to have thought that whatever <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> said or did to show his excessive grief for the man who was the dearest to him in the world, redounds to his own honour; whereas others seem to have thought that it rather tended to his disgrace, as being conduct unbecoming to any king and especially to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. Some say that he lay prostrate on his companion's body for the greater part of that day, bewailing him and refusing to depart from him, until he was forcibly carried away by his Companions. Others that he lay upon the body the whole day and night. Others again say that he hanged the physician <a href=/people/1094 target=_blank>Glaucias</a>, for having indiscreetly given the medicine; while others affirm that he, being a spectator of the games, neglected <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>, who was filled with wine. That <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> should have cut off his hair in honour of the dead man, I do not think improbable, both for other reasons and especially from a desire to imitate <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, whom from his boyhood he had an ambition to rival. Others also say that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself at one time drove the chariot on which the body was borne; but this statement I by no means believe. Others again affirm that he ordered the shrine of <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348485UEcb class=place long=48.5166 lat=34.8054>Ecbatana</a> to be razed to the ground; which was an act of barbarism, and by no means in harmony with <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s general behaviour, but rather in accordance with the arrogance of <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> in his dealings with the deity, who is said to have let fetters down into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>, in order to punish it forsooth. But the following statement, which has been recorded, does not seem to me entirely beyond the range of probability: that when <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was marching to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, he was met on the road by many embassies from Greece, among which were some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376232PEpi class=demonym long=23.1602 lat=37.6335>Epidaurian</a> envoys, who obtained from him their requests. He also gave them an offering to be conveyed to [the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376231SAsk class=place long=23.075 lat=37.597>sanctuary</a> of] <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>, adding this remark: Although <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a> has not treated me fairly, in not saving the life of my Companion, whom I valued equally with my own head. It has been stated by most writers that he ordered honours to be always paid to <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> as a hero; and some say that he even sent men to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/292255SAmm class=place long=25.5435 lat=29.2052>Ammon</a>'s temple to ask the god if it were allowable to offer sacrifice to <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> as a god; but <a href=/people/577 target=_blank>Ammon</a> replied that it was not allowable. All the authorities, however, agree as to the following facts: that until the third day after <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>'s death, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> neither tasted food nor paid any attention to his personal appearance, but lay on the ground either bewailing or silently mourning; that he also ordered a funeral pyre to be prepared for him in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> at the expense of 10,000 talents; some say at a still greater cost; that a decree was published throughout all the barbarian territory for the observance of a public mourning. Many of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s Companions dedicated themselves and their arms to the dead <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> in order to show their respect to him; and the first to begin the artifice was <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a>, whom we a short time ago mentioned as having been at variance with him. This he did that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> might not think he was pleased at <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>'s death. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> did not appoint any one else to be commander of the Companion cavalry in the place of <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>, so that the name of that general might not perish from the brigade; but that division of cavalry was still called <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>'s and the figure made from <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> went in front of it. He also resolved to celebrate a gymnastic and musical contest, much more magnificent than any of the preceding, both in the multitude of competitors and in the amount of money expended upon it. For he provided 3,000 competitors in all; and it is said that these men a short time after also competed in the games held at <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s own funeral. </p>                        </div>

Then at length he made an expedition against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/337483RKos class=ethnic long=48.3 lat=33.7>Cossaeans</a>, a warlike race bordering on the territory of the Uxians. They are mountaineers, inhabiting strong positions in separate villages. Whenever a force approached them, they were in the habit of retiring to the summits of their mountains, either in a body or separately as each man found it practicable; and thus they escaped, making it difficult for those who attacked them with their forces to come near them. After the enemy's departure, they used to turn themselves again to marauding, by which occupation they supported themselves. But <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> subdued this race, though he marched against them in the winter; for neither winter nor ruggedness of ground was any impediment either to him or to <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, who led a part of the army in the campaign against them. Thus no military enterprise which <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> undertook was ever unsuccessful. As he was marching back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, he was met by embassies from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a>, who congratulated him and crowned him as conqueror of the kingdom of Asia. From <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> also came <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392165RBre class=ethnic long=16.5 lat=39.2>Bruttians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=ethnic long=16 lat=40.4>Lucanians</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenians</a> as envoys, for the same purpose. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> are said to have sent an embassy to him at this time; and it is also asserted that envoys came to request his friendship from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> of Europe, the Gauls, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390000RIbe class=ethnic long=-4 lat=39>Iberians</a> — nations whose names were heard and their accoutrements seen then for the first time by Greeks and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>. They are also said to have entrusted to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the duty of settling their disputes with each other. Then indeed it was especially evident both to himself and to those about him that he was lord of all the land and sea. Of the men who have written the history of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, <a href=/people/3536 target=_blank>Aristus</a> and <a href=/people/625 target=_blank>Asclepiades</a> alone say that the Romans also sent an embassy to him, and that when he met their embassy, he predicted something of the future power of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, observing both the attire of the men, their love of labour, and their devotion to freedom. At the same time he made urgent inquiries about their political constitution. This incident I have recorded neither as certainly authentic nor as altogether incredible; but none of the Roman writers have made any mention of this embassy having been despatched to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; nor of those who have written an account of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s actions, has either <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, or <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> mentioned it. With these authors I am generally inclined to agree. Nor does it seem likely that the Roman republic, which was at that time remarkable for its love of liberty, would send an embassy to a foreign king, especially to a place so far away from their own land, when they were not compelled to do so by fear or any hope of advantage, being possessed as they were beyond any other people by hatred to the very name and race of despots. </p>                        </div>

These are the largest; but many others flow into these, while others again discharge themselves directly into this sea. Some of these were known to those who visited these nations with <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; others are situated towards the farther side of the gulf, as it seems, in the country of the Nomadic <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, a district which is quite unknown.

For they said that an oracular declaration had been made to them by the god <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a>, that his entrance into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> at that time would not be for his good. But he answered their speech with a line from the poet <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> to this effect: He the best prophet is that guesses well. But said the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldaeans</a>: O king, do not at any rate enter the city looking towards the west, nor leading the army advancing in that direction; but rather go right round towards the east. But this did not turn out to be easy for him, on account of the difficulty of the ground; for the deity was leading him to the place where entering he was doomed soon to die. And perhaps it was better for him to be taken off in the very acme of his glory as well as of the affection entertained for him by men, before any of the vicissitudes natural to man befell him. Probably this was the reason <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> advised <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> to look at the end of a long life, and not before pronounce any man happy. Yea indeed, <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>'s death had been no small misfortune to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; and I think he would rather have departed before it occurred than have been alive to experience it; no less than <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, as it seems to me, would rather have died before <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a> than have been the avenger of his death. </p>                        </div>

For in the middle of the city of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a> was the temple of <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a>, an edifice very great in size, constructed of baked bricks which were cemented together with bitumen. This temple had been razed to the ground by <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, when he returned from Greece; as were also all the other sacred buildings of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a>. Some say that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had formed the resolution to rebuild it upon the former foundations; and for this reason he ordered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a> to carry away the mound. Others say that he intended to build a still larger one than that which formerly existed. But after his departure, the men who had been entrusted with the work prosecuted it without any vigour, so that he determined to employ the whole of his army in completing it. A great quantity of land as well as gold had been dedicated to the god <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a> by the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> kings; and in olden times the temple was kept in repair and sacrifices were offered to the god. But at that time the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldaeans</a> were appropriating the property of the god, since nothing existed upon which the revenues could be expended. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> suspected that they did not wish him to enter <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> for this reason, for fear that in a short time the temple would be finished, and they should be deprived of the gains accruing from the money. And yet, according to <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a>, he was willing to yield to their persuasions so far at least as to change the direction of his entry into the city. For this purpose, on the first day he encamped near the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>; and on the next day he marched along the bank, keeping the river on his right hand, with the intention of passing beyond the part of the city turned towards the west, and there wheeling round to lead his army towards the east. But on account of the difficulty of the ground he could not march with his army in this direction; because if a man who is entering the city from the west, here changes his direction eastward, he comes upon ground covered with marshes and shoals. Thus, partly by his own will and partly against his will, he disobeyed the god. </p>                        </div>

When he joined his forces with the king's on the return of the latter from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, and observed that he was severely punishing the viceroys who had been placed over the several countries, he sent to his brother <a href=/people/3654 target=_blank>Peithagoras</a> and asked him to divine about his safety. For <a href=/people/3654 target=_blank>Peithagoras</a> was a diviner who derived his knowledge of the future from the inspection of the inward parts of animals. This man sent back to <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a>, inquiring of whom he was so especially afraid, as to wish to consult divination. The latter wrote back: The king himself and <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>. <a href=/people/3654 target=_blank>Peithagoras</a> therefore in the first place offered sacrifice with reference to <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>. But as there was no lobe visible upon the liver of the sacrificial victim, he stated this fact in a letter, which he sealed and sent to his brother from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348485UEcb class=place long=48.5166 lat=34.8054>Ecbatana</a>, explaining that there was no reason at all to be afraid of <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>, for in a short time he would be out of their way. And <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> says that <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> received this epistle only one day before <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> died. Then <a href=/people/3654 target=_blank>Peithagoras</a> again offered sacrifice in respect to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, and the liver of the victim consulted in respect to him was also destitute of a lobe. He therefore wrote to <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> to the same purport about <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> as about <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>. <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> did not conceal the information sent to him, but told <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, in order the more to show his good-will to the king, if he urged him to be on his guard lest some danger might befall him at that time. And <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> says that the king commended <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a>, and when he entered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, he asked <a href=/people/3654 target=_blank>Peithagoras</a> what sign he had met with, to induce him to write thus to his brother. He said that the liver of the victim sacrificed for him was without a lobe. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> asked what the sign portended, he said that it was a very disastrous one. The king was so far from being angry with him, that he even treated him with greater respect, for telling him the truth without any disguise. <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> says that he himself heard this story from <a href=/people/3654 target=_blank>Peithagoras</a>; and adds that the same man acted as diviner for <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a> and afterwards for <a href=/people/12218 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>, and that the same sign occurred for both. It was verified by fact; for <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a> lost his life leading an army against <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, and <a href=/people/12218 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> was killed in the battle fought by him at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389305UIps class=place long=30.5267 lat=38.8529>Ipsus</a> against <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> and <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a>. Also concerning <a href=/people/1817 target=_blank>Calanus</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> philosopher, the following story has been recorded. When he was going to the funeral pyre to die, he gave the parting salutation to all his other companions; but he refused to approach <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> to give him the salutation, saying he would meet him at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> and there salute him. At the time indeed this remark was treated with neglect; but afterwards, when <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had died at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, it came to the recollection of those who had heard it, and they thought forsooth that it was a divine intimation of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s approaching end. </p>                        </div>

To me indeed it seems probable that most of them came to crown and eulogize him on account of his victories, especially the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> ones, as well as to say that the Greeks rejoiced at his safe return from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>. It is said that he greeted these men with the right hand, and after paying them suitable honour sent them back. He also gave the ambassadors permission to take with them all the statues of men and images of gods and the other votive offerings which <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> had carried off from Greece to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/302532UPas class=place long=53.1672 lat=30.1939>Pasargadae</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus class=place long=48.247 lat=32.191>Susa</a>, or any other place in Asia. In this way it is said that the brazen <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237AHaA class=place long=23.7234 lat=37.97513>statues</a> of <a href=/people/600 target=_blank>Harmodius</a> and <a href=/people/496 target=_blank>Aristogeiton</a>, as well as the monument of the Celcaean <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, were carried back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> says that he found at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> the fleet with <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a>, which had sailed from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> Sea up the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>; and another which had been conveyed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a>, consisting of two <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> quinqueremes, three quadriremes, twelve triremes, and thirty triacontors. These had been taken to pieces and conveyed to the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a> to the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370379UZeu class=place long=37.8768 lat=37.048>Thapsacus</a>. There they were joined together again and sailed down to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>. The same writer says that he cut down the cypresses in <a href=/people/471 target=_blank>Babylonia</a> and with them built another fleet; for in the land of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> these trees alone are abundant, but of the other things necessary for ship-building this country affords no supply. A multitude of purple-fishers and other sea-faring men came to him from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a> and the rest of the seaboard to serve as crews for the ships and perform the other services on board. Near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> he made a harbour by excavation large enough to afford anchorage to 1,000 ships of war; and adjoining the harbour he made dockyards. Miccalus the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384268PKla class=person long=26.7703 lat=38.3614>Clazomenian</a> was despatched to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> with 500 talents to enlist some men and to purchase others who were experienced in nautical affairs. For <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> designed to colonize the seaboard near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> Gulf, as well as the islands in that sea. For he thought that this land would become no less prosperous than <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a>. He made these preparations of the fleet to attack the main body of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabs</a>, under the pretext that they were the only barbarians of this region who had not sent an embassy to him or done anything else becoming their position and showing respect to him. But the truth was, as it seems to me, that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was insatiably ambitious of acquiring fresh territory. </p>                        </div>

Therefore he thought himself quite worthy to be considered by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabs</a> as a third god, since he had performed deeds by no means inferior to those of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>. If then he could conquer the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabs</a>, he intended to grant them the privilege of conducting their government according to their own customs, as he had already done to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>. The fertility of the land was a secret inducement to him to invade it; because he heard that the people obtained cassia from the lakes, and myrrh and frankincense from the trees; that cinnamon was cut from the shrubs, and that the meadows produce spikenard without any cultivation. As to the size of the country, he was informed that the seaboard of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a> was not less in extent than that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>; that near it lie many islands; that in all parts of the country there were harbours sufficiently commodious to provide anchorage for his fleet, and that it supplied sites for founding cities, which would become flourishing. He was also informed that there were two islands in the sea facing the mouth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>, the first of which was not far from the place where the waters of that river are discharged into the sea, being about 120 stades distant from the shore and the river's mouth. This is the smaller of the two, and was densely covered with every kind of timber. In it was also a temple of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, around which the inhabitants themselves spent their lives. The island was devoted to the use of wild <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> and stags, which were allowed to range at large as being dedicated to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>. It was unlawful to chase them unless any one wished to offer sacrifice to the goddess; and for this purpose alone it was lawful to chase them. <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> says that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ordered this island to be called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/294483IIka class=place long=48.2793 lat=29.4305>Icarus</a>, after the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378263IIka class=place long=26.2 lat=37.6>island</a> so named in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381253WAeg class=place long=25.3 lat=38.1>Aegean Sea</a>, on which, as the report goes, <a href=/people/1088 target=_blank>Icarus</a>, son of <a href=/people/310 target=_blank>Daedalus</a> fell, when the wax, by which the wings had been fastened to him, melted. For he did not fly near the earth, according to his father's injunctions, but senselessly flying far aloft, he allowed the sun to soften and loosen the wax. <a href=/people/1088 target=_blank>Icarus</a> left his name to the island and the sea, the former being called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378263IIka class=place long=26.2 lat=37.6>Icarus</a> and the latter the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375263WIka class=place long=26.3333 lat=37.5>Icarian Sea</a>. The other island was said to be distant from the mouth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> about a day and night's voyage for a ship running before the breeze. Its name was <a about=https://topostext.org/place/262505ITyl class=place long=50.5205 lat=26.2328>Tylos</a>; it was large and most of it neither rugged nor woody, but suitable for producing cultivated fruits and all things in due season. Some of this information was imparted to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> by <a href=/people/437 target=_blank>Archias</a>, who was sent with a triacontor to investigate the course of the coasting voyage to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>, and who went as far as the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/262505ITyl class=place long=50.5205 lat=26.2328>Tylos</a>, but durst not pass beyond that point. <a href=/people/2387 target=_blank>Androsthenes</a> was despatched with another triacontor and sailed to a part of the peninsula of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>. <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hieron</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367345PSol class=person long=34.539 lat=36.742>Soli</a> the pilot also received a triacontor from <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and advanced farthest of those whom he despatched to this region; for he had received instructions to sail round the whole <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=demonym long=40 lat=28>Arabian</a> peninsula as far as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=demonym long=40 lat=28>Arabian</a> Gulf near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> over against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/305320UHer class=place long=32.0993 lat=30.5529>Heroopolis</a>. Although he coasted along the country of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabs</a> to a great distance, he durst not go as far as he was ordered; but returning to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> he reported that the size of the peninsula was marvellous, being only a little smaller than the country of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, and its extremity projected far into the Great Sea. <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a> indeed in his voyage from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> had seen this stretching out a little, before he turned aside into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> Gulf, and he was almost induced to cross over to it. The pilot <a href=/people/936 target=_blank>Onesicritus</a> thought they ought to have gone thither; but <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a> says that he himself prevented it, so that after sailing right round the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> Gulf he might be able to give a report to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> that he had accomplished the voyage on which he had sent him. For <a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchus</a> said he had not been despatched to navigate the Great Sea, but to explore the land bordering on the sea, to find out what men inhabit it, to discover the harbours and rivers in it, to ascertain the customs of the people, and to see if any of the country was fertile and if any was sterile. This was the reason why <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s naval expedition returned in safety; for if it had sailed beyond the deserts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>, it would not have returned in safety. This is said also to have been the reason why <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hieron</a> turned back. </p>                        </div>

This <a href=/people/3922 target=_blank>Pallacopas</a> is not a river rising from springs, but a canal cut from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>. For that river flowing from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> mountains, proceeds within its banks in the season of winter, because its water is scanty; but when the spring begins to make its appearance, and especially just before the summer solstice, it pours along with mighty stream and overflows its banks into the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> country. For at that season the snow upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> mountains melts and swells its water to a great degree; and as its stream flows high above the level of the country, it would flow over the land if some one had not furnished it with an outlet along the <a href=/people/3922 target=_blank>Pallacopas</a> and turned it aside into the marshes and pools, which, beginning from this canal, extend as far as the country contiguous to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>. Thence it spreads out far and wide into a shallow lake, from which it falls into the sea by many invisible mouths. After the snow has melted, about the time of the setting of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> flows with a small stream; but none the less the greater part of it discharges itself into the pools along the <a href=/people/3922 target=_blank>Pallacopas</a>. Unless, therefore, some one had dammed up the <a href=/people/3922 target=_blank>Pallacopas</a> again, so that the water might be turned back within the banks and carried down the channel of the river, it would have drained the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> into itself, and consequently the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> country would not be watered by it. But the outlet of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> into the <a href=/people/3922 target=_blank>Pallacopas</a> was dammed up by the viceroy of <a href=/people/471 target=_blank>Babylonia</a> with great labour (although it was an easy matter to construct the outlet), because the ground in this region is slimy and most of it mud, so that when it has once received the water of the river it is not easy to turn it back. But more than 10,000 <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> were engaged in this labour even until the third month. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was informed of this, he was induced to confer a benefit upon the land of <a href=/people/454 target=_blank>Assyria</a>. He determined to shut up the outlet where the stream of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> was turned into the <a href=/people/3922 target=_blank>Pallacopas</a>. When he had advanced about thirty stades, the earth appeared to be somewhat rocky, so that if it were cut through and a junction made with the old canal along the <a href=/people/3922 target=_blank>Pallacopas</a>, on account of the hardness of the soil, it would not allow the water to percolate, and there would be no difficulty in turning it back at the appointed season. For this purpose he sailed to the <a href=/people/3922 target=_blank>Pallacopas</a>, and then continued his voyage down that canal into the pools towards the country of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabs</a>. There seeing a certain admirable site, he founded a city upon it and fortified it. In it he settled as many of the Grecian mercenaries as volunteered to remain, and such as were unfit for military service by reason of age or wounds. </p>                        </div>

Here a part of his fleet lost its way in the narrow branches of the river through want of a pilot, until he sent a man to pilot it and lead it back into the channel of the river. The following story is told. Most of the tombs of the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> kings had been built among the pools and marshes. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was sailing through these marshes, and, as the story goes, was himself steering the trireme, a strong gust of wind fell upon his broad-brimmed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> hat, and the fillet which encircled it. The hat, being heavy, fell into the water; but the fillet, being carried along by the wind, was caught by one of the reeds growing near the tomb of one of the ancient kings. This incident itself was an omen of what was about to occur, and so was the fact that one of the sailors swam off towards the fillet and snatched it from the reed. But he did not carry it in his hands, because it would have been wetted while he was swimming; he therefore put it round his own head and thus conveyed it to the king. Most of the biographers of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> say that the king presented him with a talent as a reward for his zeal, and then ordered his head to be cut off; as the prophets had directed him not to permit that head to be safe which had worn the royal fillet. However, <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> says that the man received a talent; but afterwards also received a scourging for placing the fillet round his head. The same author says that it was one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> sailors who fetched the fillet for <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; but there are some who say it was <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>, and that this was an omen to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of his death and to <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> of his great kingdom. For that of all those who succeeded to the sovereignty after <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> became the greatest king, was the most kingly in mind, and ruled over the greatest extent of land after <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself, does not seem to me to admit of question. </p>                        </div>

At the same time arrived embassies from Greece, the members of which, with crowns upon their own heads, approached <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and crowned him with golden crowns, as if forsooth they came to him as special envoys deputed to pay him divine honours; and his end was not far off. Then he commended the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> for their great zeal towards him, which was shown by their obedience to <a href=/people/1899 target=_blank>Peucestas</a> in all things, and <a href=/people/1899 target=_blank>Peucestas</a> himself for the prudence which he had displayed in ruling them. He distributed these foreign soldiers among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> ranks in the following way. Each company was led by a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> decurion, and next to him was a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> receiving double pay for distinguished valour; and then came one who received ten staters, who was so named from the pay he received, being less than that received by the man with double pay, but more than that of the men who were serving as soldiers without holding a position of honour. Next to these came twelve <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, and last in the company another <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a>, who also received the pay of ten staters; so that in each company there were twelve <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and four <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, three of whom received higher pay, and the fourth was in command of the company. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> were armed in their hereditary manner; but of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> some were archers, while others had javelins furnished with straps, by which they were held. At this time <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> often reviewed his fleet, had many sham-fights with his triremes and quadriremes in the river, and contests both for rowers and pilots, the winners receiving crowns. Now arrived the special envoys whom he had despatched to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/292255SAmm class=place long=25.5435 lat=29.2052>Ammon</a> to inquire how it was lawful for him to honour <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>. They told him that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/292255SAmm class=place long=25.5435 lat=29.2052>Ammon</a> said it was lawful to offer sacrifice to him as to a hero. Rejoicing at the response of the oracle, he paid respect to him as a hero from that time. He also despatched a letter to <a href=/people/81 target=_blank>Cleomenes</a>, who was a bad man and had committed many acts of injustice in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. For my own part I do not blame him for his friendship to <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> and for his recollection of him even when dead; but I do blame him for many other acts. For the letter commanded <a href=/people/81 target=_blank>Cleomenes</a> to prepare chapels for the hero <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, one in the city itself and another in the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299IPha class=place long=29.8856 lat=31.213>Pharos</a>, where the tower is situated. The chapels were to be exceedingly large and to be built at lavish expense. The letter also directed that <a href=/people/81 target=_blank>Cleomenes</a> should take care that <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>'s name should be attached to them; and moreover that his name should be engraved on all the legal documents with which the merchants entered into bargains with each other. These things I cannot blame, except that he made so much ado about matters of trifling moment. But the following I must blame severely: If I find, said the letter, the temples and chapels of the hero <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> well completed, I will not only pardon you any crimes you may have committed in the past, but in the future you shall suffer no unpleasant treatment from me, however great may be the crimes you have committed.

On each side of the throne were couches with silver feet, upon which his personal Companions were sitting. A certain man of obscure condition (some say that he was even one of the men kept under guard without being in chains), seeing the throne and the couches empty, and the eunuchs standing round the throne (for the Companions also rose up from their seats with the king when he retired), walked through the line of eunuchs, ascended the throne, and sat down upon it. According to a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> law, they did not make him rise from the throne; but rent their garments and beat their breasts and faces as if on account of a great evil. When <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was informed of this, he ordered the man who had sat upon his throne to be put to the torture, with the view of discovering whether he had done this according to a plan concerted by a conspiracy. But the man confessed nothing, except that it came into his mind at the time to act thus. Even more for this reason the diviners explained that this occurrence boded no good to him. A few days after this, after offering to the gods the customary sacrifices for good success, and certain others also for the purpose of divination, he was feasting with his friends, and was drinking far into the night. He is also said to have distributed the sacrificial victims as well as a quantity of wine to the army throughout the companies and centuries. There are some who have recorded that he wished to retire after the drinking party to his bed-chamber; but <a href=/people/1707 target=_blank>Medius</a>, at that time the most influential of the Companions, met him and begged him to join a party of revellers at his residence, saying that the revel would be a pleasant one. </p>                        </div>

After retiring from the drinking party he took a bath; after which he took a little food and slept there, because he already felt feverish. He was carried out upon a couch to the sacrifices, in order that he might offer them according to his daily custom. After performing the sacred rites he lay down in the banqueting hall until dusk. In the meantime he gave instructions to the officers about the expedition and voyage, ordering those who were going on foot to be ready on the fourth day, and those who were going to sail with him to be ready to sail on the fifth day. From this place he was carried upon the couch to the river, where he embarked in a boat and sailed across the river to the park. There he again took a bath and went to rest. On the following day he took another bath and offered the customary sacrifices. He then entered a tester bed, lay down, and chatted with <a href=/people/1707 target=_blank>Medius</a>.

The next day he was transferred to the house near the swimming-bath, where he offered the prescribed sacrifices. Though he was now very dangerously ill, he summoned the most responsible of his officers and gave them fresh instructions about the voyage. On the following day he was with difficulty carried out to the sacrifices, which he offered; and none the less gave other orders to the officers about the voyage.

Most of them through grief and affection for their king forced their way in to see him. It is said that when his soldiers passed by him he was unable to speak; yet he greeted each of them with his right hand, raising his head with difficulty and making a sign with his eyes.

They say that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was seized with an acute paroxysm of pain over the wine-cup, on feeling which he retired from the drinking bout. One writer has not even been ashamed to record that when <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> perceived he was unlikely to survive, he was going out to throw himself into the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>, so that he might disappear from men's sight, and leave among the men of after-times a more firmly-rooted opinion that he owed his birth to a god, and had departed to the gods. But as he was going out he did not escape the notice of his wife <a href=/people/1966 target=_blank>Roxana</a>, who restrained him from carrying out his design. Whereupon he uttered lamentations, saying that she forsooth envied him the complete glory of being thought the offspring of the god. These statements I have recorded rather that I may not seem to be ignorant that they have been made, than because I consider them worthy of credence or even of narration. </p>                        </div>

According to the statement of <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a>, he lived thirty-two years, and had reached the eighth month of his thirty-third year. He had reigned twelve years and these eight months. He was very handsome in person, and much devoted to exertion, very active in mind, very heroic in courage, very tenacious of honour, exceedingly fond of incurring danger, and strictly observant of his duty to the gods. In regard to the pleasures of the body, he had perfect self-control; and of those of the mind, praise was the only one of which he was insatiable. He was very clever in recognising what was necessary to be done, even when it was still a matter unnoticed by others; and very successful in conjecturing from the observation of facts what was likely to occur. In marshalling, arming, and ruling an army, he was exceedingly skilful; and very renowned for rousing the courage of his soldiers, filling them with hopes of success, and dispelling their fear in the midst of danger by his own freedom from fear. Therefore even what he had to do in secret he did with the greatest boldness. He was also very clever in getting the start of his enemies, and snatching from them their advantages by secretly forestalling them, before any one even feared what was about to happen. He was likewise very steadfast in keeping the agreements and settlements which he made, as well as very secure from being entrapped by deceivers. Finally, he was very sparing in the expenditure of money for the gratification of his own pleasures; but he was exceedingly bountiful in spending it for the benefit of his associates. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0074.tlg001:7.29'><b>&sect; 7.29</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;APOLOGY FOR ALEXANDER'S ERRORS <br />That <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> should have committed errors in his conduct from quickness of temper or from wrath, and that he should have been induced to comport himself like the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> monarchs to an immoderate degree, I do not think remarkable if we fairly consider both his youth and his uninterrupted career of good fortune; likewise that kings have no associates in pleasure who aim at their best interests, but that they will always have associates urging them to do wrong. However, I am certain that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was the only one of the ancient kings who, from nobility of character, repented of the errors which he had committed. The majority of men, even if they have become conscious that they have committed an error, make the mistake of thinking that they can conceal their sin by defending their error as if it had been a just action. But it seems to me that the only cure for sin is for the sinner to confess it, and to be visibly repentant in regard to it. Thus the suffering will not appear altogether intolerable to those who have undergone unpleasant treatment, if the person who inflicted it confesses that he has acted dishonourably; and this good hope for the future is left to the man himself, that he will never again commit a similar sin, if he is seen to be vexed at his former errors. I do not think that even his tracing his origin to a god was a great error on <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s part, if it was not perhaps merely a device to induce his subjects to show him reverence. Nor does he seem to me to have been a less renowned king than <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a>, <a href=/people/255 target=_blank>Aeacus</a>, or <a href=/people/718 target=_blank>Rhadamanthus</a>, to whom no insolence is attributed by the men of old, because they traced their origin to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. Nor does he seem at all inferior to <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a> or <a href=/people/356 target=_blank>Ion</a>, the former being the reputed son of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, and the latter of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>. His adoption of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> mode of dressing also seems to me to have been a political device in regard to the foreigners, that the king might not appear altogether an alien to them; and in regard to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, to show them that he had a refuge from their rashness of temper and insolence. For this reason I think, he mixed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> royal guards, who carried golden apples at the end of their spears, among the ranks of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> peers with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> body-guards. <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> also asserts that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> used to have long drinking parties, not for the purpose of enjoying the wine, as he was not a great wine-drinker, but in order to exhibit his sociality and friendly feeling to his Companions. </p>                        </div>

Then, indeed, let him reflect who he is himself, and what kind of fortune he has experienced; and then consider who that man was whom he reproaches as bad, and to what a height of human success he attained, becoming without any dispute king of both continents, and reaching every place by his fame; while he himself who reproaches him is of smaller account, spending his labour on petty objects, which, however, he does not succeed in effecting, petty as they are. For my own part, I think there was at that time no race of men, no city, nor even a single individual to whom <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s name and fame had not penetrated. For this reason it seems to me that a hero totally unlike any other human being could not have been born without the agency of the deity. And this is said to have been revealed after <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s death by the oracular responses, by the visions which presented themselves to various people, and by the dreams which were seen by different individuals. It is also shown by the honour paid to him by men up to the present time, and by the recollection which is still held of him as more than human. Even at the present time, after so long an interval, other oracular responses in his honour have been received by the nation of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>. In relating the history of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s achievements, there are some things which I have been compelled to censure; but I am not ashamed to admire <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself. Those actions I have branded as bad, both from a regard to my own veracity, and at the same time for the benefit of mankind. For this reason I think that I undertook the task of writing this history not without the divine inspiration. </p>                        </div>
