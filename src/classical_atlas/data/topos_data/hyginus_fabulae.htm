When <a href=/people/598 target=_blank>Thyestes</a> saw <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a> and the sword which he wore, and recognized it as the one he had lost at the ravishing, he asked <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a> where he got it. He replied that his mother <a href=/people/2274 target=_blank>Pelopia</a> had given it to him. He bade her be summoned. She told him she had taken it from some unknown person in a rape by night, and from that embrace had borne <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a>. Then <a href=/people/2274 target=_blank>Pelopia</a> snatched the word, pretending to examine it, and plunged it in her breast. <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a>, drawing the bloody sword from his mother's breast, bore it to <a href=/people/126 target=_blank>Atreus</a>, who rejoiced, believing <a href=/people/598 target=_blank>Thyestes</a> dead. <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a> slew him as he was sacrificing on the shore, and with his father <a href=/people/598 target=_blank>Thyestes</a> returned to his father's kingdom. </p>                        </div>

He attacked their town, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410254UIsm class=place long=25.37 lat=40.96>Ismarus</a>, and distributed the spoils among his comrades. From there he went to the <a href=/people/12133 target=_blank>Lotus Eaters</a>, quite good men, whose custom it was to eat the lotus, a flower growing from the leaves. This food was so sweet that those who tasted it would forget to return home. Two men sent to them by <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, on tasting the plants they gave, forgot to return to the ships. He bound them and brought them back himself. From there he went to the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a> <a href=/people/882 target=_blank>Polyphemus</a>, son of Neputune, to whom a prophecy had been given by the augur <a href=/people/4704 target=_blank>Telemus</a>, son of Eurymus, that he should beware of being blinded by <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>. He had one eye in the middle of his forehead, and feasted on human flesh. After he drove his flock back into the cave he would place a great stone weight at the door. He shut <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> and his comrades within, and started to devour the men. When <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> saw that he could not cope with his size and ferocity, he made him drunk with the wine he had received from <a href=/people/1188 target=_blank>Maron</a>, and said that he was called <a href=/people/2905 target=_blank>Noman</a>. And so, when <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> was burning out his eye with a glowing stake, he summoned the other <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclopes</a> with is cries, and called to them from the closed cave, <a href=/people/2905 target=_blank>Noman</a> in blinding me! They thought he was speaking in sport, and did not heed. But <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> tied his comrades to the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and himself to the ram, and in this way they got out. He came to <a href=/people/289 target=_blank>Aeolus</a>, son of <a href=/people/1732 target=_blank>Hellen</a>, to whom control of the winds had been given by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>. He welcomed <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> hospitably, and gave him as a gift a bag full of winds. But his comrades took it, thinking it to be gold and silver, and when they wished to divide it, they opened the bag secretly, and the winds rushed out. He was carried again to <a href=/people/289 target=_blank>Aeolus</a>, who cast him out because the divinity of the gods seemed hostile to him. He came to the <a href=/people/10942 target=_blank>Laestrygonians</a>, whose king was <a href=/people/2278 target=_blank>Antiphates</a> . . . Some he devoured and shattered eleven of his ships, with the exception of the one in which <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> escaped when his comrades had been lost. He came to the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408139IPit class=place long=13.883 lat=40.755>Aenaria</a>, to <a href=/people/245 target=_blank>Circe</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sol</a>, who, by giving a potion, used to change men into wild beasts. When he sent <a href=/people/904 target=_blank>Eurylochus</a> to her with twenty-two of his men, she changed them from human form; but <a href=/people/904 target=_blank>Eurylochus</a> in fear did not enter, but fled and reported to <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>. <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> himself alone went to her, but on the way <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a> gave him a charm, and showed him how to deceive <a href=/people/245 target=_blank>Circe</a>. After he came to <a href=/people/245 target=_blank>Circe</a> and took the cup from her, at <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a>'s suggestion he put in the charm, and drew his sword, threatening to kill her unless she restored his comrades. Then <a href=/people/245 target=_blank>Circe</a> knew that this had not happened without the will of the gods, and so, promising that she would not do the like to him, she restored his comrades to their earlier forms. She herself lay with him, conceived, and bore two sons, <a href=/people/3109 target=_blank>Nausithous</a> and <a href=/people/1979 target=_blank>Telegonus</a>. From there he set out for Lake <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141WAve class=place long=14.0822 lat=40.8393>Avernus</a>, descended into the Lower World, and found there his comrade <a href=/people/2515 target=_blank>Elpenor</a>, whom he had left behind at <a href=/people/245 target=_blank>Circe</a>'s. He asked <a href=/people/2515 target=_blank>Elpenor</a> how he had come there, and <a href=/people/2515 target=_blank>Elpenor</a> replied that in his drunkenness he had fallen down the ladder and broken his neck. He begged him to give him burial when he returned to the upper world, and place his oar on his grave. There he also spoke to his mother, <a href=/people/5370 target=_blank>Anticlia</a>, about the end of his journey. Then he returned to the upper world, buried <a href=/people/2515 target=_blank>Elpenor</a>, and fixed the oar on his tomb as he had asked. Next he came to the <a href=/people/605 target=_blank>Sirens</a>, daughters of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> <a href=/people/2956 target=_blank>Melpomene</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383211WAch class=place long=21.1067 lat=38.3388>Achelous</a>, women in the upper parts of their bodies but bird below. It was their fate to live only so long as mortals who heard their song failed to pass by. <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, instructed by <a href=/people/245 target=_blank>Circe</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sol</a>, stopped up the ears of his comrades with wax, had himself bound to the wooden mast, and thus sailed by. From there he came to <a href=/people/10625 target=_blank>Scylla</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a>, who was woman above, but fish from the hips down, with six <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> joined to her body. She snatched and devoured six men from <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>' ship. He had come to the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> to the sacred herds of <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sol</a>, but their flesh lowed when his comrades cooked it in a brazen kettle. He had been warned by <a href=/people/468 target=_blank>Tiresias</a> and by <a href=/people/245 target=_blank>Circe</a>, too, not to touch them, and as a result he lost many comrades there. Borne on to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382156WCha class=place long=15.606 lat=38.248>Charybdis</a>, who three times a day sucked down the water and three times belched it up, by <a href=/people/468 target=_blank>Tiresias</a>' warning he passed by. But <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sol</a> was angry because his herd had been harmed. (When <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> had come to the island, and at <a href=/people/468 target=_blank>Tiresias</a>' warning forbade anyone's touching the herd, his comrades seized some <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> while he slept; as they were cooking them the flesh lowed from the brazen kettle.) For his reason <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> struck his ship with a thunderbolt and burned it Wandering from this, his comrades lost in the shipwreck, he swam to the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411127IKir class=place long=12.75 lat=41.1>Aeaea</a>, where the nymph <a href=/people/829 target=_blank>Calypso</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a>, lived. She enamoured of the handsome form of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, kept him a whole year, and was unwilling to release him until <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a>, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>'s command, bade her release him. When a raft had been made there, <a href=/people/829 target=_blank>Calypso</a> sent him off with an abundance of provisions, but <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a> shattered the raft with his waves because he had blinded his son, the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a>. While he was being tossed about by the waves, <a href=/people/6618 target=_blank>Leucothoe</a>, who we call <a href=/people/2057 target=_blank>Mater Matuta</a>, who lives forever in the sea, gave him her girdle to bind around his chest, to buoy him up. When he had done this, he swam to safety. From there he came to the island of the <a href=/people/629 target=_blank>Phaeacians</a>, and hid his nakedness under the leaves of trees. There <a href=/people/1410 target=_blank>Nausicaa</a>, daughter of King <a href=/people/10603 target=_blank>Alcinous</a>, brought garments to the stream to wash. He crept out from the leaves and begged help from her. Moved by pity, she gave him a mantle, and led him to her father. <a href=/people/10603 target=_blank>Alcinous</a> welcomed him with generous hospitality, honoured him with gifts, and sent him to his country, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383204UIth class=place long=20.643 lat=38.453>Ithaca</a>. By <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a>'s wrath, he was shipwrecked again. After the twentieth year, with the loss of his comrades, he returned alone to his country. On reaching his home, unrecognized, he found suitors who sought to marry <a href=/people/264 target=_blank>Penelope</a> occupying his palace, so he pretended to be a stranger. But his nurse <a href=/people/7673 target=_blank>Euryclia</a>, while bathing his feet, recognized him as <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> by a scar. Later, with the help of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>, he and his son <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a> and two servants killed the suitors with arrows. </p>                        </div>

Although the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> recognized him and fawned upon him, <a href=/people/636 target=_blank>Eumaeus</a> did not know him, since <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a> had changed his appearance and attire. <a href=/people/636 target=_blank>Eumaeus</a> asked him where he came from, and he replied that he had been shipwrecked. When the shepherds questioned him whether he had seen <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, he said he was his comrade, and gave signs and proofs. Soon <a href=/people/636 target=_blank>Eumaeus</a> took him into his house, and revived him with food and drink. When the servants, sent as usual to bring in the flocks, had come, and he had asked <a href=/people/636 target=_blank>Eumaeus</a> who they were, <a href=/people/636 target=_blank>Eumaeus</a> said: After <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> left, when some time had intervened, suitors came to ask for <a href=/people/264 target=_blank>Penelope</a> in marriage. She kept putting them off with this condition — 'When I finish this weaving, I shall marry' — but what she wove in the day, she unravelled at night, and so she put them off. But now they feast with the maid-servants of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> and waste his flocks. Then <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a> restored his former appearance to him. Suddenly the swineherd saw it was <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, and clinging to him and embracing him, he wept for joy, and wondering what it was that had changed him. <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> said to him: Tomorrow take me to the palace to <a href=/people/264 target=_blank>Penelope</a>. When he took him there, <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a> again changed his appearance to that of a beggar, and when <a href=/people/636 target=_blank>Eumaeus</a> took him to the wooers, and they were feasting with the hand-maids, he said to them: Look! You have another beggar, who will amuse you along with <a href=/people/1550 target=_blank>Irus</a>. Then <a href=/people/921 target=_blank>Melanthius</a>, one of the suitors, said: Yes, let them wrestle and the victor will get a stuffed <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>'s-belly pudding, and a cane to drive away the loser. When they had wrestled and <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> had struck <a href=/people/1550 target=_blank>Irus</a> and driven him out, <a href=/people/636 target=_blank>Eumaeus</a> led <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> in beggar's disguise to his nurse <a href=/people/7673 target=_blank>Euryclia</a>, and told her he was a comrade of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>. When she wished . . . was going [to cry out], <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> held his hand over her lips, and warned her, and told <a href=/people/264 target=_blank>Penelope</a> to give his bow and arrows to the suitors, saying that whoever of them drew it, could have her as a wife. When she did this . . . they strove among themselves and no one could draw it, <a href=/people/636 target=_blank>Eumaeus</a> said in ridicule: Let us give . . .  <a href=/people/921 target=_blank>Melanthius</a> did not permit . . . <a href=/people/636 target=_blank>Eumaeus</a> gave the bow to the old man. He transfixed all the suitors except <a href=/people/921 target=_blank>Melanthius</a> the slave; he was seized, apart from the suitors, and nose, arms, and other parts of his body were cut in bits. So <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> obtained his palace and his wife. He bade his handmaids cast their bodies into the sea, and later, at <a href=/people/264 target=_blank>Penelope</a>'s request, after the death of the suitors, he punished them, too. </p>                        </div>

When <a href=/people/7594 target=_blank>Desmontes</a> found this out, he blinded <a href=/people/1684 target=_blank>Melanippe</a>, and shut her in a prison, with commands that only scant food and water be given to her, and that the children be thrown to wild beasts. When they had been thrown out, a <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a> in milk came to the children and offered them her udders, and cowherds, seeing this, took the children to rear. In the meantime <a href=/people/4207 target=_blank>Metapontus</a>, King of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378263IIka class=person long=26.2 lat=37.6>Icaria</a>, demanded of his wife <a href=/people/2975 target=_blank>Theano</a> that she bear children to him, or leave the kingdom. She, in fear, sent to the shepherds asking them to find a child she could present to the king. They sent her the two babies they had found, and she presented them to king <a href=/people/4207 target=_blank>Metapontus</a> as her own. <a href=/people/2975 target=_blank>Theano</a> later bore two sons to <a href=/people/4207 target=_blank>Metapontus</a>. Since, however, <a href=/people/4207 target=_blank>Metapontus</a>, was exceedingly fond of the first two, because they were very handsome, <a href=/people/2975 target=_blank>Theano</a> sought to get rid of them and save the kingdom for her own sons. A day came when <a href=/people/4207 target=_blank>Metapontus</a> went out to perform sacrifices to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a> Metapontina, and <a href=/people/2975 target=_blank>Theano</a>, seizing the opportunity, revealed to her sons that the older boys were not her own. So, when they go out to hunt, kill them with hunting knives. When they had gone out in the mountains, at their mother's instructions, they started fighting. But with the aid of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a>, <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a>'s sons overcame them and killed them. When their bodies were borne into the palace, <a href=/people/2975 target=_blank>Theano</a> killed herself with a hunting knife. The avengers, <a href=/people/6130 target=_blank>Boeotus</a> and <a href=/people/289 target=_blank>Aeolus</a>, fled to the shepherds where they had been reared, and there <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a> revealed to them that they were his sons and that their mother was held in custody. They went to <a href=/people/7594 target=_blank>Desmontes</a>, killed him, and freed their mother, whose sight <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a> restored.

When he had taken it home, clothed in its royal garments, a fellow shepherd asked that it be given to him.

However, when <a href=/people/4337 target=_blank>Cephalus</a>, who was fond of hunting, had gone to the mountain in the early morning, <a href=/people/683 target=_blank>Aurora</a>, wife of <a href=/people/5362 target=_blank>Tithonus</a>, fell passionately in love with him, and begged for his embrace. He refused, since he had given his promise to <a href=/people/1460 target=_blank>Procris</a>. Then <a href=/people/683 target=_blank>Aurora</a> said: I don't want you to break faith, unless she has done so before you. And so she changed his form into that of a stranger, and gave him beautiful gifts to give to <a href=/people/1460 target=_blank>Procris</a>. When <a href=/people/4337 target=_blank>Cephalus</a> had come in his changed form, he gave the gifts to <a href=/people/1460 target=_blank>Procris</a> and lay with her.

When <a href=/people/4337 target=_blank>Cephalus</a> saw that javelin and <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> were so irresistible, he asked the stranger to sell them to him, not knowing she was his wife.

When led to the tyrant, <a href=/people/945 target=_blank>Aristogiton</a> escaped the guards, and <a href=/people/600 target=_blank>Harmodius</a> alone was brought before the King.

Fifth, those which <a href=/people/303 target=_blank>Danaus</a>, son of <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a>, conducted at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a> for the wedding of his daughters, with singing contests. The hymenaeus, 'wedding-hymn', was so called from these. Sixth, those which <a href=/people/6078 target=_blank>Lynceus</a>, son of <a href=/people/1155 target=_blank>Egyptus</a>, conducted once more at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a> for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=person long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a> <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>. They are called aspis en arge'. In these Games, whoever wins receives a shield instead of a crown, because, when <a href=/people/941 target=_blank>Abas</a>, son of <a href=/people/6078 target=_blank>Lynceus</a> and <a href=/people/1980 target=_blank>Hypermnestra</a>, announced to his parents that <a href=/people/303 target=_blank>Danaus</a> had perished, <a href=/people/6078 target=_blank>Lynceus</a> took down from the temple of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=person long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a> <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a> the shield which <a href=/people/303 target=_blank>Danaus</a> had carried in his youth and had dedicated to <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>, and gave it to <a href=/people/941 target=_blank>Abas</a> his son as a reward. In these Games the law is that whoever wins and again enters the contest . . . unless he wins again . . . so that he often enter. [In these games the law is that whoever wins and again enters the contest is penalized unless he wins a second time, so that the same person may not enter often.] Seventh, <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a>, son of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> and <a href=/people/416 target=_blank>Danae</a>, established funeral games for <a href=/people/2473 target=_blank>Polydectes</a>, his guardian, in the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372245PSer class=place long=24.506 lat=37.154>Seriphos</a>, and when he was wrestling [contending? ] he struck his grandfather <a href=/people/864 target=_blank>Acrisius</a> and killed him. And so, what he wouldn't have done by his own will, he did by the will of the gods. Eighth, <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> established gymnastic contests at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a> for <a href=/people/170 target=_blank>Pelops</a>, son of <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a>, in which he himself competed with Achareus in the pammachium which we call pancratium.

The seven leaders who went to attack <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a> established these. Later on in these games <a href=/people/4380 target=_blank>Euneus</a> and <a href=/people/5602 target=_blank>Deipylus</a>, sons of <a href=/people/2578 target=_blank>Jason</a> and <a href=/people/939 target=_blank>Hypsipyle</a>, won the race. In these Games, too, the Pythaules had seven (singers?) dressed in the pallium who sang the <a href=/people/10998 target=_blank>Pythia</a>. Because of this he was later called the Choraules.

When these games were over, <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> threw twelve captives on the pyre of <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a>, together with his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and his <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>.

Then, too, the ancient men of our race had on the posts of their dining-couches heads of <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> bound with vines to signify that the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> had discovered the sweetness of the vine. The vine, too, which a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> had nibbled, brought fort more fruit, and from this they invented pruning. <a href=/people/10018 target=_blank>Pelethronius</a> first invented bits and saddles for <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. Belona first invented the needle, which in Greek is called Belone. <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a>, son of <a href=/people/394 target=_blank>Agenor</a>, first produced bronze at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>. <a href=/people/255 target=_blank>Aeacus</a>, son of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>, first discovered gold in <a href=/people/6753 target=_blank>Panchaia</a> on Mount Tasus. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>, king in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a>, first discovered silver which <a href=/people/913 target=_blank>Erichthonius</a> was first to bring to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. At <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=place long=21.374 lat=37.89>Elis</a>, a city in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a>, races of four-horse chariots were first established.

The ancients didn't have obstetricians, and as a result, women because of modesty perished. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> forbade slaves and women to learn the art of medicine. A certain girl, <a href=/people/6515 target=_blank>Hagnodice</a>, a virgin desired to learn medicine, and since she desired it, she cut her hair, and in male attire came to a certain <a href=/people/2884 target=_blank>Herophilus</a> for training. When she had learned the art, and had heard that a woman was in labor, she came to her. And when the woman refused to trust herself to her, thinking that she was a man, she removed her garment to show that she was a woman, and in this way she treated women. When the doctors saw that they were not admitted to women, they began to accuse <a href=/people/6515 target=_blank>Hagnodice</a>, saying that he was a seducer and corruptor of women, and that the women were pretending to be ill. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=ethnic long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagites</a>, in session, started to condemn <a href=/people/6515 target=_blank>Hagnodice</a>, but <a href=/people/6515 target=_blank>Hagnodice</a> removed her garment for them and showed that she was a woman. Then the doctors began to accuse her more vigorously, and as a result the leading women came to the Court and said: You are not husbands, but enemies, because you condemn her who discovered safety for us. Then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> amended the law, so that free-born women could learn the art of medicine. <a href=/people/3293 target=_blank>Perdix</a>, son of <a href=/people/310 target=_blank>Daedalus</a>' sister, invented the compass, and also the saw from the spine of a fish. <a href=/people/310 target=_blank>Daedalus</a>, son of <a href=/people/3744 target=_blank>Eupalamus</a>, first made statues of the gods. Oannes, who in <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldaea</a> is said to have come from the sea, interpreted astrology. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=ethnic long=28 lat=38.5>Lydians</a> first dyed raw wool with a substance from twigs, and afterward learned to dye the thread. <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a> first invented the music of the pipes. In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a> first invented grain. Tyrrhenus, son of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, first invented a trumpet for this reason: When his comrades were apparently feasting on human flesh, the inhabitants of the region around fled from the cruel practice. So when any one of them died he blew on a hollow conch-shell and called the district together, and declared they were giving burial to the dead and not devouring them. Thus the trumpet is called the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenian</a> melody. The Romans today have this custom: whenever anyone dies, trumpeters sound and friends are called together, to testify that he did not die from poison or the sword. Summoners, too, invented the horn [?]. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> first fought with clubs; later <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a>, son of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a>, fought with a sword, and bellum, war, is named from this. </p>                        </div>
