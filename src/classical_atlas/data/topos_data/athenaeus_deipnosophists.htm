The Sophist at Dinner is its title, and the subject is a banquet given by a wealthy Roman named Larensis, who has summoned as guests the men of his time most learned in their several branches of knowledge. Not one of their excellent sayings has <a href=/people/648 target=_blank>Athenaeus</a> failed to mention. For he has contrived to bring into his book an account of fishes, their uses and names with their derivations; also vegetables of all sorts and animals of every description; historians, poets, philosophers, musical instruments, innumerable kinds of jests; he has also described drinking-cups in all their variety, the wealth of kings, the size of ships, and other matters so numerous that I could not easily mention them all; for the day would fail me if I undertook to enumerate them kind by kind. In short, the plan of the discourse reflects the rich bounty of a feast, and the arrangement of the book the courses of the dinner. Such is the delightful feast of reason which this wonderful steward, <a href=/people/648 target=_blank>Athenaeus</a>, introduces, and then, surpassing even himself, like the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> orators, he is so carried away by the ardour of his eloquence that he passes on by leaps and bounds to the further portions of his book. </p>                        </div>

For whatever the subject in which he displayed his learning, he made it appear as though that had been his only study, such was the encyclopaedic range in which he had been nurtured from boyhood. He was, as <a href=/people/648 target=_blank>Athenaeus</a> says, a satiric poet not inferior to any of the successors of <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a>. Present, too, were <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a>, <a href=/people/1837 target=_blank>Leonides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=person long=21.374 lat=37.89>Elis</a>, <a href=/people/1261 target=_blank>Aemilianus</a> <a href=/people/4602 target=_blank>Maurus</a>, and <a href=/people/1800 target=_blank>Zoilus</a>, wittiest of philologians. Of philosophers there were <a href=/people/2920 target=_blank>Pontianus</a> and <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a>, both of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408299PNik class=place long=29.923 lat=40.762>Nicomedia</a>, excelling all in wide erudition; <a href=/people/814 target=_blank>Philadelphius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329351UPto class=person long=35.0817 lat=32.9278>Ptolemais</a>, a man not merely bred in philosophic contemplation, but also of tried experience in life generally. Of the <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynics</a> there was one he calls <a href=/people/1240 target=_blank>Cynulcus</a> (<a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-catcher); for not only two fleet <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> followed him, like <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a> going to the Assembly, but many more than were in <a href=/people/583 target=_blank>Actaeon</a>'s pack. Of orators there was a company as numerous as that of the <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynics</a>, against whom, as well as all the other speakers, <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=person long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a> inveighed. He, through the constant investigation which he carries on at all hours in the streets, public walks, bookshops, and baths, has won a name that distinguishes him better than his own, Ceituceitus. This gentleman observed a law peculiar to himself, of never tasting food until he had asked whether or not a word was to be found in literature: is, for example, the word hora (season) found signifying part of a day? Is methysos (drunken) found applied to a man? Is metra (womb) found as the name of a viand, or the compound syagros said of a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>? And among physicians there were <a href=/people/3162 target=_blank>Daphnus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=person long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, pure in character as he was sacred in profession, no amateur in his grasp of the doctrines of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAca class=place long=23.707 lat=37.992>Academy</a>; <a href=/people/4533 target=_blank>Galen</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=person long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamum</a>, who has published more works on philosophy and medicine than all his predecessors, and in the exposition of his art as capable as any of the ancients; also <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404297PNic class=person long=29.7168 lat=40.4266>Nicaea</a>.

In fact this list, as <a href=/people/648 target=_blank>Athenaeus</a> says, was more like a muster-roll than a list of guests at a banquet. </p>                        </div>

In explanation, <a href=/people/648 target=_blank>Athenaeus</a> says that he owned so many ancient Greek books that he surpassed all who have been celebrated for their large libraries, including <a href=/people/331 target=_blank>Polycrates</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=person long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>, <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a> the tyrant of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, <a href=/people/1627 target=_blank>Eucleides</a>, likewise an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, <a href=/people/2765 target=_blank>Nicocrates</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=person long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, the kings of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=place long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamum</a>, <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> the poet, <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> the philosopher, <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, and <a href=/people/571 target=_blank>Neleus</a>, who preserved the books of the two last named.

Or, as the lyric poet of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a> sings, His delight is in the fair flower of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, in wit which makes our unceasing sport about the friendly table.

For who can suffer from homesickness when in the company of one who keeps his house wide open to his friends? As the comic poet <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> says: When a man enters a friend's house, he may, <a href=/people/3434 target=_blank>Nicophon</a>, discover his friend's welcome as soon as he enters the door. The janitor smiles at him, the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> wags his tail and comes to him, a slave rises to meet him and promptly sets a chair for him, even though not a word be spoken. </p>                        </div>

He once landed at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, and finding the victualler's shop empty inquired the cause.

A brave man I, among brave men I have come to dine. For common are the goods of friends. But the passage from <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a> is this: Though drinking much wine — and that unmixed with water — thou hast not paid the scot . . . and uninvited, too, thou camest, as an intimate friend might do. Nay, thy belly hath perverted thy heart and soul to shamelessness. <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a>, the comic poet, says, I believe: There are, among our guests invited to dinner, two invincibles, <a href=/people/377 target=_blank>Philocrates</a> and — <a href=/people/377 target=_blank>Philocrates</a>! For I count him, though one, as two (and lusty too); yes, even as three. Once, they say, he had been asked out to dine by some friend who told him to come when the shadow on the dial measured twenty feet. So at dawn he began to measure when the sun was rising, and when the shadow was too long by more than a couple of feet he came to dine, and said that he had arrived a little late because of business engagements — though he had come at daybreak! <a href=/people/1583 target=_blank>Amphis</a> the comic poet says that whosoever is late at a free dinner you may guess would desert right soon the ranks in battle; and <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> says, The goblet which cost nothing thou shalt not neglect. Again, The free goblet must not be neglected; nay, it must be pursued. <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> also says: That is the life the gods lead, when you can dine at others' expense with no thought of the reckoning. And again: My life is blessed indeed! I must ever discover some new device to get a morsel for my jaws. These jests have I brought from home to the banquet, after careful rehearsal, for I, too, wanted to have my house-rent ready to pay when I came. For we bards ever sacrifice without smoke.

For he considered that passions and pleasures become very strong, and that foremost among them and innate are the desires for eating and drinking, and that they who abide resolutely in frugality are well-disciplined and self-controlled in all the exigencies of life. He has, therefore, ascribed a simple manner of life to all, the same, too, for kings as for subjects, for young as for old, when he says: And to his side she drew a polished table; and the grave housekeeper brought bread and set it before them. And the carver took platters of meat and set them before them. <br />Now this meat, too, was roasted, and was for the most part beef. Excepting this he never places before them anything, whether at a festival or a wedding or any other gathering. And yet he often makes <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> entertain his chieftains at dinner; no entrees served in fig-leaves, no rare titbit or milk-cakes, or honey-cakes, does <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> serve as choice dainties for his kings, but only viands by which body and soul might enjoy strength. And so after the duel <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> especially rewarded <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> with the chine of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>. And to <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>, by this time an old man, and to <a href=/people/1543 target=_blank>Phoenix</a>, he gives roast meat, meaning to restrain us from riotous desires. And it was so with <a href=/people/10603 target=_blank>Alcinous</a>, whose choice inclined to a luxury life; he feasted the <a href=/people/629 target=_blank>Phaeacians</a>, who lived most luxuriously, and entertained the stranger <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>; he shows him the well-appointed house and garden, and then causes the same simple fare to be placed before him. <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, also, when he celebrated the nuptials of his children, at the time when <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a> came to visit him, took and set before them the roasted <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>-chine, which they had served to him as his own meed of honour. And <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a> also, though a king who had many subjects, sacrificed <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> to <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> at the seaside by the hand of the children most near and dear to him, exhorting them in these words: Nay then, let one go to the field for a heifer, and the rest. For that sort of sacrifice, made by men who are devoted and loyal, is holier and more acceptable to the gods. Even the suitors, insolent though they were, and recklessly given over to pleasure, are not represented as eating fish or birds or honey-cakes, for <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> strenuously excludes the tricks of the culinary art, the viands which <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> calls aphrodisiac, and that mentioned in many authors under the name of lastaurokakabos (as <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> says in his work On <a href=/people/626 target=_blank>Pleasure</a> and the Good), the preparation of which is rather elaborate. </p>                        </div>

What is more, he does not place fruit upon the board either, though it was abundant and he mentions it in a delightful passage, representing it as never failing throughout the year: Pear upon pear, he says, and all the rest. What is more, he also does not picture the wearing of chaplets or the use of unguents, any more than the burning of incense. On the contrary, his characters are free of all such conventions, and the foremost of them are singled out for freedom and independence. Even to the gods he ascribes a simple regimen of nectar and ambrosia. He pictures human beings as honouring the gods in their diet, denying to them the use of frankincense or myrrh or wreaths or similar luxuries. And even this simple food they do not enjoy greedily, according to him, but like an excellent physician, he forbids satiety, saying, when they had banished desire for eating and drinking. And after his heroes had satisfied their appetite some would be off to athletic practice, amusing themselves with discus and spear, in sport training themselves for serious work; while others would listen to the harpists as they set to melody and rhythm the deeds of heroes. </p>                        </div>

By way, then, of showing that moderate living is healthful, beneficial, and adapted for all, he has portrayed <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>, wisest of men, as offering wine to the physician <a href=/people/1010 target=_blank>Machaon</a> when he was wounded in the right shoulder, although <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a> was a bitter foe of passion; and the wine he gives is Pramneian, too, which we know was heavy and filling. It was no cure for thirst, but rather a device for stuffing the belly; at any rate, although <a href=/people/1010 target=_blank>Machaon</a> has already drunk, <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a> urges him to continue, saying, Be seated, and drink. He then scrapes some <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>'s milk cheese over the wine and adds an onion as a relish to make him drink more. And yet in another passage <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> says that wine relaxes and enervates bodily vigour. As for <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>, <a href=/people/2138 target=_blank>Hecuba</a>, hoping that he will stay in the city the rest of the day, invites him to pour a libation and drink, thinking thereby to excite him to gaiety. But he puts it off and goes forth to action. She insistently praises wine, but he rejects it, though panting for breath when he comes before her. She urges him to pour a libation and drink, but he thinks it unholy when he is covered with the blood of battle. Still, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> recognizes the usefulness of wine in moderation when he says that he who quaffs too eagerly injures himself. He also understands various degrees of mixing; for <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> would not have directed that the purer sort be mixed had not some sort of mixing been a daily custom. It may be that the poet was not aware that wine is too easily carried off through the pores if there be no admixture of solid food, a fact well known to physicians in practice; at any rate, for patients suffering from cardiac disorders they mix some cereal food and wine together in order to retain its effect. <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>, however, gives <a href=/people/1010 target=_blank>Machaon</a> his wine mixed with meal and cheese; and the poet makes <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> combine the advantages derived from food and wine together in the verse, The man who has had his fill of wine and food. To a hard drinker he gives the sweet draught, as he calls it: In it stood casks of wine, the old sweet draught. </p>                        </div>

This he mentions once in the <a href=/people/12112 target=_blank>Odyssey</a>: <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> and the godlike swineherd kindled a fire and prepared breakfast. And once in the <a href=/people/12111 target=_blank>Iliad</a>: Quickly they set to work and prepared breakfast. He calls the morning meal embroma; we call it akratismos, because we eat pieces of bread sopped in unmixed (akratos) wine. So <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> retains the Homeric usage: While the cook is getting breakfast, immediately continuing, Have you time to join me at breakfast? Cantharus also identifies ariston and akratismos: A. Let us, then, take breakfast here. — B. Not so; we will breakfast at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a>. <a href=/people/353 target=_blank>Aristomenes</a>: I'll get a little breakfast, a bite or two of bread, and then come back. But <a href=/people/638 target=_blank>Philemon</a> says that the ancients had four meals, akratisma, ariston, hesperisma (evening meal) and deipnon (dinner). Now the akratisma they called breaking the fast, the ariston (luncheon) they called deipnon, the evening meal dorpestos, the dinner epidorpis. In <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a> may be found the proper order of these terms, in the verses wherein <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a> is made to say: I appointed captains of divisions and of hundreds over the host, and meals I taught them to distinguish, breakfasts, dinners, and suppers, third. The fourth meal is mentioned by <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> in these words: Go thou when thou hast supped, referring to what some call deilinon, which comes between our ariston and deipnon (dinner). So ariston, in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, is the meal eaten in the early morning, whereas deipnon is the noon meal which we today call ariston, and dorpon is the evening meal. Perhaps, also, deipnon in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> is sometimes synonymous with ariston; for of the morning meal he somewhere said: They then took their deipnon, and after that began to arm for battle; that is, immediately after sunrise and the deipnon, they go forth to fight. </p>                        </div>

Certain authorities also think that a separate table is set before each diner. In the case of <a href=/people/4205 target=_blank>Mentes</a>, at any rate, they assert that a polished table was placed before him when he visited <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a>, although the tables had already been set out. But this is not a conclusive settlement of the question; for it is possible that <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> dined from the same table as <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a>. Throughout the banquet the tables remained before them fully spread, as is still the custom today among many foreign peoples, completely covered o'er with divers good things, as <a href=/people/543 target=_blank>Anacreon</a> has it. After the guest withdrew, the maids carried away much food as well as the table and the cups. But the banquet in the scene at <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>'s palace is peculiar. For after eating, the guests converse; then they wash their hands and eat once more, and still later, after their lamentation, they bethink them of supper. The notion that the tables were removed is seemingly refuted by the verse in the <a href=/people/12111 target=_blank>Iliad</a>: He had been eating and drinking, and the table still stood beside him. Accordingly we must read the line thus: Eating and drinking still, while the table stood beside him. Or else we must explain the contradiction by the special circumstances. For how could it have been decent for <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, then in mourning, to have a table set before him just as it is for revellers throughout an entire symposium? Loaves of bread were served in baskets, but at dinner only roast meat was known. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, observes <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>, never made broth when he sacrificed <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, nor did he boil the flesh or the brains, but he roasted even the entrails.

Dinners were called daites from dateisthai, to divide, and wine as well as meat was equally apportioned: By this time we had satisfied our souls with the equal feast. Again: Your health, <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>! Of the equal feast we are in no want. Hence <a href=/people/2360 target=_blank>Zenodotus</a> was convinced that an equal feast meant a goodly feast. For since food is a necessary good for man, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, he asserts, calls it equal, using an extended form of the word; for primitive men, who, of course, did not have abundant food, would fall upon it pell-mell as soon as it appeared, and forcibly snatch and wrest it from those who had it, so that in the midst of this disorder bloodshed would actually occur. So it was, probably, that the word atasthalia (wickedness) came into use, because it was amid festivity (thalia) that men first sinned against one another. But when, through <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>'s bounty, they came to have plenty, they would divide it equally to each, and in this way men came to sup in orderly fashion. Thus, also, comes the conception of loaf as a due portion, and of cake divided up into equal portions, and of goblets for drinkers challenging in their turn. In fact, these terms arose when men were progressing toward fair dealing. And so the meal is called dais from daiesthai, divide, that is, to distribute in equal portions; and the roaster of meat is daitros, or divider, because he gave an equal portion to everybody. In fact, it is only of human beings that the poet uses the word dais, but when he comes to beasts, never. But <a href=/people/2360 target=_blank>Zenodotus</a>, unaware of the etymology of the word, writes in his edition of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, gave their bodies to be a prey to <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> and a feast (dais) to birds, dignifying by this name the food of vultures and other birds of prey, although man alone progresses from primitive violence to fair dealing. Hence only man's food can be dais, and his lot is what is given to everybody. In <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> the feasters were not in the habit of carrying home anything left over, but after satisfying themselves they left it behind where they had dined. The housekeeper would take and keep it, so that if a stranger arrived she might have something to give him. </p>                        </div>

For surely the hooks had not been forged in <a href=/people/4725 target=_blank>Thrinacia</a>, but must have been brought with them on the voyage, which proves that they had had practice and skill in catching fish.

The game was called phaininda either from the players shooting the ball or because, according to <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a> the Mauretanian, its inventor was the trainer <a href=/people/10044 target=_blank>Phainestius</a>.

Another performer described by <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> danced The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, clashing his wicker shields and alternately squatting and standing up.

The suitors, he says, numbered one hundred and eight, and divided the counters between opposing sides, each side equal in number according to the number of players themselves, so that there were fifty-four on a side. A small space was left between them, and in this middle space they set one counter which they called <a href=/people/264 target=_blank>Penelope</a>; this they made the mark to be thrown at with another counter. They then drew lots, and the one who drew the first took aim. If a player succeeded in pushing <a href=/people/264 target=_blank>Penelope</a> forward, he moved his piece to the position occupied by her before being hit and thrust out, then again setting up <a href=/people/264 target=_blank>Penelope</a> he would try to hit her with his own piece from the second position which he occupied. If he hit her without touching any other player's piece, he won the game and had high hopes of marrying her. <a href=/people/1260 target=_blank>Eurymachus</a> had won the greatest number of victories in this game, and looked forward to his marriage with confidence. In this way, because of their easy life, the suitors' arms were so flabby that they could not even begin to stretch the bow. Even the servants who ministered to them were given over to luxury. Very potent, in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, is the scent of unguents.

For the same reason, in such a society they throw jackstones, dance, and play ball. <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> is wrong in saying that games were invented in the reign of <a href=/people/1880 target=_blank>Atys</a> when there was a famine; for the heroic age antedated his time.

Men of the old time were careful to gather up their garments decently, and ridiculed those who were negligent about this. Thus <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> in the <a href=/people/1854 target=_blank>Theaetetus</a> speaks of men who could render any service promptly and smartly, but did not know how to throw their cloaks over their shoulders from left to right, as gentlemen should; nor had they ever grasped the fitting harmony of words so that they could rightly sing of the lives of gods and happy men. <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a> derides <a href=/people/691 target=_blank>Andromeda</a> thus: What peasant woman beguiles thy wit — one who know not how to draw her tattered garments over her ankles?

In <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, too, women as well as men play ball, and men threw the discus and the javelin in a kind of rhythmic form: They delighted themselves with the cast of discus and spear. For the element of delight alleviates the difficulty of the throw. The young men also go out to hunt and catch every kind of quarry in order to train themselves for the perils of war, and as a result they were always stronger and healthier, as when they array themselves as a tower of strength and stand against him with their javelins. They were also acquainted with bathing, as a refreshment after toil, in various forms; they relaxed their weariness in the sea, which is especially good for the nerves; they loosened the tension of the muscles by tub-baths, then anointed themselves with oil so that, when the water dried, their bodies might not become stiff. For example, the men who returned from the reconnaissance washed away in the sea the thick sweat from their shins and neck and thighs, and having in this way refreshed themselves, they went to the polished tubs and bathed, and smearing themselves with olive oil they sat down to their meal. There is another method also of relieving fatigue by fomentations on the head: She mixed it to a pleasant warmth over my head and shoulders. For tub-baths, by reason of the water entirely enveloping the pores (as when one puts a colander into water), prevent the excretion of sweat. It cannot get through at all, unless one lifts the colander and allows the pores a relief and vent outward. So <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> explains in his Physical Problems, when he inquires why persons in sweat do not perspire after they enter warm or cold water, nor again until they emerge from the bath. </p>                        </div>

Hence he bestows the epithet beautiful on fruit-bearing trees: Beautiful trees grow there — pears, pomegranates, and apples.

Bitter the campaign they saw, for after taking one city they came away with wider breaches (εὐρυπρωκτότεροι πολύ) than had the city which they captured. Nor did the heroes allow the air to be free to the birds, for they set springes and nets to catch thrushes and doves. They also trained for bird-shooting, even hanging a dove by a fish-line from the mast of a ship and shooting at it from a distance, as is shown in the Funeral Games. But the poet is silent about the eating of vegetables, fish, and birds because that is a mark of greed, and also because it would be unseemly for the heroes to spend time in preparing them for the battle, since he judges it beneath the level of heroic and godlike deeds. But that they did use boiled flesh he makes clear when he says: Even as a cauldron boileth . . . melting the lard of some fatted <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>hog</a>. Then, too, the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>-foot which was hurled at <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> is a proof of the boiling, for nobody ever roasts the foot of an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>.

Some even assert that the flight of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> into the sea is a hint that the making of wine had long been known. For wine is sweet when sea water is poured into it. When <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> commends dark wine he often calls it fiery. For it is very potent and has the most lasting effect on the system of the drinker. <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> says that dark wine originated among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a>, and that they were the first to learn how to plant and tend vines from <a href=/people/10621 target=_blank>Oinopion</a>, son of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, who also was the founder of that island-state; and they transmitted it to other peoples. But white wine is weak and thin, while yellow wine digests more easily, having a drying quality. </p>                        </div>

There are two sorts, the dry and the sweetish. The latter attains this quality whenever south winds blow as the vintage season draws near, causing it also to become darker. Wine that is not made under these conditions is dry and of a yellow colour. Of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=demonym long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alban</a> wine there are also two sorts, one rather sweet, the other acid; both are at their best after fifteen years. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406144USur class=demonym long=14.3764 lat=40.6284>Sorrentine</a> begins to be good after twenty-five years; since it lacks oil and is very rough, it takes a long time to ripen; even when it is ripe, it is barely wholesome except for those who use it continually. The wine of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=place long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a>, which contains more oil than that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406144USur class=place long=14.3764 lat=40.6284>Sorrentum</a>, is fit to use after fifteen years. The Privernian also can be used then, being thinner than that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=place long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a> and not at all likely to go to the head. Similar to this is the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=demonym long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formian</a>, but it quickly matures and is more oily than the other. The Trifolian matures more slowly, and is more earthy than the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406144USur class=demonym long=14.3764 lat=40.6284>Sorrentine</a>. The Statan is one of the best kinds, resembling the <a href=/people/5008 target=_blank>Falernian</a>, but lighter, and innocuous. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=demonym long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tiburtine</a> is thin, easily evaporates, and matures in ten years; but it is better when aged. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127ULab class=demonym long=12.7377 lat=41.8093>Labican</a> is sweet and oily to the taste, ranking midway between <a href=/people/5008 target=_blank>Falernian</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=demonym long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alban</a>; it may be drunk at the earliest after ten years. The Gauran is both rare and excellent, besides being vigorous and rich, containing more oil than the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418129UPra class=demonym long=12.8924 lat=41.8399>Praenestine</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=demonym long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tiburtine</a>. <a href=/people/1401 target=_blank>Marsic</a> is very dry and wholesome. In the neighbourhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388269UCym class=place long=26.9363 lat=38.7595>Cyme</a>, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>, grows the so-called Ulban, which is light and ready to use after five years. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/436135PAnc class=demonym long=13.51 lat=43.61>Anconitan</a> is good, oily . . . The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401155UPyx class=demonym long=15.5214 lat=40.0778>Buxentine</a> is like the acid variety of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=demonym long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alban</a>, but its effect is wholesome. The Velitern is sweet to the taste and wholesome, but has the peculiar quality of seeming to be mixed; it gives the impression of having another kind mixed with it. The Calenian is light and more healthful than <a href=/people/5008 target=_blank>Falernian</a>. The <a href=/people/5526 target=_blank>Caecuban</a> is also a generous wine, but overpowering and strong; it matures only after many years. The <a href=/people/9412 target=_blank>Fundan</a> is strong, heavy-bodied, and apt to attack head and smooth; hence it is not often drunk at symposia. The <a href=/people/11083 target=_blank>Sabine</a> is lighter than all of these, ready to drink after from seven to fifteen years. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417130USig class=demonym long=13.0261 lat=41.6952>Signine</a> is good in the sixth year, but much better when aged. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420126UNom class=demonym long=12.6459 lat=42.0292>Nomentan</a> matures quickly and is drinkable after the fifth year; it is neither too sweet nor too thin. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=demonym long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spoletine</a> wine . . . is sweet to the taste and of a golden colour. The <a href=/people/8703 target=_blank>Aequan</a> is in many respects like the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406144USur class=demonym long=14.3764 lat=40.6284>Sorrentine</a>. The Barine is very dry and constantly improves. The Caucine is likewise a generous wine and similar to <a href=/people/5008 target=_blank>Falernian</a>. The Venefran is wholesome and light. The Trebellic of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> is temperate in its effect, wholesome and tasty. The Erbulan is at first dark, but becomes white after a few years; it is very light and delicate. The wine of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433054PMas class=place long=5.36 lat=43.3>Marseilles</a> is good; but it is uncommon, rich, and full-bodied. The wine of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>, and in fact all the wines of that latitude, are soft, having no violent effect and no strength; they are sweet and wholesome. The <a href=/people/643 target=_blank>Mamertine</a>, to be sure, grows outside of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>; in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, where it grows, it is called Iotaline.

The sweet wine, therefore, which is called Pollian among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> Greeks, must be this Bibline.

For they place in the wine-jar dough made from spelt, first mixing it with honey, so that the wine gets its fragrance from itself, but its sweetness from the dough. And further on he says: If you mix hard and fragrant wine with smooth and odourless wine, as, for instance, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=demonym long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heracleote</a> and <a href=/people/886 target=_blank>Erythraean</a>, the one supplies smoothness, the other fragrance. <br />Perfumed wine finds mention in <a href=/people/2540 target=_blank>Poseidippus</a>: A strange, thirsty wine is this precious perfumed stuff.

As for the white, it is by nature thinnest, diuretic, and heating; while it is a digestive, it makes the head hot; for this wine is heady. Dark wine, if not inclined to be sweet, is very nutritious, also astringent. But the sweet varieties, both of white and yellow wines, are the most nutritious. For sweet wine smooths the tract through which it passes, and by thickening the humours more, tends to incommode the head less. In fact, the quality of sweet wine causes it to remain in the hypochondriac regions and induces salivation, as <a href=/people/336 target=_blank>Diocles</a> and <a href=/people/2925 target=_blank>Praxagoras</a> record.

Wines which are more carefully treated with sea water do not cause headache; they loosen the bowels, excite the stomach, cause inflations, and assist digestion. Examples are the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=demonym long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndian</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal class=demonym long=27.4238 lat=37.0323>Halicarnassian</a>.

The wine of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369273PKos class=place long=27.2859 lat=36.8914>Cos</a> also is very highly treated with sea water. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=demonym long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodian</a>, also, has, to be sure, a smaller share of the sea, but most of it is useless. The island wine is naturally well adapted for drinking-bouts and not unsuitable for daily use. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=demonym long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidian</a> wine produces blood, is nourishing, and causes easy relaxing of the bowels; but when drunk too copiously it weakens the stomach. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=demonym long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbian</a> has less astringency and is more diuretic. The pleasantest is the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=demonym long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chian</a>, especially the variety known as Ariusian. There are three kinds of it; one dry, another rather sweet, the third, a mean between these two in taste, and called self-tempered. Now the dry has a good taste, is nourishing and more diuretic; the sweet is nourishing, satisfying, and laxative; the self-tempered is mid-way between them in useful effects. Speaking generally, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=demonym long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chian</a> wine promotes digestion, is nourishing, produces good blood, is very mild, and is satisfying in its rich quality. But the pleasantest wines are the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=demonym long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alban</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=person long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and the <a href=/people/5008 target=_blank>Falernian</a>.

But they should be made rather early in the season and set aside in an open space so that the richness peculiar to their nature may evaporate. A very pleasant wine, when old, is the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer class=demonym long=19.9156 lat=39.6063>Corcyraean</a>.

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=demonym long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilician</a> wine called Abates is merely a laxative. Hard waters, like those from springs and rains, suit the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369273PKos class=demonym long=27.2859 lat=36.8914>Coan</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=demonym long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndian</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal class=demonym long=27.4238 lat=37.0323>Halicarnassian</a>, and all other wines which have been abundantly treated with sea water, provided the water be thoroughly filtered, and have stood for some time.

Even better than this is the <a href=/people/10343 target=_blank>Taeniotic</a> (strip-) wine, so-called.

Many even add cabbage-seed to all remedies concocted against drunkenness. Wherever cabbages grow in a vineyard the wine produced is darker.

So also <a href=/people/3045 target=_blank>Melanippides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367244PMel class=person long=24.4199 lat=36.7389>Melos</a>: Wine, my master, named after <a href=/people/490 target=_blank>Oineus</a>. <a href=/people/745 target=_blank>Hecataeus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=person long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a> declares that the vine was discovered in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=place long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aitolia</a>, and he adds: <a href=/people/6736 target=_blank>Orestheus</a>, son of <a href=/people/10993 target=_blank>Deucalion</a>, went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=place long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aitolia</a> to assume the kingship, and a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>bitch</a> of his gave birth to a stalk. He ordered that it be buried, and from it sprang a vine with many clusters. For this reason he called his own son <a href=/people/6819 target=_blank>Phytius</a> (Vine-grower). When his son <a href=/people/490 target=_blank>Oineus</a> was born, he was named after the vines. For the ancient Greeks, <a href=/people/648 target=_blank>Athenaeus</a> explains, called grape-vines oinai. And the son of <a href=/people/490 target=_blank>Oineus</a> was <a href=/people/1645 target=_blank>Aetolus</a>. But <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, explaining the etymology in the <a href=/people/3010 target=_blank>Cratylus</a>, says that oinos is for oionous, because wine fills our brain with false impressions. Or perhaps it is so called from onesis (benefit), since <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> alludes to the derivation of the word somewhat in this way: Then shalt thou thyself be benefited if thou wilt but drink. In fact he calls all victuals oneiata (benefits) because they help us. In wine, <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, the gods devised the best remedy for mortal men to dissipate care. The writer of the <a href=/people/3573 target=_blank>Cypria</a>, whoever he may be, is authority for this.

For it gives food to them that take it, and strength in mind and body. In medicine it is most beneficial; it can be mixed with liquid drugs and it brings aid to the wounded. In daily intercourse, to those who mix and drink it moderately, it gives good cheer; but if you overstep the bounds, it brings violence. Mix it half and half, and you get madness; unmixed, bodily collapse. Wherefore <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> is everywhere called physician. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphic</a> priestess, too, has directed certain persons to call <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> health-giver. <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a> makes <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> say: Three bowls only do I mix for the temperate — one to health, which they empty first, the second to love and pleasure, the third to sleep. When this is drunk up wise guests go home. The fourth bowl is ours no longer, but belongs to violence; the fifth to uproar, the sixth to drunken revel, the seventh to black eyes. The eighth is the policeman's, the ninth belongs to biliousness, and the tenth to madness and hurling the furniture. Too much wine, poured into one little vessel, easily knocks the legs from under the drinkers. And <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> says: A. After the sacrifice, a feast . . . after the feast, drinking. — B. Fine, in my humble opinion! — A. Yes, but after drinking comes mockery, after mockery filthy insult, after insult a law-suit, after the law-suit a verdict, after the verdict shackles, the stocks, and a fine. <a href=/people/2338 target=_blank>Panyasis</a>, the epic poet, ascribes the first toast to the <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a>, the Hours, and <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, the second to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> and <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> again, the third, however, to Violence and Ruin. He says: The first portion fell to the lot of the <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a> and the merry Hours, and to noisy <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, the very gods who inspired the round. For the next following the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>-born goddess and <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> drew the lot. Here men get the greatest good from drinking wine. If a man, content with that, goes back home from the still pleasant feast, he can never meet with any harm. But if he persist to the full measure of the third round and drink to excess, there rises the bitter doom of Violence and Ruin, with evils to men in their train. So then, good sir (for thou hast a proper measure of sweet drink), go to thy wedded wife and let thy companions rest. For I fear, when that third sweet round is quaffed, that Violence may excite wrath in thy heart and crown a goodly entertainment with an evil end. Nay, obey, and cease from too much drinking. And continuing the subject of wine immoderately used, <a href=/people/2338 target=_blank>Panyasis</a> says: After that the doom of Ruin and overcome follows close upon the victim. According to <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, the revel brings blows, insult, and outrage, whence some declare that <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> and <a href=/people/3403 target=_blank>Hybris</a> (Violence) were born at the same time. <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> says somewhere: Man is, in a way, much like wine in his nature; young wine, like the young man, is bound to boil up at first and do violence; but when it has lost its ferment it grows hard, and after passing the crisis of all these conditions I speak of, and having had this top froth skimmed from the surface, it is at last fit to use; it settles down again and always thereafter is pleasant to all. And according to the poet of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a>, There is wine, which has the strength of fire when it enters into men; it swells them as the north or south wind swells the Libyan sea, and brings to light the hidden things in the deep; so wine drives the wits from men in complete upheaval. But in another passage <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> says just the opposite: Man is not at all like wine in his nature; for when he has grown old he loses his flavour, whereas the oldest wine is what we strive to get. The one bites, the other makes us merry. And Panysasis says: </p>                        </div>

It is loyal, a defender from evil, a companion to solace every pain. Yea, wine is the desired portion of the feast and of merry-making, of the tripping dance and of yearning love. Therefore, thou shouldst receive and drink it at the feast with glad heart, and when satisfied with food thou shouldst not sit still like a child, filled to over-flowing, oblivious of the mirth. And again: But wine is the best gift of gods to men, sparkling wine; every song, every dance, every passionate love, goes with wine. It drives all sorrows from men's hearts when drunk in due measure, but when taken immoderately it is a bane. <a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaeus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379153PTau class=person long=15.2921 lat=37.8523>Tauromenium</a> says that in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373136PAkr class=place long=13.5855 lat=37.2906>Agrigentum</a> there is a house which is called the trireme from the following circumstance. A party of young fellows were drinking in it, and became so wild when overheated by the liquor that they imagined that they were sailing in a trireme, and that they were in a bad storm on the ocean. Finally they completely lost their sense, and tossed all the furniture and bedding out of the house as though upon the waters, convinced that the pilot directed them to lighten the ship because of the raging storm. Well, a great crowd gathered and began to carry off the jetsam, but even then the youngsters did not cease from their mad actions. The next day the military authorities appeared at the house and made complaint against the young men when they were still half-seas over. To the questions of the magistrates they answered that they had been much put to it by a storm and had been compelled to throw into the sea the superfluous cargo. When authorities expressed surprise at their insanity, one of the young men, though he appeared to be the eldest of the company, said to them, Ye <a href=/people/12004 target=_blank>Tritons</a>, I was so frightened that I threw myself into the lowest possible place in the hold and lay there. The magistrates, therefore, pardoned their delirium, but sentenced them never to drink too much, and let them go. They gratefully promised . . . If, said he, we ever make port after this awful tempest, we shall rear altars in our country to you, as Saviours in visible presence, side by side with the sea gods, because you appeared to us so opportunely. This is why the house was called the trireme. <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philochorus</a> says that drinkers not only reveal what they are, but also disclose the secrets of everybody else in their outspokenness. Hence the saying, wine is truth also, and wine revealeth the heart of man. Hence also the tripod as prize of victory in the festival of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>. For of those who speak the truth we say that they speak from the tripod, and it must be understood that the mixing-bowl is <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>'s tripod. For in ancient times there were two sorts of tripods, both of which came to be termed cauldrons. The one called bath-pourer was also made to stand over a fire. Thus <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a>: This was contained in the household cauldron, tripod-mounted, which ever keeps its station above the fire. </p>                        </div>

Wherefore the tripod is proper to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> because of its prophetic truth, while to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> it is proper because of the truth of wine. Now Semos of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=person long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a> says: Bronze tripod; not the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a>, but rather what is now termed cauldron. Of these some were not intended for fire, and in them they mixed wine; others were pitchers for the bath, in which they heated water, and they were made to stand over a fire. Of these latter some had handles, but having three feet as a base they were called tripods. <a href=/people/1241 target=_blank>Ephippus</a> says somewhere: A. Too much wine makes you babble too much. — B. Ay, but they say that men in their cups speak the truth. And <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>: One may hide all else, <a href=/people/402 target=_blank>Pheidias</a>, but not these two things — that he is drinking wine, and that he has fallen in love. Both of these betray him though his eyes and through his words, so that the more he denies, the more they make it plain. <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philochorus</a> has this: <a href=/people/1385 target=_blank>Amphictyon</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, learned from <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> the art of mixing wine, and was the first to mix it. So it was that men came to stand upright, drinking wine mixed, whereas before they were bent double by the use of unmixed. Hence he founded an altar of the 'upright' <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> in the shrine of the <a href=/people/2317 target=_blank>Seasons</a>; for these make ripe the fruit of the vine. Near it he also built an altar to the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> to remind devotees of the mixing; for the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> are said to be the nurses of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>. He also instituted the custom of taking just a sip of unmixed wine after meat, as a proof of the power of the good gratitude, but after that they might drink mixed wine, as much as each man chose. They were also to repeat over this cup the name of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the <a href=/people/1517 target=_blank>Saviour</a> as a warning and reminder to drinkers that only when they drank in this fashion would they surely be safe. <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> in the second book of the Laws says that the use of wine is designed to promote health. From the condition produced by wine they liken <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> to a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> or a leopard, because they who have indulged too freely are prone to violence. <a href=/people/529 target=_blank>Alcaeus</a>: Sometimes drawing for themselves honey-like sweetness, sometimes, again, what is sharper than caltrops. There are some drinkers who become full of rage, like a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>. <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>: Insolent <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>, driving rage into their horns.

No man who is fond of drinking is base. For the twice-mothered <a href=/people/1553 target=_blank>Bromius</a> delights not in the company of wicked men or untutored ways, says <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>; and he adds that wine makes all fond of talk who drink it too freely. The author of the epigram on <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> says: 'Wine,' I aver, 'is a mighty <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> to the witty bard, but you that drink water can never produce anything good.' Thus spoke <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a>, O <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, and breathed not of one wine-skin, but reeked of every cask. Therefore his halls teemed with chaplets, and he had a brow like thine, yellow with the ivy berry. <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> says that in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379237HMou class=place long=23.658 lat=37.938>Munychia</a> honours are paid to a hero Acratopotes (Drinker of unmixed wine), and that among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> statues of heroes named <a href=/people/9759 target=_blank>Matton</a> (Kneader) and <a href=/people/9101 target=_blank>Ceraon</a> (Mixer) have been set up by certain cooks in the public mess. In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=place long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaea</a>, also, Deipneus, who got his name from deipna (dinners), is held in honour. From dry food no jests will grow nor impromptu verses — nor yet, again, will conceit or boasting of spirit. Rightly, therefore, the line, whither are gone the boasts ye uttered in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=place long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnos</a>, when ye ate much flesh and drank goblets brimming with wine, is bracketed by the scholar <a href=/people/340 target=_blank>Aristarchus</a> in his notes, because it represents the Greeks as boasting after eating meat. For boasting, ridicule, and jests spring not from every kind of heartiness and fullness, but only from that which alters the spirit so completely that it inclines to illusion, which happens only through wine. Wherefore <a href=/people/1587 target=_blank>Bacchylides</a> says: A sweet compelling impulse issues from the cups and warms the heart; and hope of love fulfilled speeds through the brain when mingled with the gifts of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, sending the thoughts of men to topmost heights. Soon it breaks down even the battlements of cities, and every man dreams of being a monarch. With gold, yes, and with ivory, his house glitters; wheat-laden ships carry over the shining sea mighty wealth from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. Thus does the drinker's heart leap with fancies. </p>                        </div>

Inspired by wine, both comedy and tragedy were invented in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381239DIka class=place long=23.9005 lat=38.0956>Icarium</a>, a village of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, at the very time of the vintage (tryge). Hence comedy was at first called trygoedia. The vine, antidote to sorrow, was given to mortals; without wine <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a> lives not, and every other joy of mortals dies, says <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> in the Bacchae. And <a href=/people/2999 target=_blank>Astydamas</a> also says: He revealed to mortals that cure for sorrow, the vine, mother of wine. — If a man fill himself too continually he loses thought, but if he drink moderately he becomes full of ideas, says <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>. I have drunk not to the clouding of my reason, but just so much that I can still surely distinguish the syllables with my tongue, says <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>. <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> maintains that in old times it was not the custom to indulge in too much wine or in any other luxury, except in honour of the gods. Hence they named their carousals either thoinai or thaleiai or methai — the first, because they thought it their duty to take wine for the gods' sake, the second because they gathered and came together to grace the gods. This, namely, is the meaning of daita thaleian (bountiful feast). As for the term methe (drunkenness) <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says that the verb methyo (get drunk) comes from the use of wine after sacrifice. Sacrificing but meagre offerings in rites to the gods, albeit more pious than they who offer <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, says <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>. In this way he indicates that the word rite means festival. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, too, has these lines: As for me, I say that no more precious rite could be celebrated than when mirth possesseth the whole people. Further, we call by the name of mystic rites those festivals which are still more important and are accompanied by certain traditional mysteries, deriving the name from the large sums expended upon them. For telein means to spend generously, and those who spend much are called polyteleis, those who spend little, euteleis. <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> says: The prosperous should live ostentatiously, and so make plain the god's bounty. For the god who had bestowed these blessings thinks that a man should feel grateful to him for what he has done. But when men try to hide their fortune, alleging that they are but indifferently well off, the god sees that they are ungrateful and are living meanly, and at the first opportunity he seizes and wrests from them all that he has given before. All this is said by way of oenologizing, or talking about wines; gulping down, as it were, all the names of wines. He who has been accustomed from his earliest upbringing to drink water takes no pleasure in the cup. Pleasant it is, at the feast and the bounteous banquet, for men to enjoy themselves with stories after they are satisfied with eating, says <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> in the epic tale of <a href=/people/790 target=_blank>Melampus</a>. It has not occurred to any of you to speak about waters, although from its mixture with water the wine is drawn for drinking. And yet the grandiloquent <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> has said that of all things water is best. </p>                        </div>

He also praises its clearness: Four fountains gushed with water white. Whatever flows lightly and is of unusual value he calls desirable. Thus he speaks of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398223WTit class=place long=22.139 lat=39.726>Titaresius</a>, which flows into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399227WPen class=place long=22.7094 lat=39.9298>Peneius</a>, as desirable. He also mentions water fit for cleansing in a passage which <a href=/people/2925 target=_blank>Praxagoras</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369273PKos class=person long=27.2859 lat=36.8914>Cos</a> accepts with approval . . . <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> speaks of it as good; It flows past, good for cleansing even very soiled garments. Moreover, he distinguishes fresh water from broad; in speaking of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>, he uses the term broad. But of fresh water he says: We stayed our ships near a well of fresh water. He also knows the good qualities of hot water in the treatment of wounds. For he makes of this a fomentation to apply to <a href=/people/665 target=_blank>Eurypylus</a> when he was wounded. And yet if one had merely to check the flow of blood, cold water would have been suitable, since it hardens and contracts the flesh; but for dulling pain <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> causes <a href=/people/665 target=_blank>Eurypylus</a> to be bathed with hot water, since it is potent for soothing. In <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, too, the word liaros means hot. This he makes quite clear in the passage about the sources of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262WSka class=place long=26.213 lat=39.994>Scamander</a>: The one, he says, flows with hot water, and about it smoke rises up as from a blazing fire. Must not this be hot, when from it a fiery vapour and hot smoke rise into the air? But concerning the other spring he says that in summer it flows like hail or chilling snow or ice which forms from water. And just as he is wont to say of fresh wounds that the warm blood flows round them, so, in the case of <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, he says while yet the blood welled up warm from his wound (employing the word thermos), but, on the other hand, of the stag which flees after being shot, he says (changing the word toliaros), while the blood is warm and his limbs are strong to move. But <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> call what is warm metakeras (lukewarm), according to <a href=/people/132 target=_blank>Eratosthenes</a>: diluted, he says, and lukewarm. Regarding other waters, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> calls those which flow from rocks dark, meaning unfit for use. He prefers to all others the water of springs and those which flow through fertile and rather deep soil, as <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> does also: A spring perpetual and ever flowing, which has not been fouled. And <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> says: Ambrosial water, honeyed delight, flows from the fair spring of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384230SApo class=place long=23.00886 lat=38.39014>Tilphossa</a>. This <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384230SApo class=place long=23.00886 lat=38.39014>Tilphossa</a> is a spring in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a>, from which, <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> says, <a href=/people/468 target=_blank>Teiresias</a> drank; but not being able to bear its coldness because of his age he died. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, in his work On Waters, says that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> water is very fertilizing and fresh. Hence it loosens the drinker's bowels, since it contains a soda ingredient. In his work On Plants he says that in some places water occurs which promotes conception, as in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383232PThe class=place long=23.1549 lat=38.2935>Thespiae</a>, whereas in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391262PPyr class=place long=26.286 lat=39.155>Pyrrha</a> it produces sterility. He also says that some fresh waters are sterile or not very favourable to conception, like that in Pheta or in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391262PPyr class=place long=26.286 lat=39.155>Pyrrha</a>. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001:2.42'><b>&sect; 2.42</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;And once, when droughts had occurred in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> valley, the flow of water became poisonous and many <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> died. He further says that many bitter waters as well as salt water and entire rivers change their character; such is the river in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=place long=28.7 lat=37.01>Caria</a> on the banks of which stands a shrine to Zenoposeidon. The reason is that many thunderbolts fall in that region. Other waters, again, are like solids, and have a considerable density, like the water of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375234PTro class=place long=23.3484 lat=37.5033>Troezen</a>, for it is no sooner tasted than it becomes a mouthful. The waters near the mines of Mt. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409241LPan class=place long=24.0828 lat=40.9169>Pangaion</a> weigh in the winter time ninety-six drachms to the half pint, while in summer they weigh forty-six. Cold weather contracts it and gives it greater density. Hence, also, water flowing in water-clocks does not correctly give the hours in winter, but makes them too long, since the flow is slower on account of its density. He asserts the same even of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, where the climate is milder. But salty water is more earthy and requires longer boiling than sea water, as sea water is naturally warmer and not affected in the same way. Of salty waters the only one that is hard is the water of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153WAre class=place long=15.2929 lat=37.0573>Arethusa</a>. Inferior, also, are the heavier, the harder, and the colder waters for the same reasons: they are more difficult to boil partly because of the large content of solids and partly because of their excess of cold. On the other hand, those which heat quickly are light and healthful. In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395223UKra class=place long=22.3057 lat=39.4996>Crannon</a> there is a water, slightly warm, which retains warmth in the wine mixed with it for two or three days. Running waters, including those drawn from an aqueduct, are as a rule better than standing water, and when aerated are still softer. For this reason even snow water is thought to be good, because the more potable element is drawn to the surface and this is broken up by the air; it is, therefore, even better than rain water, and water obtained from ice, also, is better because it is lighter; the proof is that ice itself is lighter than water in general. But cold waters are hard because they are more solid, and whatever is corporeal is warmer when heated and colder when cooled. For the same reason water on the mountains is better to drink than water in the plains, because it is mixed less with solid matter. This solid matter also causes the shades of colour in water. For example, the water in the lake at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> is red for several days, while that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/470320WBor class=place long=32.4546 lat=46.5629>Borysthenes</a> at certain periods is violet-coloured, although it is extremely light. The proof: when the north wind blows the river rises higher than the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469320WHyp class=place long=32.007 lat=46.9324>Hypanis</a> because of its lightness. In many places there are springs which are rather good to drink from and have a winy flavour, like the one in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap class=place long=30 lat=41>Paphlagonia</a>, to which the natives are said to resort for tippling. Others, however, among the <a href=/people/11018 target=_blank>Sicani</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=person long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, are salty as well as acid. In the dominion of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> there is a well in which the water at the top is like oil, but of a darker hue; they skim this off in globules and use it for <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>. Among other peoples also occur springs with a similar oiliness, like the one in Asia, about which <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> wrote word that he had discovered a well of oil. Among the naturally warm waters some are fresh, as those in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=demonym long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilician</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358368PAeg class=place long=35.788 lat=36.769>Aegae</a>, in the neighbourhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393229PPag class=place long=22.9258 lat=39.3546>Pagasae</a>, </p>                        </div>

For in the hot summer weather they beset him closely for as much as thirty days, and although they observed that he did not abstain from any salt food, they were constrained to believe him when he said that he had a perfectly good bladder. To be sure, he did use liquids, nevertheless he had no real need of them with his food. It is pleasant, says <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>, to change to different food, and when one is stuffed too often with common viands the mere taste of something new affords redoubled pleasure. The king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, as <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> tells us in the first book, has drinking-water brought to him from the <a href=/people/1774 target=_blank>Choaspes</a>, which flows by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus class=place long=48.247 lat=32.191>Susa</a>; that is the only water he drinks.

But <a href=/people/4303 target=_blank>Staphylus</a> declares that <a href=/people/790 target=_blank>Melampus</a> was the first to invent the mixing of wine with water. Pleistonicus also remarks that water is a better aid to digestion than wine. Those who drink toasts too constantly come to have an unnatural condition of the stomach; it is much more apt to go wrong, and often causes corruption in the food taken. He, therefore, who would enjoy health should have recourse to suitable exercises to provoke abundant perspiration, and also to baths, in order to moisten and soften the body; then he should drink the best water obtainable, in winter and spring as hot as he can bear it, in summer cold, in order not to weaken the stomach before it must act; he should also drink in quantities proportioned to the amount of food, that the water may be absorbed in the system before the wine, and thus prevent the wine from being distributed in full force and so attack and eat away the walls of the vascular organs. But if any of us find this irksome, let him take before dinner some warm sweet wine diluted, preferably what is called protropos (the sweet <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=demonym long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbian</a>), which is good for the stomach. Wine that is rather sweet does not make the head heavy, as <a href=/people/197 target=_blank>Hippocrates</a> says in his book On Diet — a work which some entitle Acute Diseases, others On Barley Gruel, and others still Refutation of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=demonym long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidian</a> Principles. He says: Sweet wine is less apt to cause headache than that of more vinous power; it attacks the brain less violently, and traverses the digestive tract more easily than the other. We should not drink like the <a href=/people/6329 target=_blank>Carmani</a>, of whom <a href=/people/645 target=_blank>Poseidonius</a> says: These people, namely, eager to prove their friendship in their drinking bouts, open the veins of the forehead, and mixing the blood which streams down in their wine, they imbibe it, </p>                        </div>

After this peculiar mode of drinking the wine, they smear the head with perfume, preferably of rose, but failing that, of quince, in order to repel the effects of the draught and not be injured by the fumes from the wine; if quince perfume is not at hand, they use orris or nard. Appropriately, therefore, <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> says: He anoints his nostrils with perfume; a highly important element of health is to put good odours to the brain. One should, however, avoid the richer unguents and drink water which is light and transparent in appearance, light, too, in actual weight and free from solid matter. Good water is that which heats and cools in a reasonable time, and when poured into a bronze or silver vessel does not tarnish it. <a href=/people/197 target=_blank>Hippocrates</a> also says: Water which heats and cools quickly is always lighter in weight. Waters which cook vegetables slowly are poor. Such are those which contain soda or salt. In his treatise On Waters, <a href=/people/197 target=_blank>Hippocrates</a> calls good water potable. Stagnant waters are bad, such as those in ponds and marshes. Even among spring waters the majority are too hard. And <a href=/people/763 target=_blank>Erasistratus</a> says: Some persons approve waters by their weight without proper testing. Witness, for example, the water of the <a href=/people/284 target=_blank>Amphiaraus</a> spring compared with that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=place long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretria</a>. The one is bad, the other good, but there is no difference in their weight whatever. <a href=/people/197 target=_blank>Hippocrates</a> in his work On Places says that all waters are best which issue from high elevations and deep-soiled hills. For they are clear and fresh, and may be mixed with only a little wine; in winter, also, they are tepid, in summer, cool. He particularly recommends those whose streams issue toward the rising sun, more especially toward the quarter where it rises in summer. For then they must necessarily be sparkling, fragrant, and light. <a href=/people/336 target=_blank>Diocles</a> says that water is useful for digestion; it does not cause flatulence, it is moderately cooling, clears the vision, does not oppress the head in the least, and produces activity of mind and body. <a href=/people/2925 target=_blank>Praxagoras</a>, too, says the same, but he commends rain water, whereas Evenor prefers cistern water, and further says that the water from the <a href=/people/284 target=_blank>Amphiaraus</a> spring is superior in comparison with that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=place long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretria</a>. That water is, beyond dispute, nourishing, is proved by the fact that some animals, like the cicadae, feed on that alone. Many other liquids are also nourishing, such as milk, barley-water, and wine. Children at the breast, at any rate, are sufficiently nourished by milk, and many tribes live by milk-drinking. There is also a story that <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410250PAbd class=person long=24.9833 lat=40.95>Abdera</a>, having decided because of his years to give up life, cut down his food from day today; but when the holy days of the <a href=/people/1058 target=_blank>Thesmophoriae</a> drew near, the women of his family entreated him not to die during the festival, since they desired to observe it. So he yielded, and bade them set before him a dish of honey; and the man survived the requisite number days although he ate only what was served of honey; when the days were over and the honey was removed, he died. But <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> was always fond of honey, and when someone asked him how he might live a healthy life he replied, by wetting his inside with honey, his outside with oil. </p>                        </div>

Cherries. — <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> on Plants The cherry is a tree of peculiar character and large growth; it even attains a height of twenty-four cubits. Its leaf is similar to that of the medlar, but is tough and broader; its bark is like the linden's, the blossom is white, resembling the pear and the medlar, composed of tiny flowers, and waxy. The fruit is red, shaped like a persimmon, but in size like a bean. But the stone of the persimmon is hard, while that of the cherry is brittle. And again: crataegus ('thorn'), called by others crataegonus; this has an elongated leaf like that of the medlar but is larger, broader, and more oblong; but it has no fissure as the medlar leaf has. The tree does not grow to be either very tall or very thick; the wood is vari-coloured, yellowish and hard. The bark is as smooth as medlar. It has a single root, generally descending deep. The fruit is round like that of the wild olive; as it ripens it becomes yellow and then darkens; it has the flavour and the juiciness of a medlar, whence it may rather be regarded as a wild medlar. From this description, <a href=/people/648 target=_blank>Athenaeus</a> remarks, the scholar appears to means what we call today the cherry. <a href=/people/625 target=_blank>Asclepiades</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404289PBry class=person long=28.8827 lat=40.3756>Myrlea</a>, mentioning a kind of bush-cherry, spoke of it thus: In the country of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=ethnic long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynians</a> grows the bush-cherry, the root of which is not large, nor, for that matter, is the tree, but equal in size to the rose-bush; its fruit, in all other respects, resembles the cherry, but it causes drowsiness, as of wine, to those who eat too much, and makes the head ache. The author thinks, from this description, that <a href=/people/625 target=_blank>Asclepiades</a> is speaking of the arbutus. For not only does the tree bearing this fruit correspond to this description, but it is also true that whoever eats more than seven berries of it gets a headache. <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>: On the mountains, without cultivation, the arbutus-trees used to grow in plenty for their enjoyment. <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>: They eat myrtle-berries and ripe fruit of the arbutus-tree. <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a>: The ripe loveliness of her breasts is as the apple or the arbutus-berry. <a href=/people/1583 target=_blank>Amphis</a>: The mulberry-tree, look you, bears mulberries, the ilex acorns, the strawberry-tree arbutus. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>: The strawberry-tree, which bears the edible arbutus-berry.

And the tree, carya, occurs in <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>: Walnut-trees and ash-trees. <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a>: Beechnuts and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380244PKar class=demonym long=24.427 lat=38.027>Carystian</a> walnuts.

Almonds. — The almonds of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=place long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxos</a> were often mentioned in ancient writers, and in fact they are of excellent quality on that island, as I have proved to my own satisfaction, says <a href=/people/648 target=_blank>Athenaeus</a>. <a href=/people/456 target=_blank>Phrynichus</a>: He has knocked out all my molars, so that I couldn't crack a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=demonym long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxian</a> almond. Excellent almonds also grow on the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>; compared with varieties from other countries they are oblong and crooked at the extremity. <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> in his Dialect Lexicon says that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> call the nuts, when the outer skin is still soft, myceri, while the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375252PTen class=place long=25.1617 lat=37.538>Tenos</a> give that name to the nuts when sweet. But <a href=/people/2987 target=_blank>Amerias</a> says that mycerus is a general name for almond. Almonds eaten before the symposium are very provocative of thirst. <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a>: Let me chew some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=demonym long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxian</a> almonds and drink wine from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=demonym long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxian</a> vines. Now there was a variety of vine called <a href=/people/6689 target=_blank>Naxia</a>. <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385228PCha class=person long=22.8416 lat=38.4944>Chaeronea</a> tells how a physician at the house of <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>, son of <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, beat all the others in drinking, until he was detected in the act of eating five or six bitter almonds before the symposium began; when prevented from taking them he could not hold out in the drinking contest in the slightest degree. The cause, therefore, was to be found in the bitterness, which produces dryness and consumes moisture. The word amygdale (almond), according to <a href=/people/3610 target=_blank>Herodian</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=person long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, is derived from the fact that next to the green part it has many scarifications (amychae). An <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> you are, going to the husks of sweetmeats, <a href=/people/638 target=_blank>Philemon</a> somewhere says. Beech-trees, <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a>'s delight, says <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> in Book II of the Georgics. The neuter form amygdalon also occurs. <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>: A sweet, some myrtle-berries, a cheese-cake, almonds. With reference to the placing of the accent in the word amygdale, <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a> insists that in speaking of the fruit the grave accent should be used as it is in the neuter amygdalon; for the name of the tree, on the other hand, he requires the circumflex, amygdale, like rhode. So, too, <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a>: The fair flower of the rose-bush (rhode). </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/3854 target=_blank>Hermonax</a>, and <a href=/people/2552 target=_blank>Timachidas</a> in the Dialect Lexicon, say that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=demonym long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontic</a> nut is known as <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>-acorn. <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=person long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a> raises the question whether or not dessert should be served first, as in some places of Asia and Hellas, instead of after dinner. If, for example, it is served after dinner, when a good deal of food is in the stomach and intestines, it happens that the nuts then eaten to incite thirst mix with this food and cause winds and fermentation of the food, because they naturally remain on the surface and digest with difficulty; hence indigestion and diarrhoea result. Almonds, <a href=/people/336 target=_blank>Diocles</a> remarks, are nourishing and good for the bowels, and are, moreover, calorific because they contain some of the properties of millet. The green are less unwholesome than the dry, the soaked than the unsoaked, the roasted than the raw. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=demonym long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heracleot</a> nuts, also called <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>-acorns, are not so nutritious as almonds, and besides have a drying property and lie on the top of the stomach; if too many are eaten they affect the head. Of these nuts, also, the green are less likely to cause trouble than the dry. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> nuts are as apt to cause headache as the <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>-acorns, but are more nourishing; they roughen the throat and mouth, but are less noxious when roasted. They are digested more easily than other nuts when eaten with honey. The broad chestnuts are more windy, but when boiled they give less trouble than when raw or roasted, while the roasted are better than the raw. <a href=/people/5904 target=_blank>Phylotimus</a> says in his work on Food: The broad chestnut and the so-called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=place long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardis</a> nut are all of them hard to digest and dissolve when raw, since they are held in restraint by the phlegm in the stomach and possess astringency. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=demonym long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontic</a> nut, also, is oily and hard to digest, the almond less so.

Yet when they are still tender and have been blanched, they are better, being more juicy, while those which are roasted in ovens have little nutriment. Almonds are diuretic, attenuating, cathartic, and of little nutrition. Dried almonds, however, are much more windy and apt to lie on the stomach than the green, which, to be sure, have a poor flavour and are less nourishing. But if they are blanched when still tender though full grown, they are milky and of a better flavour. Among dried almonds the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=demonym long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasian</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a> varieties, when still tender, are more easily excreted.

Almonds and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=demonym long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heracleot</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> nuts, and others of the same kind are less wholesome than chestnuts. In fact none of these varieties should be eaten raw excepting green almonds: some should be boiled, others roasted. For some of them, like dried almonds and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>-acorns, are fatty by nature, while others are tough and astringent, such as beech-nuts and similar sorts. The cooking process, therefore, removes the oil from the fatty varieties, that being the most harmful element, while the tough and astringent kinds are softened when one applies a little slow heat. But <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> calls chestnuts <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=place long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardis</a>-acorns also, and says that they are nourishing and well-flavoured, but hard to assimilate because they remain a long time in the stomach; and though when roasted they are less filling, yet they are more easily digested. But the boiled not only inflate less, but also nourish more than the roasted. Lopimon ('peel-nut') and caryon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=ethnic long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboeans</a> called it, but others called it <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>-acorn, says <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=person long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophon</a> in the Georgics.

The diminutive form rhaphanidion occurs in <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, <a href=/people/1429 target=_blank>Hyperbolus</a>: A little lettuce leaf or bit of radish. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> in his Plants says that there are five kinds of radish — <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a>, Leiothasian, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378228PKle class=demonym long=22.776 lat=37.825>Kleonaian</a>, Amorean, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=demonym long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotian</a>; by some, however, the Leiothasian is called Thracian; the sweetest is the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=demonym long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotian</a>, and it is round in shape; in general, he adds, the varieties with smooth leaves are sweeter.

For, in explaining the antiquity of comedy he says: Pease-porridge, fire, turnips, radishes (rhaphanoi), ripe olives, phallic cakes. That he really means radishes is proved by <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>. For he also writes about the antiquity of comedy in the <a href=/people/1622 target=_blank>Danaids</a>, and says: The chorus would dance wrapped up in rugs and bundles of bedding, sticking under their arm-pits ribs of beef, sausages, and radishes. The radish, moreover, is a very cheap article of food. <a href=/people/1583 target=_blank>Amphis</a>: Any man who goes to market to get some delicacy and prefers to buy radishes when he may enjoy real fish must be crazy. Pine kernels. — <a href=/people/1709 target=_blank>Mnesitheus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> physician, in his work on Edibles, calls the seeds of conifers ostracides and again he calls them cones.

But <a href=/people/197 target=_blank>Hippocrates</a> in the work on Tisane, half of which is spurious (some even think the whole is), calls them coccali (kernels). Most authorities, however, call them pyrenes(stones), as does <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> also in speaking of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=demonym long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontic</a> nut.

Eggs. — <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a>, in the Physics, explains that the popular expression bird's milk means the white of an egg. Concerning eggs, compare <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>: In the beginning <a href=/people/12253 target=_blank>Night</a> laid a wind-egg (oon). <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a> makes the word a trisyllable: They say, you know, that <a href=/people/596 target=_blank>Leda</a> once found an egg (oion). And again: much whiter than an egg. But <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> said oeon: eggs (oea) of the goose and of winged fowls. So also <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> in the second book of his Iambic Verses: like the egg of a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378274UMai class=place long=27.4103 lat=37.7519>Maeander</a> goose. <a href=/people/796 target=_blank>Anaxandrides</a> even extended it to four syllables when he said oaria. And <a href=/people/1241 target=_blank>Ephippus</a>: Little jars of date-wine, egglets, too, and many other like toys. <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, I believe, speaks of slices of egg. Wind-eggs they used to call hypenemia as well as anemiaea. What is known among us today as the upper-story (hyperoon) of a house they used to call an egg (oon), says <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> in the Amatoria, explaining that since <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> was reared in an upper-story she caused the report to spread that she had sprung from an egg.

Appetizers. — After the first appetizer was drunk all round, says <a href=/people/648 target=_blank>Athenaeus</a>, the master of ceremonies, who was <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, asked whether the word for appetizer, propoma, was found in any author in the sense in which we use it. While the others were racking their brains he answered, I will tell you myself, <a href=/people/724 target=_blank>Phylarchus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> (or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/309306UNau class=place long=30.5925 lat=30.8972>Naucratis</a>), in the passage dealing with Zelas, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a> (the same who invited the leaders of the Gauls to an entertainment with treacherous designs against them, but was killed himself) says, if I have the luck to remember it: 'An appetizer (propoma) was handed round before dinner, as had been the custom in the beginning.' After delivering himself of this wisdom, <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> asked for a drink from the cooler, expressing great satisfaction in his ready memory. Among the ingredients used in the preparation of these fore-drinks <a href=/people/648 target=_blank>Athenaeus</a> mentions particularly the following. Mallows. — <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a>: And they knew not how much virtue lies in the mallow or the asphodel. Malache (mallow) is the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> form, but I have found it, he says, written with an o in many copies of <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>' <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a>: eating the root of the moloche. So <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>: I am more gentle than a moloche. <a href=/people/1847 target=_blank>Phaenias</a> in the work on Plants says: In the cultivated mallow the seed mould is called placenta, being similar in appearance; for its comb-like structure may be compared to the base of the placenta, and in the middle of the placenta-like mass the central point resembles a navel. When the base is removed this mass looks like a cross-section of the sea-urchin. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370247PSip class=person long=24.745 lat=36.975>Siphnian</a> <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> records that the mallow is juicy, softening the bronchial tubes and carrying off the bitter humour at the top of the stomach; it is, accordingly, a specific for irritations of the kidneys and bladder; it is also nourishing and quite easily digested, though the wild is better than the garden variety. And <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a>, the disciple of <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a>, also says that the mallow is an ingredient of the remedy known as alimon, also adipson, being very useful for the purpose. Gourds. — <a href=/people/329 target=_blank>Euthydemus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, in his work on Green Vegetables, calls the gourd Indian sikya, because the seed was imported from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>.

It is more wholesome when eaten with water and vinegar, and has more flavour when seasoned; more apt to cause thinness when eaten with mustard, and more digestible and more easily excreted when boiled. And <a href=/people/1709 target=_blank>Mnesitheus</a> says: All vegetables which are easily affected by the action of heat, such as the cucumber, the pumpkin, quinces, sparrow-quinces, and the like, when eaten cooked, may afford but little nourishment to the body; but they are innocuous and provide moisture. Yet they are all apt to check the action of the bowels, and should preferably be eaten boiled. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> writers use one word, colocynth, for them all. <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a>: What a huge head he has!

On what subjects are they discoursing today? What weighty idea, what crucial point is now debated in their school? Tell me wisely, if you've come with any knowledge, for the land's sake, tell me. — B. Why, yes, I can tell you about these fellows with certainty. At the <a href=/people/11002 target=_blank>Panathenaea</a> I saw a troop of lads . . . at the playground of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAca class=place long=23.707 lat=37.992>Academy</a> I heard words unutterable, extraordinary. For they were making definitions about nature, and separating into categories the ways of beasts, the nature of trees, the kinds of vegetables; and in the course of it they were seeking to determine what species the pumpkin belonged to. — A. And what conclusion, then, did they reach, and of what species is the plant? Tell me, if you really know. B. Well, then; in the first place, they all in silence took their station and with heads bowed low they reflected a long time. Then suddenly, while the lads were still bending low in study, one said it was a round vegetable, another said it was grass, a third a tree. On hearing that, a physician from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=person long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> could contain himself no longer, and snapped his fingers at them for a pack of lunatics. — A.

And <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, who was standing by, very mildly, and without irritation, told them to try again to define the species to which the pumpkin belongs.

Water was poured over my hands. A slave came with the table; on it lay no cheese, no assortment of olives, no dainty entrees or fol-de-rol to offer us their generous smell; on the contrary, there was set before us a platter with a marvellous smell of the <a href=/people/2317 target=_blank>Seasons</a>, shaped like the hemisphere of Heaven's vault.

(60B) Mushrooms. — <a href=/people/6244 target=_blank>Aristias</a>: With champing of champignons the stony ground resounded. <a href=/people/10118 target=_blank>Poliochus</a>: Both of us broke a bit of black barley bread, with chaff mixed in the kneading, twice a day, and had a few figs; sometimes, too, there would be a braised mushroom, and if there were a little dew we'd catch a snail, or we'd have some native vegetables or a crushed olive, and some wine to drink of dubious quality. <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>: Our dinner is a barley cake bristling with chaff, cheaply prepared, and perhaps one iris-bulb or a dainty dish of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a>-thistle or mushroom or any other poor thing that the place affords us poor creatures. That is our mode of life, without heat, without excitement. Nobody eats thyme when meat is to be had, not even they who profess to be <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagorean</a> vegetarians.

Many, however, cause death, but those seem to be proper to eat which are very thin, tender, and friable, growing on elms and pine-trees. Unfit to eat are those which are black, livid, and hard, or which become tough after boiling and serving; when these are eaten they are often fatal. A good antidote is a draught of hydromel, or honey-vinegar, or soda and vinegar. Vomiting should follow the drink. Hence mushrooms ought to be prepared in the first instance with vinegar, or with honey and vinegar, or honey and salt alone, since in this way the choking element is removed. And <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, in the History of Plants, writes: Such plants grow in some cases underground, in other cases on the ground; among the latter are what some call peziae ('puff-balls'), which occur among mushrooms. For they also, as it happens, have no roots; but the mushroom has a lengthy stalk like an adherescent growth, and roots extend from it. He also says that in the region of the sea round the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361000LPHe class=place long=-5.3464 lat=36.123>Pillars of Heracles</a>, whenever it rains copiously, mushrooms grow by the sea which are turned into stone by the action of the sun. And <a href=/people/1847 target=_blank>Phaenias</a>, also, in Book I of his Plants, says: Other plants, again, produce not even so much as a blossom, nor is there any trace of a club-like bud containing a seed, or any seed process whatever; such are the mushroom, truffle, fern and helix-ivy. The same author speaks of the fern, which some call blachnum. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> in the Plants, again: Smooth-skinned flora, like the truffle, mushroom, puff-ball, and crane-truffle. </p>                        </div>

Into the appetizer these ingredients also were put, — pepper, a salad leaf, myrrh, sedge, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> perfume. <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>: If, then, a man just buys some pepper and brings it home, they denounce him as spy fit for the rack. Again: Now must I go round looking for a peppercorn and a blite-berry. <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a>: Take, woman, a seed of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=demonym long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidian</a> bay or pepper, pound it together with myrrh and sprinkle over the path. <a href=/people/4239 target=_blank>Ophelion</a>: Libyan pepper, fragrant incense, and a lunatic book of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s. <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> in the Theriaca: or even the downy leaves of than flea-bane — often again, chopping up fresh pepper or <a href=/people/538 target=_blank>Median</a> cress. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> in the History of Plants: Pepper is a berry, and there are two kinds of it. The one is round as a pea, with a reddish shell, the other is oblong and black, with poppy-like seeds. The latter is much stronger than the former, but both are hot and therefore serve as antidotes to hemlock. And in the chapter On Suffocation he writes: Their resuscitation is effected by an infusion of vinegar and pepper or nettle pounded with the pepper-berry. We should observe, by the way, this fact, that there is no neuter noun in Greek ending in i, with the sole exception of meli (honey); for peperi, kommi (gum), and koiphi are foreign words.

A little further on he says: But the melon is better for the heart and stomach. The cucumber, when boiled, is tender, innocuous, and diuretic.

Now <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> says that the white variety of lettuce is the sweeter and more tender. There are three kinds — the flat-stalk, the round-stalk, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconian</a>. The last has a leaf like that of the cardoon, but it is erect and strong-growing, and sends forth no side-shoots from the stalk. Some specimens of the flat variety are so flat-stalked that some people actually use them as gates to protect their gardens. He also says that when the stalks have been broken the new shoots are sweeter. <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=person long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophon</a>, in the second book of his Dialect Lexicon, explains the word brenthis as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a> term for lettuce; in this <a href=/people/430 target=_blank>Adonis</a> sought refuge from the wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> which killed him. And so <a href=/people/1583 target=_blank>Amphis</a> in the Lamentation says: It was among the lettuce-plants, plague take them! Why, if a man not yet sixty should eat them when he desires commerce with a woman, he might twist and turn the whole night long without once accomplishing his desires, wringing his hands against stern fate instead of acting like a man. <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a>, too, says that <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> hid <a href=/people/430 target=_blank>Adonis</a> in a lettuce-bed, since the poets mean by this allegory that constant eating of lettuce produces impotence. So also <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a>, in The Defectives, says: Don't put lettuce on the table before me, wife, or you will have only yourself to blame. In that plant, the story goes, <a href=/people/168 target=_blank>Kypris</a> once laid out <a href=/people/430 target=_blank>Adonis</a> when he died; therefore it is dead men's food. And <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> says that <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, when she fell in love with <a href=/people/11023 target=_blank>Phaon</a>, hid him away in fair lettuce-beds, while the younger <a href=/people/451 target=_blank>Marsyas</a> declares that it was in a field of unripe barley. According to <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a>, in the Dialect Lexicon, <a href=/people/1171 target=_blank>Hipponax</a> uses the form tetrakine for thridax (lettuce), and <a href=/people/1776 target=_blank>Cleitarchus</a> says that this is the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> term. <a href=/people/398 target=_blank>Lycus</a> the <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagorean</a> says that the naturally flat-leaved lettuce, smooth and stalkless, is called eunuch by <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagoreans</a>, but impotent by women; for it causes urination and relaxes desire; but it is the best to eat. <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> says that the lettuce stalk is full of nutriment, and less easy to eliminate than the leaves; but the latter, while more apt to cause flatulence, are even more nutritious and eliminant. In general, however, lettuce is wholesome, cooling, a good regulatory and soporific, juicy, and checks sexual desire. And the more luxuriant plants are more wholesome and more capable of inducing sleep, but the tougher and more flabby are less wholesome and digestible, but they also cause sleep. Dark lettuce is more cooling, and is digestible as well. Lettuce grown in summer is juicier and more filling, while the autumn lettuce lacks nourishment and is less juicy. The stalk of the lettuce is supposed to cure thirst. When lettuce is cooked in a saucepan, like the stalks of kale, it is superior, as <a href=/people/1094 target=_blank>Glaucias</a> says, to all the other boiled vegetables.

And continuing: East of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> live the Chorasmii, possessing plain and mountain alike; and on the mountains are forest trees and the prickly artichoke, the willow, and the tamarisk. He also says that the artichoke grows in the region of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> river. <a href=/people/2930 target=_blank>Scylax</a>, too (or <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a>), writes: Now the country is watered by springs and aqueducts, and on the mountains grow artichokes and other herbaceous plants. And in continuation he says: From that point a high mountain range extends on both sides the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> river, covered with virgin forest and with the prickly artichoke. But the grammarian <a href=/people/700 target=_blank>Didymus</a>, in expounding the words prickly artichoke in <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>, says: Perhaps he means the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-thorn (wild rose), since that plant is prickly and rough. What is more, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphic</a> priestess called it 'wooden-<a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>,' and when <a href=/people/4000 target=_blank>Locrus</a> received an oracle commanding him to build a city wheresoever he should be bitten by a wooden <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, he founded the city in the region where he had scratched his leg on a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-thorn. Now the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-thorn is something midway between a shrub and a tree, according to <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, and its fruit is red, like that of the pomegranate. Its leaf, moreover, is like that of the willow. <a href=/people/1847 target=_blank>Phaenias</a>, in the fifth book of his work on Plants, speaks of a certain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> plant which he calls cactus, having prickly thorns, and <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> also says in the sixth book of his treatise on Plants: The cactus, as it is called, occurs only in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, and does not exist in Greece. It sends forth straight from the root stalks which spread on the ground; the leaf is flat and prickly, and what are called cacti are strictly stalks. When the peel is removed they are edible even though slightly bitter, and people preserve them in brine. But there is another kind which sends up an erect stem, called pternix, and this also is edible. And the fruit-vessel, after the downy prickles have been removed, resembles the 'brain' of the palm-tree, and is likewise fit to eat. They call it askaleron ('the head'). Now who, if he accepts this description, would not confidently say that this cactus is what the Romans, who live near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, call cardus, and that it is obviously what the Greeks call kinara?

And in those regions grows an abundance of artichokes, which all the soldiers in our train picked and used as food, and they offered them to us, stripping off the prickles. I also know of an island called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368263IKin class=place long=26.284 lat=36.978>Kinaros</a>, mentioned by Semos. Palm Tops. — <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, after speaking of the palm-tree, proceeds: The process of growing from the fruit, therefore, is as I have described; but there is another method of propagation from the tree itself, by taking off the upper part containing the 'head.' And <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, in the second book of the Anabasis, writes as follows: In that place also the soldiers ate for the first time the 'head' of the palm, and all the men wondered at its appearance and peculiar flavour; but it also excited violent headache. And the palm-tree, once the 'head' is taken from it, withers quite away. <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> in the Georgics: And at the same time they prune the suckers of the palm and fetch forth the 'head,' a food which the young delight in.

As for us, dear <a href=/people/250 target=_blank>Timocrates</a> (says <a href=/people/648 target=_blank>Athenaeus</a>), it will appear that we have had 'brains' up to the finish if we bring this collection of examples to a close at this point. — It's a big job to be plunged into a family dinner-party, where father will take the cup and lead in the talk; and after words of advice to the young man is in jocose mood; then comes mother after him; then the old aunt mutters some nonsense aside, and a hoarse-voiced old man, the aunt's father; and after him an old woman who calls the youngster 'dearest,' while he nods assent to them all.

From the stalk grow large leaves, and the root is thicker than the root of the thickest reed, and is made up of distinct tubes, like the stalk.

The beans, he adds, which grow in the pods are not easy to digest when green; they have little nutriment, are laxative and very windy, but when dried they cause less flatulence. As a matter of fact, there also grows from the pods a flower used for wreaths. Now the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> call it lotus; but the people of my city <a about=https://topostext.org/place/309306UNau class=place long=30.5925 lat=30.8972>Naucratis</a>, says our author, <a href=/people/648 target=_blank>Athenaeus</a>, call it honey-lotus.

But in the reign of <a href=/people/5423 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, son of <a href=/people/85 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a>, it chanced that they sprang up in a swamp near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398203WThy class=place long=20.251 lat=39.581>Thyamis</a> river in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394204RThp class=place long=20.4 lat=39.4>Thesprotia</a>, a region of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epeirus</a>. For perhaps two years, then, they bore fruit luxuriantly and spread; but when <a href=/people/5423 target=_blank>Alexander</a> stationed a guard over them to see that no one should even approach the spot, to say nothing of gathering them at will, the swamp dried up, and not only did not produce the aforesaid fruit again, but whatever water it had contained never reappeared. The like also occurred in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389230PAid class=place long=23.0476 lat=38.855>Aedepsus</a>. For, not to mention other waters, a spring came to light which sent forth cold water not far from the sea. The sick who drank of it received the greatest benefit, so that many came even from great distances to use the water. Accordingly the generals of King <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>, desiring to be more efficient in collecting revenue, imposed a special tax on all who drank, and as a result the stream dried up. In the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399263RTro class=place long=26.27 lat=39.915>Troad</a>, also, all who desired were at liberty in old times to collect salt at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396262UTra class=place long=26.1725 lat=39.5665>Tragasae</a>. But when <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a> levied a tax on it, it disappeared. Surprised at this, he exempted the place from taxation, whereupon the salt increased once more. <br />The Cucumber. — There is a proverb, Munch a cucumber, woman, and keep on weaving your cloak. Matron in his Parodies: And I saw a cucumber, son of glorious <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>, lying among the green vegetables; and it lay outstretched over nine tables. And <a href=/people/1267 target=_blank>Laches</a>: As when a cucumber grows in a watered field. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> writers, to be sure, make it a trisyllable (sikyos), but <a href=/people/529 target=_blank>Alcaeus</a>, in may bite some cucumbers, inflects it from the nominative sikys, like stachys, genitive stachyos (ear of grain). A skillet, radishes . . . and four cucumbers. The diminutive form sikydion occurs in <a href=/people/456 target=_blank>Phrynichus</a>, The Recluse: And chew a gherkin. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> says there are three kinds of cucumber, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconian</a>, club-shaped, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=demonym long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotian</a>. Of these the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconian</a> grows better if watered, but the others grow without watering. He also says that cucumbers are more succulent if the seed, before sowing, is soaked in milk or honey-syrup. This he records in his Plant Aetiology. The growth is more rapid, he says, if the seed is soaked in water or milk before it is placed in the ground. <a href=/people/329 target=_blank>Euthydemus</a>, in his work on Vegetables, says that dracontiae, as they are called, are a kind of cucumber; and <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> <a href=/people/729 target=_blank>Ixion</a>, in the first book of the Etymologumena, says that the word sikyos comes from seuomai (burst forth) and kio (move); for it is a stimulating plant. But <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=person long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>, in the Symposium, calls the cucumber hedygaion (from a sweet soil). <a href=/people/336 target=_blank>Diocles</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380244PKar class=person long=24.427 lat=38.027>Carystus</a> says that if the cucumber is eaten in the first course with marshwort it causes distress, because it is carried on top of the stomach, like the radish; but when eaten last it gives less trouble and is more digestible. When cooked it is also a fairly good diuretic. <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>, also, says: The cucumber, because it is cooling, is hard to digest and to purge from the system; moreover, it causes chilliness, provokes bile, and inhibits coition. Cucumbers grow in gardens when the moon is full, and their growth is as visible as that of sea-urchins. <br />Figs. — The fig-tree, says <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a>, — for on the subject of figs I will yield to no man, even if I am to be hanged on a fig-branch, I am so extraordinarily fond of them; I will tell what occurs to me — the fig-tree, my friends, was made to be the guide of men to civilization. This is proved by the fact that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> call the place where it was discovered Sacred Fig-tree, while they call its fruit the Leader because it was the first cultivated fruit to be discovered. Of figs, however, there are several kinds. There is first the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a>, which <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> mentions in Homonyms; for in praising <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a> he says: A. What products, <a href=/people/919 target=_blank>Hipponicus</a>, our country bears, excelling all in the whole world! Honey, wheat-bread, figs. — B. Figs, to be sure, it bears a-plenty. And <a href=/people/1592 target=_blank>Istros</a> in the History of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=person long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a> says that it was even forbidden to export figs produced in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, in order that the residents alone might enjoy them; and since many were caught in the act of smuggling them across the border, those who gave information to the courts about such persons came to be called, for the first time, sycophantae (fig-detectives). And <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> says in The Poet: It is not right that the name 'sycophant' Fshould be bestowed on scoundrels; for the word 'figs,' when applied to a man, ought to reveal a character good and sweet. As it is, when 'sweet' is attached to a rascal, it makes one wonder how this can be. And Philomnestus, in the article On the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395261USmi class=demonym long=26.117 lat=39.536>Sminthian</a> Festival at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>, says: For the sycophant got his name from the fact that in those days the fines and taxes, </p>                        </div>

The figs which grow in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a> are mentioned by <a href=/people/6078 target=_blank>Lynceus</a> in his letters, in which he compares the best products of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a> with those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>.

These figs, in fact, are as different from those produced elsewhere as the meat of the wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> is superior to all other pork not wild. The white-fig is a sort of fig-tree, and it may be that is the kind which produces the white figs. <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a> mentions it in the Iambics thus: The dried white-figs separately. Wild figs are mentioned by <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> in <a href=/people/1303 target=_blank>Sciron</a>: Or impale on branches of wild fig-trees. And <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> in The <a href=/people/974 target=_blank>Sphinx</a>: But not in any wise like wild figs. <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>, in The Marriage of <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>, called the fruit figuratively by the name of the tree, when he said: A ripe wild-fig thou art, because, though useless for food itself, thou canst impregnate others with thy talk. Now he really says ripe fig-tree, meaning ripe fig. <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, also, in The Melting-pot: Why need we say more of those who everywhere offer figs for sale in baskets? They always put the tough and poor ones at the bottom, but the ripe and handsome ones on top. And so the purchaser, believing that what he buys are all good, pays the price, while the dealer snaps the coin in his jaw and sells wild figs, protesting with an oath that they are real figs. Now the wild fig, that is, the tree from which come the erina (wild-figs), is erinos, used as a masculine. Thus <a href=/people/1377 target=_blank>Strattis</a> in <a href=/people/2675 target=_blank>Troilus</a>: Have you, then, noticed that there is an erinos ('wild fig-tree') near it?

And <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a>, in Soldiers, transmits the term <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>-figs for another sort, in these words: Preferably the phibalian or the <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>-figs. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, in the second book of his History of Plants, speaks of a certain variety of fig-tree which is like the so-called Aratean. And in the third book he says that in the region of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397268LIda class=place long=26.8423 lat=39.6922>Ida</a> there grows a bushy fig-tree with a leaf like that of the linden; it bears red figs of the size of olives, but more round, which are like medlars in taste. Concerning the fig-tree in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a>, the same <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, in the fourth book of the Plant History, has the following: The fig-tree which in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> is called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a> bears its fruit on the stem and the stoutest branches, sending out a small leafless shoot like a rootlet, to which the fruit is attached. The stem is large, resembling the white poplar, but the leaf is like that of the elm. It produces four crops, which is also the number of its sproutings. Its sweetness approaches that of the fig, and the inner flesh resembles that of wild-figs; in size it is like a plum. The so-called prodromi (early-figs) are also mentioned by the same <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> in the fifth book of Plant Aetiology as follows: In the case of the fig-tree, whenever the atmosphere is mild, damp, and warm, it encourages sprouting; from this come the 'early figs.' Proceeding, he has this to say: Again, some produce 'early' figs, such as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconian</a>, the white-navel, and several other varieties, whereas others do not. And <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>, in the Dialect Dictionary, mentions the word proiterike ('early') as applied to a kind of fig-tree, because it bears its fruit early. A double-bearing tree is mentioned by <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in the Ecclesiazusae: You, meanwhile, take some leaves of the double-bearing fig-tree. Also <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> in The Women of Tough-Town: It is down below, right by the double-bearing fig-tree. And <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>, in the fifty-fourth book of his Histories, says that in parts of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>'s domain, round about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410232RBis class=place long=23.2 lat=41>Bisaltia</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408238PAmp class=place long=23.847 lat=40.822>Amphipolis</a>, and Grastonia, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, the fig-trees produce figs, the vines grapes, the olive-trees olives, in the middle of spring, at the time when you would expect them to be just bursting forth, and that <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> was lucky in everything. In the second book concerning Plants <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> says that even the wild-fig bears twice in a season; others say also that it bears three times, as on the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376243IKeo class=place long=24.3333 lat=37.6167>Ceos</a>. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> also says that if the fig-tree be planted in a squill-bulb it comes into bearing quicker and is not injured by worms; and in fact anything that is planted in squills grows more quickly and has a sturdier growth. Again <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> says, in the second book of Plant Aetiology: The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> fig-tree, as it is called, although it is of surprising height, has fruit which is small and meagre, as if it had expended all its nourishment in getting its growth. And in the second book of the History of Plants our authority says: There is also another variety of fig-tree in Hellas, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, with runty fruit, which bears a good fig in front of the leaf, but the runt behind it. Other trees there are also, which in general produce from the last year's growth, and not from the new. And this fig is the first to have ripe, sweet fruit, unlike the runty kinds among us. It also grows to be much larger than other figs, </p>                        </div>

I know, too, of other names currently given to figs: regal, fig-regal, yellow-belly, venison, cake-fig, bitter-fig, wake-robin, dusty-white, dusty-black, fountain-fig, mill-fig, and scallion-fig. Speaking of the name given to figs (sykon), <a href=/people/1120 target=_blank>Tryphon</a>, in the second book of the History of Plants, says that <a href=/people/534 target=_blank>Androtion</a>, in the Farmers' Handbook, tells the story that Sykeus, one of the <a href=/people/206 target=_blank>Titans</a>, was pursued by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and taken under the protection of his mother, <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>, and that she caused the plant to grow for her son's pleasure; from him also the city of Sykea in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> got its name. But the Epic poet <a href=/people/3234 target=_blank>Pherenicus</a>, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=person long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heracleot</a> by birth, declares that the fig was named from Syke, the daughter of <a href=/people/1604 target=_blank>Oxylus</a>; for <a href=/people/1604 target=_blank>Oxylus</a>, son of Oreius, married his sister Hamadryas and begot, among others, Carya (walnut), Balanus (oak-nut), Craneia (cornel), Morea (mulberry), Aegeirus (poplar), Ptelea (elm), <a href=/people/1179 target=_blank>Ampelus</a> (vine), and Syke (fig-tree); and these are called <a href=/people/11032 target=_blank>Hamadryad</a> (tree) nymphs, and from them many trees derive their names. Hence, also, he adds, <a href=/people/1171 target=_blank>Hipponax</a> says: The black fig-tree, sister of the vine. But <a href=/people/889 target=_blank>Sosibius</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=person long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonian</a>, by way of proving that the fig-tree is a discovery of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, says that for that reason the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> even worship a <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> of the Fig. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=ethnic long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxians</a>, according to <a href=/people/2206 target=_blank>Andriscus</a> and again <a href=/people/4825 target=_blank>Aglaosthenes</a>, record that <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> is called <a href=/people/4201 target=_blank>Meilichius</a> (gentle) because he bestowed the fruit of the fig. For this reason, also, among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=ethnic long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxians</a> the face of the god called <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> <a href=/people/7349 target=_blank>Baccheus</a> is made of the vine, whereas that of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> <a href=/people/4201 target=_blank>Meilichius</a> is of fig-wood. For, they say, figs are called meilicha (mild fruit). That figs are more useful to man than all other so-called tree fruits, is sufficiently proved by <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=person long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycia</a> by many circumstances in his treatise on figs, and in particular he says that new-born children grow sturdy if nourished with fig-juice. <a href=/people/749 target=_blank>Pherecrates</a>, or whoever is the author of The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, says: If any of us after long search ever spies a fresh fig, we smear it on the babies' eyes, evidently in the belief that figs are an uncommonly good remedy. And the admirable and honey-tongued <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>, in the first book of his Histories, says that figs are a great boon. His words are: O King, thou art making ready to march against men who wear trousers of leather, and the rest of their garments are of leather; they eat, too, food not such as they desire, but such as they have, because they inhabit a land that is rugged; moreover, they use not wine, but are water-drinkers; they have no figs to eat, or any other good thing. <a href=/people/160 target=_blank>Polybius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374221PMeg class=person long=22.1273 lat=37.4124>Megalopolis</a>, also, in the sixteenth book of his Histories, says that at the time when <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, the father of <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Perseus</a>, overran Asia, he was embarrassed for lack of rations for his men, and so he accepted figs from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397227RMag class=ethnic long=22.9 lat=39.4>Magnesians</a>, since they had no grain. When, therefore, he had overmastered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376274PMyo class=place long=27.4291 lat=37.5967>Myus</a>, he gave the region to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397227RMag class=ethnic long=22.9 lat=39.4>Magnesians</a> in gratitude for the figs. And <a href=/people/4409 target=_blank>Ananius</a> the iambic poet also said: If one should lock up within the house much gold, a few figs, and two or three men, he would discover how much better than gold figs are. </p>                        </div>

Then the physician <a href=/people/3162 target=_blank>Daphnus</a> said: <a href=/people/5904 target=_blank>Phylotimus</a>, in the third book On Food, says that fresh figs differ considerably in comparison with one another, both as regards varieties, the seasons when they are severally produced, and their effects; but speaking generally, those that are juicy, especially those that are thoroughly ripe, readily dissolve, and are digested more easily than other fruit, and do not hinder the digestion of other food. They also have the effects of moist food in being mucilaginous, sweet, and slightly alkaline, and cause an evacuation which is copious, loose, rapid, and quite painless. They also produce chyle possessing a salty acidity, when taken with salted food. They readily dissolve, as I said, because although we may eat them in large quantities, we soon become very loose. But this would be impossible if these masses remained and were not quickly dissolved. They are digested more easily than other fruit, as is shown by the fact that if we eat many times as many of them as we eat of other fruit we can dispose of them without pain; but what is more significant, if we eat more than the usual amount of other food it gives us no trouble, provided that figs be eaten first. It is clear, therefore, that if we can dispose of both, figs must be digestible themselves and do not hinder the digestion of other food. Their effects, then, are as aforesaid. The mucilaginous and the salty qualities we detect from the fact that they make the hands both sticky and clean, while the sweetness is noticed in the mouth. That they produce evacuation without cramps or disturbance, and more abundant, rapid, and mild, we think needs no further statement. Moreover, they undergo but little change in the process, not because they are hard to digest, but because we take them down quickly with no mastication, and they make the passage quickly. They produce a salty juice because it has been proved that figs possess this sodic element, and they will cause the juice to be more salty or more acid according to the nature of the other liquids drunk with them. For salted foods will increase the saltiness of the juice, whereas vinegar and thyme will increase its acidity. <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=person long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>, in the Symposium, asks whether it is better to take warm or cold water after eating figs. Those, he says, who advocate warm water urge it because they notice the fact that warm water quickly cleanses the hands; hence, they say, it is probable that in the belly also figs are quickly dissolved by warm water. Further, when warm water is poured on figs outside the body it dissolves their substance, and reduces them to small bits, whereas cold water solidifies them. But those who recommend the drinking of cold water argue that taking a cold drink carries down by its weight the food lodging in the stomach; for figs do not act kindly on the stomach, since they overheat it and reduce its tone; wherefore some persons actually make a practice of drinking unmixed wine with them. After this the contents of the bowels are readily expelled. </p>                        </div>

Those that mature as winter approaches and are ripened by forcing are poorer, whereas those which come at the height of their seasons are better, being ripened naturally.

Yet, when they are ripe, sweet apples have more wholesome juices and are more easily passed because they have no astringency; but sour apples have juices more unwholesome and binding.

Moreover, they have the effects of liquid foods: those that are sour and not quite ripe have a greater astringency and moderate acidity, producing in the body the liquid principle called astringent. And in general apples are less digestible than pears, as is shown by the fact that though we may eat fewer apples, we digest them less easily, whereas we may take a larger quantity of pears and digest them better. The astringent liquid produced by them, and called by <a href=/people/2925 target=_blank>Praxagoras</a> translucent, is explained by the fact that foods not easily digested have thicker juices; but it has been demonstrated that, in general, apples are less digestible than pears, and that astringent substances are more apt to produce thicker juices. Thus, among winter apples, quinces produce more astringent juices, while struthia, having fewer juices, which therefore are less astringent, can be more readily digested. <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389278UThy class=person long=27.8405 lat=38.9229>Thyateira</a> says that all quinces are called struthia, but he is mistaken. For <a href=/people/6506 target=_blank>Glaucides</a> makes the matter clear when he says that the best fruits are the three, quinces, phaulia, and struthia. Now quinces are mentioned by <a href=/people/695 target=_blank>Stesichorus</a> in the <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> in these words: Many a quince they threw before the throne of the king, many leaves of myrtle and chaplets of roses, and wreaths of violets twined. <a href=/people/769 target=_blank>Alcman</a>, too, speaks of them, and Cantharus, also, in the <a href=/people/682 target=_blank>Tereus</a>: With quinces as far as the breasts.<a href=/people/638 target=_blank>Philemon</a> is another writer who calls quinces struthia, in The Rustic. <a href=/people/724 target=_blank>Phylarchus</a>, in the sixth book of his Histories, says that quinces by their fragrance can even dull the power of deadly drugs. At any rate, he says, when Phariac poison is put into a chest which still smells of the quinces that were stored therein it evanesces, retaining none of its peculiar properties. For when it had been mixed and given to persons against whom this poison had been secretly prepared, it left them quite unharmed. The cause was afterwards discovered on questioning the seller of the drug, who recognized the result as due to storing the quinces with it. <a href=/people/12141 target=_blank>Hermon</a>, in his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> Glossary, says that kodymala is a name for the quinces.

Thereupon <a href=/people/1261 target=_blank>Aemilianus</a> said that <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=place long=-5 lat=35>Mauretania</a> and a very learned man, mentions the citron in his History of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, asserting that among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> it is called the apple of <a href=/people/597 target=_blank>Hesperia</a>, whence <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> brought to Greece the apples called, from their colour, golden. As for the so-called apples of the <a href=/people/597 target=_blank>Hesperides</a>, <a href=/people/625 target=_blank>Asclepiades</a>, in the sixtieth book of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> History, says that <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> brought them forth in honour of the nuptials, as it was called, of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>.

For the philosopher, in the fourth book of his History of Plants, has this to say: 'Among many other products of the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> there is in particular the so-called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> or <a href=/people/538 target=_blank>Median</a> apple. This tree has a leaf similar and pretty nearly equal in size to that of the wild-strawberry-tree and the walnut, and it has spines like the wild pear or white-thorn, but smooth and very sharp and strong. While the fruit is not eaten, it is very fragrant itself, and so also are the leaves of the tree; and if the fruit be placed among garments, it keeps them free of moths. It is also useful when one has by chance drunk a deadly poison (for as a dose in wine it upsets the stomach and brings up the poison), and it also sweetens the breath; for if the pulp of the fruit be cooked in broth or anything else, or squeezed and sucked into the mouth, it makes the breath sweet. The seed is taken out and sown in springtime in beds which have been carefully prepared; it is then watered every three or four days; when the plant is well up, it is transplanted in the spring to soft, moist ground not too thin-soiled. It bears its fruit at all seasons; for when some have been plucked, others are in blossom, and others again are ripening. Those blossoms which have a kind of distaff projecting from the centre are fertile, but those which have none are infertile.' Again, in the first book of the same work, he gives the facts about the distaff and the fertile blossoms. Impelled, therefore, my friends, by this description which <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> gives of the colour, fragrance, and leaves, I am convinced that the citron is meant; and let none of you be surprised that he says it is not eaten, because even down to our grandfathers' time no one would eat it, </p>                        </div>

If to this anyone objects that what is today called a citron is not meant here, let plainer testimony be cited, although <a href=/people/1847 target=_blank>Phaenias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391259PEre class=person long=25.9348 lat=39.1341>Eresus</a> offers us the suggestion that possibly the juniper-berry (kedron) is intended, from kedros (cedar). For the cedar, he says, in the fifth book on Plants, also has spines round the leaves. But that this is also true of the citron is known to all. I am well aware, too, that when the citron is eaten before any food, dry or liquid, it is an antidote to every poisonous ingredient; I learned this from a townsman of mine who was entrusted with the governorship of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. He had sentenced some convicted criminals to be the prey of wild beasts, and they were to be thrown among the creatures called asps. As they were entering the theatre assigned for the punishment of the robbers, a peddler-woman in the street gave them in pity some of the citron which she was holding in both hands and which she was eating. They took it and ate, and when, after a short time, they were thrown among those cruel and monstrous creatures, the asps, they received no injury when bitten. Perplexity seized the magistrate, and finally he questioned the soldier who guarded them to see whether they had eaten or drunk anything; when he learned that the citron had been given them, he ordered next day that a piece of citron should be given, exactly as before, to one convict, but not to the other, and the one who ate suffered no injury when bitten by the reptiles, but the other died the moment he was struck. And so, since the same result has been attested in many instances, the citron has been proved to be an antidote to every poison. </p>                        </div>

'When then,' he says, 'all had come to know this poisonous loving-cup of his, they never went out of doors without eating rue; for those who eat this beforehand are not in the least injured by drinking aconite, which, he says, received its name because it grew in a place called Aconae, near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=place long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heracleia</a>.' When <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> had ended these remarks, most of the company expressed their wonder at the effects of the citron, and ate it up as though they had not touched any food or drink before. <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a>, in the Dialect Dictionary, says that the Romans call it citrus. (85C) Following the dishes just described, there were brought in for us separately plates of oysters in quantity, as well as other testaceous foods. Most of them, practically, I find have been thought worthy of mention by <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> in the Marriage of <a href=/people/576 target=_blank>Hebe</a>: He brings all sorts of shell-fish — limpets, lobsters, crabs, <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a>-fish, whelks . . . Dbarnacles, purple-shells, oysters tight-closed (to open them is no easy matter, but to eat them is easy enough), mussels, snails, periwinkles, and suckers (which are sweet to eat forthwith, but too acrid when preserved), and the long, round razor-fish; also the blackshell, to gather which brings fair profit to children; and on the other side are land-snails and sand-snails, which are held in poor esteem and are cheap, and which all mortals callandrophyctides ('man-shy'), but we gods call whites. But in the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, instead of the line the shell, to gather which brings fair profit to children, is written the shell which we call tellis ('long mussel'); and its meat is very pleasant. In what he says of the telline he probably means what the Romans call mitulus(mussel). <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> the grammarian, who mentions it in the tract on The Broken Scroll, says that limpets are similar to the so-called tellinae. and <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391265PMyt class=person long=26.5621 lat=39.1114>Mitylene</a>, on the word limpet in <a href=/people/529 target=_blank>Alcaeus</a>, says that there is an ode in the collection of <a href=/people/529 target=_blank>Alcaeus</a>'s works which begins, Child of the rocks and of the hoary sea, and at the end of it is written: Limpet of the sea, swell the hearts of children.

Of shell-fish the kinds more conducive to strength, <a href=/people/336 target=_blank>Diocles</a> says, are snails, purple-shells, and periwinkles. Concerning the last <a href=/people/875 target=_blank>Archippus</a> has the following: Periwinkle, nursling of the sea, son of purple-shell. <a href=/people/661 target=_blank>Speusippus</a>, in the second book of <a href=/people/2446 target=_blank>Similars</a>, says that periwinkles, purple-shell, twisted snails, and conchs resemble each other. The twisted snails are mentioned also by <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> in the Camicians thus: Of this twisted snail from the sea — if, my child, we could find someone [to string it]. Again, <a href=/people/661 target=_blank>Speusippus</a> enumerates in order the conchs, scallops, mussels, pinnas, and razor-fish, by themselves, and in another class, the oysters and limpets. And <a href=/people/2834 target=_blank>Araros</a>, in The Hunchback, says: These, then, were the tasty dainties — snails and razor-fish, and the wriggling shrimps leaped forth like <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphins</a>. <a href=/people/1229 target=_blank>Sophron</a> in the Mimes: A.

The rough are also of poor flavour and afford little nourishment, but are easily passed; purple-fishers use them also for bait; of the smooth varieties, on the other hand, their excellence increases with their size. <a href=/people/982 target=_blank>Hegesander</a>, in the Commentaries, says that the rough-shelled conchs are called sacks by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, but rams by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>. <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a> further says that limpets are most easily digested of all the varieties of sea-food mentioned above; oysters are less nourishing than they, but are filling and rather easy to digest. Scallops are more nourishing, but have not so good a flavour and are harder to digest. As for mussels, those from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> and similar kinds are better in flavour than scallops, but are inferior to cockles; they tend to cause urination rather than loosening of the bowels. Some of them, also, are like squills, with poor flavour, and uninviting to the taste. The smaller kinds among them, and those that are rough outside, are more diuretic and better flavoured than the squill-like, but are less nourishing, partly because of their small size, and partly because of their nature. The 'necks' of the periwinkle are wholesome, but contain less nutriment than mussels, cockles, and scallops; for persons with weak stomachs, who do not easily work off their food into the abdominal tract, they are useful, not being liable to fermentation. This is because foods admittedly easy to digest are, by a reverse process, alien to a constitution of this sort, since their tenderness and solubility make their fermentation easy. Hence the 'livers' of these testacea, while not good for stomachs in good condition, are beneficial for weakness in the bowels. More nourishing and more enjoyable than these are the 'livers' of purple-shells, but they are more quill-like in effect; in fact the whole of the bivalve has this character. A peculiarity also attendant upon them, and upon the razor-fish as well, is that they thicken the broth in which they are cooked. But even when the 'necks' of purple-shells are cooked by themselves, they are good for stomach affections. <a href=/people/2540 target=_blank>Poseidippus</a> mentions them in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382162PLoc class=demonym long=16.229 lat=38.216>Locrian</a> Women thus: 'Tis time to conclude; eels, crayfish, conchs, sea-urchins freshly caught, livers, pinnas, necks, mussels.

The borers are more nourishing, but have a rank smell. The tethea are similar to those just mentioned, and more nourishing. There occur also the so-called wild mollusks; these are filling, but have a rank smell and are poor in flavour. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, in the Zoology, says the testacea comprise the pinna, oyster, mussel, scallop, razor-fish, conch, limpet, ascidium, and barnacle. Those that have locomotion are the periwinkle, purple-shell, sweet purple-shell, sea-urchin, and twisted snail. Further, the scallop has a rough shell, striated, while the ascidium is not striated, but smooth-shelled; the pinna has a small mouth, while the oyster is wide-mouthed, a rough-shelled bivalve; but the limpet is a univalve and smooth-shelled; the shell of the mussel is composed of two parts exactly alike, while that of the razor-fish and the barnacle is single and smooth; that of the conch partakes of the nature of both. The inside of the pinna, as <a href=/people/1534 target=_blank>Epaenetus</a> says in the Art of Cookery, is called the liver. In the fifth book of his History of Animals, <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says: Purple-shells spawn in springtime, periwinkles as winter draws to a close. In general (he says) the testacea appear to have what are called eggs in the spring and even in the autumn, excepting the edible urchins. The last propagate most at these seasons, but also continually at all times, and rather more at the full moon and on sunny days, excepting those in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393263WPyr class=place long=26.2 lat=39.16>Pyrrhaean Euripus</a>; the others, however, are better in winter; they are small and full of eggs. It appears also that all sea-snails spawn alike at the same season. Proceeding, the philosopher says again: So the purple-shells swarm in spring in the same place and produce what is termed the honeycomb. This is a kind of wax, though not so smooth, as if a large mass from the husks of white pulse were solidified. None of them has any vent, nor do purple-shells propagate from this, but they and all other testacea spring from slime and decomposition. This is a sort of excretion which occurs in them and in the periwinkles; for the latter also produce the waxy substance. They begin the process by excreting a sticky pulp, of which the husk-like parts are composed. After this is completely discharged, they let out a watery substance into the earth; here then, in the earth, are formed little purple-shells, which the adults are found to contain when caught. and if they are caught before hatching occurs, they sometimes bring forth the young in the fishermen's baskets, collecting in the same spot, and a kind of cluster is formed. There are several varieties of purple-shell; some are large, like those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262USig class=place long=26.1802 lat=39.9901>Sigeium</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395261LLek class=place long=26.065 lat=39.48>Lectum</a>, while others are small, as in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236WEur class=place long=23.591 lat=38.465>Euripus</a> and on the coast of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=place long=28.7 lat=37.01>Caria</a>.

Some of the large specimens weigh as much as a pound. Those which are found on the shore and off headlands are small in size, but contain the red dye. Again, on shore facing the north they are generally dark-dyed, whereas on south shores they are red. <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, in his Commentary on <a href=/people/1229 target=_blank>Sophron</a>, after prefixing the lemma greedier than purple-shells, explains that it is a proverb, and says that according to some authorities it is derived from the dye; for whatever it touches it draws to itself, and produces the glint of its own colour in whatever is placed beside it. But others refer it to the animal itself. And they are caught, says <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, in the spring, but never in the season of the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a>-star; for they do not feed at that time, but hide themselves and live in holes. The dye is contained between the liver and the neck. And the purple-shell as well as the periwinkle has from germination the same kind of operculum which other spiral mollusks have. They feed by thrusting out the 'tongue,' as it is called, beneath the operculum. The purple-shell has a 'tongue' more than an inch long, by which it feeds and bores through other shell-fish as well as its own shell. Both purple-shell and periwinkle have long lives, extending to about six years. Their growth may be discerned by the coil in the shell. Conchs, cockles, razor-fish, and scallops are produced in sandy places. Pinnas grow in an upright position from the sea bottom, and contain the 'pinna's guard,' Dwhich may be a small prawn or a small crab. If these are taken away, they quickly die. <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=person long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, in his work on Names, says this parasite is born with them.

Now the pinna is a shell-fish, but the its parasite is a small crab. The pinna opens its shell and quietly waits for small fish to approach, while the parasite stands by and bites it as a signal when anything comes near; the pinna feels the bite and closes, and in this way they eat up together whatever is caught inside. Some authorities also say that they are procreated together, and as it were from the same seed. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, again, says: All testacea grow in slimy matter, oysters in mud, but conchs and the others described in sand, while ascidia, barnacles, and those that cling to surfaces, like limpets and nereid snails, grow in the hollows of the rocks. Creatures which have no shells, like the actinia and the sponges, grow in the same way as testacea, in hollows of the rocks. There are two classes of actinia; one class, formed in cavities, never separate from the rocks; the other, living in smooth and level places, let go their hold and move about. <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a>, in the <a href=/people/1000 target=_blank>Autolycus</a>, calls the actinia nettles, </p>                        </div>

He mentions them also in the Wasps. <a href=/people/749 target=_blank>Pherecrates</a> in the Deserters: To wear a crown of nettles for an equal length of time. The physician <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370247PSip class=person long=24.745 lat=36.975>Siphnos</a> says: The nettle eases the bowels, is a diuretic, and generally wholesome; but it causes the itch in those who gather them unless they first smear themselves with oil. As a matter of fact, it does injury to those who gather them, and by them is today called nettle by a slight alteration of words. (Possibly the plant nettle gets its name from it.) By a euphemism, i.e. substitution, it is so called; for it is not gentle and quiet to the touch, but rough and disagreeable. The marine nettle, to be sure, is mentioned by <a href=/people/1208 target=_blank>Philippides</a> in the <a href=/people/284 target=_blank>Amphiaraus</a> thus: Oysters, nettles, and limpets he served to me. But there is a play on the word in the <a href=/people/2005 target=_blank>Lysistrata</a> of <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>: Nay, thou bravest daughter of ascidian grandmothers and motherkins who were nettles. For tethea (ascidia) are shell-fish, but there is also a comic mixing with tethe, grandmother, and with mother. Concerning other shell-fish <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> has this to say: The rough-shelled cockles of the smaller sorts, having flesh of tenuous consistency, are called oysters, and are wholesome and digestible; but the smooth kinds, by some called regal, also giant, while nourishing, are hard to digest; they are well-flavoured and wholesome, more especially the larger ones. Tellinae are found at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/313300UCan class=place long=30.0772 lat=31.3107>Canobus</a> in large numbers and are abundant about the time when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> is rising. Of these the regal are more tender and light, and promote digestion; moreover they are nourishing. The river varieties are sweeter. Mussels are moderately nourishing; they promote digestion and are diuretic. The best are the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=demonym long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesian</a>, especially when taken in the autumn. The myiscae are smaller than mussels proper, but are sweet and well-flavoured and are nourishing besides. Razor-fish, so named by some, but by others pipes, reeds, or finger-nails, contain much liquid of poor flavour and sticky. The males among them are striated and not of one colour; they are good for patients who suffer from stone or a stricture of any kind. But the females are of one colour and are sweeter. They are eaten boiled or fried, but those that are baked on coals until the shells open are better. Solenists (razor-fish catchers) was the name given to the men who gather these shell-fish, as <a href=/people/1847 target=_blank>Phaenias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391259PEre class=person long=25.9348 lat=39.1341>Eresus</a> records in the book entitled Tyrants killed in Revenge. He writes as follows: <a href=/people/489 target=_blank>Philoxenus</a>, surnamed the Solenist, rose from the position of demagogue to that of tyrant. At first he got his living as a fisherman and was a catcher of razor-fish; but having got together some capital he won a competence by trade on a larger scale. Of the scallops the white varieties are tenderer; for they are free from odour and good for the bowels. Of the dark or reddish varieties the larger and fleshy specimens have a fine flavour. In general, they are all wholesome, easily digested, and good for the bowels, when eaten with cummin and pepper. <a href=/people/875 target=_blank>Archippus</a> mentions them in The Fishes: With limpets, sea-urchins, eschars, garfish, and scallops. </p>                        </div>

Since he had a hard time with the bite and did not comprehend what its rough resistance meant he cried, You rascally morsel, I won't be soft and let you go now, nor will I ever again take another. Now the urchins, I mean both terrestrial and marine, guard themselves against the fishers by projecting their spines like a fence of palings. This is attested by <a href=/people/356 target=_blank>Ion</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=person long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a>, who says, in The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> (or <a href=/people/1256 target=_blank>Caeneus</a>): But among land animals I like the ways of the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> rather than the miserable arts of the urchin (hedgehog), which, when it perceives the hostile approach of others stronger than itself, winds its spiny body in a ball and lies still, invincible against bite and touch. Of the limpet, says <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>, some are small and some also resemble oysters. They are tough, with little juice, not very pungent, of good flavour and easily digested; when boiled, too, they are tolerably well-flavoured. Pinnas are diuretic and filling, but hard to digest and assimilate. The periwinkles resemble them; for their necks are wholesome, but not readily digested. Hence for patients with weak stomachs they are proper food; but they are hard to pass, and moderately filling. The 'livers' ('poppies,' so-called) are tender at the base and digestible. Hence they are fit for those who suffer from abdominal weakness. The purple-shells stand midway between the pinna and the periwinkle; for their necks have much liquor and a good flavour, while the remaining part of them is salty and sweet, readily assimilated, and good for modifying the humours. Oysters are reproduced in rivers, lagoons, and the sea. </p>                        </div>

For then they have a good liquor, and are larger and sweeter. Those which are found on beaches or rocks and are untouched by slime or fresh water are small, tough, and biting to the tongue. The spring shell-fish, and those which come at the beginning of summer, are superior, being plump and having a sea flavour mixed with sweetness; they are wholesome and digestible. Cooked with mallow or sorrel or fish, or even alone, they are nourishing and good for the bowels. <a href=/people/1709 target=_blank>Mnesitheus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, in his work on Victuals, says: Oysters, cockles, mussels, and the like, contain a meat not easily digested on account of the salty liquor which they contain. Hence when eaten raw they draw down the bowels by their saltiness, whereas when cooked they lose all or most of their salt in the liquor in which they are cooked. Hence, also, the liquids in which any shell-fish are cooked stir and move the bowels, but the meat of cooked shell-fish causes rumblings when it has lost its moisture. But baked shell-fish, provided the baking be done with skill, have the least harmful effect on account of the action of the heat. Consequently they are not as indigestible as the raw, having all the liquids which disturb the bowels thoroughly dried up. And so the nourishment afforded by all shell-fish is liquid and hard to digest, and at the same time is not conducive to urination. But the nettle, the urchin's eggs, and similar food afford a nourishment which, though the liquid is slight, tends to relax the bowels and stimulate the kidneys. <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=person long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophon</a> in the Georgics makes this catalogue of the testacea: And all the shell-fish which feed at the bottom of the ocean — sea snails, conchs, giant clams, and mussels, slimy offspring of Halosdyne — and the hiding-place of the pinna itself.

Purple-shells, and a vast number of other shell-fish as well, occur there. One in particular, which the natives call berberi, or mother-of-pearl, is that from which the pearl comes. This is of high value in Asia Minor, and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> and Upper Asia is sold for its weight in gold. This mollusk looks like the scallop; its shell, however, is not grooved, but is smooth and thick; unlike the scallop, moreover, it has but one auricula, not two. The jewel occurs in the flesh of the mollusk, like the tubercle in <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>, and is sometimes so very golden in appearance that when placed side by side with gold it cannot be readily distinguished from it; sometimes, again, it is silvery, and sometimes perfectly white, resembling the eye of a fish.

They say that the mollusk is most apt to teem with pearls when thunderstorms and downpourings of rain are frequent, and the pearls found then are most numerous and of good size. In winter the mollusks have a habit of entering recesses at the bottom of the ocean; but in summer they swim about, with shells open at night but closed by day. Those which cling to rocks or cliffs send forth roots and remain there while they produce the pearls. These are kept alive and nourished through the part which adheres to the flesh, and this part, which grows at the mouth of the shell, has tentacles and introduces the food. It is, in fact, similar to a little crab, and is called pinna-guard (hermit-crab). From this opening the flesh projects to the middle of the shell, like a root, and on this the pearl is propagated, and it grows on the tough part of the shell, receiving food so long as the oyster clings to the rock. </p>                        </div>

Now the purest pearls, those which are most lustrous and large, are produced in the pinna which remains on the ocean bottom, whereas the pinna which grows at the surface, emerging about the water and receiving the direct rays of the sun, is of inferior colour and of less value. Pearl-fishers run risks when they put their hands straight into an open shell; for in that case it closes up, and often severs the fingers; some even die on the spot. But if they succeeded in getting the hand under the shell sideways, they can easily tear it from the rock. <a href=/people/10285 target=_blank>Smaragdi</a> are mentioned by <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> in The Slave: These should be an emerald and carnelians.

And again he says: 'Why, good sir, won't you let me wash the tripe and sell my sausages instead of laughing at me?' Still again: 'I'll gulp down a beef-gut and a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>'s tripe, then drink up the broth, and without stopping to wipe my mouth I'll outbawl the orators and confound <a href=/people/115 target=_blank>Nicias</a>.' Again: 'Ay, the daughter of a mighty sire gave me a piece of meat cooked in broth, and a slice of guts, of tripe, and of belly.' <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> mentions the jawbone in The <a href=/people/5912 target=_blank>Plutuses</a>: 'fighting for the jawbone of an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>.' And <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> in the <a href=/people/1606 target=_blank>Amycus</a> says, 'makes jawbones soft.' <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, in the <a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaeus</a>, writes: 'He (God) also joined together the ends of their jawbones under the conformation of the face.' And <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, in the Art of Horsemanship mentions 'a small, contracted jaw.' Some pronounce the word with a u (suagon) by analogy with the word for <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a> (sus). <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> mentions sausages, calling them oryae, a name by which he even entitles one of his plays, the Orya. <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> says in the Clouds: Let them make sausages of me and serve me up to the students. <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> in the Wine-flask: How thin, said he, is this slice of sausage! So <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a> in the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>Goats</a>.

So <a href=/people/2834 target=_blank>Araros</a>, in <a href=/people/430 target=_blank>Adonis</a>: For the god is turning his snout toward us.

With so much said on these matters, the physicians present did not fail to contribute their share. For <a href=/people/6435 target=_blank>Dionysocles</a> said: <a href=/people/1709 target=_blank>Mnesitheus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, in his work on Victuals, remarked that the head and feet of a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> contain little nourishment or fat. And <a href=/people/212 target=_blank>Leonidas</a> quoted Demon, who says, in the fourth book of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> History: <a href=/people/2567 target=_blank>Apheidas</a>, when king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, was assassinated by his younger brother <a href=/people/2577 target=_blank>Thymoetes</a>, a bastard, who thereupon became king. In his reign <a href=/people/1083 target=_blank>Melanthus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372218RMes class=person long=21.8 lat=37.2>Messenia</a> was banished from his native land and asked the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphic</a> priestess where he should find a home. And she made answer, 'Wherever, on being received as an honoured guest, he should have the feet and the head served to him at dinner.' And this actually happened to him at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235PEle class=place long=23.5415 lat=38.0441>Eleusis</a>; for when, in the course of the observance of some ancestral festival, the priestesses had consumed all the meat and only the feet and the head were left, these were sent to <a href=/people/1083 target=_blank>Melanthus</a>. Next was brought in a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>'s matrix, a veritable metropolis and mother to the sons of <a href=/people/197 target=_blank>Hippocrates</a>, who, as I know, were ridiculed in comedy for swinishness. After glancing at it <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> said, Come now, my friends, in what author is the matrix mentioned? We have filled our bellies full, and it's high time that we do the talking; I urge the <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynics</a> to be still, since they have foddered themselves without stint.

In fact, they will eat and drink anything, never taking to heart what the divine <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> said in the <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a>: 'To talk about poetry would make our gathering like the symposia of common and vulgar men. For being unable, through lack of cultivation, to amuse one another in company at a symposium, by their own resources or through their own voices and conversation, they raise high the market-price of flute-girls, hiring for a large sum an alien voice — that of the flutes — and for this they come together. But wherever men of gentle breeding and culture are gathered at a symposium, you will see neither flute-girls nor dancing-girls nor harp-girls; on the contrary, they are quite capable of entertaining themselves without such nonsense and child's play, but with their own voices, talking and listening in their turn, and always decently, even when they have drunk much wine.' That is what you <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynics</a> do, <a href=/people/1240 target=_blank>Cynulcus</a>. When you drink — or rather when you drain — you are like flute-girls and dancing-girls in thwarting the pleasure of conversation, Cliving, as <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> again describes it in the <a href=/people/2649 target=_blank>Philebus</a>, 'the life, not of a human being, but of a mollusk or some other creature of the sea which has breath, and for its body a shell.' And <a href=/people/1240 target=_blank>Cynulcus</a>, in a burst of temper cried out, You glutton, whose god is your belly, and with no wit for anything else! You are ignorant of the art of connected discourse, you cannot recall the facts of history, or even so much as make a slight offering with a graceful phrase. No, you have misused your whole time in asking 'is such a word found or not? Is it used or not used?' And you test every word that occurs to your companions in talk as one tests a smooth surface by drawing his nail over it, collecting all the thorny places, 'like one making his way through prickly plants and thorny liquorice,' for ever wasting time, but never gathering the flowers that are sweetest. You are the one who tells us that what the Romans call strena ('New Year's gift'), a name and a custom of friendly giving handed down by ancient tradition, is the epinomis. Now if you call it that in competition with <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, we should like to know [what the one has to do with the other]. But if you have found it in any author, tell us who he is. For myself, I know that a certain part of the trireme is called epinomis, according to citations given by <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> in his book On the Trireme. You are the one who uttered that new word phainoles, not yet accepted in good use — yes, sir, phainoles has become masculine! — when you said, 'Slave, <a href=/people/3999 target=_blank>Leucus</a>! give me that useless phainoles!' Once, when you were on your way to a public bath, did you not answer somebody who asked you where you were going, 'I am hurrying, said I, to mash myself'? On that same day your fine <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412161UCan class=demonym long=16.0651 lat=41.2205>Canusian</a> coat was stolen by sneak-thieves, and loud mirth arose in the bath when the 'useless phainoles' could not be 'found.' And on another occasion, dear mates (for to you shall be told the truth), he stumbled on a stone and wrenched his ankle. After having it attended to, he went on his way, and to all who asked, 'What ails you, <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>?' he would say, 'a black eye.' I happened to be with him and could not restrain my laughter on the occasion. Later I was visiting a friend, a physician, and I got him to smear my eyes thickly with a salve; and then, when people asked me, 'What's the matter with you?' I would reply, 'I sprained my eye.' Now there is also another devotee of this same pedantry, <a href=/people/11060 target=_blank>Pompeianus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/319359UPhi class=person long=35.9346 lat=31.9551>Philadelphia</a>, a man not without guile, </p>                        </div>

During the celebration of the <a href=/people/11002 target=_blank>Panathenaea</a>, when the courts do not convene, he said, it is the natal day of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> Pullet and today is an unjust day.'

Once, when he was delivering in public a show speech, expatiating on the glories of the Imperial City, he said, 'Marvellous is the unstable empire of the Romans.' This, my friends, is the kind of men who form <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>'s learned coterie, men who actually give the name 'oven-cauldron' to what the Romans call a miliarium, a contrivance for making hot water. They are the inventors of many strange terms, out-running by many leagues the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=person long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, who used to call a maiden 'wait-man' because she waits for a husband, or a pillar 'stand-hold' because it stands and holds, or a javelin 'hurl-against' because it is hurled against one, or <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mouse</a>-holes '<a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mice</a>-keepers' because they guard <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mice</a>. Speaking of this same <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, <a href=/people/7325 target=_blank>Athanis</a>, in the first book of his Sicilian History, says that he called the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> 'earth-earer' and the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> iacchos.

Again, that which has not yet become cannot be until it has become, seeing that it has not yet become; for it has become from that which is; but if it had not had being from something how could it have become out of what is not? That were impossible. But if it has had birth from something somewhere, then it cannot be that what is not shall be born into what is not; for into what is not it cannot pass. What all this means not <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> himself could understand.' But I am aware that even <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> the poet somewhere calls <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> <a href=/people/340 target=_blank>Aristarchus</a> ('noblest ruler'), and that <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a> called <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a> <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a> ('lord of the folk'), while <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=person long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophon</a> called the creature known as the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>asp</a> 'poison-shooter.' Moved by these and similar fantastic usages the most admirable <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, speaking in the <a href=/people/5915 target=_blank>Politicus</a> of certain animals which traverse dry land, and of others which traverse the air, applies the terms 'walking on dry land,' 'walking in water,' and 'walking in the air' to land animals, water animals, and birds, by way of exhorting these word-fanciers to avoid strange novelties. His words literally quoted are: 'If you will take care not to be too particular about mere names, you will end in being richer in wisdom when old age comes on.' I am aware, too, that <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> Atticus, the orator, denominated the block of wood which is thrust between the spokes of a wheel 'a wheel-shackle' on the occasion when he was driving down steep roads, and indeed <a href=/people/4688 target=_blank>Simaristus</a>, in his Synonyms, called this block a 'check'; and <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>, too, somewhere names the watchman 'a bar to fear' in this verse: 'Have courage! I am thy mighty bar against this fear.' In another passage he calls the anchor a 'stay' because it holds back the vessel: 'The sailors drew up the stay of the ship.' <a href=/people/570 target=_blank>Demades</a> also, the orator, used to say that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig class=place long=23.425 lat=37.75>Aigina</a> was 'the eyesore' of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Peiraeus</a>, that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a> was a 'fragment' broken from the empire, that young men are 'the spring-time' of the people, the walls of a city are its 'garb,' and a trumpeter was the 'public cock' of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. And this same word-chasing sophist used to speak of a woman whose menses had been checked as 'uncleansed.' When it comes to yourself, <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, how did it occur to you to say 'foddered themselves' when you should have used the word 'satisfied'? To this <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, with a pleasant smile, replied: Nay, do not bark, comrade, nor grow savage, shooting forth canine madness during the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-days; rather, you should fawn on and wag your tail at your convives, lest we turn our holiday into a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-slaughter like the one celebrated at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>. 'Foddered,' my good sir, is a word used as I have used it by <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> in the <a href=/people/5139 target=_blank>Odysseis</a>: 'All day long ye sat and foddered yourself with pure milk.' Again, <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> in <a href=/people/786 target=_blank>Trophonius</a> used the past participle 'foddered'; and <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in <a href=/people/2883 target=_blank>Gerytades</a>: 'Take care of her and fodder her with monodies.' So, too, <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> in <a href=/people/1524 target=_blank>Tyro</a> says: 'With food of every fodder we entertained our guests'; </p>                        </div>

They were all delighted with these jests, and <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> continued: What is more, I will render an account of the word metra ('<a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>'s paunch'). <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, in the play entitled The Man from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>, by way of ridiculing the orator <a href=/people/1818 target=_blank>Callimedon</a>, surnamed 'crayfish,' who was active in politics in <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>' time, says: 'Every man is willing to die for his country, but <a href=/people/1818 target=_blank>Callimedon</a> the Crayfish would doubtless submit to death for a boiled <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a>'s paunch.' Now <a href=/people/1818 target=_blank>Callimedon</a> was a notorious gourmand. The paunch is mentioned also by <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> in Fond of his Mother, thus: 'If the wood has pith in it, it can put forth a sprout; a town is a mother-city, not a father-city; the matrix is a delectable meat sold by some; <a href=/people/9806 target=_blank>Metras</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=person long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chian</a> is one whom the people love.'

And <a href=/people/1663 target=_blank>Dioxippus</a> in A Foe to Pimps: 'What dishes he hankers after! how refined they are! sweetbreads, paunches, entrails.' And in The Historian: 'Through the portico burst <a href=/people/4406 target=_blank>Amphicles</a>, and pointing to two paunches hanging there he cried, 'Send <a href=/people/1818 target=_blank>Callimedon</a> here if you see him.'

That you may eat a slice of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a>'s matrix boiled, dipping it into the bitter gall of rue.' As to the ancients, however, none of them had the custom of serving <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>'s paunches or lettuce or any other like relish before a banquet, as is done today. <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a>, at any rate, the inventive genius of cookery, speaks of it after the dinner, the toasts, and the smearing with perfumes: 'Always crown the head at a banquet with chaplets of all the myriad flowers wherewith earth's happy floor doth bloom, and dress the hair with fragrant, distilled unguents, and on the soft ashes of the fire throw myrrh and frankincense, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>'s redolent fruit, all the livelong day.

Yet accept a cheese-cake made in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>; or failing that, if you get one from somewhere else, go out and demand some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> honey, since that will make your cheese-cake superb.

Similarly, describing the arrangements for King <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>'s dinner, when he celebrated the festival of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, as well as the dinner given by King <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, he says that fish and meat were served first.

What does this mean? Explain! — A. I consecrated them. That fellow, too, was a cook — ye gods, he knew not what a cook he was! Nature is the primal source of every art, the primal, you sinner! You cannot imagine anything cleverer than she, and every undertaking is easy to one who is versed in this doctrine, since much conspires to help him. Wherefore, when you see an illiterate cook, one who has not read <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> entire or rather does not know him by heart, spurn him as an empty fool; and if he knows not the Rule of <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, dismiss him with contempt, as being outside the pale of philosophy. For you have got to know, good sir, the difference between a horse-mackerel in winter and one in summer; next, what fish is most useful at the time the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiad</a> sets, and at the solstice. For mutations and movements, to men abysmal evil, work changes in their food, you understand; but that which is eaten in proper season yields gratification. But how many can follow all this with understanding? As a result, colic and winds arise, and make the guest behave with impropriety. But with my cooking, the food that is eaten nourishes, is properly digested and — exhaled. Hence the juices are distributed evenly in all the passages. The juice, says <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a>, causes no trouble; it is what subvenes that makes the eater gouty. — B. It looks to me as if you knew something of medicine also. — A. Yes, and so does anyone else who penetrates Nature. But observe, in the gods' name, the ignorance of modern cooks. When you see them making a pickled sauce out of fish of contradictory qualities, and grating a dash of sesame into it, take them in turn and — tweak their noses! — B. How delightful! — A. Ay, for what possible good can come when one individual quality is mixed with another and twisted together in a hostile grip? Distinguishing these things clearly is a soulful art, not washing dishes or reeking with smoke. For myself, I never enter the kitchen. — B. Why, what do you do? — A. I sit near by and watch, while others do the work; to them I explain the principles and the result. Softly! the mincemeat is seasoned highly enough. — B. You must be a musician, not a cook! A. Play fortissimo with the fire. Make the tempo even. The first dish is not simmering in tune with the others next it. </p>                        </div>

You see, I serve no course without study, I mingle all in a harmonious scale. — B. What does that mean? — A. Some things are related to each other by fourths, by fifths, or by octaves. These I join by their own proper intervals, and weave them in a series of appropriate courses. Sometimes I superintend with admonitions like What are you joining that to? What are you going to mix with that? Look out! You are pulling a discordant string. Leave that out, won't you? Even so did <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> condense pleasure into the sum of wisdom. He could masticate with care. He is the only one who knows what the Good is.

What, therefore, they have not got and do not know, they cannot impart to anyone else. B. I quite agree. Let us, then, dismiss the rest of your story; it has long been plain what it is.' Baton, also, in The Fellow-Cheater, portrays a father in distress over his young son, whose manners have been spoiled by his nurse. He says: 'You have taken my boy and ruined him, you foul wretch, have lured him into a life foreign to his nature. He now takes a morning cup through your influence, something he never did before. — DNURSE: And so, master, you blame me if he has seen a bit of life? FATHER: Life, do you call that life? — NURSE: Yes, the wise so call it. <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, anyhow, says that pleasure is the highest Good; everybody knows that. You cannot have it any other way, whereas by living well, of course all live rightly. Perhaps you will grant me that? — FATHER: Tell me then, have you ever seen a true philosopher drunk, or beguiled by the doctrines you preach? — NURSE: Aye, every mother's son of them. At any rate, those who walk with eyebrows uplifted, and seek in their discussions and discourses for the wise man, as if he were a runaway slave, once you set a sea-lizard before them, know so well what topic to attack first, seek so skilfully for the gist or head of the matter, that everybody is amazed at their knowledge.' Then, too, in The Soldier, or <a href=/people/4327 target=_blank>Tychon</a>, by <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>, there appears a fellow who gives this advice, saying: 'Any mortal man who counts on having anything he owns secure for life is very much mistaken. For either a war-tax snatches away all he has saved, or he becomes involved in a lawsuit and loses all, or he is fined after serving in the War Office, or is chosen to finance a play, and after supplying golden costumes for the chorus he has to wear rags himself; or called to serve as trierarch, he hangs himself, or sailing in his ship he is captured somewhere, or as he takes a walk or a nap he is murdered by his slaves.

Rather, it's only when you've got your mouthful past your teeth and have swallowed it down that you can count it the one thing safe among your possessions.' The same lines occur also in The Water Jar. So then, my friends, when one considers these facts, he must with good reason approve the noble <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> for his shrewd comprehension of <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>'s 'Nature,' and his remark that the very centre of the <a href=/people/10981 target=_blank>Epicurean</a> philosophy is the Gastrology of <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a>, that noble epic which all philosophers given to hearty eating claim as their <a href=/people/1029 target=_blank>Theognis</a>. It is against these also that <a href=/people/4316 target=_blank>Theognetus</a> pronounces in The Ghost or Miser: 'You'll be the death of me, fellow, with all this!

You have gabbled your silly philosophy to earth and heaven, which pay no heed whatever to your words.' While <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> was still talking, slaves entered, carrying on platters some crayfish larger than the orator <a href=/people/1818 target=_blank>Callimedon</a>, who, because of his for fondness for this viand, was called Crayfish. <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, to be sure, writing in Dorcis, or The Woman Who Smacks, callshim fish-lover, following a tradition common to other comic poets as well: The fishmongers have voted, so people say, to raise a bronze statue of <a href=/people/1818 target=_blank>Callimedon</a> in the fish-market at the next <a href=/people/11002 target=_blank>Panathenaea</a>, holding in his right hand a crayfish; for they regard him as the sole saviour of their business, all other customers being a loss. Yet the eating of crayfish was extremely popular, as may be shown by many passages in comedy. For the present it will suffice to quote <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>, who says, in the <a href=/people/1058 target=_blank>Thesmophoriazusae</a>: A. Hasn't anybody bought a fish? a squid, may be, or some broad prawns, or a polyp? Is there no broiled faster or salmon, and no squids? — B.

No haggis or beestings or <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>'s liver, not even honey or <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>'s paunch? Have you not even supplied the weary women with an eel or a large crayfish? By broad prawns he must mean lobsters, as we call them, mentioned by <a href=/people/2342 target=_blank>Philyllius</a> in The Island-Towns. And this may be inferred from the fact that <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a>, in his famous poem, does not even mention the word crayfish, but speaks of it as lobster, as in the following: </p>                        </div>

Most of them, and the best of all in quality, are in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385150IAio class=place long=15.05 lat=38.5>Liparae</a> Islands; yet the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a> also gathers many. Further, <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>, in The Marriage of <a href=/people/576 target=_blank>Hebe</a>, makes clear that the lobster mentioned above by <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a> is the same as the cray, when he says: There are lobsters and crabs as well, and the creature with small feet and long claws, and its name is cray. But the crayfish variety is quite distinct from that of the lobster, and shrimps, again, are different. Those who speak <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> Greek pronounce the word for lobster with an o (ostakos), like the word for raisins. But <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>, in <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> and Sea, has the form with a, lobsters (astakoi) with crooked claws. <a href=/people/661 target=_blank>Speusippus</a>, in the second book of <a href=/people/2446 target=_blank>Similars</a>, says that among the soft-shell crustaceans the crayfish, lobster, nympha, bear-crab, common crab, and pagurus crab are alike. Further, <a href=/people/336 target=_blank>Diocles</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380244PKar class=person long=24.427 lat=38.027>Carystus</a> says that shrimps, crabs, crayfish, and lobsters are well-flavoured and diuretic. According to <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a>, another kind of crab, the colybdaena, is mentioned by <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> in the play cited above, under the name of sea-phallus; but <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a>, in his Art of Cookery, says that he means the shrimp. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, in the fifth book of The History of Animals, says: Of the soft-shelled crustaceans, the crayfish, lobsters, shrimps, and the like copulate from the rear, like the retromingent quadrupeds. Coition takes place at the beginning of spring near the shore (it has long since been observed in the case of all these creatures), but in some regions it occurs later, when the figs begin to ripen. The crayfish, he adds, multiply in rough, rocky places, the lobsters in smooth, but neither occur on muddy grounds. Hence we find lobsters in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a> and off the coast of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=place long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasos</a>, but crayfish off <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262USig class=place long=26.1802 lat=39.9901>Sigeium</a> and Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402243LAth class=place long=24.327 lat=40.158>Athos</a>. All crayfish, moreover, are long-lived. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, too, in his tract on Animals which live in holes, asserts that lobsters, crayfish, and shrimps slough off old age. Speaking of shrimps (karides), <a href=/people/225 target=_blank>Ephorus</a> in Book III records that there was a town of that name near the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a>, and he declares that it was founded by the survivors of the flood, led by <a href=/people/2682 target=_blank>Macar</a>, in <a href=/people/10993 target=_blank>Deucalion</a>'s time; and even to his day the place was called Karides (Crayville). That artificer of fancy dishes, <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a>, gives this advice: If ever you go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373276UIas class=place long=27.5846 lat=37.2795>Iasus</a>, city of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=ethnic long=28.7 lat=37.01>Carians</a>, you will get a good-sized shrimp.

The word karis is used with a long i by <a href=/people/2834 target=_blank>Araros</a> in The Hunchback: The squirming shrimps leaped forth like <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphins</a> into the rope-twined pot. Also by <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a> in <a href=/people/5150 target=_blank>Orthannes</a>: I let down a shrimp and pulled it up again. <a href=/people/796 target=_blank>Anaxandrides</a> in <a href=/people/78 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a>: He sports with the shrimplets among the perchlets and whitebait, with the sole among the gobios, and with the shiners among the gudgeon.

Likewise in The Tail: I'll make you redder than a broiled shrimp. <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a>, in The Nurses, has the phrase shrimps, among creatures that have arched backs. And <a href=/people/4239 target=_blank>Ophelion</a>, The Ugly Fair, speaks of curved shrimps heaped together on dry land; and again in The Wail from the East: as curved shrimps leap on coals, so danced they. On the other hand, the word karis is used with a short i by <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a> in The <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>Goats</a>: Except that once I ate some shrimps in the house of <a href=/people/2063 target=_blank>Phaeax</a>; and in The Demes, He had the face of a shrimp, as red as a leather belt. Shrimps (karides) got their name from kara, head, for the head takes up the biggest part of the body. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> writers, employing the word with a short i, derive it in the same way: it comes from kare, head, because of the prominent head it possesses. Just asgraphis, graver, comes from graphe, picture, and bolis, missile, from bole, a throw, so also karis from kare. Since the penult was lengthened the ultima was lengthened also, and it is pronounced like psephis, pebble, and crepis, boot. Concerning these crustaceans <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370247PSip class=person long=24.745 lat=36.975>Siphnos</a> writes thus: Among the crustaceans the shrimp, lobster, crayfish, crab, and <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>-crab, though of the same family, differ from one another. The <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>-crab is larger than the lobster. The crayfish are also called grapsaei; they contain more meat than the crab. Crab-meat is heavy and hard to digest. <a href=/people/1709 target=_blank>Mnesitheus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, in his work on Victuals, goes further and says that crayfish, crabs, shrimps, and the like are all hard to digest, yet are more digestible than any other kind of fish, and should be broiled rather than stewed. <a href=/people/1229 target=_blank>Sophron</a> uses the form kurides for karides in his Mimes of Women: Lo, the beauteous kurides (shrimps), lo, the lobsters, lo, the beauties! Behold how red they are and smooth-haired! So <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> in <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> and Sea, the red kurides too; but in Lord and Lady Logos, he spells it with o, small fry and crooked korides. So also <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>: cuttle-fish with <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a>, korides with gudgeon. (106E) The next dish to be brought in was fried liver wrapped in fold-over, the so-called epiplus, which <a href=/people/1454 target=_blank>Philetaerus</a> in <a href=/people/682 target=_blank>Tereus</a> calls epiploon. After gazing upon it <a href=/people/1240 target=_blank>Cynulcus</a> said, Tell us, learned <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, whether liver thus encased is mentioned anywhere. He answered, Show us first in what author epiplus is used of the fatty caul. Thereupon <a href=/people/841 target=_blank>Myrtilus</a> took up their challenge and said: The word epiplus for 'caul' occurs in The <a href=/people/11014 target=_blank>Bacchants</a> of <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>: </p>                        </div>

So, too, <a href=/people/356 target=_blank>Ion</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=person long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a> in his Sojournings: 'hiding it in the caul.' You are reserving the caul my dear <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, against the time when you shall be wrapped in it and consumed, and so rid us all of your questionings. But it is only fair that you should cite testimony about liver dressed in this way, since you said a while ago, when we were discussing ears and feet, that <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> mentions it in Crateias or The Apothecary. The entire passage is valuable as illustrating a number of things, and since your memory at present is not equal to it, I will recite it at length myself. The comedian says: 'First, then, I spied oysters, wrapped in seaweed, in the shop of an <a href=/people/11094 target=_blank>Old Man of the Sea</a>, and sea-urchins too. I grabbed them; for they are the prelude to a daintily ordered dinner. Next, I came upon some little fish, all trembling for fear of what was to happen to them. But I bade them have no fears so far as I was concerned, promising that I wouldn't harm a single one, and bought a large greyfish. Then I took an electric ray-fish, being mindful that when a lady lays tender fingers upon it she must not suffer any hurt from its thorny touch. For the frying-pan I got some wasse, sole, shrimp, jack hake, gudgeon, perch, and sea-bream, and made the dish gayer than a <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peacock</a>. Then came some meats — feet, snouts, and <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>'s ears, and liver wrapped in caul; for it is ashamed of its own livid colour. No professional cook shall come near these, or even look upon them. He will rue it, let me tell you. Rather, I shall myself act as steward, so cleverly, so smoothly, and elegantly (yes, I shall make the dish myself), that I shall cause the feasters now and then to push their teeth into the plates for very joy. The preparation and composition of all these foods I am ready to disclose, proclaim, and teach for nothing if anybody wishes to learn.' Further to show that it was customary to wrap livers in caul, <a href=/people/982 target=_blank>Hegesander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=person long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, in his Commentaries, says of <a href=/people/1728 target=_blank>Metaneira</a> the courtesan that she found a lung in a dish of cased livers, and when, on removing the fat, she discovered it, she cried out, 'I am lost! My enfolding garments have been my undoing.' Perhaps the comic poet <a href=/people/2042 target=_blank>Crobylus</a> may be added to those who, like <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, speak of liver so prepared as 'feeling ashamed'; for in The False Substitute he says: 'And verily he added a stout polyp's claw and to this again the shamed liver of a dung-eating <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>.' Liver is mentioned also by <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in Masters of the Frying-pan, by <a href=/people/529 target=_blank>Alcaeus</a> in The Wrestling-school, and by <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a> in <a href=/people/10993 target=_blank>Deucalion</a>. The word should be pronounced with rough breathing; for elision before it in <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a> is effected with an aspirate. He says namely, 'You have no bile attaching to your liver (eph hepati).' </p>                        </div>

But I would have you know I am still a fierce fighter.' <a href=/people/982 target=_blank>Hegesander</a>, in his Commentaries, says that the liver-fish has two stones in its head similar in lustre and colour to those found in oysters, but rhomboid in shape. Fish for frying are mentioned by <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in his <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> as well as in the play cited above. Compare <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a> in <a href=/people/5150 target=_blank>Orthannes</a>: 'Every pretty woman who is in love resorts thither, as well as the runty lads who are nurslings of the frying-pan — wild Mohawks lounging in the cake-shops.

The kneaded roll, <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>'s daughter, draws its hollow cleft along, made by the pressure of the finger to look like a trireme's ram — the best introduction to a dinner.' They used also to eat fried cuttle-fish. <a href=/people/474 target=_blank>Nicostratus</a> (or Philaeterus) says, in <a href=/people/2713 target=_blank>Antyllus</a>: 'Never again shall I venture alone to eat cuttle-fish from the pan.' And <a href=/people/1781 target=_blank>Hegemon</a>, in <a href=/people/2914 target=_blank>Philinna</a>, represents persons eating small fry also out of the pan in these verses: 'Nay, but go quickly and buy me a polyp, and let me eat small fry even from the pan.' Whereupon <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, not pleased at this, but in some vexation, glanced sharply at us and recited these iambics from the <a href=/people/5150 target=_blank>Orthannes</a> of <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a>: 'How glad I am that that god-detested fellow — <a href=/people/2957 target=_blank>Myrtilus</a> — has come to shipwreck on a frying-pan;' for I am sure that he never bought or ate any of these things, because one of his own slaves once recited to me these verses from <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a>'s Pimp: 'I am kept by a cruel brute from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=person long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, a rich but avaricious sinner; a gourmand he, who spends as much as sixpence on a dinner.' The lad had a fine education, which he had got not in <a href=/people/841 target=_blank>Myrtilus</a>'s house, of course, but when he lived with some other master. So I asked him how he had come to fall into <a href=/people/841 target=_blank>Myrtilus</a>'s hands. He answered me in these lines from The Chick of <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>: 'When a child I was brought by a trader here to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> with my sister.

But <a href=/people/2920 target=_blank>Pontianus</a> anticipated him and said: <a href=/people/1120 target=_blank>Tryphon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=person long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, in Plant Life, names the different sorts of bread, if I remember rightly, as follows: raised bread, unleavened bread, bread made with fine flour, with groats, with unbolted meal (the last, he declares, is more laxative than that made of refined flour), bread made of rye, of spelt, and of millet. The groat bread, he says, is made of rice-wheat, for it cannot be made of barley. 'Oven-bread' is so named from being baked; it is mentioned by <a href=/people/937 target=_blank>Timocles</a> in Sham Robbers thus: 'Seeing that a dough-pan fresh from the fire was lying there, I ate some of the oven-bread piping hot.' Brazier-bread is mentioned by <a href=/people/3759 target=_blank>Antidotus</a> in The Premier Danseur: 'He took some hot brazier-bread — why not? — and folding it over he dipped it into sweet wine.' Also by <a href=/people/2042 target=_blank>Crobylus</a> in The Suicide: 'taking a dough-pan full of fine brazier-bread.' Further, <a href=/people/6078 target=_blank>Lynceus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=person long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>, in his letter to <a href=/people/917 target=_blank>Diagoras</a>, compares the food used in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> with that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>, and says: 'Besides, the bread sold in their market is famous, and they bring it in at the beginning and the middle of a banquet without stint. And when they are tired and sated with eating, they then introduce a most delightful allurement in what is called smeared brazier-bread. It is a soft and delectable compound dipped in sweet wine, with such harmonious effect that a marvellous result comes to one whether he will or no; for just as the drunken man often becomes sober again, so the eater of it grows hungry again with its delicious flavour.' Another kind listed by <a href=/people/1120 target=_blank>Tryphon</a> is <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362279LAta class=place long=27.864 lat=36.209>Atabyrite</a> bread. <a href=/people/1028 target=_blank>Sopater</a> mentions it in The Woman of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=person long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidus</a>: 'And there was an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362279LAta class=place long=27.864 lat=36.209>Atabyrite</a> loaf to stuff the jaws.' Achaenae loaves. — This bread is mentioned by Semos in the eighth book of the <a href=/people/4967 target=_blank>Delias</a>. He says that it is made in honour of <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a> and <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Kore</a>. They are large loaves and a festival called Megalartia is celebrated by persons who contribute it reciting the words, 'a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> full of lard for our Lady of Sorrows.' Oven bread. — <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> mentions this in <a href=/people/2313 target=_blank>Old Age</a>. There he introduces a bread-woman whose loaves have been torn to bits by the animals which cast off their old skin. She says: 'What does this mean?' — One answers: 'Give us some hot rolls, daughter.' She: 'But you must be mad!' — 'Fresh from the oven, daughter.' — She: 'What do you mean, fresh from the oven?' — 'And very white, daughter.' </p>                        </div>

And so wrote <a href=/people/1229 target=_blank>Sophron</a>: 'Who is baking suet-bread or oven-bread (klibanitae) or half-loaves?' The same writer mentions also a kind of bread named plakites ('flat') in the Mimes of Women: 'She promised she would treat me in the evening to some griddle-cakes.' Cheese-bread, too, is mentioned by <a href=/people/1229 target=_blank>Sophron</a> in the mime entitled Mother-in-Law, thus: 'I advise you to snatch a bite; for someone has sent cheese-bread for the children.' <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=person long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophon</a>, in his Glossary, calls unleavened bread daratos. <a href=/people/2345 target=_blank>Plato</a> (the comic poet) in A Long Night calls the large and dirty loaves '<a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=demonym long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilician</a>' in these lines: 'And then he bought and sent us some loaves; don't think they were the clean, tidy kind; they were large <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=ethnic long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicians</a>.' And in the play entitled <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> he calls certain loaves agelaioi.

These rolls are made of new wheat, as <a href=/people/2342 target=_blank>Philyllius</a> makes clear in <a href=/people/1259 target=_blank>Auge</a>: 'Here I come in person, bringing the fruit of wheat three months in the growing, hot rolls as white as milk.'

Another form of bread is the so-called kollyra, mentioned by <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in the <a href=/people/280 target=_blank>Peace</a>: 'A mighty roll and a box on the ears as a relish to go with it.' Also in the Merchantmen: 'And a roll for the veterans, because of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381241SNik class=place long=24.0002 lat=38.1409>trophy</a> they raised at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381241LMaB class=place long=24.0002 lat=38.144>Marathon</a>.' Obelias bread is so named because it is sold for an obol, as in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, or because it used to be baked on a spit. <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in The Farmers: 'Then there is a man who haply is baking a loaf on the spit.' <a href=/people/749 target=_blank>Pherecrates</a> in The Forgetful Man: 'Fall greedily on the spitted bread and heed not the loaf.' <a href=/people/9903 target=_blank>Obeliaphoroi</a> was the name also given to those who carried these loaves on their shoulders in processions. <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> in the sixth book of Epithets says that <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> invented spitted bread in his campaigns. Pulse bread is the same as that which is called lekithitas, according to <a href=/people/2104 target=_blank>Eucrates</a>. Panos is 'bread' in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405188RMes class=demonym long=18 lat=40.3>Messapian</a>. Hence abundance is called pania, and things that satisfy pania, by <a href=/people/2842 target=_blank>Blaesus</a> in Half-Worn, Deinolochus in <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephus</a>, and <a href=/people/6878 target=_blank>Rhinthon</a> in <a href=/people/495 target=_blank>Amphitryon</a>. The Romans, also, call bread panis. <a href=/people/9861 target=_blank>Nastos</a> is the name given to a large loaf of leavened bread, according to <a href=/people/2184 target=_blank>Polemarchus</a> and <a href=/people/470 target=_blank>Artemidorus</a>; but <a href=/people/1833 target=_blank>Heracleon</a> says it is a kind of round, flat cake. <a href=/people/474 target=_blank>Nicostratus</a> has the word in The Couch: 'There was a cake, my master, as big as this, and white; it was so thick that it bulged from the basket, and when the cover was taken off, an odour and a steam mingled with honey rose upward to the nostrils; for it was still hot.' 'Grated' bread is a variety in use in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>, as <a href=/people/470 target=_blank>Artemidorus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=person long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> says in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=demonym long=27.3 lat=38>Ionian</a> Notes.

There is also an ash-baked bread in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=place long=21.374 lat=37.89>Elis</a> called bacchylos, as <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> records in Book II of his Glossary. <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>, too, mentions it thus in The Mistaken Lady: 'Carry round ash-baked bread of finely-sifted flour.' Another variety of bread also is the so-called apopyrias ('toasted')' it is baked directly over the coals. This is called a yeast bread by some, as <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> in Mollycoddles: 'First, I have here some toasted leavened bread — none of your stuff filled with cudweed.' <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a> in his Gastronomy expounds thus the subject of barley-meal and bread: 'First, then, dear <a href=/people/1450 target=_blank>Moschus</a>, I will call to mind the gifts of fair-haired <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>, and do thou lay it to heart.

The excellence of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> bread is called to mind in the following passage from the <a href=/people/1144 target=_blank>Omphale</a> of <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>; 'How could a man of gentle breeding ever leave this roof, when he sees these white-bodied loaves crowding the furnace in close ranks, and when he sees, too, how they have changed their shape in the oven — deft imitations made by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> skill, which <a href=/people/4711 target=_blank>Thearion</a> taught his countrymen?'

For we have no interest either in barley (since the town is full of wheat bread), or in the list of these kinds of bread. For I have come across another treatise, beside those cited, by <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378346PTya class=person long=34.57 lat=37.82>Tyana</a>, entitled Bread-making, and have made the acquaintance of all the terms here mentioned by many of our friends, and so I shall proceed to say something on my own account about bread. The bread called artopticeus differs from that baked in ovens and furnaces. If now, you make it with hard yeast, it will be white and good to eat dry; but if with dissolved yeast, it will be light but not so white. Bread baked in the oven and furnace requires a softer yeast. The Greeks have a bread called 'soft,' which is made with a little milk and oil and sufficient salt; the dough must be quite soft. This bread is called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=person long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocian</a>, since it is chiefly in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a> that 'soft' bread is made. Such bread is called lachma by the Syrians and is found to be very serviceable in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, because it may be eaten when very warm. It also resembles a flower. There is also a 'boletus' bread, so-called, shaped like a mushroom. The kneading-trough is greased and sprinkled with poppy-seed, on which the dough is spread, and so it does not stick to the trough during the rising. When it is placed in the oven, some coarse meal is sprinkled over the earthenware pan, after which the loaf is laid upon it and takes on a delightful colour, like that of smoked cheese. Twist bread is prepared with the admixture of a little milk; there is added also a little pepper and oil or lard. But in making the so-called artolaganon ('wheat-wafer'), a little wine, pepper, and milk are introduced, along with a small quantity of oil or lard. Similarly into kapyria, called by the Romans tracta, are put mixtures as into the wheat-wafer. When the great Roman scholar had expounded his lore, worthy of <a href=/people/340 target=_blank>Aristarchus</a>, <a href=/people/1240 target=_blank>Cynulcus</a> said: In the name of <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>, what learning! It's no wonder our admirable Bright-eyes has disciples by the hundreds, and has won so much wealth by this splendid erudition, surpassing <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a> and <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a>. Wherefore I swear by the goddesses that I am in doubt what to say. Can it be that he himself cannot see, or have they who entrust themselves to him as pupils only one eye among them, so that they can scarcely see because of their number? Happy, then, I should call them, or rather, they have passed on to the happy state, since their teachers give them disquisitions like this. To him answered <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a>, a bon vivant who extravagantly admired the industrious zeal of this scholar: 'You, there,' to quote the words the comic poet <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a>, 'live in the air with feet unwashed, sleeping on poor pallets of straw, foul gullets, which slyly feed on others' stores.' Did not your progenitor <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> once greedily eat up a whole cake at dinner, and in reply to a question say that he was eating some very good bread? And you yourselves, 'greedy dish-lickers of white <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a> steaks' — to quote <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a> once more — never yield place to others, but keep up your din, </p>                        </div>

How should you know that dice, not the kind you always use, are square-shaped loaves seasoned with anise, cheese, and oil, as <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a> says in his Art of Cookery? Our Bright-eyes has overlooked this variety, as also the thargelos, called by some thalysios; for <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a> for <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a>, in Book II of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> Dialect, says that thargelos is the name given to the first bread made after the harvest. He has also overlooked sesame bread, and has not even noticed the anastatos, so-called, which is prepared for the <a href=/people/12238 target=_blank>Arrephoroi</a>. Then there is also the pyramous, baked with sesame seed and possibly the same as sesame bread. <a href=/people/1120 target=_blank>Tryphon</a> mentions all these varieties in Book I of his Plant Life, as well as those denominated thiagones, which are loaves baked in honour of the gods in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=place long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aitolia</a>. Dramikes also and drames are names given to certain kinds of loaves by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396212RAth class=ethnic long=21.2 lat=39.6>Athamanians</a>. The compilers of glossaries, also, list the names of bread. Thus <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> has dramis, name of a loaf among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, but called duratos by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a>. Etnitas, he says, is a bread made of pulse, while erikitas is the name given to a loaf made of coarsely cracked, unsifted wheat. <a href=/people/2987 target=_blank>Amerias</a>, again, calls the bread of unbolted wheat 'dry-wheat bread,' as <a href=/people/2552 target=_blank>Timachidas</a> does also. <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> says the thiagones is the name given by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=ethnic long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aitolians</a> to loaves baked in honour of the gods. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> call their sourish bread kyllastis. <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> mentions it in The Daughters of <a href=/people/303 target=_blank>Danaus</a>: 'Sing, too, of sour bread and Master <a href=/people/2340 target=_blank>Petosiris</a>.'

Further, <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389278UThy class=person long=27.8405 lat=38.9229>Thyateira</a> says that bread made of barley is called kyllastis by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>. The dirty loaves <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> named 'grey-bread' in The Man from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>: 'A. Then how did you get here? — B. At considerable pains I got some loaves while in the baking. — A. The devil take you! However, how many have you brought? — B. Sixteen. — A. Fetch them here. . . . — B. There are eight of the white, and as many of the grey.' A shot, says <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>, is the name given to bread when hot and sopped in wine. <a href=/people/638 target=_blank>Philemon</a>, in Complete List of Sacrifices, Book I, says that bread made of unsifted wheat and containing all the elements of the grain is called pyrnon; loaves having incisions, he says, which the Romans call 'squares,' are named blomiaioi, while bread made of bran is called brattime, or (by <a href=/people/2987 target=_blank>Amerias</a> and <a href=/people/2552 target=_blank>Timachidas</a>) eukonos. Moreover, <a href=/people/5182 target=_blank>Philitas</a>, in The Unruly, speaks of a kind of bread named spoleus, which he says was eaten only within the family circle. As for barley-cakes, one may find them also recorded in <a href=/people/1120 target=_blank>Tryphon</a> and several other authors as well. Among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, to be sure, is the sort called physte, in which the meal is not ground very fine; but there are, besides, the 'cress' cake, the berex, the 'clews, and the <a href=/people/7154 target=_blank>Achilleum</a>; this last is probably made of '<a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>,' or very fine barley. There are likewise sandwich bread, wine biscuit, honeycake, and lily loaf. . . . (A dance figure for choruses under the name of 'lily' is mentioned by <a href=/people/978 target=_blank>Apollophanes</a> in The Bride.) The thridakiskai mentioned in <a href=/people/769 target=_blank>Alcman</a> are the same as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> sandwich bread. <a href=/people/769 target=_blank>Alcman</a> has it thus: 'Heaping up sandwich bread and muffins.' </p>                        </div>

But I must be excused from enumerating — since, in fact, I am not so fortunate as to remember — all the cakes and confections set forth by <a href=/people/353 target=_blank>Aristomenes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> in the third book of Articles pertaining to Ceremonial. Even I, though younger, came to know this man, who was our senior. He was an actor of Old Comedy, a freedman of the highly cultivated emperor <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>, who called him his 'Attic partridge.' Then <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> said: 'Freedman' — where is that term found? Someone replied that there was a play by <a href=/people/456 target=_blank>Phrynichus</a> entitled Freedmen, and that <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> in She Who Got Slapped also speaks of a freedwoman; he added other instances as well. Whereupon <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> again asked, How does apeleutheros ('freedman') differ from exeleutheros? It was decided, however, to postpone this question for the present. Just as we were on the point of attacking our bread, <a href=/people/4533 target=_blank>Galen</a> said: We shall not dine until you have heard from us also what the sons of the <a href=/people/625 target=_blank>Asclepiadae</a> have to say about bread and cake and meal as well. First <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370247PSip class=person long=24.745 lat=36.975>Siphnos</a>, in the treatise on Diet for Sick and Well, declares that bread made of wheat, as compared with that made of barley, is more nourishing, more digestible, and in every way superior. In order of merit, the bread made of refined flour comes first, after that bread of ordinary wheat, and then the unbolted, made of flour that has not been sifted. These are accepted as the more nourishing. Again, <a href=/people/2650 target=_blank>Philistion</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386231ROpu class=person long=23.04 lat=38.65>Locris</a> says that bread made of highly refined flour tends to promote bodily vigour more than bread made of the coarse; but he rates the latter second, and after that the bread of ordinary wheat flour. Nevertheless, bread of the finest meal has a poorer flavour and less nourishment. All fresh bread is more digestible than bread that has dried up, besides being more nourishing and more juicy; further, it encourages pneumatic action and is easily assimilated. Dry bread, on the other hand, is surfeiting and hard to digest, and bread that is very old and dry has less nourishment, acts as an astringent in the bowels, and has a poor taste. Bread baked in the ashes is heavy and hard to digest because the baking is uneven. That which comes from a small oven or stove causes dyspepsia and is hard to digest. But bread made over a brazier or in a pan, owing to the admixture of oil, is easier to excrete, but steam from the drying makes it rather unwholesome. Bread baked in large ovens, however, excels in all good qualities, for it is well-flavoured, good for the stomach, easily digested, and very readily assimilated; it neither binds nor distends the bowels. The physician <a href=/people/2091 target=_blank>Andreas</a> says that there is a kind of bread in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> made with mulberries, the eating of which causes loss of hair. <a href=/people/1709 target=_blank>Mnesitheus</a> declares that wheat bread is more digestible than barley-cake, and that bread made of one-seeded wheat affords more adequate nourishment, since it is digested with little trouble. But bread made of rice-wheat, if eaten too abundantly, is heavy and causes dyspepsia; wherefore they who eat it are not healthy. </p>                        </div>

(116)After this lengthy discussion it was decided at last to dine, and when the hors d'oeuvre of salt fish had been passed round <a href=/people/1837 target=_blank>Leonides</a> said: <a href=/people/329 target=_blank>Euthydemus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, my friends, remarks in his work on Salt Meats that <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> has this to say about salted or pickled food: 'First in choice is the sturgeon with double-edged mouth, the fish which the rough-clad fisherfolk call the jaw. The Bosporos, rich in salt fish, delights in it, and the people there cut the belly pieces into squares and make it into a pickle. Not inglorious in the eye of mortals, I ween, is the tribe of sharp-nosed sturgeon which jagged lumps of salt adorn either whole or sliced. Again, of <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunnies</a>, pickled in the right season, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> is mother, as well as of deep-sea mackerel and well-fed swordfish, while <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404271UPar class=place long=27.0671 lat=40.4257>Parium</a> Town is a glorious nurse of Spanish mackerel.

These verses, in my opinion, come from some master cook rather than from the gifted <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a>. For how could he know about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404271UPar class=place long=27.0671 lat=40.4257>Parium</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, to say nothing of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392165RBre class=ethnic long=16.5 lat=39.2>Bruttians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=ethnic long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campanians</a>, when he lived many years before these places were settled? I believe, therefore, that the verses are <a href=/people/329 target=_blank>Euthydemus</a>'s own. To this <a href=/people/6435 target=_blank>Dionysocles</a> replied: Who wrote the lines, good <a href=/people/1837 target=_blank>Leonides</a>, it is for you others, famous critics as you are, to determine. Nevertheless, since we are on the subject of salt fish, I will proceed to tell what I know about it, with full details of the trade, including also a proverb which <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367345PSol class=person long=34.539 lat=36.742>Soli</a> thought worth quoting: 'Stale salt fish likes marjoram.'

But <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a> records that neither young <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunnies</a> nor those called horaia are easy to digest, and further, that the flesh of young <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a> resembles 'cube' <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a> and hence is greatly different from all the other <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a> called horaia. In like manner he says there is a great difference in the horaia of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and those caught in other places, and this is true not of <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a> alone, but of all other fishes taken in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>.

First comes this piece of horaion; that cost a penny. I must wash it well. Then I will sprinkle seasoning in a casserole, place the slice in it, pour over it some white wine, stir it in oil and stew it until it is as soft as marrow, covering it generously with a garnish of silphium.' And in The Man with a Cataract one of the characters, when asked to pay his share of the club dinner, replies: 'If, however, you don't render me an account of each item in detail, you shall not get from me the twelfth part of a bronze farthing. — B.

Add the wine, of which I procured more when you were drunk; three bottles, at fivepence the bottle.' <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a>, in the second book of his Materials for Food, says that pelamydes are large fish-cubes. <a href=/people/2540 target=_blank>Poseidippus</a> also mentions cubes in The Converted Philosopher. <a href=/people/329 target=_blank>Euthydemus</a>, in the treatise on Salt-fish, says that the delcanos is a fish named from the Delcon river, in which it is caught, and that when pickled it is very wholesome. <a href=/people/981 target=_blank>Dorion</a>, in his work on Fishes, when mentioning the lebias says that some declare it to be the same as the delcanos; that the <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>-fish is by many called saperdes (shabar), and the beside is that which comes from the Sea of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/460370WMai class=place long=37 lat=46>Maeotis</a>. He says, too, the grey mullets caught off <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410250PAbd class=place long=24.9833 lat=40.95>Abdera</a> are wonderful, and next to them are the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420351PSin class=demonym long=35.143 lat=42.025>Sinopic</a>, and when pickled they are wholesome. The fish called mullet, he says, are by some named agnotidia, by others platistakoi, being quite the same, as is also the chellaries; for this one fish has received many appellations; it is also called <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a> and oniskos as well as chellaries. The larger are called platistakoi, those of medium age mullets, whereas the little ones areagnotidia. Mullets are mentioned by <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in The Merchantmen: 'Mackerel, Spanish mackerel, lebiae, mullets, shabar, roe <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a>.' Upon this, when <a href=/people/6435 target=_blank>Dionysocles</a> had lapsed into silence, the scholar <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> spoke up. Look you, the poet <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>, also, mentions these pickled fish in <a href=/people/10993 target=_blank>Deucalion</a>: 'Salt sturgeon, if one likes it, or a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Cadiz</a> <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a>; and revels in the odour of a roe <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=person long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>.' And in The Parasite: 'In the middle a salt sturgeon, luscious, white throughout, and hot.' And so <a href=/people/474 target=_blank>Nicostratus</a> (or <a href=/people/1454 target=_blank>Philetaerus</a>) in <a href=/people/2713 target=_blank>Antyllus</a>: 'Let a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=demonym long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantian</a> fish-slice come to our revels, and let a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Cadiz</a> belly-slice enter beside it;' and continuing, he says: 'Nay, but I haves bought from a fishmonger, a very gentlemanly fellow, <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> and the Gods are my witness, a very large piece of salt-fish with no skin on it, worth a shilling; for a penny I bought it, though we could not eat it up if we ate for three days, or even twelve; for it is huge.' Upon this <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, with a glance at <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a>, said: It appears that no one, sir, has mentioned in this list the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/310315UMen class=demonym long=31.516 lat=30.958>Mendesian</a> fish of you <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> — fish which even a mad <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> would not taste, or the excellent, half-salted varieties you have, of the pickled sheat-fish. </p>                        </div>

And the same author mentions the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/310315UMen class=demonym long=31.516 lat=30.958>Mendesian</a> thus: 'There is the lovely <a about=https://topostext.org/place/310315UMen class=demonym long=31.516 lat=30.958>Mendesian</a>, too, lightly salted with care, and a mullet baked in the yellow beams of fire.' That these viands are much to be preferred to the poll-fish and sweet-fish so celebrated in your country, experienced persons know. Now tell us whether the word for salt-fish is masculine in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> Greek; for we know that it is in <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>. Anticipating his answer <a href=/people/841 target=_blank>Myrtilus</a> said: Yes, <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> has it masculine in Dionysalexander: 'In baskets I will bring salt-fish of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>.' <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, in <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> Outraged: 'So that all I have I shall throw away on salt-fish.' <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>, in The Men of <a href=/people/3819 target=_blank>Dinnerville</a>: 'I shall not scruple to drench this poor fish with all the evils I know him to be capable of.' <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a> in Wild Animals: 'You must boil some of the cabbages, and bake the fresh and salt fish, and keep your hands off us.' But a peculiar construction is found in <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a>'s Bread-Sellers, 'A fat piece of salt-fish.' <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> has tarichos masculine, meaning 'mummy,' in <a href=/people/615 target=_blank>Phineus</a>: 'Dead as an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> mummy, to judge from the looks.' A diminutive form tarichion is used by <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in the <a href=/people/280 target=_blank>Peace</a>: 'Buy a nice little piece of salt-fish to take to the country.' So also <a href=/people/619 target=_blank>Cephisodorus</a> in The <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>Pig</a>: 'A nasty little piece of meat or salt-fish'; and <a href=/people/749 target=_blank>Pherecrates</a> in The Deserters: 'Meanwhile our wives are waiting for us, boiling for each some pease-porridge or lentils, and broiling a bit of orphan salt-fish.' <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>, also, has the form tarichos as a masculine. <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>, too, in Book IX: 'The pieces of salt-fish lying over the fire began to squirm and quiver.' So, too, the proverbs have it in the masculine: 'Broiled salt-fish, if it but see the fire, — '; 'stale salt-fish likes marjoram'; 'a piece of salt-fish will never get its deserts.' But the word is also neuter in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> Greek, and the genitive becomes tarichous. <a href=/people/4483 target=_blank>Chionides</a> in Beggars: 'Ye gods, would you even eat some salt-fish?' So the dative is tarichei, like xiphei. <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> in The Arbitrants: 'Over this piece of salt-fish, therefore, the two are pecking.' Also in the accusative: 'I sprinkle more salt on the salt-fish, if so it befall.' But when the word is masculine, the genitive will no longer have the s. Now the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> set such store by salt-fish that they actually enrolled the sons of <a href=/people/4919 target=_blank>Chaerephilus</a>, the salt-fish-dealer, as citizens, according to the following verses of <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376232PEpi class=place long=23.1602 lat=37.6335>Epidaurus</a>: '(You made) the sons of <a href=/people/4919 target=_blank>Chaerephilus</a> citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> because he introduced salt-fish. </p>                        </div>

For when foods are served after an interval of drinking, they counteract what settles on the stomach from the effects of wine and becomes the cause of gnawing pangs. Some even think that these are unwholesome — I mean the different kinds of green vegetables and salt-fish — possessing, as they do, a pungent quality, and that the starchy and binding foods are more suitable. They are not aware that many foods which produce loose excretions cause a wholesome reaction on those of opposite nature; among these are the so-called siser (skirret), mentioned by <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> in The Rustic and in <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> and Sea, and by <a href=/people/336 target=_blank>Diocles</a> in Book I of his Hygiene; also asparagus, the white beet (for the red hinders bowel action), conchs, razor-fish, sea mussels, clams, scallops, salt-fish in perfect condition and not tainted, and different sorts of juicy-meated fish. It also is well to have an hors d'oeuvre of herbs and beets, or again of salt-fish, to provoke an appetite for what is to come, and to obviate the unequal effects of the heavier foods. Crowding all the drinks at the beginning is a practice to be avoided, for they render it hard to absorb any additional moisture.' But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, as <a href=/people/1241 target=_blank>Ephippus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403234POly class=person long=23.354 lat=40.2963>Olynthus</a> observes in his account of the funeral of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>, never understood how to drink in moderation, but rather drank deep at the beginning of the feast.

The best of the lean varieties are cubes, horaia, and the like; of the fat, the <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a> steaks and young <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a>.

The <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a> steak, he says, is taken from medium-sized young <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a>, the smaller size resembling the cube <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a>, from which class also comes the horaion.

Spanish mackerel is rather purgative and pungent and has poorer flavour, but is filling. Better are the Amynclanian and the Spanish sort called Saxitanian, which are lighter and sweeter. Now <a href=/people/911 target=_blank>Strabo</a>, in the third book of his Geography, says that Sexitania, from which this salt-fish gets its name, is near the Isles of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, opposite <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376-09PCar class=place long=-0.9738 lat=37.6013>New Carthage</a>; and that there is another town called Scombroaria from the mackerel caught there; from them the best fish-pickle is prepared.

But the spawn of fresh and salt fish alike is hard to digest and dispose of, especially that of the fatter and larger fishes. For being harder, they remain unseparated. They become wholesome, however, when first dipped in salt and then broiled. All salt-fish should be washed until the water becomes odourless and sweet. Salt-fish cooked in sea water is sweeter, and tastes better when hot. <a href=/people/1709 target=_blank>Mnesitheus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, in his treatise on Food, says that all salt and sweet juices move the bowels, but acid and pungent juices stimulate urination; bitter juices are more diuretic, and some of them loosen the bowels; astringent juices, on the other hand (check) the excretions. But the well-informed <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, in the work entitled <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hieron</a>, or The Tyrant, says in condemnation of such food as we have been describing: 'How now? said <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hieron</a>; have you noticed these many contraptions which are set before tyrants — acid, pungent, astringent, and their brothers? Indeed I have, replied <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>, and in my humble opinion they are very much opposed to man's nature. Do you not think, said <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hieron</a>, that such viands are due to the appetites of a soul debased and sick? For they who really like to eat, as you doubtless know, require none of these fancy contrivances. Thereupon <a href=/people/1240 target=_blank>Cynulcus</a> asked for a drink of decocta, saying that he needed to wash away salty words with fountains of sweetness.

I would not, indeed, call for a drink of <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>Bull</a> water, for you do not know what that is; nor do you understand that even the best poets and historians have used expressions not in the best taste. <a href=/people/619 target=_blank>Cephisodorus</a>, for example, pupil of the orator <a href=/people/222 target=_blank>Isocrates</a>, in the third book of his Answer to <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, says that one may find at least one or two vulgar phrases in all other poets and rhetoricians, as, for example, the 'skin every man' of <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a>; the 'urging one's own profit while praising equality' of <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a>; or 'my tongue hath sworn' of <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, and again the saying of <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> in The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Aethiopians</a>: 'These words of mine, then, I utter for your gratification, and not perforce; but do you yourself, like men of wisdom, praise the right while holding fast to profit.' And in another place also the same poet says that 'no word that brings profit is evil.' Again, there is <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> making <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> plot against <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, and <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> committing adultery, causing universal condemnation of them. If, then, I, too, have erred, O mighty hunter of noble words and phrases, be not angry. For as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=demonym long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Milesian</a> poet <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a> says: D'I sing no ancient story, for new themes are much better.

Depart, thou <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> of the antiquated!' So, again, <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> said in <a href=/people/1166 target=_blank>Alcestis</a>: 'Speed to the fashioning of the new, this way, that way, knowing full well that one novel enterprise, even though it be overbold, is more useful than many ancient devices.' But that even the ancients know the water called by that name (not to rouse your ire again by mentioning decocta) I will make clear. As <a href=/people/749 target=_blank>Pherecrates</a> says in The Sham <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>: 'A wise man, very clever in his own conceit, might say . . . but I will answer, Be not a petty quibbler, but rather, if you please, pay attention and listen to me.'

The ancients are also acquainted with the use of very cold water in drinking healths, but I will not quote them unless you tell me in your turn whether they drank hot water at banquets. For if mixing-bowls got their name from the circumstance that water and wine were mixed in them and were thus brought on, filled to the brim, they did not light a fire under the bowls, as if they were kettles, and serve the drink hot. That they know of warm water is made clear by <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a> in The Demes: 'Heat the bronze cauldron for us and have some sacrificial cakes cooked, that we may feed together on the entrails.' And <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> in <a href=/people/1144 target=_blank>Omphale</a>: let me not see anyone boiling water in a kettle for me. There's nothing the matter with me. Heaven forbid! But if I get a twist in my belly or navel, I've got a charm which I bought of <a href=/people/10056 target=_blank>Phertatus</a> for a shilling.' And in The Anointer (the play is also attributed to <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>) he says: 'But if you bring scandal upon our workshop, then, by the dear <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>, I will turn you out, dipping your biggest ladle deep into the cauldron of boiling water. If I fail, may I never drink the water of freedom.' So <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> in The Republic: 'Can there be desire for something additional in the soul? For instance, thirst is thirst — is it for hot water or for cold, for much or for little, in a word, for a drink qualified in any way? Or if there be any heat added to the thirst, will not that add the desire for a hot drink? Or if cold be added, the desire of a cold drink? But if, again, the thirst is great because the element of quantity is present, will that not of itself add the desire for a great quantity, or if little, the desire for a little? Surely thirst, in and for itself alone, cannot be the desire for anything other than what it thirsts for, that is, a drink unqualified, and hunger, again, cannot be the desire for anything else than mere food, can it?' Semos of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=person long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a>, in the second book of the Island History, says that in the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368246IKim class=place long=24.55 lat=36.8>Cimolos</a> underground refrigerators are constructed in summer, where the people store jars full of warm water and draw them out again as cold as snow. This warm water the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> call metakeras ('lukewarm'). Thus <a href=/people/2070 target=_blank>Sophilus</a> in <a href=/people/1926 target=_blank>Androcles</a>, and <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382162PLoc class=ethnic long=16.229 lat=38.216>Locrians</a>: 'The two slave-girls poured in water, the one hot, the other lukewarm.' So <a href=/people/638 target=_blank>Philemon</a> in The Woman of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=person long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>, <a href=/people/1583 target=_blank>Amphis</a>, too, in The Bath: 'One bawled aloud for somebody to bring him hot water, while another called for lukewarm.' While the <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynic</a> was on the point of piling other instances upon these, <a href=/people/2920 target=_blank>Pontianus</a> said: The ancients, dear friends, knew also of the use of very cold water in drinking. <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, at any rate, says in The Parasite: 'Indeed, I want you to taste that water; for I have a wonderful well in the house, more frigid than <a href=/people/2834 target=_blank>Araros</a>.' <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a> also mentions well-water thus in the <a href=/people/3195 target=_blank>Cercopes</a>. . . .

We manage, too, to get snow to drink, but scold if the entree be not hot. Sour wine, again, we spit out, but go into ecstasies over a vinegar salad. The saying, then, of many wise men holds good: Best it is not to be born at all, but if one be born, let him die with all speed.' So <a href=/people/7595 target=_blank>Dexicrates</a>, in the play entitled Self-deceivers, says: 'Yet if I get drunk and drink snow, and know that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> produces the best perfume, (what difference does it make?') And <a href=/people/2879 target=_blank>Euthycles</a>, in Wastrels, or The Letter: He is the first to discover whether snow may be had in the market, and he must be the first, at all costs, to eat the new honeycomb.' Even the excellent <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, in the Memorabilia, knows of the use of snow in drinking, and <a href=/people/462 target=_blank>Chares</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391265PMyt class=person long=26.5621 lat=39.1114>Mitylene</a>, in his Records of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, tells how to keep snow, when he recounts the siege of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> capital <a href=/people/2341 target=_blank>Petra</a>. He says that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> dug thirty refrigerating pits which he filled with snow and covered with oak boughs. In this way, he says, snow will last a long time. That they also chilled wine in order to drink it rather cold is shown by <a href=/people/1377 target=_blank>Strattis</a> in Keeping Cool: 'No man would prefer to drink wine hot; rather one likes it chilled in the well or mixed with snow.' So also <a href=/people/1050 target=_blank>Lysippus</a> in The <a href=/people/11014 target=_blank>Bacchants</a>: 'A. What's the matter, <a href=/people/12141 target=_blank>Hermon</a>? How are we getting on? — B. How else than this? The pater has sunk me down the well, methinks, as one sinks wine in summer time.' And <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>, in The Souvenir, says: 'Chill the wine, <a href=/people/1326 target=_blank>Doris</a>!' <a href=/people/5933 target=_blank>Protagorides</a>, in the second book of his Comic Histories, when recounting the voyage of King <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> down the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, has something to say about ingenious contrivances to get cold water. His words are these: 'During the day they place the water in the sun, and when night comes they strain the thick sediment and again expose the water to the air in earthen jars set on the highest part of the house, while throughout the entire night two slaves wet down jars with water. At dawn they take the jars downstairs, and again drawing off the sediment, they thus make the water clear and in every way healthful. They then place the jars in heaps of chaff, and thereafter use it without the need of snow or anything else whatever.' Cistern water is mentioned by <a href=/people/1329 target=_blank>Anaxilas</a> in The Flute-player thus: 'This also, from the cistern water in my house, consider at your disposal.' </p>                        </div>

When <a href=/people/841 target=_blank>Myrtilus</a> heard this he said: Being a salt-fish devotee, comrades, I would like to drink snow in imitation of <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>. To this <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> said: The expression 'salt-fish devotee,' to be sure, is found in the <a href=/people/1144 target=_blank>Omphale</a> of <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>: 'I am by no means a salt-fish devotee, my girl;' and <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in Government by Women also calls a character 'salt-fish stew' in these lines: 'this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=person long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilician</a> <a href=/people/5043 target=_blank>Hippocles</a> here, this salt-fish stew of an actor.' But what you mean by 'in imitation of <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>' I do not know. No, you glutton, for you have no interest in history, replied <a href=/people/841 target=_blank>Myrtilus</a>. You are a licker of fat, and as the old <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=demonym long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samian</a> poet <a href=/people/1773 target=_blank>Asius</a> has it, you would 'toady for a bit of fat.' <a href=/people/659 target=_blank>Callistratus</a>, in the seventh book of Miscellanies, says that the poet <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> was once dining with some friends 'at the season of mighty heat,' and when the cup-bearers mixed snow in the wine of the rest of the company, but not in his, he improvised the following epigram: 'The snow with which swift <a href=/people/208 target=_blank>Boreas</a>, rising in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, covers the sides of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a>, and which gnaws the spirit of men unclad, and encircles and clothes as a girdle the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402225RPie class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.2>Pierian</a> land — of that snow let someone pour even into my cup a share. For it is not seemly that one should raise to the lips a hot drink to toast a friend.' So, then, after <a href=/people/841 target=_blank>Myrtilus</a> had drunk, <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> again asked Where do you find the word 'fat-licker,' and what are the verses of <a href=/people/1773 target=_blank>Asius</a> about 'toadying for a bit of fat'? Well, said <a href=/people/841 target=_blank>Myrtilus</a>, the verses of <a href=/people/1773 target=_blank>Asius</a> are as follows: 'Lame, branded, wizened with age — like a beggar he came, toadying for a bit of fat, when Meles celebrated his wedding. Uninvited though he was, he was bent on having some broth, and in the midst of them he stood, a ghost rising from the mire.' But the word 'fat-licker' is in the <a href=/people/3934 target=_blank>Philarchus</a> of <a href=/people/2070 target=_blank>Sophilus</a>: 'You're a gourmand and a fat-licker.' Also in the play entitled Running-mates, he has 'fat-licking' in these lines: 'For the brothel-keeper in his fat-licking greed told me to make him a blood sausage like this you see.' <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>, also, mentions the 'fat-licker' in The Bumble-<a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>. They also drank sweet wine while still eating dinner, as <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> shows in <a href=/people/3822 target=_blank>Dropides</a>: 'The girl came in, carrying the sweet wine in a silver cup which had a wide flare, very pretty to look at. It was neither bowl nor saucer, but partook of the shape of both.' Next there was brought in a flat pudding made of milk, meal-cakes, and honey; the Romans call it libum. </p>                        </div>

Yet I should be glad to eat a pudding generously filled with the scales or the kernels of pine cones.And when it was brought he said, Give me a mystile; for I will not use the word mystron, . . . which is not found in any author before our time. Strange that you should be so forgetful, said <a href=/people/1261 target=_blank>Aemilianus</a>. Are you not the one who have always admired the epic poet, <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=person long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophon</a>, for his learning and love of the antique? Did you not cite his mention of pepper? Well, he is the very one who uses the word mystron when describing the use of the word 'pudding,' in the first of his two books on Farming. His words are these: 'But when you prepare a dish of fresh-killed <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kid</a> or <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a> or capon, sprinkle some groats in a hollow bowl and pound them well, then stir in a fragrant oil, well mixed. When the broth is boiling hard, pour it over the meal, put the lid on the pan, and smother it; for when it is stewed in this way, the heavy meal swells up. Serve it when mildly warm in hollow mystra.' In these terms — strange that you should forget them! — <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> indicates the use of pudding and barley-groats, directing that a broth of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a> or <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kid</a> or fowl be poured over it. To repeat his words: pound the groats in a mortar, mix oil with it and stir it in the broth when it begins to boil. When, after these preliminaries, the mixture actively boils up again, it should be stirred with the ladle without adding any other ingredient; simply spoon it off as it is, to prevent any of the rich fat at the top from boiling over. That is why he says 'put on the lid and cover the boiling liquid'; for the meal swells up when it is smothered in this way. Finally, when it has cooled to a mild heat, eat it with hollow pieces of bread. And what is more: <a href=/people/1549 target=_blank>Hippolochus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=person long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedon</a>, in the letter to <a href=/people/6078 target=_blank>Lynceus</a> in which he describes a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> dinner surpassing in sumptuousness any that had ever been given anywhere, even mentions gold spoons (mystra) given to each guest. And since you are so fond of the antique and refuse to speak any word not in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> dialect, let me ask you, friend, what <a href=/people/3434 target=_blank>Nicophon</a>, poet of the Old Comedy, has to say in Hand-to-mouth Toilers. For I find him also mentioning spoons when he says: 'Anchovy-peddlers, charcoal-peddlers, dried-fig-peddlers, hide-peddlers, Fbarley-peddlers, spoon-peddlers, book-peddlers, sieve-peddlers, sweet-cake-peddlers, seed-peddlers.' For what else can mystriopolaebe than 'spoon-sellers'? Having learnt, then, my noble Syro-Atticist, the use of the word for spoon from these examples, eat your fill of the pudding, the you may not have to say, 'I am weak and faint.' I am also surprised that you have not asked where 'pudding' comes from. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, in some vexation, replied, Dishes, indeed! Are we never to get a rest from putting some question to these upstart pedants? None the less, replied <a href=/people/1261 target=_blank>Aemilianus</a>, I am going to render you an account of this word, too. I will begin the discussion of pudding by citing these lines from the <a href=/people/2990 target=_blank>Anteia</a> of <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>: 'A. Whatever have you got in those baskets, my dear? — B. In three of them there are noble <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=demonym long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarian</a> puddings. — A.

But this same play is also ascribed to <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, with very divergent readings in a few passages. <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> again, in The <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a>-lorn Lass: 'We've got a lot of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> pudding in the house.' But <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> uses the word 'pudding' of something sopped up like gruel, in The Men of <a href=/people/3819 target=_blank>Dinnerville</a>: 'Or, when he cooked gruel, he would put a fly in it and offer it to be sopped up.' Very fine wheat flour, under the name semidalis, is mentioned by <a href=/people/1377 target=_blank>Strattis</a> in The Man-handler and by <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in Fair Measure, even though I cannot quote the lines in testimony. The genitive semidalidos occurs in the same play of <a href=/people/1377 target=_blank>Strattis</a>: 'and the twin offspring of fine wheat.' Edesmata, meaning 'dishes,' are mentioned by <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> in The Twins thus: 'I have enjoyed many fine dishes, drunk three or maybe four healths, and had rather a glorious time, devouring victuals enough for four elephants.' So let this book come to an end, concluding with this discourse on dishes. We shall begin our banquet in what follows. Not so, <a href=/people/648 target=_blank>Athenaeus</a>; not at least until you have related to us the story of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> symposium as told by <a href=/people/1549 target=_blank>Hippolochus</a>.

In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, as I have already said, <a href=/people/1379 target=_blank>Caranus</a> celebrated his marriage with a banquet at which the number of men invited to gather was twenty; no sooner had they taken their places on the couches, than they were presented with silver cups, one for each, to keep as their own. Each guest, also, had been crowned before he entered with a gold tiara, worth, every one of them, five gold staters. And after they had emptied their cups, they were each given a bronze platter of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a> manufacture, containing a loaf as wide as the platter; also chickens and ducks, and ringdoves, too, and a goose, and an abundance of suchlike viands piled high; and each guest took his portion, platter and all, and distributed it among the slaves who stood behind him. Many other things to eat were handed round in great variety, following which came a second platter of silver, on which again lay a huge loaf, and geese, hares, young <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>, and curiously moulded cakes besides, pigeons, turtle-doves, partridges, and other fowl in plenty. This all, he says, we presented to the slaves in addition, and when we had had enough of food we washed our hands. Then numerous chaplets were brought in, made of all kinds of flowers, and in addition to them all were gold tiaras, equal in weight to the first chaplet. </p>                        </div>

To me these girls looked quite naked, but some said that they had on tunics. And after a prelude they withdrew. Then came in other girls carrying each two jars fastened together with a gold band and containing perfume; one jar was silver, the other gold, and held half a pint. These also they gave to each guest. After that there was brought in a fortune rather than a dinner, namely a silver platter gilded all over to no little thickness, and large enough to hold the whole of a roast <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> — a big one, too — which lay on its back upon it; the belly, seen from above, disclosed that it was full of many bounties. For, roasted inside it, were thrushes, ducks, and warblers in unlimited number, pease puree poured over eggs, oysters, and scallops; all of which, towering high, was presented to each guest, platters and all. After this we drank, and then received a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kid</a>, piping hot, again upon another platter as large as the last, with spoons of gold. Seeing, therefore, our embarrassment, <a href=/people/1379 target=_blank>Caranus</a> ordered baskets and bread-racks made of plaited ivory strips to be given us, at which we applauded the bridegroom with delight for having rescued our gifts. Then more crowns again, and a double-jar of gold and silver containing perfume, equal in weight to the first. <a href=/people/3186 target=_blank>Quiet</a> being restored, there trooped in men who would have graced even the religious observances at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> Feast of Pots. After them entered ithyphallic dancers, clowns, and some naked female jugglers who performed tumbling acts among swords, and blew fire from their mouths. After we had finished with them, our attention was next engrossed in a warm and almost neat drink, the wines at our disposal being <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=demonym long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasian</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400234PMen class=demonym long=23.419 lat=39.964>Mendaean</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=demonym long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbian</a>; and very large gold cups were handed to each guest. After this draught we were all presented with a crystal platter about two cubits in diameter, lying in a silver receptacle and full of a collection of all kinds of baked fish; also a silver bread-rack containing <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=person long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocian</a> loaves, of which we ate some and gave the rest to the slaves. Then we washed our hands and put on crowns, again receiving gold tiaras twice the size of those we had before, and another double-jar of perfume. When all was quiet, <a href=/people/2347 target=_blank>Proteas</a> jumped up from his couch and demanded a six-pint bowl, and filling it with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=demonym long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasian</a> wine with just a dash of water he drank it all saying, 'He that drinks most shall have least sorrow.' And <a href=/people/1379 target=_blank>Caranus</a> said, 'Since you have been the first to drink, be the first also to receive the bowl as a gift; and this shall be the meed of all the others who drink.' At these words 'all the nine rose up' and seized a bowl, each striving to get ahead of the other. But one unfortunate, who of all our companions was unable to drink, sat up and wept at his bowlless state, until <a href=/people/1379 target=_blank>Caranus</a> made have a present of the cup unfilled. </p>                        </div>

While then our merrymaking was proceeding, and the late hour was beginning to bring darkness, they threw open the room, which had been curtained all about with white linen; and when this was drawn back, the barriers being let down by a hidden contrivance, there rose to our view torches: Cupids and Dianas, Pans and Hermae and many similar figures held the lights in silver brackets. While we were admiring this artistic device, veritable <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380218LEry class=demonym long=21.8333 lat=37.9667>Erymanthian</a> <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> were served to each guest, on square platters rimmed with gold; they were skewered with silver spears. The wonderful thing about it was, that though relaxed and heavy with wine, as soon as we saw any of these things introduced we all became sober enough to stand on our feet, as the saying is. Well, the slaves began to stuff our happy baskets full until the customary signal for concluding the banquet was sounded on the trumpet; for this, as you know, is the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> practice at dinners attended by many guests. Then <a href=/people/1379 target=_blank>Caranus</a>, leading off the drinking in small cups, ordered the slaves to circulate them quickly. We, therefore, sipped them gently as an antidote to the drinking of unmixed wine which had gone before. Meanwhile, the clown Mandrogenes had come in, a descendant, so they say, of the celebrated <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> clown <a href=/people/1718 target=_blank>Straton</a>. He caused many a loud laugh among us by his jokes, and afterwards danced with his wife, who was over eighty years old.

So, after this, we arose and took our leave, quite sober — the gods be my witness! — because we were apprehensive for the safety of the wealth we took with us. But you, staying in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, think it happiness rather to listen to the precepts of <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, eating wild thyme and rocket-seed and your esteemed rolls while you attend the festivals of the <a href=/people/3413 target=_blank>Lenaea</a> and the Pots! We, however, have carried away a fortune from <a href=/people/1379 target=_blank>Caranus</a>'s banquet instead of trifling portions, and are now looking for houses or lands or slaves to buy. With this example before our eyes, friend <a href=/people/250 target=_blank>Timocrates</a>, what Greek banquet can you compare with the symposium just described? Why, even <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>, the comic poet, once said disparagingly in the <a href=/people/901 target=_blank>Oinomaus</a> (or <a href=/people/170 target=_blank>Pelops</a>): But what could leaf-chewing Greeks, scant of table, accomplish?

And <a href=/people/638 target=_blank>Philemon</a> in The Pursuer, or Soupy: How did the boiled fish look to you? — B. 'Twas small, do you understand? And there was brine, white and thick beyond belief, and no smell of pan or condiments. And all cried out, 'What a good pickle you make!' They used to eat even grasshoppers and cicadas as an incentive to appetite.

And <a href=/people/474 target=_blank>Nicostratus</a> in The Pet: The first platter, leading the main courses, will contain a sea-urchin, some raw smoked fish, capers, a wine-sop, a slice of meat, and a bulb in sour sauce. But they also ate as an appetizer turnips done in vinegar and mustard, as <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> plainly shows in the second book of the Georgics; for he says: Of turnip and cabbage, in truth, two families appear in our gardens, long and solid. The latter you wash and dry in the north wind, and they are welcome in winter even to the idle stay-at homes; for soaked in warm water they come to life again. But the other, the turnip roots, you cut in thin slices, gently cleaning away the undried outer skin, and after drying them in the sun a little, either dip a quantity of them in boiling water and soak them in strong brine; or again, put equal parts of white must and vinegar in a jar together, then plunge the slices in it, having dried them off with salt. Often, too, you may pound raisins and biting mustard-seeds with a pestle and add it to them. When cream of tartar forms, and the top grows more and more bitter, then 'tis time to draw off the pickle for those who seek their dinner. <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> (or <a href=/people/5985 target=_blank>Sosippus</a>) says in The Woman who left her Husband: — A. Have you got sharp vinegar in the house? — B. I fancy so, slave, and we have bought rennet. All this will I squeeze thick together in a nice dish for them, and the salad with sour dressing shall be served for all.

And <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in the play entitled Fair Measure says: At a subscription-dinner they were drinking with an eye only for the dancing and nothing else; and they took the names of dainties and foods — Relish, Prawn, Gudgeon, and Wheat-flour.

Then came the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379237DPha class=demonym long=23.7062 lat=37.9373>Phaleric</a> anchovy, darling of <a href=/people/664 target=_blank>Triton</a>, holding her soiled veil before her face . . . and they were loved of the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a> and grew on the mountains. Then came one bringing pinnas, in ringing bowls, which the white foaming waters nurture on a rock streaming with sea-weed. A sole with thick cartilage, and a red-cheeked mullet came too; and upon it I was among the first to lay a hand with strong nail. But I was not quick enough to wound it, for <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Phoebus Apollo</a> did me a hurt. But when I saw <a href=/people/1253 target=_blank>Stratocles</a>, stern master of the rout, holding the head of the horse-taming mullet in his hands, then did I quickly seize it with joy, and tore open its insatiable throat. And there came the daughter of <a href=/people/428 target=_blank>Nereus</a>, silver-footed <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a>, the fair-tressed cuttle, dread goddess with voice of mortal, who of all fish alone knows the difference between black and white. I saw <a href=/people/992 target=_blank>Tityus</a>, too, glorious conger-eel of the marshy lake, lying in the casseroles; and its length covered nine tables. In its tracks followed the white-armed goddess-fish, the eel, who boasted that she had lain in <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>' embrace, from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384231WCop class=place long=23.0687 lat=38.4471>Copaic Lake</a> whence comes the race of wild eels.

For they measured nine cubits and three spans in width, and they were nine fathoms long. Oft did the cook go back and forth throughout the room, balancing on right shoulder the platters covered with dainties, and forty black kettles followed him close, while from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a> there marched in close array as many casseroles. Came, too, the windswift messenger <a href=/people/403 target=_blank>Iris</a>, the fleet squid, and the flower-dotted perch and plebeian black-tail, which, mortal though he was, was companion of fishes immortal. But alone and apart, wroth at the loss of his armour, stood the head of the <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a>, son of Lurkhole; and the gods had made it a bane to men. The monk-fish, which carpenters love extravagantly, was there — the rough but kindly nourisher of the young; I shall never behold anything sweeter than its flesh. There entered, too, that doughty knight, baked mullet, yet not alone; for a dozen sargs followed in close company.

The gilt-head was there, the fairest fish amid all others, the crawfish too, and the lobster eager to arm for the fray at the feasts of the Blessed. Upon them the feasters laid hands and put them to their mouths, pulling them this way and that. Their leader was the lordly elops, glorious in battle, for which sated though I was, I stretched forth a lusty hand, eager to taste of it; and it seemed to me as ambrosia, on which feast the blessed gods that live for ever. Then the cook brought and added to our store a murry which covered the table, and the girdle which she wore with pride about her neck, what time she wed the high-souled son of <a href=/people/2513 target=_blank>Dracon</a>. Sandals, again he placed beside us, everliving offspring of immortal goddesses, and a sole, which dwelt in the roaring brine; then lusty wasse in order, high-flying, which feed among rocks, and watery piglings. And mingled with all were sargs and horse-tails and sheats, and opposite a sea bream, a hake and a sargus. These the cook brought in and placed steaming beside us, and filled all the house with their savour. On them he urged us to feast; but to me, at least, they seemed to be food for womenfolk, and soon I was borne on to other kinds. Now there lay a dish, which none at the dinner had touched, where in an open space rose to view the place of the saucepans. . . . Next came a blackbird for me, who sat ready to eat it; nor, to be sure, was it untouched, for others yearned for it too. And a ham I saw, and no sooner saw than I trembled; and near it lay the sweetened mustard, yellow as gold, but forbidding one to take too much. And when I had tasted I wept that on the morrow I should not see it again, but must content myself with cheese and the faithful barley-cake. 'But my belly could not hold out, for it was overcome with pains; the black broth overpowered it, and the boiled <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a>' feet as well.

But of them I ate nothing at all, for I lay back, too full.

For the latter, when he gathers the nobles before <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, says that barley-meal was mixed.

On their arrival he pointed to the preparations made for each of the dinners and said: 'Men of Greece, I have gathered you together because I wish to show you the folly of the <a href=/people/538 target=_blank>Median</a> commander who, with all his luxury of living, came to attack us who are so poor.' And some say that a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397165PSyb class=person long=16.491 lat=39.714>Sybarite</a> who had sojourned in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> and had been entertained among them at their public mess remarked: 'It is no wonder that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> are the bravest men in the world; for anyone in his right mind would prefer to die ten thousand times rather than share in such poor living.' <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a>, commenting on the wicker carriage mentioned in <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, cites <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> as mentioning in The <a href=/people/5912 target=_blank>Plutuses</a> the feast at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> which is called Kopis (Cleaver). He says: Is it then true, as they say, that yonder in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> all strangers who arrive are richly feasted at the Cleaver, and that in the public lounges sausages hang nailed to the walls for the old men to bite off with their teeth?' And <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a> in The <a href=/people/12102 target=_blank>Helots</a>: . . . and the Cleaver be celebrated in honour of these men today. The Cleaver is a dinner of a special sort, as is also that which is called the aiklon. Whenever they celebrate the Cleaver they first cause to be constructed booths beside the temple of the god, and in them they place rough couches of wood; upon these they spread rugs, on which they hospitably entertain all who have placed themselves in a reclining posture there — not merely persons who arrive from our country, but also any foreigners who have come to town. At the Cleaver they sacrifice <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>, but no other victim of any kind; and of the meat they give portions to all, also the cake called physikillos, </p>                        </div>

Any one among the <a href=/people/4302 target=_blank>Spartiates</a>, besides, who wishes to do so may take part in the Cleaver. They celebrate the Cleaver in town; they also celebrate the Nurse Festival, called Tithenidia, for the children. In this the nurses take the male children at the time of the Cleaver into the country, and there, before the image of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> called Korythalia, as she is called, whose sanctuary is beside the so-called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373223WTia class=place long=22.43469 lat=37.05572>Tiassos</a>, in the region toward <a href=/people/6066 target=_blank>Cleta</a>, they celebrate the Cleaver in the same way as for those first mentioned.

He has the same also in <a href=/people/10027 target=_blank>Periallus</a>. But in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> the so called aiklon comes after the dinner; they serve it to those who are admitted to the mess, being bread loaves in baskets and a piece of meat for each. The attendant who accompanies the distributer of the meat announces the aiklon, adding the name of the donor. Thus <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a>; but he is contradicted by <a href=/people/700 target=_blank>Didymus</a> the grammarian (whom <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375234PTro class=person long=23.3484 lat=37.5033>Troezen</a> calls the book-forgetter because of the number of treatises — three thousand five hundred — which he has published). <a href=/people/700 target=_blank>Didymus</a> says: <a href=/people/331 target=_blank>Polycrates</a> relates in his History of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=person long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> observe the ritual of the <a href=/people/9528 target=_blank>Hyacinthia</a> for a period of three days, and because of the mourning which takes place for the death of <a href=/people/2564 target=_blank>Hyacinthus</a> they neither wear crowns at the meals nor introduce wheat bread, nor do they dispense any cakes, with their accompaniments, and they abstain from singing the paean to the god, and do not introduce anything else of the sort that they do at other festivals. On the contrary, they eat with great restraint, and then depart. But in the middle of the three-day period there is held a spectacle with many features, and a remarkable concourse gathers which is largely attended. Boys with tunics girded high play the lyre or sing to flute accompaniment while they run the entire gamut of the strings with the plectrum; they sing the praises of the god in anapestic rhythm and in a high pitch. Others march through the theatre mounted on gaily adorned <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>; full choirs of young men enter and sing some of their national songs, and dancers mingling among them go through the figures in the ancient style, accompanied by the flute and the voice of the singers. As for the girls, some are carried in wicker carts which are sumptuously ornamented, others parade in chariots yoked to two <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, which they race, and the entire city is given over to the bustle and joy of the festival. On that day they sacrifice very many victims, and the citizens entertain at dinner all their acquaintances and their own servants as well. Not one misses the festival; on the contrary, it so happens that the city is emptied to see the spectacle. </p>                        </div>

Thus he expressly says that barley-cakes are served at the Cleavers. For that is what 'tall barley-cakes' (barakes) means — not 'dumplings' (tolypae), as <a href=/people/840 target=_blank>Lycophron</a> asserts, nor the bits of barley-cakes in the first kneading, as <a href=/people/132 target=_blank>Eratosthenes</a> says; further, there were wheat-loaves and a broth of some kind, extraordinarily well seasoned. What the Cleaver really is is plainly set forth by <a href=/people/3429 target=_blank>Molpis</a> in his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonian</a> State. He writes as follows: 'They also celebrate the so called Cleavers. This is a dinner consisting of barley-cake, wheat loaf, meat, uncooked greens, broth, fig, nut, and lupine.' What is more, the sucking-<a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> sacrificed are not called orthagorisci, as <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> maintains, but orthragorisci, because they are offered for sale at dawn (orthros), as <a href=/people/1353 target=_blank>Persaeus</a> in his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a> State and <a href=/people/2405 target=_blank>Dioscurides</a> in the second book of the State assert, to whom may be added also <a href=/people/657 target=_blank>Aristocles</a>, who says the same in the first of his two books on the State of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a>. Further, <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> says that the chief meal is called aiklon by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a>, all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor class=ethnic long=22.4 lat=38.7>Dorians</a> alike calling it the same. For <a href=/people/769 target=_blank>Alcman</a>, at any rate, has it thus: 'Whether he is at the mill or at the company mess (synaikliai), he tears his hair,' calling by this name the meals shared together. And again: '<a href=/people/6190 target=_blank>Alcmaon</a> hath made ready the meal (aiklon).' <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> do not say 'aiklon' for the portion following dinner; and what is more, the word as they use it does not signify the doles given to messmates after the dinner; for it means bread and meat. These, on the contrary, are called epaikla, being, as it were, additional viands served to messmates after the regular aiklon, or meal. It is from this, I fancy, that the word epaiklon is formed. Moreover, what is prepared for the so called epaikla is not uniform, as <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> assumes, but is of two sorts: that, namely, which they give to the boys is very simple and frugal, being merely barley-meal soaked in oil, which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=person long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a> <a href=/people/878 target=_blank>Nicocles</a> says they greedily gulp down (kapto) after dinner on laurel leaves, whence, he says, the leaves are called kammatides, but the meal-cakes themselves are called kammata. And that it was a practice among the men of long ago even to munch laurel leaves as a dessert is shown by <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a> (or <a href=/people/336 target=_blank>Diocles</a>), who says, in The Cyclopians: 'Here comes the dish of leaves, which means an end to our dinners and our dances as well.' But that which they bring in for the men's mess is prepared from certain definite animals, which are given as a present to messmates by one, sometimes even several, among the rich members. <a href=/people/3429 target=_blank>Molpis</a> says that these after-dishes are also called mattye. Concerning them <a href=/people/1353 target=_blank>Persaeus</a>, in The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a> State, writes as follows: 'And immediately he assesses the well-to do in a sum sufficient to pay for the epaikla; these are desserts following the chief meal. But from the poor he requires a contribution of a reed or rush or laurel leaves, so that they may be able to gulp down their epaikla after dinner. These consist of barley-cakes mixed with oil. The whole proceeding, trifling to be sure, has become an act of governmental administration. Whoever is appointed to take the first or the second place on the couch, or to sit upon the bed, must in all cases do the same at the epaikla.' A similar account is given by <a href=/people/2405 target=_blank>Dioscurides</a>. </p>                        </div>

The victor levies a light fine consisting of meal cakes (kammata) or laurel leaves (kammatides) to serve them on. These kammata are cakes, while kammatides are the leaves with which they gulp them down.' Concerning the dinner eaten by the members of the mess, <a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a> records the following in the work entitled Tri-Statesman: 'The dinner is at first served separately to each member, and there is no sharing of any kind with one's neighbour. Afterwards there is a barley-cake as large as each desires, and for drinking, again, a cup is set beside him to use whenever he is thirsty. The same meat dish is given to all on every occasion, a piece of boiled pork; sometimes, however, not even so much as that is served, beyond a small bit of meat weighing not over a quarter of a pound. Besides this there is nothing whatsoever, except, of course the broth made from this meat, enough to go round among the entire company throughout the whole dinner; there may possibly be an olive or a cheese or a fig, or they even get something especially added, a fish or a hare or a ring-dove or something similar. Afterwards, when they have finished their dinner in haste, there are passed round these so called epaikla. Each member contributes to the mess about three half-medimni of barley, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> measure, and perhaps eleven or twelve pitchers of wine; besides this, a certain weight of cheese and figs, and further, to procure the meat, about ten <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig class=demonym long=23.425 lat=37.75>Aiginetan</a> obols.' And <a href=/people/1909 target=_blank>Sphaerus</a>, in the third book of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a> State, writes: 'The members of the mess also contribute epaikla to them. Sometimes the common people bring whatever is caught in the chase; but the rich contribute wheat bread and anything from the fields which the season permits, in quantities sufficient for the one meeting alone, because they believe that to provide more than is enough is uncalled for, if the food is not going to be eaten.' And <a href=/people/3429 target=_blank>Molpis</a> says: 'Following the meal, it is customary always for something to be provided by some person, sometimes even by several persons, a dish (mattye) prepared in their own homes, and called epaiklon. No one is in the habit of contributing anything which he has bought by purchase in the market, for they contribute, not to satisfy their pleasure or the greed of the stomach, but to give evidence of their own prowess in the hunt. Many of them, too, who keep flocks, give a liberal share of the offspring. And so the mattya may consist of ring-doves, geese, turtle-doves, thrushes, blackbirds, hares, <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a>, and <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kids</a>. The cooks announce to the company the names of those who bring in anything for the occasion, in order that all may realize the labour spent upon the chase and the zeal manifested for themselves.' <a href=/people/10815 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398267USke class=person long=26.7002 lat=39.8074>Scepsis</a>, in Book I of The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> Battle-order, says that the festival of the <a href=/people/5540 target=_blank>Karneia</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> is a representation of their military discipline. There are, namely, places numbering nine, which they call 'sunshades' because they bear some likeness to tents; and nine men eat in each, and a herald proclaims everything by order. Each 'shade,' moreover, holds three brotherhoods, and the festival of the <a href=/people/5540 target=_blank>Karneia</a> is held for nine days. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> afterwards desisted from the austerity of such a mode of living and degenerated into luxury. <a href=/people/724 target=_blank>Phylarchus</a>, at any rate, in the twenty-fifth book of his Histories, writes of them: The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> desisted from going to the common mess in the traditional fashion; </p>                        </div>

In the old days, once they had rested their arms upon the couch, which was quite bare, they endured the rigour of it as long as the assembly lasted; now, however, they have relaxed in the luxury just mentioned, Bindulging in the display of many cups, and in the service of food dressed in every variety, and what is more, rare unguents and wines and desserts likewise. And these practices, in imitation of the regal court of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, were begun by <a href=/people/1216 target=_blank>Areus</a> and <a href=/people/1612 target=_blank>Acrotatus</a>, who reigned a little while before <a href=/people/81 target=_blank>Cleomenes</a>; yet even they in their turn were so far outdone in their own magnificence by certain private citizens of their generation in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>, that <a href=/people/1216 target=_blank>Areus</a> and <a href=/people/1612 target=_blank>Acrotatus</a> seemed to surpass in frugality all the men of earlier times, no matter how simple these may have been. <a href=/people/81 target=_blank>Cleomenes</a>, however, who greatly excelled other men in his understanding of affairs, in spite of his youth, also grew to be most simple in his mode of life. For though he was by this time at the head of affairs of great importance, he made it plain to all whom he invited to a sacrificial feast that the arrangements which they made in their own houses were in no wise inferior to his. Although many embassies were received in audience before him, he never assembled them for dinner earlier than the customary time, and never caused more than five couches to be spread with coverings; when no embassy was present, he had only three couches prepared. And no directions were given by a seneschal concerning who should sit or recline first; on the contrary, the eldest led the way to the couches, unless <a href=/people/81 target=_blank>Cleomenes</a> himself called out the name of some person. Usually he was found to be reclining with his brother, or with one of the men of his own age. On the tripod lay a bronze cooler, a wine-jar, a silver bowl holding a pint, and a ladle; the pitcher was of bronze. But no drink was offered unless some asked for it. One ladleful was given before the meal, to <a href=/people/81 target=_blank>Cleomenes</a> long before the others, and only when he nodded to them did the others ask for theirs. The courses served on the small table were quite ordinary, and for the rest, they were in such quantity as neither to exceed nor fall short of the need — enough for all without having any of the guests call for more. For <a href=/people/81 target=_blank>Cleomenes</a> thought that they ought not to receive merely the frugal entertainment of broth and bits of meat, as they did at the common mess, nor, on the other hand, to go to such excess as to waste money to no good, by exceeding the moderation of their daily life. For the one he regarded as a meanness, the other as pride. The wine was of a little better quality when guests were present. After the meals all remained silent, and the slave, standing by with the wine ready mixed, gave it to anyone who asked for it. Just as before the meal, so also after it, not more than two ladlesful were offered, and then only when one signified his desire by a nod. No entertainment ever accompanied the meal, but the king himself conversed with each in turn, inviting all either to listen or to speak, so that they were all captivated by him when they departed. <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>, satirizing <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a> dinners in the play entitled The Magistrate, has the following: </p>                        </div>

But all slaves pay one <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig class=demonym long=23.425 lat=37.75>Aiginetan</a> stater per caput. The citizens are distributed in clubs which are called <a href=/people/4414 target=_blank>Andreia</a> ('halls of men'). The mess is in charge of a woman who has assistants, three or four men chosen from the common people. Each of them is attended by two servants who bring in the fire-wood; these are called faggot-bearers. Everywhere throughout <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> there are two houses for the public messes; one of these is called Andreion, the other, in which they entertain strangers, is called koimeterion ('resting-place'). In the house intended for the mess there are set out, first of all, two tables, called 'guest-tables,' at which sit in honour any strangers who are in town; next come the tables for the others. An equal portion of the food on hand is served to each person; but only a half-portion of meat is given to the younger men, and they get nothing of the other food. Then on each table is placed a cup filled with wine much diluted; this is shared by all who are at the same table, and a second cup is served after they have finished the meal. For the boys a mixing-bowl is prepared which they share in common, but permission is given the older men to drink more if they desire. The woman in charge of the mess takes from the table in the sight of all the best of everything that is served, and sets it before the men who have distinguished themselves in war or in wisdom. After dinner they are in the habit first of deliberating on public affairs; from that subject they proceed to call up deeds of prowess in war and to praise the men of proved bravery, in order to encourage the younger men in the pursuit of virtue. <a href=/people/8229 target=_blank>Pyrgion</a>, in the third book of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> Customs, says that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=ethnic long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretans</a> at the public mess eat together in a sitting posture. He further says that food without condiments is served to the orphans; that the youngest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> men stand by to wait at the tables; and that, after a silent libation to the gods, they proceed to the distribution of the food on hand to all present. They also apportion to the sons seated below their fathers' chairs only one half as much as is served to the adult men, but the orphans receive an equal share with the latter, Falthough in their case each of the customary foods is served without the admixture of any condiments. There were also chairs reserved for guests, and a third table at the right as one entered the halls, which they called 'the table of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, god of strangers,' or 'the strangers' table.' <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>, comparing the symposia of the Greeks with those of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, says: Of all the days in the year, the one which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> are accustomed to celebrate most is their birthday. On that day they deem it right to have a more abundant feast set before them than on all other days. </p>                        </div>

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> are greatly addicted to wine; and it is not permissible to vomit or to make water in presence of another. These, then, are the customs observed by them. They are in the habit of deliberating on the most important matters when they are drunk, and whatsoever is their pleasure when they deliberate is brought before them for consideration the next day, when they are sober, by the master of the house where they happen to be when they deliberate. And if it still be their pleasure when they are sober, they act on it, otherwise they renounce it. Again, whatever they decide upon when they are sober they reconsider when they are drunk. Concerning the luxury of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> kings <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> writes thus in <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a>: For the benefit of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> king they go about the entire country in search of something he may like to drink, and countless persons devise dishes which he may like to eat. No one could say, either, what trouble they give themselves that he may sleep in comfort. But <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a>, being devoted to hard work, was glad to drink anything that was before him, and was glad to eat whatever came first to hand, and any place was satisfactory to him for securing grateful sleep. In the work entitled <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hieron</a>, speaking of what food is prepared for the delectation of tyrants and of men in private station, he says: 'I know too, <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>, that most persons infer that we eat and drink with greater zest than ordinary people from this fact, that they would themselves, as they believe, be more pleased to dine on the meal that is set before us than on what is served to themselves. For it is anything that transcends the usual that gives pleasure, which is the reason why all men except tyrants look forward with joy to holiday feasts. For since the tables set before tyrants are always heavily laden, they have nothing special to offer on feast-days, so that here is the first particular in which they are at a disadvantage compared with men in private station, namely in the delight of anticipation. Then secondly, he said, I am sure that you have learned that the more abundantly one is supplied with things which go beyond his needs, the more quickly he suffers from satiety as regards eating. Wherefore, again, the one who has too many things set before him is at a disadvantage, compared with those who live moderately, in the duration of his pleasure.' 'Yes, but, good heavens,' <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> replied, 'so long as their appetites are keen, surely those who enjoy a richer array of food must have more pleasure than those before whom poorer dishes are set.' <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, in his treatise On Monarchy dedicated to <a href=/people/146 target=_blank>Cassander</a> (if the work is authentic; for many declare that it is by <a href=/people/889 target=_blank>Sosibius</a>, for whom the poet <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a> wrote a congratulatory poem in elegiac verse), says that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> kings, to gratify their love of luxury, offer a large sum of money as a reward for all who invent a new pleasure.

For the dinner, like the tribute, has from ancient times been imposed upon all cities in proportion to their population. <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=person long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a>, author of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> History, writes, in the second book of the work entitled Equipment: All who attend upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> kings when they dine first bathe themselves and then serve in white clothes, and spend nearly half the day on preparations for the dinner. Of those who are invited to eat with the king, some dine outdoors, in full sight of anyone who wishes to look on; others dine indoors in the king's company. Yet even these do not eat in his presence, for there are two rooms opposite each other, in one of which the king has his meal, in the other his invited guests. The king can see them through the curtain at the door, but they cannot see him. Sometimes, however, on the occasion of a public holiday, all dine in a single room with the king, in the great hall. And whenever the king commands a symposium (which he does often), he has about a dozen companions at the drinking. When they have finished dinner, that is, the king by himself, the guests in the other room, these fellow-drinkers are summoned by one of the eunuchs; and entering they drink with him, though even they do not have the same wine; moreover, they sit on the floor, while he reclines on a couch supported by feet of gold; and they depart after having drunk to excess. In most cases the king breakfasts and dines alone, but sometimes his wife and some of his sons dine with him. And throughout the dinner his concubines sing and play the lyre; one of them is the soloist, the others sing in chorus. And so, <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a> continues, the 'king's dinner,' as it is called, will appear prodigal to one who merely hears about it, but when one examines it carefully it will be found to have been got up with economy and even with parsimony; and the same is true of the dinners among other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> in high station. For one thousand animals are slaughtered daily for the king; these comprise <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a>, <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a>, deer, and most of the smaller animals; many birds also are consumed, including <a href=/people/275 target=_blank>Arabian</a> ostriches — and the creature is large — geese, and cocks. And of all these only moderate portions are served to each of the king's guests, and each of them may carry home whatever he leaves untouched at the meal. But the greater part of these meats and other foods are taken out into the courtyard for the body-guard and light-armed troopers maintained by the king; there they divide all the half-eaten remnants of meat and bread and share them in equal portions. Just as hired soldiers in Greece receive their wages in money, so these men receive food from the king in requital for services. Similarly among other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> of high rank, all the food is served on the table at one and the same time; but when their guests have done eating, whatever is left from the table, consisting chiefly of meat and bread, is given by the officer in charge of the table to each of the slaves; this they take and so obtain their daily food. </p>                        </div>

On one occasion, when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=ethnic long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasians</a>, to save the towns belonging to them on the mainland, received and entertained the army of <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, four hundred talents in silver were expended in their behalf by <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, a prominent citizen; for cups and mixing bowls of silver and gold were furnished at table, and after the dinner (these were carried off as spoil by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>). If <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> had eaten there twice, taking breakfast as well as dinner, the cities would have been utterly ruined. And in the ninth book, also, of his Histories he says: The Great King gives a royal banquet which is held once a year on his birthday. The name given to the dinner in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, is tukta, which in Greek means 'complete.'

But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> king, as <a href=/people/485 target=_blank>Ctesias</a> and <a href=/people/2046 target=_blank>Dinon</a> (in his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> History) say, used to dine in company with 15, men, and four hundred talents were expended on the dinner. This amounts, in the coinage of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, to 2,400, denarii, which, divided among 15, men, make denarii, Italic currency, for each man. Consequently it comes to the same sum as that spent by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, which was one hundred minas, as <a href=/people/1241 target=_blank>Ephippus</a> related. But <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>, in The Carouse, reckons the expense of the largest banquet at a talent only when he says: So then, our prosperity accords not with the way in which we offer sacrifice. For though to the gods I bring an offering of a tiny <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> bought for ten drachmas, and glad I am to get it so cheap; but for flute-girls and perfume, harp-girls, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400234PMen class=demonym long=23.419 lat=39.964>Mendean</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=demonym long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasian</a> wine, eels, cheese, and honey, the cost is almost a talent; and whereas by analogy it is . . . He evidently mentions a talent as though it were an extravagant expenditure. Again, in The Peevish Man, he has the following: So burglars sacrifice: they bring chests and wine-jars, not for the gods' sake, but for their own. The frankincense is required by religion, and so is the meal-cake; the god gets this, offered entire on the fire. But they, after giving the end of the spine and the gall-bladder to the gods — because unfit to eat — gulp down the rest themselves. <a href=/people/489 target=_blank>Philoxenus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363230PKyt class=person long=23.0291 lat=36.2295>Cythera</a>, in the poem entitled The Banquet (granting that it is he and not the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387207PLeu class=person long=20.717 lat=38.81>Leucadian</a> <a href=/people/489 target=_blank>Philoxenus</a>, who was mentioned by the comic poet <a href=/people/2345 target=_blank>Plato</a> in <a href=/people/11023 target=_blank>Phaon</a>), describes the arrangements of a dinner in these terms: And slaves twain brought unto us a table with well-oiled face, </p>                        </div>

Some slaves set beside us snowy-topped barley-cakes in baskets, while others (brought in loaves of wheat). After them first came not an ordinary tureen, my love, but a riveted vessel of huge size; . . . a glistening dish of eels to break our fast, full of conger-faced morsels that would delight a god.

Another rich dish there was, made of squid and sepia-polyps with soft tentacles. After this came a grey mullet hot from its contact with fire, the whole as large as the table, exhaling spirals of steam. After it came breaded squid, my friend, and crooked prawns done brown. Following these we had flower-leaved cakes and fresh confections spiced, puff-cakes of wheat with frosting, large as the pot. This is called the 'navel of the feast' by you and me, I ween. Last there came — the gods are my witnesses — a monstrous slice of <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a>, baked hot, from over the sea where it was carved with knives from the meatiest part of the belly. Were it ours ever to assist at the task, great would be our joy. Yet even where we were wanting, the feast was complete. Where it is possible to tell the full tale, my powers still hold, and yet no one could recount truly to you all the dishes that came before us. I nearly missed a hot entrail, after which came in the intestine of a home-bred <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>, a chine, and a rump with hot dumplings. And the slave set before us the head, boiled whole, and split in two, of a milk-fed <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kid</a> all steaming; then boiled meat-ends, and with them skin-white ribs, snouts, head, feet, and a tenderloin spiced with silphium.

Afterwards there was jugged hare, and young cockerels, and many hot portions of partridges and ring-doves were now lavishly laid beside us. Loaves of bread there were, light and nicely folded; and companioning these there came in also yellow honey and curds, and as for the cheese — every one would avow that it was tender, and I too thought so.

And when they departed, she furnished litters for the guests of high rank, with bearers, while for the greater number she provided <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> gaily caparisoned with silver-plated harness, and for all she sent along <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=demonym long=35.01 lat=13.01>Aethiopian</a> slaves to carry the torches. On the fourth day she distributed fees, amounting to a talent, for the purchase of roses, and the floors of the dining-rooms were strewn with them to the depth of a cubit, in net-like festoons spread over all. He also records that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> himself, on a later visit to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, erected a scaffold in plain sight above the theatre, and roofed with green boughs, like the caves built for Bacchic revels; on this he hung tambourines, fawnskins, and other Dionysiac trinkets of all sorts, where he reclined in company with his friends and drank from early morning, being entertained by artists summoned from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, while Greeks from all parts assembled to see the spectacle. And sometimes, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> continues, he even shifted the place of his revels to the top of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAkr class=place long=23.7257 lat=37.9717>Acropolis</a>, while the entire city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> was illuminated with torches hung from the roofs. And he gave orders that henceforth he should be proclaimed as <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> throughout all the city. So, too, the Emperor Gaius, who had the cognomen <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a> from the circumstance that he was born in camp, was named the new <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, and not only that, but he also assumed the entire garb of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, and made royal progresses and sat in judgement thus arrayed. Viewing all this, which surpasses what we have, we may well admire Greek poverty, having also before our eyes the dinners of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a>, an account of which is given by <a href=/people/1776 target=_blank>Cleitarchus</a> in the first book of his History of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. He says that after the demolition of their city by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, their entire wealth was found to be under 440 talents; he further says that they were mean-spirited and stingy where food was concerned, preparing for their meals mincemeat in leaves, and boiled vegetables, anchovies, and other small fish, sausages, beef-ribs, and pease-porridge. With these, <a href=/people/4085 target=_blank>Attaginus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/2652 target=_blank>Phrynon</a>, entertained <a href=/people/252 target=_blank>Mardonius</a> together with fifty other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, and <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> says in the ninth book that <a href=/people/4085 target=_blank>Attaginus</a> was well supplied with riches.

Now the meal consisted of cheese and a lightly kneaded barley-cake served, in deference to custom (nomos), on bronze trenchers called in some authors mazonomoi ('barley-cake servers'), having received their name from this use. Along with the cake and the cheese were an entrail and salt to eat with it. Having consecrated this food, each man was permitted to drink a little from an earthenware basin, and the one offering it would say 'Good dinner to you!' Thereupon all shared alike a broth and a hash, and to each diner was given besides two slices of meat. At all their meals, but especially in those called mazones ('barley-feeds'), which name the guild of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> retains even to this day, they held to the custom that for the more hearty eaters among the young men a larger quantity of broth should be poured out, and more barley-cakes and wheat bread should be placed before them. For such a young man was held to be manly and a thoroughbred, since hearty eating was admired and praised among them. After dinner they offered libations without washing their hands first, but wiping them off with pieces of bread; each man then carried away the crumbs. This practice they observed against the dangers which occur in the streets at night. After the libation they sing a paean. But when they sacrifice to the spirits of the departed, there is a great slaughter of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, and all are feasted in company with their slaves; at these festival banquets the boys dine with their fathers, sitting without cloaks on the stones. And <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>, in the forty-sixth book of his History of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, says that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a> entertain at their celebrations masters and slaves, setting one table before them all; they freely serve food for all to share, and mix the same bowl for all.

After reclining they rise again, and kneeling, join in pouring a libation, while the herald, acting as priest, recites the traditional prayers. After this they recline, and all receive a pint of wine excepting the priests of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=person long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> and of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>; for to each of these latter the wine is given in double quantity, as well as the portions of everything else. Thereupon each diner is served with a loaf of pure wheat bread moulded flat, upon which lies another loaf which they call oven-bread; also a piece of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>'s flesh, a small bowl of barley gruel or of some vegetable in its season, two eggs, a bit of fresh cheese, some dried figs, a flat-cake, and a wreath. Any manager of the festival who provides more than these viands is fined by the censors, and what is more, neither are those who dine in the town hall permitted to bring in anything to eat, but they eat these foods alone, giving a share of what remains to the slaves. </p>                        </div>

As for the origin of these practices, <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> is the right man to inform us! <a href=/people/4190 target=_blank>Lyceas</a>, in his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> History, esteems the banquets of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> more highly than the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, and says: The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> undertook a campaign against <a href=/people/748 target=_blank>Ochus</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, but were defeated. Their king was taken prisoner, but <a href=/people/748 target=_blank>Ochus</a> treated him kindly and even summoned him to dinner. But though the arrangements for the dinner were sumptuous, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> laughed at them, feeling that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> lived very frugally. 'If you would know, O King,' said he, 'how a rich king should eat, permit the cooks who were once mine to prepare for you an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> dinner.' The order was given, and when the dinner had been prepared, <a href=/people/748 target=_blank>Ochus</a> was delighted with it, but said, 'May the god, O <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a>, bring you, evil man that you are, to an evil end, for you turned your back on such splendid dinners as these and conceived a desire for cheaper food.' What <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> dinners were like <a href=/people/5933 target=_blank>Protagorides</a> shows in the first book of his Games at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361361UDap class=place long=36.1442 lat=36.13>Daphne</a>, when he says: A third kind of dinner is the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a>, where no tables are placed beside the guests, but platters are carried round among them. Among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a>, says <a href=/people/724 target=_blank>Phylarchus</a> in the sixth book, many loaves of bread are broken up and served lavishly on the tables, as well as pieces of meat taken from the cauldrons; no one tastes these without looking first to see whether the king has touched what is set before him. Again, in Book III, the same <a href=/people/724 target=_blank>Phylarchus</a> says that <a href=/people/5460 target=_blank>Ariamnes</a>, who was a very rich<a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=person long=7 lat=49>Celt</a>, publicly promised to entertain all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a> for a year, and he fulfilled this promise by the following method. At various points in their country he set stations along the most convenient highways, where he erected booths of vine-props and poles of reed and osiers, according to the space demanded in each station for the reception of the crowds which were expected to stream in from towns and villages. Here he set up large cauldrons, containing all kinds of meat, which he had caused to be forged the year before he intended to give the entertainment, sending for metal-workers from other cities. Many victims were slaughtered daily — <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>, <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>hogs</a>, <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, and other <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> — casks of wine were made ready, and a large quantity of barley-meal ready mixed. <a href=/people/724 target=_blank>Phylarchus</a> continues: Not merely the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a> who came from the villages and towns profited by this, but even passing strangers were not allowed to depart by the slaves who served, until they had had a share of the food which had been prepared. Thracian dinners are mentioned by <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> in the seventh book of the Anabasis, describing the symposium at the house of <a href=/people/328 target=_blank>Seuthes</a> in these words: </p>                        </div>

These, to the number of about twenty, were covered with meat piled high, and large loaves of leavened bread were attached by skewers to the meat. Special care was taken always to set the courses opposite the strangers, for that was the custom. <a href=/people/328 target=_blank>Seuthes</a> was the first to do this. He would take the loaves lying in front of him, break them into small pieces, and toss them to whom he liked; the meat likewise, leaving only enough to taste for himself. The others also before whom the tables were set followed his example. But an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=person long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a> named <a href=/people/6250 target=_blank>Arystas</a>, a great eater, dispensed with the ceremony of the toss, and seizing in his hands a three-pound loaf and some meat, he placed them on his lap and proceeded to eat. They passed round drinking-horns containing wine, and all took them. But when the cup-bearer came to <a href=/people/6250 target=_blank>Arystas</a> with the drinking-horn, he, seeing that <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> was no longer eating, said, 'Give it to him; for he is not busy any longer, whereas I haven't got time yet.' Thereupon laughter arose. As the drinking proceeded a Thracian entered with a white <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and grasping a full horn he said, 'Here's to you, <a href=/people/328 target=_blank>Seuthes</a>; accept this <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> as a present, for upon it, when you pursue, you will catch whomsoever you desire, and when you retreat, you will never be afraid of the enemy.' Another, in like manner, brought in and presented him with a slave as he drank his health, and still another gave him garments for his wife. <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a>, in proposing a toast to him, gave him a silver saucer and a scimitarworth ten minae. Then an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> named <a href=/people/5017 target=_blank>Gnesippus</a> arose and said that there was an excellent custom of long standing, that the rich should honour the king with presents, but to those who were not rich the king should give presents. But <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> got up with a resolute air, and as he took the drinking-horn he said: 'I give myself and my comrades here to you, <a href=/people/328 target=_blank>Seuthes</a>, to be your trusted friends, and not one of us comes unwillingly. And today they appear before you with no other request, but desire that they may labour and risk danger in your behalf.' Then <a href=/people/328 target=_blank>Seuthes</a> arose and drank with <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, and with him also emptied the horn upon the ground. After this there entered persons who played tunes on the horns used for signalling, and who sounded off measures, and as it were flageolet notes, on trumpets made of raw <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>-hides. <a href=/people/645 target=_blank>Poseidonius</a> (he of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BSPo class=place long=23.72265 lat=37.97635>Stoa</a>), in the Histories which he compiled, collected many usages and customs of many peoples germane to the philosophic tenets which he held; and he writes: The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a> place hay on the ground when they serve their meals, which they take on wooden tables raised only slightly from the ground. Their food consists of a few loaves of bread, but of large quantities of meat prepared in water or roasted over coals or on spits. This they eat in a cleanly fashion, to be sure, but with a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>-like appetite, grasping whole joints with both hands and biting them off the bone; if, however, any piece proves hard to tear away, they slice it off with a small knife, which lies at hand in its sheath in a special box. </p>                        </div>

The last they also drop into their wine. They use no olive oil, on account of its rarity, and being unfamiliar, it seems to them unpleasant. When several dine together, they sit in a circle; but the mightiest among them, distinguished above the others for skill in war, or family connexions, or wealth, sits in the middle, like a chorus-leader. Beside him is the host, and next on either side the others according to their respective ranks. Men-at arms, carrying oblong shields, stand close behind them, while their bodyguards, seated in a circle directly opposite, share in the feast like their masters. The attendants serve the drink in vessels resembling our spouted cups, either of clay or of silver. Similar also are the platters which they have for serving food; but others use bronze platters, others still, baskets of wood or plaited wicker. The liquor drunk in the houses of the rich is wine brought from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and the country round <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433054PMas class=place long=5.36 lat=43.3>Marseilles</a>, and is unmixed; though sometimes a little water is added. But among the needier inhabitants a beer is drunk made from wheat, with honey added; the masses drink it plain. It is called corma. They sip a little, not more than a small cupful, from the same cup, but they do it rather frequently. The slave carries the drink round from left to right and from right to left; this is the way in which they are served. They make obeisance to the gods, also, turning towards the right. <a href=/people/645 target=_blank>Poseidonius</a> again, describing the wealth of Lovernius, father of Bituis, who was deposed by the Romans, says that to win the favour of the mob he rode in a chariot through the fields scattering gold and silver among the myriads of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a> who followed him; he also made an enclosure twelve stades square, in which he set up vats filled with expensive wine, and prepared a quantity of food so great that for several days all who wished might enter and enjoy what was set before them, being served continuously. After he had finally set a limit to the feast, one of the native poets arrived too late; and meeting the chief, he sang his praises in a hymn extolling his greatness and lamenting his own lot in having come late. And the chief, delighted with this, called for a bag of gold and tossed it to the bard as he ran beside him. He picked it up and again sang in his honour, saying that the wheel-tracks made by the chariot on the ground on which he drove bore golden benefits for men. All this <a href=/people/645 target=_blank>Poseidonius</a> recorded in the twenty-third book. But in the fifth book, in his account of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, he says: The subject who enjoys the title of 'king's friend' has no share at his board, </p>                        </div>

In the sixteenth book, again, he tells the story of King <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>; how that he went up into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a> and made war on <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a>, but was taken prisoner by the barbarian and lived a long time at the court of <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a>, being treated in royal fashion. <a href=/people/645 target=_blank>Poseidonius</a> writes: Among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, the king at their banquets occupied a couch on which he reclined alone; it was separated from the other couches and somewhat higher than they; his table was set before him apart, as to a departed spirit, and was laden with native dishes.

The dinner consisted of a huge loaf and meat, the drink being any kind of wine mixed with cold water. They were served by men wearing daggers, and in strict silence. In the second book he says: In the Roman capital, whenever they hold a feast in the precinct of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, it is given by the general who for the time being is celebrating a triumph, and the preparation for the banquet is worthy of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> himself. For honeyed wine flowed copiously throughout the entire meal, and the food consisted of large loaves and boiled smoked meat, as well as roast meat from the freshly sacrificed victims, in extravagant plenty. And among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Etruscans</a> sumptuous tables prepared twice a day, and richly coloured rugs are spread, and there are silver cups of every kind, and a host of handsome slaves stands by, dressed in rich garments. <a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaeus</a>, moreover, in the first book of his Histories, adds that the slave girls among them serve naked until they grow to be adults. <a href=/people/1316 target=_blank>Megasthenes</a>, in the second book of his History of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, says that among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> a table is set before each one at dinner. It resembles a side-board, and on it is placed a golden bowl into which they first pour their rice, boiled as one would boil groats, and they then add many sauces of meat which had been treated with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> condiments. But the Germans, as <a href=/people/645 target=_blank>Poseidonius</a> narrates in the thirtieth book, eat for luncheon meat which has been roasted in separate pieces, and they wash it down with milik or wine that is unmixed. Some inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a> fight duels during their symposia. And <a href=/people/2904 target=_blank>Nicolas</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335363UDam class=person long=36.311 lat=33.509>Damascus</a>, a <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a> philosopher, in the 110th book of his Histories, records that the Romans have gladiatorial fights during a banquet. He writes as follows: The Romans staged spectacles of fighting gladiators not merely at their festivals and in their theatres, borrowing the custom from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Etruscans</a>, but also at their banquets. At any rate, it often happened that some would invite their friends to dinner, not merely for other entertainment, but that they might witness two or three pairs of contestants in gladiatorial combat; on these occasions, when sated with dining and drink, they called in the gladiators. No sooner did one have his throat cut than the masters applauded with delight at this feat. </p>                        </div>

But the provision was in fact disregarded, for the people would not tolerate this outrage, but declared the will void. <a href=/people/132 target=_blank>Eratosthenes</a>, in the first book of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> Victors, says that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Etruscans</a> accompany their boxing-matches with the flute. In the twenty-third book of his Histories, <a href=/people/645 target=_blank>Poseidonius</a> says: The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a> sometimes have gladiatorial contests during dinner. Having assembled under arms, they indulge in sham fights and practise feints with one another; sometimes they proceed even to the point of wounding each other, and then, exasperated by this, if the company does not intervene, they go so far as to kill. In ancient times, he continues, we observe that when whole joints of meat were served the best man received the thigh. But if another claimed it, they stood up to fight it out in single combat to the death. Others, again, would collect silver or gold, or a number of jars of wine from the audience in the theatre, and having exacted a pledge that their award would be carried out, they would decree that the collection be distributed as presents to their dearest relatives; they then stretched themselves on their backs over their shields, and some one standing near would cut their throats with a sword. <a href=/people/958 target=_blank>Euphorion</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236PCha class=person long=23.6153 lat=38.4597>Chalcis</a>, in his Historical Notes, writes as follows: Among the Romans twenty pounds are offered to any who will brave decapitation with an axe, on condition that their heirs receive the prize. And often, when too many are enrolled, they dispute which of them has the best right in each case to have his head cut off. <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a>, in Book I of his work On Lawgivers, declares that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376224UMan class=ethnic long=22.3933 lat=37.6181>Mantineans</a> were inventors of gladiatorial combats, having been counselled thereto by <a href=/people/3578 target=_blank>Demonax</a>, one of their citizens; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=ethnic long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrenaeans</a> became imitators of them. And <a href=/people/225 target=_blank>Ephorus</a> says, in the sixth book of his Histories: The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376224UMan class=ethnic long=22.3933 lat=37.6181>Mantineans</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a> used to practise the arts of war diligently, and, as a consequence, to this very day people call the ancient military uniform and mode of arming '<a about=https://topostext.org/place/376224UMan class=demonym long=22.3933 lat=37.6181>Mantinean</a>,' since it is believed that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376224UMan class=ethnic long=22.3933 lat=37.6181>Mantineans</a> are the inventors. In addition, regular courses of instruction in fighting under arms were first instituted at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376224UMan class=place long=22.3933 lat=37.6181>Mantinea</a>, <a href=/people/1623 target=_blank>Demeas</a> being the instructor in the art. And that the custom of single combat was ancient is told by <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in the Phoenician Women in these words: Warlike fury has swooped upon the sons of <a href=/people/173 target=_blank>Oidipus</a>, brothers twain, and at this moment they stand ready for the match in single combat. It is plain that the noun monomachos (single fighter) is compounded not from mache (battle) but from the verb machomai (fight). For whenever a word compounded with mache ends in -os, as in symmachos (ally), protomachos (champion), epimachos (open to attack), antimachos (fighting against) or philomachos (fight-loving) — <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> has the fight-loving race sprung from <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a> — in such instances it has the acute accent on the third syllable from the last; but when the compound takes the accent on the syllable next before the last, it contains the verb machomai, as in pygmachos (fist-fighter), naumachos (Sea-fighter). Thyself first, thou Fighter at the gate (pylamachos), is found in <a href=/people/695 target=_blank>Stesichorus</a>. There are also hoplomachos (fighting under arms), teichomachos (fighting at the wall), and pyrgomachos (fighting at the tower).

But when it became the turn of <a href=/people/2749 target=_blank>Hegesianax</a> to dance — the historian from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398262UAnt class=place long=26.159 lat=39.752>Alexandria</a> in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399263RTro class=place long=26.27 lat=39.915>Troad</a> — he arose and said: 'In my case, O King, would you rather see me dance badly, or would you like to hear me recite well my own works?' Commanded, therefore, to recite, he so delighted the king that he was promoted to a pension and became one of the king's favourites. <a href=/people/1019 target=_blank>Duris</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=person long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>, in the seventeenth book of his Histories, says of <a href=/people/1140 target=_blank>Polysperchon</a> that whenever he was elated by wine he would dance, even though he was rather old and second to none among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> either in military achievement or in general esteem; he danced continually, clad in a saffron tunic and wearing on his feet <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=demonym long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sikyonian</a> slippers. <a href=/people/1500 target=_blank>Agatharchides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=person long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidus</a>, in the eighth book of his Asiatic History records that whenever the friends of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, son of <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a>, entertained him at dinner, they encased everything that was to be served as dessert in gold; and when they desired to eat the desert, they tore off the gold with the rest of the waste and threw it away, that their friends might be spectators of their extravagance, while their slaves enjoyed the profit. But these gentry had forgotten, what <a href=/people/1019 target=_blank>Duris</a> also records, that <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a>, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s father, possessed a gold cup weighing fifty drachms, and that he always took it to bed with him and placed it at his head. <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> says some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> make a sport of hanging at their drinking-bouts; they attach a noose at a certain height, directly under which they place a stone which may be easily rolled by any who step upon it. They then draw lots, and the one who receives the lot mounts the stone, holding a pruning-knife, and places his neck in the noose; another comes by and pushes the stone; and while it is rolling from under him, the man hanging there, if he does not quickly cut himself loose with the knife before it is too late, is dead, and the others laugh, holding the poor devil's death a great joke. This, friends and fellow-drinkers, easily first among the Greeks, I have been able to tell from my knowledge of ancient symposia. The wise <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, in the first book of the Laws, accurately describes symposia in these words: Neither in the country nor in the towns under <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a> jurisdiction would you see symposia, nor would you see the things which accompany them and which excite all manner of licentious pleasures to the full extent of their power. </p>                        </div>

We laughed, and someone said: Well, my fine fellow, don't begrudge us the account of that symposium of <a href=/people/2644 target=_blank>Parmeniscus</a>. So he raised himself up high beside us, and said: 'I swear to you, gentlemen,' to quote the pleasant <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>.

Wherefore all persons, dreading the violence of the higher powers, are afraid to depart from this life of their own motion, and gladly welcome only the death which comes in old age, being persuaded that this release of their souls comes with the approval of the higher powers. To these principles we ourselves subscribe. But nobody begrudges your choosing one of the three evils. Indeed, you don't understand, poor fools, that these heavy foods form a barrier to the authoritative part of the soul, and inhibit the reason from being itself. — <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>, therefore, in the fifth book of his History of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, says: 'Too much eating, as well as meat-eating, destroys the reasoning faculties and makes souls more sluggish, and fills them besides with irascibility, hardness, and awkwardness.' And the admirable <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> also says that it is pleasant to eat a barley-cake and some cress when one is hungry, and pleasant, too, to draw water from a stream and drink when one is thirsty. And <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> was many a time found walking up and down in front of his house in the late afternoon, and to those who asked, 'What are you doing at this hour?' he would reply, 'Gathering a relish for my dinner.' — But we shall be satisfied with any piece that we may get from you, and not take it ill if we get too little, like the <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> of <a href=/people/4845 target=_blank>Anticleides</a>. For he says, in the second book of his <a href=/people/12255 target=_blank>Returns</a>: 'After the completion of his Labours, <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> was invited with others to a sacrifice celebrated by <a href=/people/247 target=_blank>Eurystheus</a>; and when the sons of <a href=/people/247 target=_blank>Eurystheus</a> set the chief portions before each one of themselves, but placed an humbler one before <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, </p>                        </div>

Well, then, we have no such temper ourselves, though we are emulators of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> in all things. ' Indeed, Lentil soup is known to the tragic stage; they say that <a href=/people/2031 target=_blank>Agatharchus</a> once painted a picture of <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> guzzling it when he had recovered from his disease. So speaks the comic poet <a href=/people/2070 target=_blank>Sophilus</a>. It is a <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a> belief, too, that the wise man will do all things rightly, even to the wise seasoning of lentil soup. Wherefore <a href=/people/12260 target=_blank>Timon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378226PPhl class=person long=22.648 lat=37.846>Phlious</a> speaks of one who had never learned wisely to make a Zenonian lentil soup, as if a lentil soup could not be made otherwise than according to the Zenonian prescription. For he said: Into the lentil soup put the twelfth part of a coriander seed. And <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=person long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a> said: Exalt not the dish of stew above a plate of lentil soup and so set us to quarrelling.' In like manner <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a>, in his essay On the Good, introduces to us certain maxims in these words: 'Never eat an olive when you have a nettle. In the winter season, a bulb-and lentil soup, oh me, oh my! For bulb-and lentil soup is like ambrosia in the chilly cold.' And the witty <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>, in <a href=/people/2883 target=_blank>Gerytades</a>, has said: 'Are you teaching him to make barley gruel or lentil soup?' And in <a href=/people/284 target=_blank>Amphiaraus</a>: 'You, who dare insult lentil soup, sweetest of delicacies!' <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>, in The <a href=/people/5612 target=_blank>Dionysi</a>: 'A kettle of lentil soup was simmering.' <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> in Just Alike: 'It proved to be a piece of good luck, that one of the natives was teaching me how to make lentil soup.' I know also that the sister of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, most prudent and sagacious, was called Lentil, though others name her <a href=/people/1033 target=_blank>Callisto</a>, as recorded by <a href=/people/1566 target=_blank>Mnaseas</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382217PPat class=person long=21.74 lat=38.245>Patrae</a> in the third book of his European History; my authority is <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a>, in the third book of his <a href=/people/12255 target=_blank>Returns</a>. At this <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a> laughed very boisterously, and the <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynic</a>, unable to bear the slighting of his erudition concerning lentils, cried, Yet, you men of fair <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a>, have been brought up on lentil food, and your entire city is full of lentil dishes. Even the 'lentil'-parodist, <a href=/people/1028 target=_blank>Sopater</a>, mentions them in a play, <a href=/people/1394 target=_blank>Bacchis</a>, in these words: 'I could not, living within sight of the huge bronze <a href=/people/12192 target=_blank>Colossus</a>, eat a loaf of lentil bread.' 'For what need have mortals (as your own <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> says, most learned grammarian) of aught save two things only, <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>'s bounty and a water-gushing draught? These we have at hand, and nature gave them to nurture us. Yet we are not satisfied with abundance of these, and so in mere wantonness we hunt for devices to get other foods.' And in another place this philosopher of the stage says: 'Sufficient unto me is the modest food of a sober table; but all that is unseasonable and goes beyond due measure I hope I may not admit.' And <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> used to say that he differed from all other men in that they live to eat whereas he ate to live. <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>, too, answered those who chided him for rubbing himself down: 'Would that I were able, by rubbing my belly as well, to quell its hunger and want!' <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> in The Suppliants says of <a href=/people/552 target=_blank>Capaneus</a>: </p>                        </div>

He says: 'Some men are so degraded, when it comes to money, that the story is told of a man who, when near his end, swallowed a large number of gold pieces and died; still another caused some to be sewn in a shirt, and after putting it on he charged the members of his household to bury him just as he was, without burning his body or caring for it in any way.' Such persons as these, in fact, all but shout as they die: 'O Gold, fairest gift welcomed by mortals! For neither a mother, nor children in the house, nor loved father can bring such delights as thou and they that own thee in their halls. If the glance which shines from <a href=/people/168 target=_blank>Kypris</a>'s eyes is like thine, no wonder that countless loves attend her.' Such was the character of the greed which people of those days possessed; concerning it <a href=/people/606 target=_blank>Anacharsis</a>, when someone asked him what the Greeks used money for, replied, 'To count!' <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> ordains that in his ideal state the currency shall be dice. Well said are the following words of <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>: 'Speak not of wealth; for I reverence not the god whom even the basest man may easily win to his side.' <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a>, in the introduction to his treatise on Good and Evil, says that once a very rich young man came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>, dressed in a purple cloak with gold fringe. When someone asked him where he was he replied, 'From Richmond.' Perhaps this is the same young man as that mentioned by <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a> thus: 'Whence does this man trace his birth?' B. From the Richmonds. All agree that these are most highly born, but not a soul sees a poor man of noble origin.' When <a href=/people/1240 target=_blank>Cynulcus</a> failed to get applause after these words, in a burst of temper he said, Mr. Toastmaster, these gentlemen have no hunger, being troubled with word-diarrhoea, or they ridicule what has been said about lentil soup, having in mind what <a href=/people/749 target=_blank>Pherecrates</a> has said in <a href=/people/4938 target=_blank>Corianno</a>: 'A.

No lentils for me, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>; I don't like them. If one eats them, his breath smells bad.' I say, then, since for this reason these wise men are wary of lentils, at least let some bread be given to me and with it anything that is not too expensive; on the contrary, if so be that you have but the far-famed lentil soup, or the so called 'conch.'

And most of the Roman grammarians, not having been conversant with many Greek poets and historians, do not know where <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> took the verse from. You, <a href=/people/1240 target=_blank>Cynulcus</a> (since you delight in this name, never mentioning the one by which your mother called you at birth), in my opinion are 'mighty fine and tall,' in the words of your friend <a href=/people/12260 target=_blank>Timon</a>, but are not aware that 'conch' has found mention in <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> long before in his Holiday and Islands, and also in the comic poet <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>, who used a diminutive form for the word in Marriage: 'a little bit of conch (conchion for conchos) and a slice of sausage cut off besides.'

And after a little: 'They had to put up with sparse diet, dirt, cold, silence, gloom, and going without a bath.'

For he says in The Restorer of Runaways: 'Decorously putting in a mouthful — making his hand small to be sure in front, but full inside, as the women do — he ate it all up, fully and fattily.'

He replied, 'Dinners without paying my share.' Wherefore <a href=/people/12260 target=_blank>Timon</a> somewhere addressed him in these words, 'Dinner-crazed, with the eyes of a fawn, but with a heart unmoved!'

And the comic poet Baton says in The Murderer: 'I summon hither the philosophers who are sober, who never give themselves a single good thing, who look for the wise man in their walks and talks, as for one who has run away. Man accursed, why, when you have the money to pay, do you stay sober? Why do such injury to the gods? Why, fellow, have you deemed money more precious than yourself or than it is by nature? You are a dead loss to the community if you drink water; for you wrong the farmer and the merchant. But I, when I drink wine to the full, make their profits good.

But every fish loves human flesh if it can get it. Wherefore it is the simple duty of all who talk such foolishness to betake themselves to vegetables, and going over to the philosopher <a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a>, to live abstemiously like <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagoreans</a> in his company.'

Now if, my philosophers, you really love independence and cheap things to eat, why do you come here where you have not even been invited? Is it as though you had come into a prodigal's house to learn how to make a list of cooking utensils? Or to recite the <a href=/people/4475 target=_blank>Cephalion</a> of <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>? For, in the words of the <a href=/people/6335 target=_blank>Cedalion</a> of <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>, ye are 'rogues from the whipping-post and the rack, devourers of other men's goods.' But that you philosophers always have your minds on dinners when you ought to ask for something in the way of <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynic</a> food to eat up or devour (for it were not lawful for me 'to use pleasing terms'), is plain from what <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> tells in the play entitled <a href=/people/696 target=_blank>Linus</a>. He imagines <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> as being educated in the house of <a href=/people/696 target=_blank>Linus</a> and as having been bidden to select from a large number of books lying beside him and read. So he picked up a book on cookery and held it in both hands very carefully. <a href=/people/696 target=_blank>Linus</a> speaks: 'Go up and take whatever book from there you wish; then looking very carefully at the titles, quietly and at your leisure, you shall read. <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a> is there, <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a>, tragedies, <a href=/people/2608 target=_blank>Choerilus</a>, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>, histories of all sorts.

DHER. <a href=/people/1766 target=_blank>Simus</a>, who's he? LI. A very talented fellow. At present he is keen for tragedy, and of all actors he is much the best cook, in the opinion of those who hire him, but of cooks he is the best actor . . . LIN. The fellow has a morbid hunger. HER. Say what you like of me. I am hungry, let me tell you!' After <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a> had recited these quotations in order, <a href=/people/1240 target=_blank>Cynulcus</a> addressed the philosophers present: As <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> said in The <a href=/people/4865 target=_blank>Archilochi</a> (Satirists): 'You have seen what sort of insults that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=demonym long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasian</a> pickle barks at us — how neatly and speedily he got his revenge without delay. He is not like the blind talking uselessly to the deaf, let me tell you.' For, oblivious of the court before whom he delivers the display of his clever iambics, and impelled by his native desire to satisfy his belly and his love of jesting, he gives us a recital of wild songs and 'lays discordantly piped and cymbals struck untimely.' And after these nice exhibitions of poor taste he goes about from house to house looking to see where brilliant dinners are preparing, outdoing the poor devil <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, of whom <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> says in The Refugee: '<a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a> is always inventing some trick; in fact, at this very moment he is trying to get himself dinners for which he pays nothing.

And this man, like our noble <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a>, does not hesitate to undertake foreign travel to gratify his appetite; so says the same <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in Dying Together: 'To get a dinner <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a> went uninvited to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>; yes, by this time he is flying overseas; so pleasant a thing it is to eat others' food.' And <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> said in <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>: 'The saying of <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> is not half bad — the really fortunate man dines on others' food.' When, then, all had laughed at this, <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> spoke: That word for 'jesting' — where did these solecistic voluptuaries get it? <a href=/people/1240 target=_blank>Cynulcus</a> answered him: Why, 'you well-seasoned <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>,' the comic poet <a href=/people/456 target=_blank>Phrynichus</a>, in <a href=/people/877 target=_blank>Ephialtes</a>, mentions jesting in these lines: 'Of all the jobs we now have to do, the hardest is to protect oneself from them. For they have a kind of sting in their fingers, the flower of man-haters' prime. When they go about the market-place they always speak suavely to all; but when they are seated on the benches, there they tear great scratches in those to whom they speak so suavely, and with one consent deride them.' But the expression, 'use pleasing terms,' is employed by <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a> in <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a> Bound: 'Thou shalt know that this is verily so, nor is it in me to use pleasing terms.' Again <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> said: What, my friends, are the utensils used by cooks? For they had mentioned these as worthy of notice in the account of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a> dinners. And where is that word 'prodigal's house'? I know indeed of some notorious prodigals. One is mentioned by <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in The Woman of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=person long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidus</a>: 'That scamp <a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a>, in only two years, has made a football of his patrimony, so rashly has he chewed up all that he had.' And in <a href=/people/473 target=_blank>Phaedrus</a> he says: 'Slowly indeed, yes, by the sun slowly, you say! That little Epicharides in five days has made a football of his patrimony, so rashly and speedily has he squeezed it up into a ball.' And <a href=/people/737 target=_blank>Ctesippus</a> also, the son of <a href=/people/406 target=_blank>Chabrias</a>, went so far in his prodigality that, to indulge his pleasures, he actually sold the stones of his father's monument, on which <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> had spent a thousand drachmas. At any rate, <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> says in Worshippers of the Dead: If, <a href=/people/1846 target=_blank>Phaedimus</a>, <a href=/people/737 target=_blank>Ctesippus</a>, son of <a href=/people/406 target=_blank>Chabrias</a>, had not happened to be a friend, I should have proposed a law not unuseful, in my opinion, — that his father's monument should be some day completed, one stone at a time each year, each large enough to fill a cart, and very cheap material too, say I.' <a href=/people/937 target=_blank>Timocles</a> in <a href=/people/185 target=_blank>Satyrs</a> of the People says: 'No longer does even <a href=/people/737 target=_blank>Ctesippus</a>, son of <a href=/people/406 target=_blank>Chabrias</a>, shave three times a day, </p>                        </div>

It may be, then, that on account of this great extravagance and licentiousness <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> omitted naming him in the speech On Exemptions. Men who have devoured their inheritances ought to be punished in the way described in <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>'s Skipper: 'O dearest mother earth, how very reverend a possession, and beyond price, art thou in the eyes of sensible men! For it were only right, of course, that anyone who had inherited an ancestral estate and then devoured it should from that time on for ever sail the seas, and never so much as set foot on land, that he might thus come to see how good a thing he had inherited but failed to save.' A prodigal named <a href=/people/6867 target=_blank>Pythodelus</a> is mentioned by <a href=/people/3777 target=_blank>Axionicus</a> in The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Etruscan</a> thus: 'Here comes <a href=/people/6867 target=_blank>Pythodelus</a>, surnamed the Dancer, and close at his heels behind him comes reeling that clever girl, Bastinado-fig.'

The language he used is as follows: 'To such an extent has he outdone the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a> in extravagance and greed, that whereas they were intemperate simply in the matter of banquets, he has made a constant practice of spending even the revenues of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> to hire mercenaries. But <a href=/people/659 target=_blank>Callistratus</a>, he continues, the son of <a href=/people/710 target=_blank>Callicrates</a>, likewise a popular leader, though he was intemperate in personal indulgence, was careful of the public interests.' And recording the history of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a> in the fifty-second book of his Histories he writes as follows: 'The city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a> offers sacrifices of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> and holds public banquets nearly every month.

Add to this also that his companions were men who had rushed to his side from very many quarters; some were from the land to which he himself belonged, others were from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, still others were from all the rest of Greece, selected not for their supreme merit; on the contrary, nearly every man in the Greek or barbarian world of a lecherous, loathsome, or ruffianly character flocked to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> and won the title of companions of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>.

It was partly the wars and campaigns, partly also the extravagances of living that incited them to be Ruffians, and live, not in a law-abiding spirit, but prodigally and like highwaymen.' <a href=/people/1019 target=_blank>Duris</a>, in the seventh book of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> History, speaking of <a href=/people/8109 target=_blank>Pasicyprus</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, and his prodigality, writes the following: 'After the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, in dismissing <a href=/people/3667 target=_blank>Pnytagoras</a>, gave him among other presents a fortress which he himself had asked for. This fortress the reigning king <a href=/people/8109 target=_blank>Pasicyprus</a> had before this been compelled by his extravagance to sell for fifty talents to <a href=/people/2015 target=_blank>Pygmalion</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/349336PKit class=person long=33.632745 lat=34.920211>Citium</a>; along with the fortress went his kingdom too. <a href=/people/8109 target=_blank>Pasicyprus</a> took the money and passed his old age in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347331PAma class=place long=33.144 lat=34.712>Amathus</a>.' Another spendthrift of this sort, according to <a href=/people/10815 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398267USke class=person long=26.7002 lat=39.8074>Skepsis</a>, was <a href=/people/4805 target=_blank>Aethiops</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=person long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>, who is mentioned by <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a>.

Thereupon he designated by name some who made a practice of these things. And when King <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> heard this, he made him a judge. At the <a href=/people/11002 target=_blank>Panathenaea</a>, as hipparch, he reared beside <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237AHms class=place long=23.72255 lat=37.97611>the Hermae</a> an ikrion (platform) for <a href=/people/2289 target=_blank>Aristagora</a> higher than <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237AHms class=place long=23.72255 lat=37.97611>the Hermae</a>; and at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235SEle class=place long=23.538 lat=38.0411>Eleusis</a>, at the time of the Mysteries, he placed a throne for her beside the anaktoron, after threatening that any who should try to prevent him would be sorry for it.' </p>                        </div>

For example, they sent for the philosophers, <a href=/people/707 target=_blank>Menedemus</a> and <a href=/people/625 target=_blank>Asclepiades</a>, when they were young and poor, and asked them how it was that though they spent all their days in leisurely association with the philosophers, and possessed no property, yet they were in such good bodily condition; and they told the judges to summon a certain miller.

Among the Romans it is recalled, as <a href=/people/645 target=_blank>Poseidonius</a> says in the forty-ninth book of his Histories, that a certain <a href=/people/2714 target=_blank>Apicius</a> had outdone the whole world in prodigality.

Concerning an <a href=/people/2714 target=_blank>Apicius</a> who also was notorious for prodigality, we have spoken in the first book. <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=person long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> in his work on Noble Birth says that there was not a man in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> who did not hate <a href=/people/791 target=_blank>Phocus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/182 target=_blank>Phocion</a>; and whenever one met <a href=/people/791 target=_blank>Phocus</a> he would say to him, 'O you disgrace to your family!'

I know of many other prodigal men besides, but I leave you to inquire into the history of them all excepting <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a> the son of <a href=/people/919 target=_blank>Hipponicus</a>, whose story is known even to the slaves who attend schoolboys. But if you have anything to say on the other subjects which I have propounded for discussion before anyone else, 'I hold the portals of my ears spread open wide.' Wherefore speak. For I again ask about the expressions which <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a> used, 'to eat up and devour.' And <a href=/people/1261 target=_blank>Aemilianus</a> said: You have the word 'prodigals' house' in <a href=/people/1377 target=_blank>Strattis</a>, who says in <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a>: 'If a body isn't going to have time even to relieve himself, or go to a prodigal's house, or when someone meets him, to stop and say a single word!' Cooking utensils are enumerated by <a href=/people/4066 target=_blank>Anaxippus</a> in The Harp-singer thus: Bring a soup ladle, a dozen skewers, a meat hook, mortar, small cheese scraper, skillet, three bowls, a skinning knife, four cleavers. First bring, won't you, you abomination in the eyes of the gods, the small kettle and the things from the soda-shop. Late again, are you? Bring also the axe and the rack of frying-pans. The pot used for boiling is called caccabe by <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in Women who get the Best Places, thus: A. Put the pot on the fire. — B. What, the teacher's? Also in Men of <a href=/people/3819 target=_blank>Dinnerville</a>: And bring the pot from there. <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> in The Pro-<a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=demonym long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Theban</a>: We now have everything; for the creature which bears the same name as our lady inside, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=demonym long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotian</a> 'eel,' is tightly enveloped in the hollow depths of the pot (caccabe); it's getting hot, rising high, stewing and spluttering. But in <a href=/people/2880 target=_blank>Euthydicus</a> <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> calls the pot batanion: after that, sliced octopus stewed in pots (batania). So <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in Asclepiocleides: With such natural aptitude have I learned in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> to make fancy dishes, that I cause the feasters now and then to push their teeth into the pots for very joy. But <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> has patanion, spelled with p, in Marriage: Pots (patania), a beet, silphium, boilers, lamps, coriander, onions, salt, olive-oil, a bowl. <a href=/people/1454 target=_blank>Philetaerus</a> in <a href=/people/10621 target=_blank>Oinopion</a>: Let this cook Potter advance!

A creature from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380244PKar class=place long=24.427 lat=38.027>Carystus</a>, gigantic, seething. — FB. Well, aren't you going to tell me? Get on! — A. Caccabus I mean; you, perhaps, would call him Casserole. — B. Do you think it makes any difference to me whether people like to call it Caccabus or Sittybus, provided that I know that you are talking about a pot? But <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a>, in <a href=/people/356 target=_blank>Ion</a>, has both forms, batania and patania, in these lines: Bowls, and basins (batania) too, and kettles, casseroles, and patens (patania), sounding in various tones, and — I couldn't begin to tell you if I began to tell. </p>                        </div>

A mashed raisin, some fennel, aniseed, mustard, kale, silphium, dried coriander, sumach, cummin, capers, marjoram, horn-onion, garlic, thyme, sage, must, hart-wort, rue, leek. Another list is in The Vigil, or Toilers; he represents a cook as saying: I'll have to run round and round and shout for anything I may need. You will demand of me your dinner just as soon as you arrive? But I have, as it happens, no vinegar, no anise, no marjoram, no fig-leaves, no oil, no almonds, no garlic, no must, horn-onion, bulb, fire, cummin, salt, egg, wood, kneading-trough, frying-pan, well-rope — I have not seen cistern or well. There is no wine jar, and I stand here all in vain, knife in hand, and what's more, my loins girt up for action. And in The <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a>-lorn Lass: First of all put some marjoram at the bottom of a large casserole, over that the liqueur, diluted with vinegar in just measure, colouring it with must and silphium; then whip it vigorously. To eat up is used by <a href=/people/1794 target=_blank>Telecleides</a> thus in The <a href=/people/1337 target=_blank>Prytanes</a>: Eating up a little cheese. <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a> has the aorist of the verb in The Taxiarchs: To eat up nothing, but merely chew an onion and three salted olives. And <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in <a href=/people/641 target=_blank>Plutus</a>: in the old days, such was his poverty, he would eat up anything. (170D) Different from the cooks were the so called table-makers. What these men were called in for is plainly shown by <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> in The Immigrant: I went and hired in addition this table-maker, who will wash the dishes, get the lamps ready, prepare the libations, and do everything else which it is his business to do. We may, however, ask whether the table-server is the same as the table-maker. For King <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a>, in Similarities, says that table-server and the person called by the Romans structor are one and the same, citing lines from a play by <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> entitled The Drinking-bout: For tomorrow I must secure a flute-girl; I will get a 'table-maker' and a caterer. This is what my master sent me from the country for. They used to call table-maker the man who took care of the tables and the correct serving of the dinner in general. <a href=/people/638 target=_blank>Philemon</a> in Butting In: You have no oversight in the kitchen; a table-maker is appointed to serve. They used to call the viands placed upon the table (trapeza) epitrapezomata. <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> in <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>: </p>                        </div>

They used also to call the man who purchased the food marketer (agorastes), though today we call him obsonator; thus <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, in the second book of Memorabilia, has these words: Should we consent to take a servant and a marketer of this quality for nothing? But in <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>'s <a href=/people/8142 target=_blank>Phanium</a> it has a more general sense: He was a thrifty and moderate purchaser. <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> has the form opsones for marketer in Masters of the Frying-<a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a>, in these lines: How that marketer seems to be delaying our luncheon! <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> used a verb meaning to buy dainties besides in The Cleobulinas . . ., and <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> has a verb buy in the market beside, in <a href=/people/3822 target=_blank>Dropides</a>. Those who give the summons to come to the king's table, as <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a> says, are called table-men, from eleon, which means meat-table. But <a href=/people/470 target=_blank>Artemidorus</a> names them dinner-summoners. He further says that they used to call the foretasters eaters, because they ate before the king to ensure his safety. But in our day the eater has become the superintendent of the entire service; his office was distinguished and honourable. <a href=/people/462 target=_blank>Chares</a>, at any rate, in the third book of his Histories says that <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> <a href=/people/1517 target=_blank>Soter</a> was appointed eater for <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. Perhaps also the man whom Romans today call foretaster was he whom Greeks in the old days used to name protenthes, as <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> has it in the earlier edition of the Clouds, in these lines: <a href=/people/3699 target=_blank>Strepsiades</a>: How is it, then, that the magistrates don't accept these pledges on the first day of the month, instead of on the last? <a href=/people/5178 target=_blank>Pheidippides</a>: Why, I fancy they are subject to the same weakness as the foretasters — in their desire to grab the pledges as early as possible, they 'foretaste' them by a whole day. <a href=/people/749 target=_blank>Pherecrates</a> also mentions foretasters in Savages: Do not wonder; for we are foretasters, though you do not know it. And <a href=/people/2342 target=_blank>Philyllius</a> in <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>: Shall I tell you then, so please you, who I am? I am one of the foretasters, and my name is Luncheonetta. I also find a decree passed at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> in the archonship of <a href=/people/619 target=_blank>Cephisodorus</a>, in which the foretasters are a kind of college, exactly like the order called Parasitoi. It runs thus: On the motion of <a href=/people/791 target=_blank>Phocus</a>, in order that the Council may celebrate the <a href=/people/4855 target=_blank>Apaturia</a> in company with all other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> according to ancestral practice, be it decreed by the Council that its members be dismissed during those days on which all the other officials entitled to a holiday are celebrating, for five days beginning with the day on which the Foretasters begin the celebration. That the ancients used to have also the foretasters called progeustae <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> tells us in the work entitled <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hieron</a>, or The Tyrant's Character: The tyrant lives in distrust even of food and drink; why, instead of being the first to offer the gods the consecrating morsel, they bid their serving-men take a taste first because of their suspicion that even in this rite they may eat or drink something harmful.

Again, the men of earlier times called those who made cakes, and especially those who made the large flat-cakes, artisans. <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>, in Sham <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, scolding the cooks because they undertake matters which are none of their business, says: Cook, in my eyes you are very obnoxious. 'How many tables are we going to set?' It's the third time, already, that you have asked that. We are including for the sacrifice one little <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>; but whether we shall set up eight tables or only one, what difference does that make to you? Serve the dinner today! You haven't any rich titbits to make, nor the kind of sauces which you usually mix in it, consisting of honey, sifted flour, and eggs; no, for nowadays things are completely turned round. It is the cook who makes cakes in moulds, bakes flat-cakes, boils groats and serves them after the salt-fish, and then a dish in fig-leaves and some grapes. Meanwhile the artisan, a woman, posted to rival him, roasts bits of meat and thrushes as if for dessert; and as a consequence the guest expecting dinner has dessert to eat, but after anointing himself and putting on a wreath he again eats a dinner of honey-cakes — with thrushes! That the duties of their office had been separate, the artisans looking after the cakes while the cooks saw to the preparation of fish and meat, is clearly shown by <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> in <a href=/people/2508 target=_blank>Chrysis</a> thus: Four flute-girls have to be paid, and a dozen cooks and artisans, who demand honey by the bowl-ful. <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> in The Artisan: A. What does this mean, slave? <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> is my witness, you have come forth with bustling briskness. DB.

To show that this poem is by <a href=/people/695 target=_blank>Stesichorus</a>, the poet <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> is a very competent witness, for he, in telling the story of <a href=/people/315 target=_blank>Meleager</a>, says: Who at point of spear overcame all the warriors, driving them beyond the eddying <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393228WAna class=place long=22.899 lat=39.365>Anaurus</a> out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394230UIol class=place long=22.9689 lat=39.3663>Iolcus</a>, rich in grapes.

While many remarks of this nature were still being made, there was heard from a neighbouring house the sound of a water-organ; it was very sweet and joyous, so that we all turned our attention to it, charmed by its tunefulness. And <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, with a glance at the musician <a href=/people/7203 target=_blank>Alceides</a>, said, Do you hear, maestro, that beautiful harmony which has lured us all, completely beguiled you its music? It is not like the 'single-pipe' so common among you <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a>, which causes pain to the listeners rather than any musical delight. And <a href=/people/7203 target=_blank>Alceides</a> says: And yet that instrument, the water-organ, whether belonging to the class of string or wind instruments, as you choose, is the invention of one of our own <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a>, a barber by trade; and his name was <a href=/people/2102 target=_blank>Ctesibius</a>. <a href=/people/657 target=_blank>Aristocles</a> relates this, speaking in some such fashion as this in his work On Choruses: 'The question is debated whether the water-organ belongs to the wind or the stringed instruments. Now <a href=/people/633 target=_blank>Aristoxenus</a>, to be sure, does not know of it; but it is said that <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> imparted a slight hint of its construction in having made a time-piece for use at night which resembled a water-organ, being a very large water-clock. And in fact the water-organ does look like a water-clock. Therefore it cannot be regarded as a stringed instrument or a percussion instrument, but perhaps may be described as a wind instrument, since wind is forced into it by the water. For the pipes are set low in water, and as the water is briskly agitated by a boy, air is released in the pipes through certain valves which fit into the pipes from one side of the organ to the other, and a pleasant sound is produced. The organ is shaped like a round altar, and is said to have been invented by <a href=/people/2102 target=_blank>Ctesibius</a>, a barber who lived there in Aspendia during the reign of <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> <a href=/people/2014 target=_blank>Euergetes</a> II; and they say that he became very famous; he, indeed, even taught his wife <a href=/people/2353 target=_blank>Thais</a>.' <a href=/people/1120 target=_blank>Tryphon</a>, in the third book On the Use of Terms (the treatise has to do with pipes and instruments), says that <a href=/people/2102 target=_blank>Ctesibius</a> the engineer wrote an account of the water-organ. I am not sure whether he is mistaken in the name. <a href=/people/633 target=_blank>Aristoxenus</a>, it is true, prefers string and percussion instruments to wind instruments, alleging that wind instruments are too easy; for, he says, many persons, like shepherds, can play the flute and the <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a>'s pipe without having been taught. All this, <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, I have to tell you concerning the water-organ.

The reed.' <a href=/people/1028 target=_blank>Sopater</a> in <a href=/people/1394 target=_blank>Bacchis</a>: 'He sounded the strain from the single-pipe.' <a href=/people/5933 target=_blank>Protagorides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404279UCyz class=person long=27.8878 lat=40.3895>Cyzicus</a>, in the second book of his work On the Games at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361361UDap class=place long=36.1442 lat=36.13>Daphne</a>, says: 'He has laid fingers to every instrument, one after the other — castanets, tambourine, pandura, and on the sweet single-pipe he hums again the sweetest scales.' And <a href=/people/645 target=_blank>Poseidonius</a>, the philosopher of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BSPo class=place long=23.72265 lat=37.97635>Stoa</a>, narrating the story of the war between the Apameans and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396224PLar class=ethnic long=22.421 lat=39.6349>Larisaeans</a>, in the third book of his Histories writes the following: 'They grasped daggers and small lances covered with rust and dirt; they put on hats with visors, which afforded shade, but did not prevent breathing at the throat; they carried with them drinking-horns full of wine and food of every variety, and beside these lay small flutes and single-pipes, implements of revel, not of battle.' (But I am not ignorant that <a href=/people/2987 target=_blank>Amerias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=person long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedon</a> in his Dialect Dictionary says that the single-pipe is called 'tityrine.') So now you have, good <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, the authority for the word photinx; and that the 'single-piper' was what is today called 'reed-piper' is plainly attested by what <a href=/people/3183 target=_blank>Hedylus</a> says in the following lines of epigrammatic verse: 'Beneath this mound <a href=/people/950 target=_blank>Theon</a> dwells, he of the single-pipe, the sweet flute-player, the charmer who accompanied the mimes on the stage. When blind with age he had even a son, <a href=/people/8283 target=_blank>Scirpalus</a>, whom when a babe he called <a href=/people/8283 target=_blank>Scirpalus</a>, son of Ready-hand, as he sang at his nativity; for he bore this name to signify the skill of his hands. So piped he the drunken bagatelles of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> sung by <a href=/people/1610 target=_blank>Glauce</a>, or the tune of the Stutterer who delights in the drinking of unmixed wine, or of Cotalus or Pacalus. Nay, then, of <a href=/people/950 target=_blank>Theon</a> the reed-piper say, Farewell, <a href=/people/950 target=_blank>Theon</a>!' Precisely, then, as they call persons who play on a reed-pipe (calamus) calamaulae, so do they call those who play on the rappa, which is also a reed, rappaulae, as <a href=/people/2987 target=_blank>Amerias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=person long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedon</a> tells us in his Dialect Dictionary.

And these are not all; for the pipes called 'elymi,' which are mentioned by <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> in <a href=/people/479 target=_blank>Niobe</a> and in The Tambourine-Players, are none other, as we hear, than the '<a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a>' pipes with which also the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> are well acquainted.

These are shorter than the 'complete' pipes. <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a>, at any rate, in a figure of speech says in <a href=/people/729 target=_blank>Ixion</a>: 'The half-holed' (that is, the smaller) 'is easily engulfed by the great.' They are the same as those called 'child' pipes, which are not adapted to the public games, but are used at dinner-parties; that is why <a href=/people/543 target=_blank>Anacreon</a> calls them 'tender.' I know of other kinds of pipes as well — the 'tragic,' the pipes used by women impersonating men, and the pipes used for accompanying a harp, which are mentioned by <a href=/people/225 target=_blank>Ephorus</a> in Inventions and <a href=/people/1424 target=_blank>Euphranor</a> the <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagorean</a> in his book On Pipes, and again <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> also . . . in his own work On Pipes.

For to adopt the words of the noble <a href=/people/484 target=_blank>Agathon</a>, Thus do we render our avocation a vocation, but contrive to make our vocation an avocation. Be that as it may, the poet, speaking of <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, says: him they found giving a marriage-feast to many kinsmen in his hall for his son and his blameless daughter; since it is the established custom to hold symposia in connexion with the wedding ceremony, partly to honour the gods of marriage, and partly to serve as a kind of public witness to the union. As for the symposium which is tendered to strangers, the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=place long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycia</a> teaches what the nature of it will be when he gives munificent welcome to <a href=/people/807 target=_blank>Bellerophon</a>: Nine days he received him as his guest, and nine <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> did he butcher. For wine seems to possess a power which draws to friendship, by lightly warming and fusing the soul. Hence they did not even ask their guests too soon who they were, but postponed that until later, as though they honored the mere act of hospitality, and not the individual and personal in us.

Anyway, there are in the city meetings of many philosophic sects — Diogenists, Antipatrists, so-called, and Panaetiasts. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> even bequeathed money for a meeting of this character, not — Heaven forbid! — that they should indulge in intemperance when they came together, but that they might carry out with decency and refinement the practices which accord with the idea of the symposium. And every day the presiding magistrates used to assemble parties for the dinner which were decent and salutary for the state. At any rate, it was to a symposium of this kind, <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> says, that report came of the capture of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386228PEla class=place long=22.783 lat=38.646>Elateia</a>: For it was evening, and someone came to the prytanes with the report that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386228PEla class=place long=22.783 lat=38.646>Elateia</a> had been captured. And the philosophers also made it their business to gather young men together and dine in their company with due regard to some fixed standard. At any rate, there were Symposium Laws by <a href=/people/365 target=_blank>Xenocrates</a> of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAca class=place long=23.707 lat=37.992>Academy</a>, and again by <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>. The messes at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>, and the men's halls among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=ethnic long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretans</a>, are conducted by the States with all possible care. Wherefore someone has said, not badly: Friendly comrades should not abstain too long from the symposium; for that is the most delightful way to remember each other. The philosopher <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> once held a symposium at which he required all who came to discuss some disputed question of the sophists. — He says that <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> was invited to a symposium, and having been assigned to a couch with a person who ate voraciously, he was unable to enjoy anything himself; and when one of the company handed food across to him, he said, Thanks to you, sir; but to <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephus</a> — what I have in mind! It so happened that the man who ate so greedily was named <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephus</a>. — And <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>, when one of the gourmands in his company snatched away the upper part of the fish at the very moment when it was set before them, with a sudden twist snatched it away again himself, while he accompanied the action with the quotation: But <a href=/people/311 target=_blank>Ino</a>, for her part, finished the work on the other side. And <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, seeing a man helping himself immoderately to the relish, said, Fellow-guests, who is it among you that treats bread like a relish, but a relish like bread? We will now talk about the Homeric symposia. In these, namely, the poet distinguishes times, persons, and occasions. This feature <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> and <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> rightly copied, for at the beginning of their treatises they explain the occasion of the symposium, and who are present. But <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> specifies no place, no time; he has no introduction whatever. One has to guess, therefore, how it comes about that a man with cup in hand suddenly propounds questions as though he were discoursing before a class. (<a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says that it is unseemly to arrive at a symposium unbathed and covered with dust.) Then, too, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> clearly teaches who are to be invited, showing that it is our duty to bid the best men and those who are held in esteem, when he says: And he summoned the old men, the noble lords of all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a>. This is not the way which <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> prescribes; for he requires that we invite our neighbors too: Above all summon him who dwells nigh thee. But really this is the kind of symposium appropriate to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=demonym long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotian</a> insensibility, and chimes well with that most man-hating of the proverbs, </p>                        </div>

For must it not be absurd that friendship should be determined by position and not by disposition? Well, as I was saying, in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, after the drinking For them the old man, the very first of all, began to weave his counsel; whereas among those who do not conduct symposia discreetly, For them the flatterer, the very first of all, began to weave his mockery. And further, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> introduces guests who differ in their ages and views of life — <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>, <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>, <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> — all of whom, speaking generally, strive after excellence, but have set out in specifically diverse paths to find it. <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, on the other hand, introduced none but prophets of atoms, although he had before him these as his models, I mean, the variety of symposia in the Poet, and the charm of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> and <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> as well. Of the last Twelve Tables <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> introduced as disputants the physician <a href=/people/1557 target=_blank>Eryximachus</a>, then the poet <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>, then, one after another, men who followed different professions in life; <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, for his part, also interspersed some who followed no profession. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, therefore, has done much better in that he sets before us different symposia; for every symposium can be better understood by comparison and contrary with others. For example, in the case of the suitors we find in him the kind of symposium which would take place when lusty young men are given over to carousals and love affairs; while in the case of the <a href=/people/629 target=_blank>Phaeacians</a>, we have something more sedate than that of these young men, and yet full of delight. To this again, he has placed in contrast the symposia which belong to army life, over against those which were conducted more after the manner of civil life, in a sober way. Still again, by contrast, he has distinguished those which have the character of a public feature, from those which represent a gathering of intimate friends. But <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> has portrayed solely a symposium of philosophers. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> has also taught us who need not be invited, but may come of their own accord, by the example of one relative fittingly pointing out the presence of others similarly connected: Of his own accord came to him <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, good at the cry. For it is plain that neither a brother, nor parents, nor wife need be invited, nor anyone else whom one holds in equal esteem with these; otherwise it would be cold and unfriendly. And yet some authorities have added a verse which further explains the reason: For he knew in his heart that his brother was troubled — as though it were necessary to tell the reason why a brother might come to dinner of his own accord, when the reason which we now give is the probable one. Can he, for example, assert that <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> did not know that his brother was giving a feast? Would that not be ridiculous, when the slaughtering of the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> was in plain singular and known to all? Why then would he have come if he had not known that? Or does he mean — of all things under Heaven! — that <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, knowing that his brother was distracted, excused the omission of the invitation, and, adapting himself to the circumstances, came of his own accord? That would be as if he meant that he had come, though uninvited, in order that they might not look at each other the next morning with suspicion, the one with shame, the other with reproach! On the contrary, it would have been absurd that <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> should forget his brother, especially when it was for his sake that he was at the moment offering sacrifice, and had assumed the conduct of the war as well, and moreover had invited those who were not related to him by birth nor associated with his country. <a href=/people/4883 target=_blank>Athenocles</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404279UCyz class=person long=27.8878 lat=40.3895>Cyzicus</a>, with a better understanding of the Homeric poetry than <a href=/people/340 target=_blank>Aristarchus</a>, explains to us with greater refinement that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> passed <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> over without mention because he was more closely related in kinship to <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>. </p>                        </div>

For, says he, I think that every man of refinement has someone, either relative or friend, to whom he can go when a feast is on without waiting for an invitation. And <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, in The Symposium, has this to say on the same subject: That we, he says, may, by an alteration, render null and void the proverb to the effect that 'good men go of their own accord to the feast of good men.' For <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, indeed, may not only have rendered it null and void, but actually outraged it; for he represented <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> as brave in matters of war, but <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> as a slack warrior; yet, when <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> was holding a sacrificial feast, he represented the inferior man as going uninvited to the dinner of the better man. <a href=/people/1587 target=_blank>Bacchylides</a>, telling of how <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> went to the house of <a href=/people/1409 target=_blank>Ceyx</a>, says: He halted at the stone threshold, and they were making ready a feast, and thus spake he: 'Of their own accord just mean approach the feasts, heaped high, of good men.' Now of the proverbs, one says, Of their own accord brave men go to the feasts of brave men, the other, of their own accord brave men go to the feasts of cowards. But it is without a warrant, at any rate, that <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> thought <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> a coward, since <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> calls him dear to <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>, and says that he was the only one who performed feats of valor in behalf of <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a>, and above all others was eager to fight in single combat against <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>, although he was inferior to him in physical strength. And of all who were in the army he was the only one of whom the poet said: And among them he himself moved, confident in his zeal. Now if his enemy, who reviled him, called him a slack warrior, and <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> on that account assumes that he was really slack, he could not be too quick in ranking <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> also among the poltroons (although <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> himself says that he was brave), seeing that this verse is said of <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>: Heavy with wine, with the eyes of a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> and the heart of a deer. The truth is that if a thing is said in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, it is not always <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> who says it. How, in fact, could <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> be a coward — he the only one to keep <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a> away from the body of <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a>, killing <a href=/people/1131 target=_blank>Euphorbus</a> and spoiling him of his arms in the very midst of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a>? That <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> has not even given thorough attention to the verse which he reprehended is a curious fact; in it <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> is called good at the cry. For <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> habitually uses this epithet of the bravest, since the ancients called the battle a cry. Being exact in all matters, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> has not omitted this small detail — the necessity of caring for the body and bathing before going to dinner. In the case of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, at any rate, he says, just before the feast among the <a href=/people/629 target=_blank>Phaeacians</a>: Straightway the housekeeper bade him bathe. And of the men in the retinue of <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a>: Then went they to the well-polished tubs and bathed. For it was unseemly, says <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, to arrive at the symposium covered with sweat and dust. For the man of refinement must not be slovenly, or dirty, or have pleasure in filth, according to <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heraclitus</a>. Also, the one who arrives first at another's house for dinner must not rush forthwith to the symposium to fill his belly, but he should previously accord something to the aesthetic sense, and take notice of the host's house. In fact, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> has not omitted this point either: They themselves went into the wondrous house; and they, having gazed upon it, admired exceedingly the hall of the king fostered by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, for it was as the shining of the sun or the moon in the high-roofed hall of glorious <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>. And <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>, in the Wasps, shows the harsh and litigious old man in process of being converted to a gentle mode of life by his son: Cease! But come now, this way; lay yourself down and learn also how to be a man of conviviality and sociability. And after instructing him how he is to recline he says: Now, speak approvingly of one of the vessels, gaze at the ceiling, admire the tapestries in the court. Again, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> tells us what we are to do before we beg to eat, namely, we are to offer as first-fruits some of the food to the gods. At any rate, the men in the company of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, even when they were in the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a>'s cave: 'Therefore (they say) we lighted a fire and offered sacrifice, and then we took ourselves and ate of the cheeses. And <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, although the envoys had come in haste in the mid-watches of the night, none the less bade <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a>, his companion, to offer sacrifice to the gods; and he lad first-offerings on the fire. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> also shows us the feasters at least offering libations: Young men filled the mixing-bowls to the brim with wine, and then measured it out to all, after they had poured the drink-offering into the cups. Then, when they had made libation. . . . All of which <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> also retains in his symposium. For after the eating was over, he says that they offered libation and thanksgiving to the god with the customary honors. Similarly also <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>. But with <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> there is no libation, no preliminary offering to the gods; on the contrary, it is like what <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> says of the lawless woman: Oft times she eats up the offerings before they are consecrated. As to the proper mixing of wine, they say indeed that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> were taught this by their king <a href=/people/1385 target=_blank>Amphictyon</a>, and for that reason they founded a shrine to upright <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>. For the god of wine is really upright and does not totter when he is drunk in just proportions and diluted. For wine is silly in its commands; it impels even the very prudent to sing much, and rouses him even to laugh effeminately and to dance, and inspires a word which were better unspoken. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> indeed does not call wine silly in the sense of foolish and causing foolish actions; he does not even bid us be of gloomy countenance, refusing to sing or laugh, or on occasion even indulging in proper measure in the dance. No, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> is not so boorish or stiff; on the contrary, he understood the nice differences of quantity and quality in all of these actions. Hence he did not say that wine makes the very prudent sing, but he says that it makes him sing much, </p>                        </div>

The school of <a href=/people/340 target=_blank>Aristarchus</a>, not understanding this in the case of the wedding-feast, and not observing that the entertainment was continuous, the principal days — those on which the bride had been taken home by the groom — having already passed; nor observing that the wedding of <a href=/people/2076 target=_blank>Megapenthes</a> was already over, and that <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> and <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> were eating quite alone; the understanding this, I say, but being misled by the first verse, Him they found giving a marriage feast to many of his kinsmen, they have added the following verses: Thus did they feast in the large high-roofed hall, neighbors and kinsmen of glorious <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, making merry; and among them the divine minstrel sang as he played the lyre, and two tumblers, leaders of the dance, whirled about by themselves in the midst of them. These verses they have taken over from The Making of the Arms, along with the very selfsame mistake in the use of words. For it was not the tumblers who were leaders of the dance, but they surely danced with the minstrel as leader. For leading properly belongs to the lyre. Hence <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> says in The Shield: And the goddesses, the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402225RPie class=person long=22.5 lat=40.2>Pieria</a>, led the song. And <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a>: I myself am leader in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=demonym long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbian</a> paean to the accompaniment of the flute. <a href=/people/695 target=_blank>Stesichorus</a> calls the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> leader of song, while <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> calls preludes leaders of the choral bands. <a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a>, of the school of <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>, deleted the entire passage about the wedding, thinking that only the opening days of it were meant, and taking no account of the concluding portion of the festival or, again, of the aftermath of the party. Consequently <a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a> wishes to write: Two tumblers among themselves  (with the rough breathing), thus forcing a solecism. For <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s phrase means, they whirled about by themselves, i.e. separately, but to use the form heautous for that is a solecism. As I was saying, however, the introduction of special entertainments into this sober kind of symposium is an intrusion which has made its way over from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> chorus, about which the poet says, </p>                        </div>

The so-called 'Laconists,' says <a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaeus</a>, sang in rectangular choruses.

Consequently it becomes impossible to emend leaders, since it is no longer possible to keep the reference to the minstrel. That it is not likely that there was any such entertainment in the house of <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> is plain from the fact that the entire symposium is carried on by conversation held among the guests themselves; there is no mention whatever of the name of the minstrel, nor even of the song which he sang; nor do <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a> and his followers pay any attention to him, but rather, as if in a silence and quietness, observe the room; and yet it is not at least unlikely that the sons of the wisest men, <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> and <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>, should be represented in the scene as boorish men, paying no attention, in the manner of rustics, to the entertainments provided for them? <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, at any rate, is attentive to the song-massacres of the <a href=/people/629 target=_blank>Phaeacians</a>: But <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> gazed at the twinkling of their feet, and marveled in his soul, although he had many things to distract him, and could say: Cares there are in my heart, more than songs.

Again, <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> in his symposium puts questions about indigestion in order to get omens from it; following that he asks about fevers. What need is there even to speak of the lack of proportion which pervades his style? As for <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> — I pass over the man who was bothered by the hiccups and cured by gargles of water and still more by the insertion of a straw to tickle his nose and make him sneeze; for he wanted to introduce fun and mockery — <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, I say, ridicules <a href=/people/484 target=_blank>Agathon</a>'s balanced clauses and antitheses, and also brings on the scene <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a>, who avows that he is consumed with lust. Nevertheless, while writing that kind of stuff, they banish <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> from their states! But, as <a href=/people/850 target=_blank>Demochares</a> used to say, you cannot make a lance-head out of savoury, nor a good man of such talk. <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> ridicules not only <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a> but also <a href=/people/1821 target=_blank>Charmides</a> and <a href=/people/329 target=_blank>Euthydemus</a> and many other young men. This is the characteristic of one who satirizes the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, the <a href=/people/2058 target=_blank>Museum</a> of Hellas, which <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> called the prop of Hellas, and which <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a>, in the epigram on <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, called the Hellas of Hellas, while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> god proclaimed it the hearth and town-hall of the Hellenes. The reason why he has traduced the young men may be seen in <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> himself. In the case of <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a>, he says in the dialogue named from him that he did not begin to have converse with <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> until he had passed out of his early bloom, when all who lusted for his body had deserted him. He tells us this at the beginning of the dialogue. The contradictory things which he says in the case of <a href=/people/1821 target=_blank>Charmides</a> may be learned from the dialogue itself by anyone who wishes. For he represents him inconsistently as sometimes in a state of vertigo and intoxication for love of the lad, and beside himself, and as a fawn cowering before the strength of a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>; and then again he declares that he takes no thought of the lad's beauty. Nevertheless, even the symposium described by <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, although it is praised, admits occasions for censure not fewer than these. <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a>, for example, gets the symposium together when his favorite <a href=/people/1000 target=_blank>Autolycus</a> had been crowned victor in the pancratium at the <a href=/people/11002 target=_blank>Panathenaea</a>. </p>                        </div>

For just as when a blaze of light, appearing at night, attracts the eyes of all, so also the beauty of <a href=/people/1000 target=_blank>Autolycus</a> draws the gaze of all to itself. And so there was no ne present whose soul was not somehow affected by the lad; some, to be sure, lapsed into greater silence, but others began to assume different poses. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, on the other hand, has not undertaken to tell us anything of this sort even though he has <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> before him, of whose beauty one of those who sat opposite her uttered words like these, forced from him by the truth: B 'Tis no cause for anger that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> and well-greaved <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a> should suffer woes a long time for such a woman as she; for she is marvelously like the deathless goddesses in countenance. Yet later he says: But even so, such though she be, let her go home in the ships. And then there are the young lads who pay a visit to <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>'s son and <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a>; plied with wine, attending a wedding symposium, they hold their peace in the presence of <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>, as is proper, struck completely dumb before her famous beauty. But <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>! Why did he tolerate the flute-girls, the boy dancing and playing the lyre, and even the woman who indecently turns somersaults, and then decline the perfume? Nobody, indeed, could have borne his use of it without laughter if he had in mind these verses: Those pale-faced men, those unshod beggars, you mean, of whom <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, poor devil, is one, and <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a>. But what follows this is also inconsistent with the strictness of his life. That is to say, <a href=/people/1472 target=_blank>Critobulus</a>, a witty lad, pokes fun at <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, who is an elderly man and his teacher, saying that he is much uglier than the <a href=/people/344 target=_blank>Sileni</a>. <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> then matches his beauty, point by point, with that of <a href=/people/1472 target=_blank>Critobulus</a> and having chosen as judges the boy and the dancing-girl, proposes as prizes for the winner the kisses of the judges. What young man, I ask, who comes upon this passage, will not be corrupted rather than stimulated to goodness? In <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s account of the symposium of <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, on the other hand, they propound to each other questions as though they were in a company of learned men, and by civilized conversation they delight one another, and us as well. <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, for example, when <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a> and his associates have returned from the bath and the Accompaniments of the meal have been placed before them, invites them to take their share in these words: Help yourselves to the food and enjoy yourselves; later, when we have ceased from our dinner, we will ask who ye twain are. Thereupon, as a special mark of kindness, he gave them in addition some of the food that had been placed before himself: Thus spake he, and took in his hands and placed before them the fat roasted chine of an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>, which they had set before him as his special portion. And after eating in silence, as becomes young men, they talk quietly with one another with heads bent together, not on the subject of food, he says, nor even about their host's maidservants, by whom they had been bathed, but rather about the rich possessions of him who had given them welcome: Such verily, are the rich possessions that are stored in the house of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. For in this way, <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> says, the verse is better written.

For it is not merely the beauty of the house that they admire; how, for example, could there have been amber and silver and ivory on the walls? On the contrary, while they do comment on the house, saying that it has resounding halls (such, of course, are halls which are high-roofed and spacious), it is about the vessels they speak in the line, of gold and amber, yea, and silver and ivory; after which comes naturally, Such, verily, are the rich possessions that are stored in the house of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, so countless many are these; wonder holds me as I look upon them.

Further, the word court-yard (aule) does not even accord with the house. For the word used is of a place across which the air blows, and we speak of letting a draught through, of a place which receives air from sides. Again there is the instrument called aulos, because the air goes through it, and any foregoing prolonged in a straight line we call aulos, like a stadium, or a gush of blood: Forthwith a thick gush came from his nostrils; or of the helmet when it extends straight up from the middle we say that it is tube-like. At <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> there are certain sacred hollows (aulones), as they are called, which <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philochorus</a> mentions in the ninth book. The noun meaning hollows is masculine, as in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, Book IV, and all the historians who write in prose; but in the poets it is feminine. <a href=/people/1658 target=_blank>Carcinus</a>, in <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>: Into a deep hollow which surrounded the army. And <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> in The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>: Crags and caves and hollows by the shore. We must therefore take the word as feminine also in <a href=/people/132 target=_blank>Eratosthenes</a>' <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, where we have A deep hollow runs through it, bathys being for batheia, precisely like 'thelys eerse', fresh dew. Everything, then, of this nature is said to be an aule (court-yard) or an aulon (hollow). But in the present instance, in speaking of the king's palace they say aulae (courts), as <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> does: To worship courts and nabobs. And <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>: To worship courts, as it seems to me, stamps one as an exile or a starveling or a rogue from the whipping-post. That is, they are called courts because the open spaces in front of the house are large, or because the king's bodyguard bivouac and lie beside the palace. But <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> always uses court (αυλή, singular) of the open spaces, where the altar of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> <a href=/people/3608 target=_blank>Herkeios</a> was placed. <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a>, at least, is found in the feeding-place of the court; and he held a gold goblet as he poured a libation of sparkling wine upon the blazing victims.

For <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> does not propound it as a question for debate, but with charming insinuation, after he has listened to their praises, he at first does not deny that he is rich; but then, divesting his words of any invidiousness, he says that he holds his possessions after undergoing many sufferings. Nevertheless he does not presume to compare himself with the gods: For his (<a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>'s) halls and rich possessions are deathless. And after displaying his character, as one who loved his brother, and avowing that it was through fate that he was still alive and enjoying his wealth, he had, by way of contrast, introduced this word of loving friendship: Would that I dwelt in my halls with but a third portion of this wealth, and that the heroes were safe and sound who perished at that time in wide <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399263RTro class=place long=26.27 lat=39.915>Troy-land</a>, far from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>, the pasture-ground of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. Who, therefore, among the descendants of those who had died for such a man as that, would not regard the grief which they felt for their father's loss as recompensed by this grateful mention of their father? But in order that it might not seem that he cherished the same feeling for all those who had alike displayed good will towards him, he added: For all these men I mourn not so much, grieved though I am, as I mourn for him, the one who causes sleep and food to be loathsome to me. And that it may not appear that he forgets anyone related to him he has mentioned them by nickname: For him then, I ween, grieve the aged <a href=/people/520 target=_blank>Laertes</a>, and prudent <a href=/people/264 target=_blank>Penelope</a>, and <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a>, whom he left a new-born child in his house. When <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a> burst into tears at the mention, <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> notices him and at that moment . . . with the entrance of <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>; and she guessed who <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a> was from family likeness. For women, because of their habit of keeping an eye on each other's honour, are very keen at detecting the points of resemblance which children have with their parents. There follows a speech interjected by <a href=/people/10593 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a>, since he must not be in the scene as a mere bodyguard, and after he has talked becomingly about <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a>'s modesty, once more <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> makes mention of his love for <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, saying that of all things he would have liked most to grow old in company with <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> alone. Naturally they weep; but <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>, being a daughter of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, and having learned many counsels from the wise men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, puts into the wine a drug which is veritably all-healing, and begins a narrative of her experiences with <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> while her case is engaged in spinning, a pursuit which she followed not for pleasure, but because she had formed the habit at home. </p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>'s industry is made plain by no mere incident in these lines also: For her also, at the same time, Adraste set a well-wrought stool; and <a href=/people/3295 target=_blank>Alcippe</a> brought a rug of soft wool, <a href=/people/6817 target=_blank>Phylo</a> brought a silver wool-basket, which Alcandre, wife of <a href=/people/1145 target=_blank>Polybus</a>, had given her. This, then, her handmaid <a href=/people/6817 target=_blank>Phylo</a> brought and placed beside her, overflowing with carded fibers; and in the lay her distaff, holding the violet-dark wool. And it is also likely that she herself was aware of her own skill in handiwork. At any rate, when she presents <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a> with a robe she says: This present even I, dear child, offer you, as a memorial of <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>'s handiwork, against the season of your longed-for marriage, and for your wife to wear. And this industry reveals the discreetness of her character; for she is not represented as a woman who exults and gives herself airs because of her beauty. She is discovered, at any rate, weaving at the loom and working in many designs: Her he found in the hall; and she was weaving, at a tall loom, a glistening mantle of double folds; and many contests she patterned therein, of horse-taming <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> and bronze-coated <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a>, which they were encountering for her sake at the hands of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> teaches us, too, that guests who have been invited to a banquet should request permission of their hosts to rise and depart. <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a> says to <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>: But come, direct us now to our beds, that we may forthwith lie down and delight ourselves in sweet sleep. And <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, who pretends to be <a href=/people/1294 target=_blank>Mentor</a>, says to <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>: But come, cut out the tongues, and let the wine be mixed, that we may pour libations to <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> and the other immortals and bethink us of rest; for it is the season for it. At the festivals of the gods it is held to be not even pious to remain too long.

Among <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, also, every kind of symposium was conducted with moderation in ancient times, as Apollonia, who has written on this subject, says. For they sat as they dined, making use of the simplest and most healthful food, and drinking only so much wine as would be sufficient to promote good cheer, which <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> prays <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> to send: What shall I do that I may be dear in thy eyes, though of the mighty thunder, son of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronus</a> — dear to the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, too, and marked by the spirit of good cheer — for this I pray thee. </p>                        </div>

For <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> does not even want to leave the symposium, though <a href=/people/1557 target=_blank>Eryximachus</a> and <a href=/people/473 target=_blank>Phaedrus</a> and some others have already gone, but stays awake with <a href=/people/484 target=_blank>Agathon</a> and <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> and drinks out of a silver well — for someone has appropriately given this name to the larger cups — and he also drinks out of a shallow cup, in a round from left to right. He says further that after this the other two began to doze, but <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> fell asleep first, while <a href=/people/484 target=_blank>Agathon</a> did not drop off until daylight began to show; and then <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> put them to bed, and rising up departed to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BLyk class=place long=23.7433 lat=37.974>Lyceum</a>, although, as <a href=/people/2522 target=_blank>Herodicus</a> says, he might better have gone to <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s <a href=/people/10942 target=_blank>Laestrygones</a>, where a sleepless man could have earned double wages. Every gathering among the ancients to celebrate a symposium acknowledged the god as the occasion for it, and made use of chaplets appropriate to the gods as well as hymns and songs. And there was no slave to serve them, but young men, sons of free men, were the cup-bearers, as for example the son of <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, who was cup-bearer, even though he was bridegroom, at the very wedding-feast itself. And in the fair <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a> even <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> is cup-bearer to the gods. In fact, free-born men made ready all other things needful for the diners, and those who had dined separated when it was daylight. In some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> symposia there also occurred debates, as in <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>'s during the campaign. The symposium of <a href=/people/10603 target=_blank>Alcinous</a>, to which the speech of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> refers: I say, for my part, that there is no issue more delightful than when good cheer possesses the whole house, and feasters in the halls learn to the minstrel, admits the welcome to a stranger, since the <a href=/people/629 target=_blank>Phaeacians</a> were of themselves lovers of luxury. If now, one compares it with the symposia of the philosophers, he will find it more decorous, though it includes mirth and joking, but in good taste. For after the gymnastic contest the minstrel sings of the amours of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>, a story full of satire, while it gives hints to <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> for the slaughter of the suitors, in that even the Lame-footed could overcome in a contest the most valiant <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>. The men of those days also sat when they dined. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, at any rate, says in many places, They sat them down in order, upon chairs and thrones. Now the throne, taken by itself alone, is the chair of a man of high birth; it has a footstool, which they called threnys, and they formed the word throne from the verb thro, which they use of sitting down, as <a href=/people/5182 target=_blank>Philitas</a>: To sit (thran) beneath the lush plane-tree. The chair (klismos), on the other hand, is provided more sumptuously with an inclined back. Poorer than either of these was the stool (diphros); in the case of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, anyway, coming in the guise of a beggar, the poet says that <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a> placed before him a mean stool and a small table. Their mixing-bowls, as indeed the name implies, stood before them filled with diluted wine; from these the young men who served offered the drinking-cup, while in the case of the most highly honored was always full; while to the others they distributed the wine in equal portions. <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, at any rate, says to <a href=/people/291 target=_blank>Idomeneus</a>: </p>                        </div>

They toasted one another not as we do — for our method in a toast is to drain to the dregs — but with the cup full: And filling the cup with wine he pledged <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>. How many times a day they took meals has already been explained; we said that there were three (and not four), because the same meal is sometimes called luncheon, sometimes dinner. Those who assert that they took four meals merely because the poet said: come you now after taking the afternoon meal are absurd; they do not observe that he means after waiting through the afternoon. Nevertheless, nobody will ever point to an instance in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> where anyone takes food three times in the day. Many indeed are mistaken when they place the following verses in sequence in the poet's text: The grave housekeeper brought food and set it beside them, adding many viands which she lavished from her store. And the carver lifted and set beside them platters of meat. Now if the housekeeper set viands before them, it is plain that they must have been chance bits of meat left over, and there would be no need to introduce a carver. Hence the two verses are sufficient alone. When the diners had departed the tables were carried away, as in the case of the suitors and the <a href=/people/629 target=_blank>Phaeacians</a>, of whom the poet says: And the handmaids cleared away the implements (entea) of the feast, meaning the vessels. For all implements which afford a covering, like breastplates, greaves, and things similar to them, they call entea, being as it were vessels to hold inside them the corresponding parts of the body. The larger rooms in the dwellings of the heroes <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> calls megara, also domata (buildings) and klisiae (huts); but men of today call them guest-rooms and men's halls. (193C) What, then, dear friends, shall we call the symposium which was given by <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, surnamed <a href=/people/1219 target=_blank>Epiphanes</a> (Illustrious), but because of his acts renamed <a href=/people/5634 target=_blank>Epimanes</a> (Insane)? He was king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, and one of the <a href=/people/3690 target=_blank>Seleucidae</a>. Concerning him <a href=/people/160 target=_blank>Polybius</a> says this: He would sometimes slip out of the palace without the knowledge of his attendants, and would appear wandering about in some quarter of the city with one or two companions; usually he was found near the shops of the silversmiths and goldsmiths talking glibly, and airing his views on art before the workmen engaged in making reliefs as well as before other artisans. Then he would condescend to men of the common people and converse with anybody, no matter whom, and he used to drink with travelers of the meanest sort who came to town. Whenever he learned that any young men were feasting together, he would appear without any announcement to join in the revel with hornpipe and symphony; the result was that most of the party got up and fled at the unexpected apparition. And often he would lay aside his royal robes, and putting on a toga he would walk up and down the market-place as though he were canvassing for votes; with some he shook hands, while others he embraced and invited to cast their vote for him, sometimes for the office of aedile, sometimes for that of tribune of the people. And having won the office, he would seat himself on the ivory chair, according to the Roman custom; he would hear quotes involving contracts in the market, and would give decisions with great earnestness and zeal. As a result he would reduce decent men to perplexity; for some supposed that he was just an artless person, while others thought him mad. And he was like that also in giving presents; </p>                        </div>

On occasion, also, meeting persons whom he had never seen, he would give them unexpected presents. In benefactions to cities and in honors paid to the gods he outdid all who had ever been kings before him. One might draw this conclusion merely from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SOly class=place long=23.7337 lat=37.9694>Olympieium</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> and the statues round the altar in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a>. He used also to bathe in the public baths when the baths were crowded with common people, having jars of the most costly scented oils brought in for his use. On one occasion a man said to him, Happy are you kings, who can use these perfumes and smell so sweet! Without answering the fellow he came in next day where the man was bathing, and caused a very large jar of most costly scented oil, the kind which is called stacta, to be poured over the man's head; the result was that all, after standing up, rolled about bathed in the oil, and roused laughter by sprawling on the slippery floor, as even the king himself did. This same king, hearing about the games instituted in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> by <a href=/people/116 target=_blank>Aemilius</a> <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a>, the Roman general, and wishing to outdo <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> in magnificence, dispatched envoys and delegates to the city to proclaim the games which were to be given by him near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361361UDap class=place long=36.1442 lat=36.13>Daphne</a>; hence great interest arose on the part of the Greeks in meeting him. As a beginning to the meeting he got up a parade which was carried out in the following manner. It was led by certain men in the prime of their youth, five thousand in number, who wore Roman armor of chain-mail; after them came five thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=ethnic long=28 lat=40>Mysians</a>; close to these were three thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=ethnic long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicians</a> equipped in the fashion of light-armed troops, and wearing gold crowns. After these came three thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> and five thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a>. These were followed by twenty thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, ten thousand of them with gold shields, five thousand with bronze shields, and the rest with silver shields; close upon these came two hundred and forty pairs of gladiators. Behind them were one thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380582UNis class=demonym long=58.21 lat=37.9511>Nisaean</a> horsemen and three thousand citizen soldiers, of whom the majority wore gold cheek-coverings and gold crowns, the rest had cheek-coverings of silver. After them came the so-called mounted companions; there were about a thousand of these, all with gold cheek-pieces. Next to these was the division made up of his friends, equal in numbers and in beauty of equipment. After them were a thousand picked men, followed by the so-called <a href=/people/7182 target=_blank>Agema</a> (Guard), which has the reputation of being the best organization of horsemen, numbering about a thousand. Last of all was the armored cavalry, both <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and men being completely covered with armor in accordance with their name. And all these mentioned wore purple cloaks, many also cloaks woven with gold and embroidered with figures. After them were a hundred chariots drawn by six <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and forty drawn by four <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>; next a chariot drawn by four elephants, and another by a pair of elephants; </p>                        </div>

It would be difficult to pursue the description of the rest of the procession, and it must be described summarily. Young men who had just come of age, to the number of eight hundred, and wearing gold crowns, marched in the line; fatted <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, about one thousand; sacrificial tables, little short of three hundred; elephants' tusks, eight hundred. It is not possible to enumerate the quantity of sacred images; for statues of all beings who are said or held to be gods, demigods or even heroes among mankind were borne along, some gilded, others draped in garments of gold thread. And beside all of them lay the sacred myths pertaining to each, according to the traditional accounts, in sumptuous editions. They were followed by representations of <a href=/people/12253 target=_blank>Night</a> and Day, <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> and Heaven, and <a href=/people/683 target=_blank>Dawn</a> and Noon. One might guess how great was the number of gold and silver vessels in the following way: of only one of the king's friends, the secretary <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, one thousand slaves marched in the procession carrying silver vessels, none of which weighed less than a thousand drachms. Then came six hundred royal slaves with gold vessels. After them nearly two hundred women sprinkled scented oil from gold pitchers. Close upon these in the procession were eighty women seated in litters having gold supports, and five hundred in litters with silver supports, all richly dressed. These were the most conspicuous features of the parade. The games, gladiatorial contests, and hunts took thirty days to conclude; during the first five days in which spectacles were carried out, all persons in the gymnasium anointed themselves with saffron oil from golden basins; these numbered fifteen, and there was an equal number of bowls with oil of cinnamon and nard. Similarly there were brought in, on the succeeding days, oil of fenugreek, marjoram, and orris, all of them rare in their fragrance. For a banquet on one occasion there were spread a thousand triclinia, on another fifteen hundred, with the most extravagant deckings. The management of these matters was undertaken by the king himself. Riding on a poor <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, he ran up and down the procession, commanding one division to advance, another to halt. At the symposia he stood at the entrance introducing some, assigning couches to others, and he himself brought in the servants who carried in the dishes served. And going round he would seat himself in one place, or throw himself down in another. At one moment he would throw aside a morsel or a cup just as he had put them to his lips, and jumping up suddenly, he would change his place or walk round among the drinkers, receiving toasts standing sometimes by one, sometimes by another, at the same time laughing at the entertainments. When the party had been going on a long time and many had already withdrawn, the king was brought in by the mime-performers entirely wrapped up, and deposited on the ground as though he were one of the performers. When the symphony sounded the challenge, he would leap up and dance naked and act with the clowns, so that everyone departed in shame.

Masurius then added an account of the procession which was arranged in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> by the most excellent king <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> <a href=/people/814 target=_blank>Philadelphius</a>; this is recorded by <a href=/people/2845 target=_blank>Callixeinus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=person long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a> in the fourth book of his work on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>. He says: Before I begin I will describe the pavilion which was set up inside the enclosure of the citadel, at a distance from the place where the soldiers, artisans, and tourists were entertained. For it proved to be extraordinarily beautiful and well worth hearing about. As for its size, it could hold one hundred and thirty couches in a circle, and its decoration was as follows. Wooden columns were set up at regular intervals, five on each long side, rising fifty cubits in height, but four on each of the other sides; upon these was fitted a square epistyle which held up the entire roof sheltering the symposium. This roof was draped with a circular canopy in scarlet edged with white, covering the middle of it; while on either side it had beams concealed by tapestries with white stripes draped voluminously about them; between the beams were painted panels set in order. Of the columns four were shaped like palm-trees, but those which stood in the middle had the appearance of Bacchic wands. Outside the columns, on three sides, was a portico with a peristyle, having a vaulted roof, and here the retires of the guests could stand. Inside, the pavilion was surrounded with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> curtains, except that the spaces between columns were hung with the pelts of animals, extraordinary in variety and in size. The outer side of the enclosing curtains, exposed to the air, was roofed with branches of myrtle and laurel and other boughs that were suitable. The floor was entirely strewn with all sorts of flowers. For <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, both because of the temperate quality of its atmosphere, and also because its gardeners can grow plants which are either rare or found only at a regular season in other regions, produces flowers in abundance and throughout the whole year, and it is not easy, as a rule, for the rose or the wall-flower of any other flower to fail entirely. Therefore, since the entertainment which was given at that time took place in the middle of winter, the scene which presented itself to the eyes of the guests passed belief. For flowers which, in any other city, could have been found only with difficulty to make up a single wreath, were lavished without stint in a wealth of wreaths upon the multitude of reclining guests, and, moreover, lay scattered profusely on the floor of the pavilion, truly presenting the picture of an extraordinary beautiful meadow. At the columns which supported the pavilion were placed marble figures, a hundred in all, the work of the foremost artists. In the intercolumniations were paintings by artists of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=demonym long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sikyonian</a> school, alternating with a great variety of selected portraits; also there were tunics of cloth of gold and most beautiful military cloaks, some having portraits of the kings woven in them, others depicting subjects taken from mythology. Above these oblong shields were hung all round, alternately of silver and of gold. And in the spaces above these again, each measuring eight cubits, recesses were constructed, six on each of the longer sides of the pavilion, and four on the narrower sides; and in these recesses were representations of drinking-parties arranged to face one another, composed of figures taken from tragedy, comedy, and satyric drama, </p>                        </div>

In the spaces between the recesses were left niches, in which were set up <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphic</a> tripods of gold, with supports beneath. Along the topmost space in the ceiling gold <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> faced each other, fifteen cubits in length. On the two sides were set a hundred gold couches with feet shaped like Sphinxes; for the apse facing the entrance was left open. On the couches were spread purple rugs made of wool of the first quality, with pile on both sides; and over them were counterpanes embroidered with exquisite art. Smooth <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> carpets covered the space in the middle trodden by the feet, having beautiful designs of figures woven in them with minute skill. Beside the guests, as they reclined, were set three-legged tables of gold, two hundred in number, making two to each couch; they were setting silver rests. Behind them, ready for the hand-washing, were a hundred silver basins and the same number of pitchers. In full sight of the company was built another couch also for the display of the goblets and cups and all the rest of the utensils appropriate to use on the occasion; all of these were of gold and studded with gems, wonderful in their work. Now it clearly appeared to me that it would be tedious to explain the materials and styles of all these vessels; but the weight of them all, taken together in a single mass, was about ten thousand silver talents. Since we have described the pavilion and its contents, we will now give an account of the procession. It was held in the city stadium. At the head marched the 'division of the Morning Star' because the procession began at the time that star appears. Then came that part of the procession which was named from the parents of the king and queen. After these came the divisions made from all the gods, having decorative symbols appropriate to the strict of each divinity. The last division, as it happened, was that of the Evening Star, since the season of the year brought the time consumed by the procession down to that point. If anyone wishes to learn the details, let him take and study the records of the quadrennial games. In the Dionysiac procession, there marched at the head <a href=/people/344 target=_blank>Sileni</a> who kept back the crowds; they were dressed in purple riding-cloaks, some in red. These were closely followed by <a href=/people/185 target=_blank>Satyrs</a>, twenty at each end of the stadium, carrying torches ornamented with gilt ivy-leaves. After these came Victories with gold wings. These carried censers nine feet high, ornamented with gilt ivy-sprays; the women had on embroidered tunics, and their persons were covered with much gold jewelry. After them followed a double altar nine feet long, ornamented in high relief with gilt ivy-foliage, and having a gold crown of grape-leaves twined with striped white ribbons. Following this came one hundred and twenty boys in purple tunics, carrying frankincense and myrrh, and, moreover, saffron upon gold trenchers. After them marched forty <a href=/people/185 target=_blank>Satyrs</a> crowned with gold crowns in ivy pattern; their bodies were smeared in some cases with purple, in others with vermilion and other colors. </p>                        </div>

One of them wore a broad-brimmed hat and held a herald's staff of gold, the other carried a trumpet. Between these walked a man over six feet tall, in tragic costume and mask, carrying a horn of plenty; he was called 'The Year.' He was followed by a very beautiful woman as tall as he, dressed in a striking tunic and adorned with much gold, and carrying in one hand a crown of <a href=/people/8130 target=_blank>Persea</a>, in the other a palm-branch; she was called 'Lustrum.' She was closely followed by the four Seasons gaily dressed and each carrying the fruits appropriate to her. Next these were two censers, nine feet tall, ornamented with ivy pattern in gold; also a square altar between them, of gold. Again came <a href=/people/185 target=_blank>Satyrs</a> wearing gold ivy-crowns and clad in red tunics; some carried a gold wine-pitcher, others a gold goblet. After them marched the poet <a href=/people/1007 target=_blank>Philiscus</a>, who was a priest of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, and all the guild of the artists of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>.

In front of him lay a gold <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconian</a> mixing-bowl holding one hundred and fifty gallons; also a gold tripod, on which lay a gold censer and two saucers full of cassia and saffron. Over him stretched a canopy decorated with ivy, grape-vine, and the other cultivated fruits, and hanging to it also were wreaths, ribbons, Bacchic wands, tambourines, fillets, and satyric, comic, and tragic masks. The cart (was followed) by priests and priestesses and those who had charge of the sacred vestments, sacred guilds of every description, and women carrying the winnowing-fans. Next came <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> bacchants, the so-called 'Mimallones,' and 'Bassarae' and '<a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> women,' with hair streaming down and crowned with wreaths, some of <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a>, others of smilax and vine-leaves and ivy; in their class some held daggers, others <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a>.

Moreover, this image could rise up automatically without anyone putting his hands to it, and after pouring a libation of milk from a gold saucer it would sit down again. It held in the left hand a Bacchic wand bound with fillets. Moreover, <a href=/people/1673 target=_blank>Nysa</a> wore a crown of gold ivy-leaf and very rich grape-clusters of jewels.

Next came a four-wheeled cart thirty-seven and a half feet long, twenty-one feet wide, and drawn by six hundred men; in it was a wine skin holding thirty thousand gallons, stitched together from leopard pelts; this also trickled over the whole line of march as the wine was slowly let out.

From this pigeons, ring-doves, and turtle-doves flew forth along the whole route, with nooses tied to their feet so that they could be easily caught by the spectators. And from it also gushed forth two fountains, one of milk, the other of wine.

Many and varied though the things are which have been mentioned as belonging to these processions, yet I have selected for mention only those things which contained gold and silver. For there were numerous articles worth mentioning, and quantities of wild beasts and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and twenty-four huge <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a>.

At any rate, the largest ships owned by him were: two with thirty banks of oars, one with twenty, four with thirteen, two with twelve, fourteen with eleven, thirty with nine, thirty-seven with seven, five with six, and seventeen with five. But the number of ships with rowers ranging from four banks to one and a half was double the others. The ships dispatched to the islands and the other states over which he ruled, as well as to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, numbered more than four thousand.

It had a double bow and a double stern, and carried seven rams; one of these was the leader, others were of gradually diminishing size, some being mounted at the catheads. It carried twelve under-girders, each of them measuring nine hundred feet. It was extraordinarily well proportioned. Wonderful also was the adornment of the vessel besides; for it had figures at stern and bow not less than eighteen feet high, and every available space was elaborately covered with encaustic painting; the entire surface where the oars projected, down to the keel, had a pattern of ivy-leaves and Bacchic wands. Rich also was the equipment in armament, and its satisfied all the requirements of the various parts of the ship. On a trial voyage it took more than four thousand men to man the oars, and four hundred reserves; to man the deck there were two thousand eight hundred and fifty marines; and besides, below decks was another complement of men and provisions in no small quantity. At the beginning it was launched from a kind of cradle which, they say, was put together from the timbers of fifty five-bank ships, and it was pulled into the water by a crowd, to the accompaniment of shouts and trumpets. Later, however, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> conceived the method of launching by digging a trench under the ship near the harbour, equal in length to the ship. He constructed for this trench foundations of solid stone seven and a half feet in depth, and from one end of these foundations to the other he fixed in a row skids, which ran transversely to the stones across the width of the trench, leaving a space below them six feet deep. And having dug a sluice from the sea, he let the sea into all the excavated space, filling it full; into this space he easily brought the vessel, with the help of unskilled men; . . . . when they had barred the entrance which had been opened at the beginning, they again pumped out the sea-water with engines. And when this had been done, the ship rested securely on the skids before-mentioned. <a href=/people/1172 target=_blank>Philopator</a> also constructed a river boat, the so-called cabin-carrier,' having a length of three hundred feet, and a beam at the broadest part of forty-five feet. The height, including the pavilion when it was raised, was little short of sixty feet. Its shape was neither like that of the war galleys nor like that of the round-bottomed merchantmen, but had been altered somewhat in draught to suit its use on the river. For below the water-line it was flat and broad, but in its bulk it rose high in the air; and the top parts of its sides, especially near the bow, extended in a considerable overhang, with a backward curve very graceful in appearance. It had a double bow and a double stern which projected upward to a high point, because the waves in the river often rise very high. The hold amidships was constructed with saloons for dining-parties, with berths, and with all the other conveniences of living. Round the ship, on three sides, ran double promenades. The perimeter of one of these measured not less than five furlongs. </p>                        </div>

As one first came on board at the stern, there was set a vestibule open in front, but having a row of columns on the sides; in the part which faced the bow was built a fore-gate, constructed of ivory and the most expensive wood. entering this, one came upon a kind of proscenium which in its construction had been roofed over. Matching the fore-gate, again, a second vestibule lay aft at the transverse side, and a portal with four doors led into it. On both sides, left and right, potholes were set beneath to provide good ventilation. Connected with these entrances was the largest cabin; it had a single row of columns all round, and could hold twenty couches. The most of it was made of split cedar and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=demonym long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Milesian</a> cypress; the surrounding doors, numbering twenty, had panels of fragrant cedar nicely glued together, with ornamentation in ivory. The decorative studs covering their surface, and the handles as well, were made of red copper, which had been gilded in the fire. As for the columns, their shafts were of cypress-wood, while the capitals, of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a> order, were entirely covered with ivory and gold. The whole entablature was in gold; over it was affixed a frieze with striking figures in ivory, more than a foot and a half tall, mediocre in workmanship, to be sure, but remarkable in their lavish display. Over the dining-saloon was a beautiful coffered ceiling of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a> wood; the ornamentations on it were sculptured, with a surface of gilt. Next to this dining-saloon was a sleeping apartment with seven berths, Dadjoining which was a narrow passage-way running transversely from one side of the hold to the other, and dividing off the women's quarters. In the latter was a dining-saloon, with nine couches, which was similar to the large saloon in magnificence, and a sleeping-apartment with five berths. Now the arrangements up to the first deck were as described. Ascending the companion-way, which adjoined the sleeping-apartment last mentioned, was another cabin large enough for five couches, having a ceiling with lozenge-shaped panels; near it was a rotunda-shaped shrine of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, in which was a marble statue of the goddess. Opposite to this was a sumptuous dining-saloon surrounded by a row of columns, which were built of marble from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>. Beside this dining-saloon were sleeping-rooms having arrangements which corresponded to those mentioned before. As one proceeded toward the bow he came upon a chamber devoted to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, large enough for thirteen couches, and surrounded by a row of columns; it had a cornice which was gilded as far as the architrave surrounding the room; the ceiling was appropriate to the spirit of the god. In this chamber, on the starboard side, a recess was built; externally, it showed a stone fabric artistically made of real jewels and gold; enshrined in it were portrait-statues of the royal family in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371252PPar class=demonym long=25.1483 lat=37.0844>Parian</a> marble.

Some of their capitals are circular in shape; the entire figure described by them resembles rose-blossoms slightly opened. But around the part which is called the 'basket' there are no volutes or rough leaves laid on, as on Greek capitals, but calyxes of water-lilies and the fruit of freshly-budded date-palms; in some instances several other kinds of flowers are sculptured thereon. The part below the root of the cap, which, of course, rests upon the drum adjoining it, had a motif that was similar; it was composed of flowers and leaves of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> beans, as it were, intertwined. This is the way in which <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> construct their columns; and the walls, too, they vary with alternating white and black courses of stone, but sometimes, also, they build them of the rock called alabaster.

But after considerable discussion in regard to the method of pulling it into the water, <a href=/people/848 target=_blank>Archimedes</a> the mechanician alone was able to launch it with the help of a few persons. For by the construction of a windlass he was able to launch a ship of so great proportions in the water. <a href=/people/848 target=_blank>Archimedes</a> was the first to invent the construction of the windlass. The remaining parts of the ship were completed in another period of six months; it was entirely secured with bronze rivets, most of which weighed ten pounds, while the rest were half as large again; these wit were fitted in place by means of augers, and held the stanchions together; fixed to the timbers was a sheath of leaden tiles, under which were strips of linen canvas covered with pitch. When, then, he had completed the outside surface, he proceeded to make complete the inner arrangements. Now the ship was constructed to hold twenty banks of rowers, with three gangways. the lowest gangway which it contained led to cargo, the descent to which was afforded by companion-ways of solid construction; the second was designed for the use of those who wished to enter the cabins; after this came the third and last, which was for men posted under arms. Belonging to the middle gangway were cabins for men ranged on each side of the ship, large enough for four couches, and numbering thirty. The officers' cabin could hold fifteen couches and contained three apartments of the size of three couches; that toward the stern was the cooks' galley. All these rooms had a tessellated flooring made of a variety of stones, in the pattern of which was wonderfully wrought the entire story of the <a href=/people/12111 target=_blank>Iliad</a>; also in the furniture, the ceiling, and the doors all these themes were artfully represented. On the level of the uppermost gangway there were a gymnasium and promenades built on a scale proportionate to the size of the ship; in these were garden-beds of every sort, luxuriant with plants of marvellous growth, and watered by lead tiles hidden from sight; then there were bowers of white ivy and grape-vines, the roots of which got their nourishment in casks filled with earth, and receiving the same irrigation as the garden-beds. These bowers shaded the promenades. Built next to these was a shrine of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> large enough to contain three couches, with a floor made of agate and other stones, the most beautiful kinds found in the island; it had walls and ceiling of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>-wood, and doors of ivory and fragrant cedar; it was also most lavishly furnished with paintings and statues and drinking-vessels of every shape. Adjoining the <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> room was a library large enough for five couches, the walls and doors of which were made of boxwood; it contained a collection of books, and on the ceiling was a concave dial made in imitation of the sun-dial on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PUAch class=place long=15.288 lat=37.07>Achradina</a>.F There was also a bathroom, of three-couch size, with three bronze tubs and a wash-stand of variegated <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379153PTau class=demonym long=15.2921 lat=37.8523>Tauromenian</a> marble, having a capacity of fifty gallons. There were also several rooms built for the marines and those who manned the pumps. But beside these there were ten stalls for <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> on each side of the ship; and next them was the storage-place for the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>' food, and the belongings of the riders and their slaves. </p>                        </div>

By its side was built a fish-tank enclosed with lead and planks; this was filled with sea-water, and many fish were kept in it. On both sides of the ship were projecting beams, at proper intervals apart; on these were constructed receptacles for wood, ovens, kitchens, handmills, and several other utensils. Outside, a row of colossi, nine feet high, ran round the ship; these supported the upper weight and the triglyph, all standing at proper intervals apart. And the whole ship was adorned with appropriate paintings. There were also eight turrets on it, of a size proportional to the weight of the ship; two at the stern, an equal number at the bow, and the rest amidships. To each of these two cranes were made fast, and over them portholes were built, through which stones could be hurled at an enemy sailing underneath. Upon each of the turrets were mounted four sturdy men in full armour, and two archers. The whole interior of the turrets was full of <a href=/people/11026 target=_blank>Saracen</a> and missiles. A wall with battlements and decks athwart the ship was built on supports; on this stood a stone-hurler, which could shoot by its own power a stone weighing one hundred and eighty pounds or a javelin eighteen feet long. This engine was constructed by <a href=/people/848 target=_blank>Archimedes</a>. Either one of these missiles could be hurled six hundred feet. After this came leather curtains joined together, suspended to thick beams by means of bronze chains. The ship carried three masts, from each of which two stone-hurling cranes were suspended; from them grappling hooks and lumps of lead could also be directed against assailants. An iron paling which encircled the ship also protected it against any who attempted to climb aboard; also grappling-cranes of iron were all about the ship, which, operated by machinery, could lay hold of the enemy's hulls and bring them alongside where they would be exposed to blows. Sixty sturdy men in full armour mounted guard on each side of the ship, and a number equal to these manned the masts and stone-hurlers. Also at the masts, on the mast-heads (which were of bronze), men were posted, three on the foremast, two in the maintop and one on the mizzenmast; these were kept supplied by the slaves with stones and missiles carried aloft in wicker baskets to the <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>'s-nests by means of pulleys. There were four anchors of wood, eight of iron. The trees for the mainmast and mizzenmast were easily found; but that for the foremast was discovered with difficulty by a swineherd in the mountains of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392165RBre class=ethnic long=16.5 lat=39.2>Bruttii</a>; it was hauled down to the coast by the engineer <a href=/people/4261 target=_blank>Phileas</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379153PTau class=person long=15.2921 lat=37.8523>Tauromenium</a>. The bilge-water, even when it became very deep, could easily be pumped out by one man with the aid of the screw, an invention of <a href=/people/848 target=_blank>Archimedes</a>. The ship was named '<a href=/people/10335 target=_blank>Syracusia</a>'; but when <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hieron</a> sent her forth, he changed the name to 'Alexandris.' The boats which it had in tow were first a pinnace of three thousand talents burden; this was propelled entirely by oars. After this came fishing-boats of fifteen hundred talents burden, and several cutters besides. The numbers composing the crew were not less than . . . Next to these just mentioned there were six hundred more men at the bow ready to carry out orders. </p>                        </div>

Quite apart from this was the provisioning of the crew. But when <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hieron</a> began to get reports of all the harbours, either that they could not receive his ship at all, or that great danger to the ship was involved, he determined to send it as a present to King <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>; for there was in fact a scarcity of grain throughout <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. And so he did; and the ship was brought to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, where it was pulled up on shore. <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hieron</a> also honoured Archimelus, the poet who had written an epigram celebrating the vessel, with fifteen hundred bushels of wheat, which he shipped at his own expense to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Peiraeus</a>. The epigram runs as follows: 'Who hath set these giant timbers on the ground? What mighty master hath hauled them with untiring cables? How was the flooring fixed to the ribs of oak, or by what axe hewn did rivets make this hollow mass, matching in height the peaks of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377150LAit class=place long=15.001 lat=37.748>Aetna</a>, or stretching with walls on both sides broad as one of the isles which <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381253WAeg class=demonym long=25.3 lat=38.1>Aegean</a> waters bind together in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372248RKyk class=place long=24.8 lat=37.2>Cyclades</a>/ Verily the giants have planed these timbers to traverse the paths of Heaven.

There is another one of the same size. For the same maker manufactures many articles of furniture in the same or similar style. In this passage <a href=/people/142 target=_blank>Lysias</a> mentions that the vessel-stand was of bronze, and so clearly shows, as <a href=/people/2845 target=_blank>Callixeinus</a> also has said, that they are supports for cauldrons. In the same way, in fact, <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> the Geographer also has spoken of it; in the third book of his work, Address to <a href=/people/2580 target=_blank>Adaeus</a> and <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>, he describes the subject of a picture painted on the wall of the Polemarch's portico at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378226PPhl class=place long=22.648 lat=37.846>Phlious</a>; it was by Sillax of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=person long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a>, who is mentioned by <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> and <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>. <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> says: a vessel-stand, and upon it a cup.

This, then, is what <a href=/people/982 target=_blank>Hegesander</a> says of it. But I too have seen it where it stands as an offering in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, truly worth seeing on account of the figures of insects worked in relief upon it, as well as other tiny creatures and plants; it is capable of holding upon it mixing-bowls and other vessels besides. But that which <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> call vessel-holder is triangular, hollow in the middle, so that it can receive a jar placed inside it. The poor have one of wood; the rich, of bronze or silver. Having, then, discussed the vessel-stand, I will next mention again kings who have been dinner-devotees. To begin with the king who bore the same name as the <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> before mentioned, and who was the son of <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>: <a href=/people/645 target=_blank>Poseidonius</a> records that he held receptions daily to great crowds; and not counting the heaps of food they consumed, he allowed every one of the feasters to carry home uncarved meat of land-animals, fowls, and creatures of the sea prepared whole, and capable of filling a cart; and after all that, quantities of honey-cakes and wreaths of myrrh and frankincense with matted fillets of gold as long as a man. And another king <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, when he celebrated the games at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361361UDap class=place long=36.1442 lat=36.13>Daphne</a>, also held brilliant receptions, according to the same <a href=/people/645 target=_blank>Poseidonius</a>: at the beginning he made distributions, man by man, of uncarved meat; afterwards of live geese, hares, and gazelles. There were also distributed to the diners gold wreaths and a great quantity of silver vessels, slaves, <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a>. And it was the duty of each man, after mounting his <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camel</a>, to drink a toast and accept the <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camel</a> and everything upon it as well as the attending slave. — And all the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, <a href=/people/645 target=_blank>Poseidonius</a> says, because of the great plenty which their land afforded were relieved of any distress regarding the necessities of life; hence they held many gatherings in order to feast continually, using the gymnasia as mere baths in which they anointed themselves with expensive oil and perfumes, and living in the 'bonds' — for this is the name by which they called the commons where the diners met — as though they were their private houses, and filling their bellies in them, during the greater part of the day, with wines and foods, even taking many things home besides; delighting their ears with sounds from a loudly-struck harp, so that the towns rang throughout with such noises. </p>                        </div>

This <a href=/people/10766 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was son of <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> <a href=/people/1219 target=_blank>Epiphanes</a> — pretended son . . . wherefore the whole world cherished hatred against <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>; concerning him our comrade <a href=/people/648 target=_blank>Athenaeus</a> has made record in his work On the Kings of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>. This symposium, then, was held somewhat in the following wise: The <a href=/people/10981 target=_blank>Epicurean</a> philosopher <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>, who had considerable command of the doctrines which he professed, was by birth a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/331445USel class=place long=44.5263 lat=33.101>Seleuceia</a> in <a href=/people/471 target=_blank>Babylonia</a>, and he used to obtain a welcome at the court in spite of the fact that the king delighted it doctrines of the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoics</a>. Well, <a href=/people/10766 target=_blank>Alexander</a> paid him high regard, although he lived a depraved life, and moreover had a slanderous and bitter tongue, not even sparing the royal house if he could provoke a laugh. And once he made request of a favour, strange for a philosopher, that he might wear a purple tunic and a gold crown bearing in the middle the face of <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a>, whose priest he demanded that he should be called; the king granted this, even adding the crown as a special gift. Then <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>, falling in love with an actress who played male roles, presented these very things to her. <a href=/people/10766 target=_blank>Alexander</a> heard of this, and getting together a dinner party of philosophers and distinguished men, he summoned also <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>; when he arrived, the king demanded that he take his place on the couch with the crown and the dress given to him. <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> replied that that was inconvenient; whereupon the king with a nod bade the entertainers to be brought in, and among them was the actress of male roles, crowned with the crown of out of, and clad in the purple tunic. A loud burst of laughter broke forth, but <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> never stirred, but praised the actress without ceasing. <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, who succeeded to the kingdom, would not tolerate the abusive manners of this <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>, and ordered his throat to be cut. But <a href=/people/10766 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was gentle in all circumstances, and in his conversation fond of literary subjects; and he was not like <a href=/people/5485 target=_blank>Athenion</a>, the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a> philosopher, who had been the head of a philosophic school at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372219PMes class=place long=21.9195 lat=37.1779>Messene</a> and again at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396224PLar class=place long=22.421 lat=39.6349>Larisa</a>, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, and afterwards usurped rule over the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>.

For, as <a href=/people/484 target=_blank>Agathon</a> says: If I speak sooth, I shall not give thee joy; but if I give the joy in any wise, I shall not speak sooth. But surely, as they say, truth is dear; and I will set forth the story of the man as it occurred. To the school of the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a> Erymneus resorted a man named <a href=/people/5485 target=_blank>Athenion</a>, who devoted himself sedulously to the philosopher's doctrines. Having purchased an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> slave girl, he lay with her. A son of this woman, whom she bore either by <a href=/people/5485 target=_blank>Athenion</a> or someone else, but named after <a href=/people/5485 target=_blank>Athenion</a>, was brought up in her master's house. He was taught to read, and when the master grew old he used to lead him by the hand in company with his mother; when the elder <a href=/people/5485 target=_blank>Athenion</a> died, the younger became his heir, and was illegally enrolled as a citizen of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>.

He was then elected an ambassador by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> at the time when their interests were inclining to the side of <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, and insinuating himself in the king's good graces he became one of his intimates, receiving the highest promotion. Wherefore he began through letters to unsettle the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> with false hopes, as though he possessed the greatest influence with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=person long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocian</a> monarch — an influence which would enable them not only to live in peace and concord, but even to recover their democratic constitution and receive large doles individually and as a community. All this the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> were loudly boasting, convinced that the Roman rule had been completely overthrown. When, then, Asia Minor had gone over to the king, <a href=/people/5485 target=_blank>Athenion</a> began his return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, but bothered by foul weather he put in to Carystia. When the <a href=/people/2850 target=_blank>Cecropids</a> learned that, they sent war-galleys and a litter with silver supports to bring him home. But now he is coming in! More than half the population of the town, nearly, poured out to take part in welcoming him; many others joined the running crowd as sight-seers, marvelling at the incredible turn of fortune, that this upstart <a href=/people/5485 target=_blank>Athenion</a> should be conveyed back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> on a gold-footed litter and purple rugs — he, who in the earlier days of his ragged coat had never seen purple; and what is more, no Roman had ever insulted <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a> by luxuriating in such display. And so they joined the running crowd to see this sight — men, women, children, with highest expectations of <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>' bounty, seeing that the poverty-stricken <a href=/people/5485 target=_blank>Athenion</a>, who once gave lectures for such fees as he could collect, now parades through town and country with insolent airs on account of the king's favour. He was also met by the artists of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> summoning the messenger of the new <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> to come to the public feast and join in the prayers and libations connected therewith. he who had in former days gone forth from a hired house was conducted to the house of Dies, the person who at that time enjoyed great wealth from revenues in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a>; the house was decorated with couches elaborately spread, with paintings and statues and display of silver vessels. From it he emerged trailing a white riding-cloak, his finger encircled with a ring of gold with the portrait of <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> engraved upon it; and many slaves preceded and followed him in the procession. In the precinct of the artists of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> sacrifices were held in honour of <a href=/people/5485 target=_blank>Athenion</a>'s arrival, and libations were poured at the proclamation of a herald.

Of all the other Roman citizens, some are prostrated before the images of the gods, while the rest have changed their dress to square cloaks and once more call themselves by the countries to which they originally belonged.

For a little while he paused after these remarks, and allowed the crowds to talk over these tidings, so unexpectedly proclaimed. Then he rubbed his forehead and said: 'What, now, an I to advise you? Tolerate no more the anarchical state of things which the Roman Senate has caused to be extended until such time as it shall decide what form of government we are to have.

Well, after many other deliverances of a like tenor uttered you this gutter-snipe, the mob talked it over among themselves, and with a rush to the theatre all together, they choose <a href=/people/5485 target=_blank>Athenion</a> commander of the military forces. And this <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a>, coming forward in the theatre 'with a stride like that of <a href=/people/1715 target=_blank>Pythocles</a>,' thanked the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> and said: 'Today you are your own commanders, although I am at your head.

With these words, he appointed the other officers in his own interest, proposing by name those whom he desired.

Then <a href=/people/5485 target=_blank>Athenion</a> sent out cavalry after them, killing some, but bringing back others as prisoners; for he had as a bodyguard many of those who are called 'completely armed.' He frequently convoked meetings of the Assembly and pretended to sympathize with the Roman cause. . . . Against many persons he brought accusations to the effect that they were engaged in communicating with those who had been outlawed, and were plotting revolution; so he murdered them. And closing the city gates, he posted thirty guards at each, and would not permit anyone, who desired to go out or to come in, to do so. He would also confiscate the estates of many persons, and amassed so much money that it filled several cisterns. He also sent out into the country persons who acted like highwaymen, intercepting those who came from town and dragging them before him. These he would put to death without trial, after first torturing and tearing them on the rack. Against many also he brought suits for treason, alleging that they were co-operating with the refugees to effect their return. Some of these, in their fear, took to flight before the day of the trial, others were condemned in the courts, he himself taking the votes. Moreover his conveys caused a scarcity of the necessaries of life in the city, and he had to ration barley and wheat in small quantities. He also sent out over the country heavy-armed troops to catch any of those who had withdrawn from the city and might still be within the borders, or any <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> who was travelling to a refuge beyond the borders.

When, for example, he professed the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a> philosophy, he bought up <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>'s library and many other books (for he was very rich) and began surreptitiously to acquire the original copies of the ancient decrees in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380238BMet class=place long=23.722 lat=37.9752>Metroon</a>, as well as anything else in other cities which was old and rare.

So <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> must have been one of those picked men — <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, who had nothing but a tattered coat and a staff!

No battle whatever occurred then, according to the account in <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a>. But not content with this narrative of his prodigy, <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> adds the battle which occurred in the precinct of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383237UDel class=place long=23.67398 lat=38.34248>Delium</a> or rather, a story of fictitious valour.

Not <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a>, not any poet besides, makes mention of this bravery. Again, how could he resign the prize for the bravest in favour of <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a>, who had not taken the smallest part in this campaign? And in the <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a>, this devotee of the goddess of memory, <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, says explicitly that <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> had never made a journey abroad, excepting the excursion to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a>. And <a href=/people/436 target=_blank>Antisthenes</a>, the disciple of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, tells the same story about the prize for the bravest that <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> tells. But this tale is not sooth. For this <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynic</a>, as well as <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, displays favouritism toward <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> in many ways; consequently neither of them should be trusted by those who have <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a> in regard. <a href=/people/436 target=_blank>Antisthenes</a>, in fact, even adds to the faction these words: We hear that in the battle with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=ethnic long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotians</a>, also, you won the prize for the bravest. — Hush, stranger! That glory belongs to <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a>, not to me. — Yes, for you gave it to him, as we hear. And <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> says that he was present at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402233UPot class=place long=23.3278 lat=40.1937>Potidaea</a>, and resigned the prize for the bravest to <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a>. But according to all the historians, the expedition to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402233UPot class=place long=23.3278 lat=40.1937>Potidaea</a>, under command of <a href=/people/188 target=_blank>Phormion</a>, preceded that against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383237UDel class=place long=23.67398 lat=38.34248>Delium</a>. At all points, then, the philosophers are false, and they fail to notice that they record many things anachronistically; just so even the noble <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, in the Symposium, represents <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a>, the son of <a href=/people/919 target=_blank>Hipponicus</a>, as having a passion for <a href=/people/1000 target=_blank>Autolycus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/1009 target=_blank>Lycon</a>, and giving a banquet in his honour when he was victor in the pancratium; he places himself in the scene with the other guests at dinner, though probably he had not been even born then, or at least was in his infancy still. Now the time of this scene was the archonship of <a href=/people/1393 target=_blank>Aristion</a>. For in this year <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a> brought out his <a href=/people/1000 target=_blank>Autolycus</a> by the agency of <a href=/people/1995 target=_blank>Demostratus</a>, and satirized the victory of <a href=/people/1000 target=_blank>Autolycus</a>. Again, <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> makes <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> say these words in his Symposium: and yet <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a>, the lover of the poet <a href=/people/484 target=_blank>Agathon</a>, defends those who wallow in lust, saying that a very valiant army could be formed of lovers and their favourites. For he said that he should expect that they, more than all others, would be ashamed to desert one another, a preposterous assertion, which assumes that men who habitually disregard censure and are lost to shame would scruple more than all others to do anything dishonourable. That, however, <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a> never said any such thing one may learn from <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s Symposium. As for <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a> indeed, I know of no work by him, nor has he even been introduced as a character speaking on the usefulness of lovers and their favourites in any other author than <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>; but waiving the question whether <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> has invented all this, or whether he had read a Symposium by <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> in different form from that now extant, we must emphasize his error in chronology. <a href=/people/1393 target=_blank>Aristion</a>, in whose archonship <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>'s symposium is supposed to be held, was archon four years before <a href=/people/1508 target=_blank>Euphemus</a>, </p>                        </div>

It is, therefore, prodigiously surprising that words not yet spoken or essayed until four years after, in the house of <a href=/people/484 target=_blank>Agathon</a>, should have been reproved as improper by <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> when dining at the house of <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a>. But <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s Symposium is nonsense pure and simple. For when <a href=/people/484 target=_blank>Agathon</a> won his victory, <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> was only fourteen years old. <a href=/people/484 target=_blank>Agathon</a> was crowned at the <a href=/people/3413 target=_blank>Lenaea</a> in the archonship of <a href=/people/1508 target=_blank>Euphemus</a>, but <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> was born in the archonship of <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a>, who succeeded <a href=/people/329 target=_blank>Euthydemus</a>; he lived for eighty-two years and departed this life in the archonship of <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a>, who succeeded <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a>, and was the eighty-second archon. From <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> and the birth of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> <a href=/people/1508 target=_blank>Euphemus</a> makes the fourteenth archon, and it was in his year that <a href=/people/484 target=_blank>Agathon</a>'s victory was celebrated by a dinner. <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> himself makes it clear that this party occurred a long while before when he says in his Symposium:. . . 'if you imagine that the party is a recent occurrence, so that I too could be there.' 'Indeed I did,' he replied. 'But how could that be, <a href=/people/1348 target=_blank>Glaucon</a>? Don't you know that <a href=/people/484 target=_blank>Agathon</a> has not lived here for many years?' And going on he says: 'Tell me, please, when did that party take place?' And I said: 'We were still busy when <a href=/people/484 target=_blank>Agathon</a> won a victory with his tragedy.' But that <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> makes many mistakes in chronology can be proved by many instances. To quote the poet who said, Whatsoever cometh untimely to the tongue, <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> writes this down without discrimination. To be sure, he never said anything that he did not put into writing, but he wrote it with scarcely any care, as when he says in the <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a>: According to your contention, then, this prince <a href=/people/12356 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> is a wretched man. — Certainly, my friend, if he is an unrighteous man. And then, after expressly speaking of <a href=/people/12356 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> as being in possession of the throne of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, he proceeds to set down the following: And this <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a>, who has died recently. But if <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a> has died recently, <a href=/people/12356 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> cannot yet be in possession of the throne; on the other hand, granting that <a href=/people/12356 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> is king, <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a> died a very long time before him. <a href=/people/888 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a>, then, was in fact king before <a href=/people/12356 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> for a period of forty-one years, according to <a href=/people/349 target=_blank>Nicomedes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404239PAka class=person long=23.888 lat=40.392>Acanthus</a>; <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> says thirty-five, <a href=/people/666 target=_blank>Anaximenes</a> forty, <a href=/people/478 target=_blank>Hieronymus</a> twenty-eight, <a href=/people/451 target=_blank>Marsyas</a> and <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philochorus</a> twenty-three. now, since these records are diverse, let us take the smallest number, twenty-three years. <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a> died during the third year of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=demonym long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesian</a> war, in the archonship of <a href=/people/798 target=_blank>Epameinon</a>, in whose year died . . . <a href=/people/888 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a>; and <a href=/people/12356 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> succeeded to the throne. How, then, could <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a> have died recently, as <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> says? Again, in the same <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a> <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> makes <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> say: Last year I was chosen by lot a member of the Council, and when my tribe was prytanizing, and it became my duty to put a question to vote, I only caused mirth, and was unable to put the question. But <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> did this not because of any incapacity, but rather because of his courageous devotion to the right; for he could not consent to violate the laws of the commonwealth. <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> makes this clear in the first book of his Hellanica: when some of the <a href=/people/1337 target=_blank>Prytanes</a> refused to put the question which was contrary to the laws, </p>                        </div>

And the mob shouted that the recusants should be brought to trial; so all the <a href=/people/1337 target=_blank>Prytanes</a>, in fear of their lives, promised that they would put the question, excepting <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, the son of <a href=/people/2186 target=_blank>Sophroniscus</a>. He said that he would not, but would do everything according to the laws. The vote here mentioned is the one taken against <a href=/people/2874 target=_blank>Erasinides</a> and the other commanders associated with him, because they failed to pick up the bodies of the men lost at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390268IArg class=place long=26.7855 lat=39.007>Arginussae</a> in the sea-fight. This fight occurred in the archonship of <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a>, twenty-four years after the death of <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a>. Nor is this all. The conversation in the <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a>, which took place after the death of <a href=/people/919 target=_blank>Hipponicus</a>, when <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a> had by this time succeeded to his property, mentions <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a> as having arrived on his second visit to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> just a few days before. But in the archonship of <a href=/people/329 target=_blank>Euthydemus</a>, <a href=/people/919 target=_blank>Hipponicus</a> is in the battle-line as a commanding officer associated with <a href=/people/115 target=_blank>Nicias</a> against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383236PTan class=ethnic long=23.5841 lat=38.3074>Tanagraeans</a> and other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=ethnic long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotians</a> who came to their aid; and he is victor in the battle. He is dead, however, probably not long before the production of The Flatterers, by <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a>, in the archonship of <a href=/people/529 target=_blank>Alcaeus</a>; at least so we must infer, because this play shows that <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a>'s inheriting of the property was then a recent event. In this play, then, <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a> represents <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a> as being in town, whereas <a href=/people/2386 target=_blank>Ameipsias</a> in <a href=/people/3809 target=_blank>Connus</a>, which was brought out two years previously, does not include <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a> in his chorus of Thinkers. It is evident, then, that <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a> came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> between these two dates. But <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> represents <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=person long=21.374 lat=37.89>Elis</a> as also present on the scene in the <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a>, along with certain of his own fellow-citizens, who could hardly live at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> in safety before the conclusion of the year's truce in the archonship of <a href=/people/5720 target=_blank>Isarchus</a>, month <a href=/people/7629 target=_blank>Elaphebolion</a>. He, however, assumes that the dialogue took place about the time when this truce had just been made; at any rate he says: For if there should be savages such as the poet <a href=/people/749 target=_blank>Pherecrates</a> portrayed last year in the play which he brought out at the <a href=/people/3413 target=_blank>Lenaea</a>. Now The Savages was produced in the archonship of <a href=/people/1393 target=_blank>Aristion</a>; after him <a href=/people/6256 target=_blank>Astyphilus</a> was archon, and he was the fifth archon after <a href=/people/5720 target=_blank>Isarchus</a>, in whose year the truce was made. The archons, namely, were <a href=/people/5720 target=_blank>Isarchus</a>, then <a href=/people/1813 target=_blank>Ameinias</a>, after him <a href=/people/529 target=_blank>Alcaeus</a>, then <a href=/people/1393 target=_blank>Aristion</a>, then <a href=/people/6256 target=_blank>Astyphilus</a>. <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, then, contrary to history, brings to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> in his dialogue <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a> and others hostile to the city, though there was no truce at the time. In another passage, also, <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> says that <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a> asked the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphic</a> priestess whether there was anyone wiser than <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>; and she made response that no one was wiser. But on this point, again, <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> does not agree; for he says: on one occasion, in fact, <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a> put a question at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> on my behalf, and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> returned answer before many witnesses that no man was more just or sober than I. How, then, is it reasonable or probable that <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, who confessed that he knew nothing, should have been proclaimed by the god who knows all things as the wisest of men? For if that is wisdom, to know nothing, then to know all things must be stupidity. And what was the use in <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a>'s bothering the god by his question about <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>? For <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> was himself entitled to credence when he said on his own behalf that he was not wise. </p>                        </div>

And yet this last must inevitably have been proclaimed with the ringing of bells by <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>, who was present at the symposium, according to <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>; <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> would never have hushed up this bit of gossip, seeing that he accused <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> of corrupting the young men. The clever <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a>, to be sure, who was <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>'s teacher in rhetoric, says in the verses which are extant under her name and which are quoted by <a href=/people/2522 target=_blank>Herodicus</a>, the disciple of <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a>: <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, I have not failed to notice that thy heart is smitten with desire for the son of <a href=/people/5601 target=_blank>Deinomache</a> and <a href=/people/810 target=_blank>Cleinias</a>. But hearken, if thou wouldst prosper in thy suit Disregard not my message, and it will be much better for thee. For so soon as I heard, my body was suffused with the glow of joy, and tears not unwelcome fell from my eyelids. Restrain thyself, filling thy soul with the conquering <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a>; and with her aid thou shalt win him; pour her into the ears of his desire. For she is the true beginning of love in both; through her thou shalt master him, by offering to his ear gifts for the unveiling of his soul. So, then, the noble <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> goes a-hunting, employing the woman of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=place long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a> as his preceptor in love, instead of being hunted himself, as <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> has said, being caught in <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a>' net. And what is more, he does not leave off weeping, being, I fancy, unfortunate in his pursuit. For seeing what a state he was in, <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a> says: Why art thou all tears, dear <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>? Can it be that the thunderbolt of desire, rankling in thy breast, stirs thee up — the bolt which crashed from the eyes of the lad invincible, whom I promised to make tame for thee? And that <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> really had a passion for <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a> is disclosed by <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> in the <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a>, although <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a> was little short of thirty years old. <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> says: Where do you come from, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>? But I know for certain: you have come from the hunt, and the beauty of <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a> is your quarry. As a matter of fact, when I saw the man the other day he looked handsome still, though a man, between ourselves, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, who is already covered with a beard under his chin. <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>. </p>                        </div>

Don't you approve <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> when he says that the most beautiful age is that of the bearded man, the age which <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a> himself has now attained? Most philosophers have a natural tendency to be more abusive than the comic poets; for example, <a href=/people/1038 target=_blank>Aeschines</a>, the disciple of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, derides <a href=/people/1472 target=_blank>Critobulus</a> the son of <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a> in the <a href=/people/2190 target=_blank>Telauges</a> for his boorishness and sordid manner of life; while as for <a href=/people/2190 target=_blank>Telauges</a> himself, <a href=/people/96 target=_blank>Aeschines</a> ridicules him, who was a very poor orator, in no measured terms, for wearing a cloak for which he pays a fuller a farthing daily, and then puts on a belted sheepskin coat, his shoes being tied with frayed laces. Again, in the <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a>, he calls <a href=/people/919 target=_blank>Hipponicus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a>, a booby, and says sweepingly that the women who come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a> are adulterous and avaricious. And his <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a> contains the contrast drawn between <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a> and his father, also the bitter mockery against the sophists <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> and <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a>. he says, namely, that <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> produced as his pull <a href=/people/378 target=_blank>Theramenes</a>, while the other had <a href=/people/489 target=_blank>Philoxenus</a> the son of <a href=/people/5644 target=_blank>Eryxis</a>, and <a href=/people/5462 target=_blank>Ariphrades</a> the brother of the harp-singer <a href=/people/3341 target=_blank>Arignotus</a>; his intention being to show the kind of instruction given by these teachers from the wickedness and the itch for depravity in those whom he named. In the <a href=/people/2295 target=_blank>Axiochus</a>, again, he bitterly disparages <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a> as a drunken sot and an eager pursuer of other men's wives. <a href=/people/436 target=_blank>Antisthenes</a>, too, in the treatise on the second <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, abuses <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a> and says that he was perverted in his relations with women as well as in his mode of life generally. He even says that <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a> lay with his mother, his daughter, and his sister, as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> do. The dialogue on the Statesman, by <a href=/people/436 target=_blank>Antisthenes</a>, contains a denunciation of all the demagogues at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>; the <a href=/people/12356 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>, of the orator <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a>; the <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a>, slanders against <a href=/people/727 target=_blank>Xanthippus</a> and <a href=/people/11003 target=_blank>Paralus</a>, the sons of <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a>. One of them, he says, lived with <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a>, who plied a trade similar to that of women in the cheaper brothels; the other was the boon companion of <a href=/people/1508 target=_blank>Euphemus</a>, who used to make vulgar and heartless jokes at the expense of all whom he met. Again, <a href=/people/436 target=_blank>Antisthenes</a> changed the name of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> to Satho, a filthy, vulgar word, and published the dialogue against him under this title. For in the eyes of these gentry no statesman is honest, no general is wise, no sophist is worth considering, no poet is good for anything, no populace is capable of reason; only <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> is — he who consorts with <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a>'s flute-girls at the workshops, or converses with Piston the cuirass-maker, or instructs the courtesan <a href=/people/2944 target=_blank>Theodote</a> how to lure her lovers, as <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> represents him in the second book of the Memorabilia. For he makes him recommend to <a href=/people/2944 target=_blank>Theodote</a> measures such as neither <a href=/people/12003 target=_blank>Nico</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=person long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samian</a> beauty, nor Callistrate the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=person long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbian</a>, nor <a href=/people/1787 target=_blank>Philaenis</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387207PLeu class=person long=20.717 lat=38.81>Leucadian</a>, nor even <a href=/people/5944 target=_blank>Pythonicus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, ever conceived as lures to desire; for all these persons used to busy themselves very devotedly with these questions.

Wherefore I will lapse into silence. After Masurius had delivered this long harangue and had been complimented by all on his knowledge, silence ensued, and then <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> spoke: It seems to me, fellow-diners, that you have unexpectedly 'been deluged with violent words' and soused in the wine unmixed: 'For a man who guzzles wine as a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> does water speaks gibberish and cannot recognize a single letter; speechless he lies immersed in the cask, sunken in sleep like one who drinks the poppy drug.' So speaks <a href=/people/1247 target=_blank>Parmenon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=person long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. Or have you been turned into stone by the <a href=/people/1237 target=_blank>Gorgons</a> just mentioned? And speaking of <a href=/people/1237 target=_blank>Gorgons</a>, <a href=/people/10765 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=person long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndus</a> records that certain animals really exist capable of turning men into stone. In the second book of his Inquiry into Birds he says: 'The gorgon is the creature which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, where it occurs, call down-looker. As the majority aver, drawing their comparison from its skin, it is like a wild <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>; but some say that it is like a calf. They say, too, that it has a breath so strong that it destroys any one who meets the animal. And it carries a mane hanging from its forehead over the eyes; whenever it shakes this aside, as it does with difficulty because of its weight, and catches sight of anything, it kills whatever is seen from beneath it; not by its breath, but by the influence which emanates from the peculiar nature of its eyes; and it turns the object into a corpse. It came to be known in this wise. Some soldiers in the expedition of <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> against <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> saw the gorgon, and supposing that it was a wild <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, since its head was bent low and it moved slowly, they rushed forward to get it, thinking that they could kill it with what swords they had. But the creature, being startled, shook the mane which lay over its eyes and immediately turned to corpses the men who had rushed upon it. Again and again other persons did the same thing and became corpses; and since all who attacked it at close quarters always died, some made inquiry of the natives about the nature of the animal; whereupon some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=demonym long=3 lat=36>Numidian</a> horsemen, at the command of <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, lay in ambush for it at a distance and shot it; they then returned with the animal to the commander.' That this creature was, to be sure, of the character described is confirmed both by its skin and by the expedition under <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>. But that other report given by this investigator is not credible; he says that in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> there are backward-grazing <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, so called because they do not move forward when they graze, but do it retreating backward; for, says he, their horns are a hindrance to grazing in the natural way, since they do not curve upwards like those of all other animals, but incline downwards and shade their eyes. This is really incredible, since no other inquirer confirms it. These remarks of <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> were found and attested in so many words by Larensis, who said that <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> had sent skins of these animals back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and that no one could guess to what animal they belonged, so extraordinary was their appearance; he further said that these skins hang dedicated in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SHrc class=place long=12.48077 lat=41.88872>temple</a> of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, where commanders celebrating their triumphs feast the citizens, </p>                        </div>

If a character named <a href=/people/3008 target=_blank>Chremes</a> or <a href=/people/2913 target=_blank>Pheidon</a> leaves out any one of these points, he is hissed off the boards; but a <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a> or a <a href=/people/361 target=_blank>Teucer</a> may do it. And <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>, in The Olive-Orchard, or Guardians: 'O Conquer with the bow, Virgin of <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a> and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> born!

That's the language of the tragedians, who alone are at liberty to say and do anything. The comic poet <a href=/people/937 target=_blank>Timocles</a>, speaking of the many ways in which tragedy is useful in the conduct of life, says, in Women at the <a href=/people/651 target=_blank>Dionysia</a>: Good sir, hearken, if haply I shall tell you the truth. Man is a creature born to labour, and many are the distresses which his life carries with it. Therefore he has contrived these respites from his cares; for his mind, taking on forgetfulness of its own burdens, and absorbed in another's woe, departs in joy, instructed withal. Look first at the tragedians, if it please you, and se what a benefit they are to everybody. The poor man, for instance, learns that <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephus</a> was more beggarly than himself, and from that time on he bears his poverty more easily. The sick man sees <a href=/people/564 target=_blank>Alcmeon</a> raving in madness. One has a disease of the eyes — blind are the sons of <a href=/people/615 target=_blank>Phineus</a>. One has lost his son in death — <a href=/people/479 target=_blank>Niobe</a> is a comfort. One is lame — he sees <a href=/people/448 target=_blank>Philoctetes</a>. One meets with misfortune in old age — he learns the story of <a href=/people/490 target=_blank>Oineus</a>. For he is reminded that all his calamities, which 'are greater than mortal man has ever borne,' have happened to others, and so he bears his own trials more easily. In like manner we, <a href=/people/250 target=_blank>Timocrates</a>, merely restore to you the morsels left by the Dinner-Sophists, we do not give them; so quotes the orator from Cothoce in his tirade against <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>. He, when <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> offered to give <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395250IHal class=place long=25.004 lat=39.513>Halonnesus</a> to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, advised them not to accept it if he gave it, but only if he gave it back.

He is the one who eats up catapults and spears, a fellow who hates words, who has never uttered an antithesis in his life, but has an eye like <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>. Accordingly, adopting the phrase of the poets just quoted, we too will give back, not give, the discourse which succeeded that which we recounted before, and we shall now tell what followed. Thereupon, slaves entered bearing an enormous quantity of fish from sea and lake, on silver platters, so that we marvelled at the luxury as well as at the wealth displayed; for our host had bought everything but the <a href=/people/590 target=_blank>Nereids</a>. And one of the parasites and flatterers remarked that position must have sent the fish to our Nittunius; not, however, through the agency of the merchants in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> who sell a tiny fish for a huge price; rather, he must have brought them himself, some from antium, others from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413133UTar class=place long=13.2486 lat=41.292>Taracina</a> and the Pontian islands opposite, still others from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410120UPyr class=place long=11.9636 lat=42.0152>Pyrgi</a>, which is a city in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Etruria</a>. For the fishmongers of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> do not fall short, even by a little distance, of those who were once satirized in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>. Concerning the latter <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>, in Brave Lads, says:I used to think that the <a href=/people/1237 target=_blank>Gorgons</a> were a fiction, but whenever I go to market, I am strong in my belief in them; for one glance there at the fishmongers, and I am straightway turned to stone. Therefore I must necessarily talk to them with my face turned away, for if I see what a small-sized fish it is for which they charge such a high price, I am then and there frozen solid. <a href=/people/1583 target=_blank>Amphis</a>, in The Wandering Juggler: It is easier, by a million degrees, to get access to the General Staff, and demand a conference and receive an answer to one's questions than it is to approach the damned fishmongers in the market. Whenever a purchaser picks up one of their wares on display and addresses to them a question, the dealer, like <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephus</a>, crouches in silence first (and with good reason, for, to put it in a word, they are all murderers); and as if meant to pay no attention and had not heard a word, he pounds a polyp. The purchaser bursts into a flame of rage. . . . The dealer, never stopping to pronounce his words entire, but clipping a syllable here and there, answers ' 'Twda cost y' eight pence.' 'And this spet-fish?' 'Steen-pence.' Such is the jargon the purchaser must hear. <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in The Man with a Cataract: When I look at the generals with their eyebrows uplifted, I think their conduct is strange, and yet I do not quite wonder that men who have been signally honoured by the state should be a bit prouder than the rest. But when I see the damned fishmongers with lowered but with eyebrows lifted to the top of their polls, I am ready to choke. If you ask, 'How much are you offering those two mullets for,' he replies, 'Ten-pence.' 'Too steep! </p>                        </div>

'My good man, take my offer, and stop joking.' 'At that price? Run along!' Are not these actions bitterer than gall itself? <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> in The Busybody: I used to think in the old days that the fishmongers at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> were the only rascals. But it is plain that this breed, like some wild beasts, is naturally given to deceit everywhere. Here, for example, is one who has beaten the record. In the first place, he wears his hair long, it being dedicated to the god, so he says. But that is not the reason; no, he has a brand on the front of his forehead, and wears long hair as a screen. If you ask this fellow, 'How much is that sea-bass?' he answers, 'tenpence,' without adding in what currency. Then, when you pay him the money, he exacts the coin of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig class=place long=23.425 lat=37.75>Aigina</a>, and if he has to give you back any change, he pays it in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> coin besides. Either way he gets the benefit of the exchange. <a href=/people/2019 target=_blank>Xenarchus</a>, in Purple-Shell: The poets (he declares) are rubbish; for they invent not a single thing that is new, but every one of them just shifts the same topics back and forth. But when it comes to fishmongers, there isn't any breed more philosophic than they, or again, more impious. For since they are no longer at liberty to rinse their wares, and this is forbidden by law, one fellow, utterly detested by the gods, when he saw his fish drying up, very cleverly started on purpose a fight among the dealers. Blows came; and pretending that he had received a mortal wound, he feigned death and lay sprawling among the fish. Someone yelled 'Water, water!' Another man in the same business immediately snatched up a pitcher and poured just a drop over him, but emptied all of it over the fish. You would say that they had just been caught. That they sell fish when they are dead and decayed is indicated in these lines by <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>, in Adulterers: There is no animal more unlucky than a fish. It isn't enough that they should be caught and killed, and find quick burial by being eaten; no, unhappy creatures that they are, they are given over to the damned fishmongers and rot, lying stale for two days or three. And if, at last, they ever find a buyer who is blind, they grant to him the disposal of the dead. He takes it home and throws it away, having learned his lesson from the smell in his nostrils. And in The Pro-<a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=person long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Theban</a> <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> says: Isn't it strange, that if a man chance to have fresh fish for sale, he talks to us with eyebrows contracted and with a scowling face; but if they are out-and out rotten, he jokes and laughs? The rascals ought to do just the opposite; the first man should laugh, the second should — go howl! That they also offer fish for sale at very high prices is told by <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in The Meeting at Pyale: </p>                        </div>

I vow to <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, but I am lost in wonder at the fishmongers. How in the world is it that they are not all rich, since they receive royal tributes? B. Only tributes? Don't they sit at their ease in our cities and take tithes of our property, and rob us of our entire estates every day? The same poet also says in The Melting-Pot: There has never been a better legislator than the wealthy <a href=/people/916 target=_blank>Aristonicus</a>. . . . For today he proposes a law that whatsoever fishmonger offers a fish for sale to anyone, and after naming a price sells it for less than the price he asked, shall straightway be haled to prison; the purpose being to keep them thoroughly frightened, so that they may be satisfied with the right price, or else take all their fish home rotten at evening. And in this way, old man and ancient hag and infant child will buy fish at a fifth of the price, as is right. And going on he says: There has not been since <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> a single legislator better than <a href=/people/916 target=_blank>Aristonicus</a>. There are many other laws, of every description, which he has caused to be passed; but today he is introducing a new law, of golden worth, that the fish mongers shall no longer offer wares for sale seated at their ease, but shall stand up the whole time. And next year he promises to propose a law that they shall hang, and so more quickly send their customers away, selling their wares, like the gods, from a machine. <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> emphasizes also their stupidity, and again their bad temper; in Knave-Hater he compares them with persons whose lives are most depraved, in these words: A. And then, are not the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> very wise For as soon as their children are born, they give them the milk of mares and <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> to drink. B. Yes, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>; and they do not bring into their houses malicious wet-nurses, and later slave-tutors; no greater pest than they could arise. A. Excepting midwives, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> is my witness. They beat all. B. Yes, excepting the mendicant priests, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>; for as a rule that is the foulest breed of all. EA. Unless, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, one should want to call fishmongers the foulest. B. But only after the money-lenders. There is no more pestiferous than they. <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>, too, describes with some eloquence the very high price at which fish are sold; he says, in The Merchant: I don't remember ever seeing fish dearer. Great <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>! If thou didst day by day receive a tithe of their cost, thou wouldst be richest of the gods by far! And yet, if one of them ever cast his winsome glance at me I would pay, albeit with a groan, all that he asked of me. I bought a conger-eel, I paid down as much as it weighed in gold, as <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> did for <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>. And <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in The Woman from Greece: Living or dead, the creature of the sea are always at war with us. If, for example, a ship founders, and then, as often happens, a man is caught while he tries to swim, they quickly gulp him down for good and all. </p>                        </div>

They are held for sale at the price of our estates, and he who buys straightway ambles home a beggar. A fishmonger, Hermaeus of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, is mentioned by name in The Fishes of <a href=/people/875 target=_blank>Archippus</a> thus: An <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a>, Hermaeus, is the most rascally pedlar of fish. Why! He forcibly peels off the skin of monkfishes and Dogfishes and offers them for sale, and he disembowels sea-bass, so they tell me. <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, too, mentions a fishmonger named <a href=/people/3636 target=_blank>Micion</a>, in The Heiress. With good reason, therefore, fishermen take more pride than the most eminent generals in their profession. At any rate, <a href=/people/796 target=_blank>Anaxandrides</a>, in <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, introduces one of them pronouncing these opinions about the fisherman's trade: As for the artists, to be sure, their lovely handiwork is hung up on panels to be admired. But this handiwork of ours is ceremoniously wrested from the casserole and quickly disappears from the frying-pan. For, good sir, what other art makes the lips of youngsters burn? Or causes such pushing of fingers, or choking, in case one cannot swallow his mouthful quickly? Is not the market, well stocked with fish, the only thing that brings about assignations? What mortal goes to dine in company if he gets but paltry small fry, or <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>-fish at the counter, or a sprat? By what enchantments or eloquence can a beautiful lad be seduced, tell me, if one abolishes the fishermen's art? This it is which goes on its conquering way, subduing with the cheerful aspect of stewed fish, luring their very bodies to the gates of — luncheon, and forces their natures to succumb without receiving a fee. With reference to those persons who are very particular in their marketing, <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> has this to say in The Heiress: The man who, though a pauper, buys fish often, and albeit indigent in other things, is rich enough for that, strips naked those whom he meets at night, and compels them, once they have been robbed of their cloaks, to watch for him early in the morning at the supply market. And the first poor man, who is also young, who is seen buying eels from <a href=/people/3636 target=_blank>Micion</a> is seized and dragged to the prison. <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>, in The Merchant, says that there is also a law among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=ethnic long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthians</a> of some such tenor as the following: A. This is the custom, good sir, here in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>, that if we ever see a man marketing opulently, we put him to the question and ask where he gets his living and what he does. And if he prove to have an estate whose revenues can pay his expenses, we let him enjoy that mode of life from that time on; but if it happens that he is spending beyond his estate, they forbid him to do that again. And whosoever disobeys, upon him they lay a fine If, again, he lives sumptuously without owning anything whatever, they hand him over to the public executioner. B.

Down to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> times people at dinner were served from utensils of crockery, as my compatriot <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a> says. But when the Romans shifted their mode of living in the direction of greater luxury, <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, who caused the downfall of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> monarchy, in imitation of the Romans gave up her mode of living. But not being able to change the name, she called a silver or a gold vessel 'crockery' pure and simple, and used to bestow such 'crockery-ware' upon her guests at dinner to take home; and this ware was of the most costly kind; for the Rhosic ware, which is the most gaily decorated of all, <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> used to spend five minas every day. And King <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> in the eighth book of his Commentaries, where he discusses <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Massinissa</a>, the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, says: 'Dinners were got up in the Roman style and furnished with crockery which was all silver; the tables of the second courses he adorned in accordance with Italic customs; all the baskets were of gold, and were in imitation of those made with reed intertwined; but the musicians whom he employed were Greek.' <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>, the comic poet, who is said to have been a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/309306UNau class=place long=30.5925 lat=30.8972>Naucratis</a> by <a href=/people/1203 target=_blank>Heliodorus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> in his work On the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAkr class=place long=23.7257 lat=37.9717>Acropolis</a> (which is in fifteen books), tells in his play <a href=/people/641 target=_blank>Plutus</a> how, at the appearance of the god bearing that name, the fish-platters suddenly turned to silver, as did all the other utensils. He says: 'Every vinegar-cruet and casserole and pot has become bread; the worn-out fish-platters, one can see, are of silver, and the lantern all of a sudden has become ivory.' <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> in Envoys: 'And, as a consequence, <a href=/people/799 target=_blank>Epicrates</a> and Phormisius got a great many bribes from the great king — golden saucers and silver platters.' And <a href=/people/1229 target=_blank>Sophron</a> in Mimes of Women says: 'With vessels of bronze and vessels of silver the house gleamed.' </p>                        </div>

But a kind of pity for almost en in the world lies deep in my sought, when I see free men in sore straits, while rogues from the whipping-post eat salt fish worth perhaps only two or three pence from a silver platter weighing a pound, or capers bought for three farthings in a silver bowl weighing fifty drachms. Yet in the old days it was actually hard to discover a (silver) saucer dedicated in a temple. B. Well, that's true still even today. For, if a man dedicates one, another quickly carries it off.' And <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in The Scarf, introducing a young man who is in love and who displays his wealth to his sweetheart, makes him say this: A. 'And I told my slaves (since I had brought two from home) to place the cups, cleaned with soda, for all to see. And there was a ladle-cup of silver (this, to be sure, weighed two drachms), a gravy-dish weighing perhaps four more, and a small cooler weighing one and two-thirds drachms, of metal thinner than <a href=/people/1208 target=_blank>Philippides</a>. B. Why! This was cleverly conceived, for all it was pure boasting.' I, for my part, also know of a citizen of our country, a bragging beggar, who, although his total possessions in silver ware amounted to no more than a drachm's weight, yet loudly called to his one and only slave, but one whose names were as innumerable as the sands: 'Slave! <a href=/people/2449 target=_blank>Strombichides</a>! Don't set before us the silver ware we use in winter, but what we use in summer.' A similar character also is the one in the play of <a href=/people/474 target=_blank>Nicostratus</a> entitled Kings. It is a swashbuckling soldier, of whether he says: 'There remain a vinegar-cruet and a cooler, of metal thinner than the texture of his purple cloak.' For they used sometimes to hammer out silver even in those days to the likeness of a membrane. <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=demonym long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnian</a> Women says: 'A three-legged table was set before us which held — O ye worshipful gods! — a nice flat-cake and honey in a silver bowl.' And the parodist <a href=/people/1028 target=_blank>Sopater</a> in <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a>: 'A silver platter containing a stale sheat-fish.' In the play entitled Lentil-Soup he also says: 'Why! At his meals he has a silver vinegar-cruet, with figures of <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a> in high relief — the kind which thibron, son of <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a>, also acquired once on a time, a man who was softly out-talented of his talents.' Again, <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=person long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a> in his Counsels to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> discusses his fellow-citizen <a href=/people/759 target=_blank>Theocritus</a> and says: 'He also drinks from vessels of silver and gold and makes use of other similar utensils at the table — he, of all men, who earlier in life not only never had any silver-ware from which to drink, but he had no bronze ware either, only earthenware, and that, too, sometimes chipped.' And <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> in The Painter: 'A choice luncheon came dancing on, composed of everything novel or much desired. There were all kinds of shell-fish, a cohort of limpets was drawn up alongside a heap of broiled meats rushed at us from the pan, and spiced drinks to wash them down, in silver mazers.' <a href=/people/638 target=_blank>Philemon</a> in The Doctor: 'And a knapsack full of silverware.' <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> in The Self-Tormentor: 'A bath, serving-maids, . . . silverware.' Also in Hymnis: 'But I have come for the purpose of getting the silverware.' <a href=/people/142 target=_blank>Lysias</a>, in the speech On the Golden Tripod, if it be genuine: 'There remained silver ware and gold ware to be given up.' But those who insist on pure Greek assert that he ought to have said 'silver ornament' and 'gold ornament.' </p>                        </div>

Indeed, the golden ewe-<a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a> of <a href=/people/126 target=_blank>Atreus</a>, which caused eclipses of the sun, the downfall of monarchs, and what is more, provided most of the themes of tragedy, is said by <a href=/people/2235 target=_blank>Herodorus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=person long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heracleia</a> to have been a silver saucer which had a golden <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a> in the centre. <a href=/people/666 target=_blank>Anaximenes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403267UPit class=person long=26.6992 lat=40.3467>Lampsacus</a>, in the work entitled First Inquiries, says that the necklace of <a href=/people/1341 target=_blank>Eriphyle</a> became famous merely because gold was at that time rare among the Greeks; indeed, it was even unusual to see a silver drinking-cup in those days. But after the seizure of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=ethnic long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocians</a>, all such things as that took on abundance. Even those who were reputed to be very rich used to drink from bronze cups, and they called the receptacles for these 'bronze-boxes.' And so <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> says that the priests of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> drank from bronze cups, and that once, when their kings were offering sacrifice together, not enough silver cups to be given to all could be found; at any rate, <a href=/people/1027 target=_blank>Psammetichus</a>, being younger than all the other kings, poured his libation from a bronze cup. Be that as it may, when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> shrine was looted by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=demonym long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocian</a> usurpers, gold flamed up everywhere among the Greeks, and silver also came romping in. Later, when the all-highest <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> brought away for his own uses the treasures of Asia the sun of 'wealth, with far-flung might,' as <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> has it, verily rose. Now the votive offerings, also, of silver and gold at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, had been dedicated in the first instance by <a href=/people/870 target=_blank>Gyges</a>, who was king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a>; and before his reign, the god at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> had no silver, much less gold, as <a href=/people/1847 target=_blank>Phaenias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391259PEre class=person long=25.9348 lat=39.1341>Eresus</a> tells us, and <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> in the fortieth book of his History of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>. For these authorities record that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> shrine was adorned by <a href=/people/870 target=_blank>Gyges</a> and his successor <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a>, and after them by <a href=/people/1134 target=_blank>Gelon</a> and <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hieron</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=person long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> Greeks. The former dedicated a tripod and a <a href=/people/335 target=_blank>Victory</a> made of gold about the time when <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> was making his invasion of Greece, the latter dedicated similar offerings. The words of <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> are as follows: 'For in ancient times the sacred precinct was adorned with bronze offerings which were not statues, but cauldrons and tripods made of bronze. Now the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>, desiring to gild the face of the <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370224UAmy class=person long=22.4502 lat=37.0363>Amyclae</a>, but not finding any gold in Greece, sent to the oracle of the god and asked the god from whom they should purchase gold.

And so they went and bought it from <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a>. As for <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hieron</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=person long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a>, he desired to dedicate to the god the tripod and the <a href=/people/335 target=_blank>Victory</a> of refined gold; for a long time he was puzzled to know where to get it, and finally sent messengers to search for it in Greece, who at last came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>, and on investigation found it in the house of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=person long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a> <a href=/people/3507 target=_blank>Architeles</a>. He had been buying up small amounts for a long time, and had a large store. Well, he sold to <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hieron</a>'s agents all that they wanted, and then, filling his hand with as much as it could hold, he added that as a present to them. In return for this <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hieron</a> sent from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> a shipload of grain and many other gifts.' <a href=/people/1847 target=_blank>Phaenias</a> records the same facts in his work on The Tyrants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=person long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, that the ancient votive offerings were of bronze, whether tripods, or cauldrons, or daggers; and on one of these, he says, is the inscription: 'Behold me; for verily I was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a>'s broad tower, what time we fought for <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> with the beautiful tresses; and <a href=/people/915 target=_blank>Antenor</a>'s son, lordly <a href=/people/3306 target=_blank>Helicaon</a>, carried me. But today the sacred soil of <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a>'s son holds me in its keeping.' On the tripod, which was one of the prizes offered at the games in honour of <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a>, was inscribed 'A bronze tripod am I, dedicated as an offering at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pytho</a>, and <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, swift of foot staked me in honour of <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a>. And <a href=/people/183 target=_blank>Tydeus</a>'s son, <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> good at the cry, made offering of me after his victory with race <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> beside the broad <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>.' </p>                        </div>

Do thou also bring unto me a precious offering, wherewith thy mother once caused <a href=/people/284 target=_blank>Amphiaraus</a> to be hidden beneath the earth, <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and all.

But the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a> <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>, while he made an exception of the legitimate and honourable use of money, nevertheless placed it in all other respects in the category of the 'indifferent,' and discouraged both the pursuit and the avoidance of it, ordaining that one should make use of simplicity or superfluity in a purposeful manner. <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>'s intention in this was that men should maintain an attitude of the soul which evinces neither fear nor wonder toward things which are neither honourable nor dishonourable (per se), and so may adapt themselves in general to the things which are 'according to nature'; on the other hand, having no far whatever of anything, men should abstain from what is opposed to nature through reason, and not through fear. For nature has not excluded from men's environment any of the things aforesaid, but has created underground veins of them, involving laborious and difficult toil, in order that persons who are eager for them may go after their acquisition in pain, and that not merely those who work in mines, but also those who amass the metals when mined, may pursue with infinite trouble this great wealth so universally admired. By way of providing a sample, to be sure, there are places where these kinds of metal are found on the surface, since, in remote corners of the world, ordinary brooks carry down grains of gold which women or men of feeble body extract by rubbing and sifting with the sand, and after washing it they carry it to the melting-pot. This is the custom among the <a href=/people/12015 target=_blank>Helvetians</a>, as my fellow-countryman <a href=/people/645 target=_blank>Poseidonius</a> says, and among some other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a>. Again, the mountains which used to be called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/520255LRhi class=place long=25.5 lat=52>Rhipaean</a>, then later named Olbian, and today <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a>, which are in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=demonym long=7 lat=49>Celtic</a> land, oozed silver whenever a forest fire broke out spontaneously.

By way of jest, indeed, he declares that men often lavish what they plainly have for the sake of what is uncertain; they fail to get what they expected, but let fall what they had, meeting with misfortune in a kind of conundrum. Although the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>, as <a href=/people/645 target=_blank>Poseidonius</a> also records, were forbidden by custom from importing into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> or acquiring either silver or gold, they none the less acquired it, but they deposited it for safe keeping with their neighbours the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a>. They then proceeded to make enemies of them where once they were friends, in order that through this enmity their disobedience might pass without investigation. It is recorded, to be sure, that the gold and silver which had previously been in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemon</a> was dedicated to the <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=person long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, but <a href=/people/107 target=_blank>Lysander</a> brought it into the city for public use, and so became the author of many evils. There is a story, at any rate, that <a href=/people/517 target=_blank>Gylippus</a>, the liberator of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a>, starved himself to death because he had been convicted by the Ephors of having embezzled some of the funds brought in be by <a href=/people/107 target=_blank>Lysander</a>. It was not easy for a mere mortal to regard as of small value the gold which had been dedicated to the god and bestowed as an ornament and possession of the people. Among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a>, the tribe called <a href=/people/8286 target=_blank>Scordistae</a>, though they refrain from importing gold into their own country, nevertheless do not pass silver by when they pillage and outrage other people's lands. This tribe is a remnant of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a> who attacked the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphic</a> oracle under <a href=/people/1090 target=_blank>Brennus</a>, but a leader named Bathanattus removed them to the regions round the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Danube</a>; from him also the road by which they retreated is called Bathanattia, and they call his descendants Bathanatti to this very day. They also eschew gold and do not bring it into their native towns, because through it they had undergone many terrible trials; but they use silver, and for its sake commit many terrible acts. And yet surely they ought not to have banished that class of metal so sacrilegiously stolen, but rather the impiety which had committed the sacrilege. For if they had not brought silver into their country any more than gold, then they would sin with respect to bronze and iron; or, again, if even these were not found among them, then they would be continually exercising their craze for war in order to steal food and drink and other necessities. </p>                        </div>

Most of the party eagerly aspired to solve <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>'s problems, and among those who interpreted the problems still remaining <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a> said: The name of parasite was in old times dignified and sacred. Take, for example, what <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> writes about parasites (I know not whether he likes to be called the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=demonym long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samian</a>, or the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=demonym long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sikyonian</a>, or the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, names for him which <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370356UMop class=person long=35.6237 lat=36.9576>Mopsuestia</a> enumerates, adding others derived from other cities; he used also to bear the soubriquet of 'tablet-picker,' according to <a href=/people/2522 target=_blank>Herodicus</a>, the disciple of <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a>): 'Parasite is nowadays a disreputable term, but among the ancients we find it used of something sacred, equivalent to companion at a sacred feast. In the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BKyn class=place long=23.732 lat=37.966>Herakleion in Cynosarges</a> there is a stele on which is a decree proposed by <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a>, the clerk being <a href=/people/309 target=_blank>Stephanus</a>, son of <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a>. With regard to the use of the term the words to be found on it are as follows: The priest shall sacrifice the monthly offerings in company with the parasites. These parasites shall be drawn from men of mixed descent and their children, according to ancestral custom. And whosoever shall decline to serve as a parasite shall be cited before the court on precisely this charge. Again, on the law tablets that relate to the Deliastai (<a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=demonym long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delian</a> sacred mission), it is written: Also the two heralds from the house of Heralds connected with the Mysteries. These shall serve as parasites for a year in the Delion And at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380238SAth class=place long=23.8444 lat=38.0141>Pallenis</a> there is inscribed on the votive offerings Dedicated by the magistrates and parasites who were awarded a gold crown in the archonship of <a href=/people/1321 target=_blank>Pythodorus</a>. In the year of the priestess Diphile the parasites were <a href=/people/2407 target=_blank>Epilycus</a>, son of . . . stratus of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380239DGar class=place long=23.8719 lat=38.0165>Gargettus</a>, <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a>, son of Pericleitus of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380239DPit class=person long=23.9006 lat=38.0006>Pitthos</a>, <a href=/people/1990 target=_blank>Charinus</a>, son of <a href=/people/850 target=_blank>Demochares</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380239DGar class=person long=23.8719 lat=38.0165>Gargettus</a>. Again in the laws of the king it is written: The parasites of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381237DAch class=place long=23.7332 lat=38.0803>Acharnae</a> shall sacrifice to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>. ' <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367345PSol class=person long=34.539 lat=36.742>Soli</a>, who was one of <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>'s disciples, records the following in the first book of his Lives: 'Further: whereas today a parasite is one who is only too ready, in those days he was one especially enrolled to have subsistence with others. In their old laws, at any rate, most states still include even today parasites among their most honoured officials.' And <a href=/people/3365 target=_blank>Cleidemus</a>, in his Atthis, says: 'parasites also were chosen to honour <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>.' So <a href=/people/2071 target=_blank>Themison</a> in his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380238SAth class=person long=23.8444 lat=38.0141>Pallenis</a>: 'It shall be administered by the king in office at the time, the magistrates and the parasites chosen in addition from the demes, as also by the elders and the women still living with their first husbands.' You can, my noble <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, now ask again, in the light of this quotation, who are 'the women still living with their first husbands'? However, since we are talking about parasites, there is also an inscription on a tablet in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAna class=place long=23.7293 lat=37.9713>Anaceium</a>: 'Of the two <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> which are specially selected as the leaders, one-third shall go to the expenses of the festival; as for the other two-thirds, one part shall go to the priest, the other to the parasites.' <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a>, in the second book of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> Dialect, says: 'And the word parasite has in our times shifted its meaning to apply to a disreputable thing, but in earlier times was the name given to those who were chosen to select the sacred grain, and there was a special repository for their use. Wherefore, in the king's code the following also stands written: He who is king shall see that the magistrates are appointed and that the parasites are chosen from the demes according to the statutes. And the parasites are to select, each from his own share in the king's office, eight quarts of barley, and those <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> who are in the sacred precinct are to be feasted therewith according to ancestral custom. And the parasites of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381237DAch class=place long=23.7332 lat=38.0803>Acharnae</a> are to bring their eight quarts in honour of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> to the repositories after the barley has been selected. That there was also a repository for them is proved by what is written in the same code For the repair of the temple, the magazine of the parasites, and the sacred house, payment shall be made at whatsoever price the repairers of sacred places shall fix in the contract. From this it is clear that the repository in which the parasites placed the first fruits of the grain was called the parasition. ' The same facts are recorded by <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philochorus</a> also in the work entitled Tetrapolis, when he mentions the parasites who were drafted for the service of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>; also by <a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420351PSin class=person long=35.143 lat=42.025>Sinope</a>, comic poet, in his Heiress, whose testimony I will cite a little later. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, in his Constitution of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404226UMet class=ethnic long=22.5836 lat=40.4674>Methonaians</a>, says: 'There were two parasites for each magistrate, and one for each military office; they received regular contributions from certain other persons, and particularly fish from the fishermen.' But as for the modern use of the term parasite, <a href=/people/2505 target=_blank>Carystius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=person long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamum</a>, in his work on Dramatic Performances, says that it was first invented by <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>. He forgets, however, that <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>, in <a href=/people/1068 target=_blank>Hope</a> or <a href=/people/923 target=_blank>Wealth</a>, introduced the character at a drinking-bout with these words: 'But another came stalking in here at the heels of the first — one whom, I can assure you, you will easily as things now go, find ever ready to assist at the feast. (However poor he may be) this fellow can none the less quaff life in a single breath, as he would a cup.' And he makes the parasite himself say these words to his questioner: 'Dine another with him who desires me (he needs only to ask me), and alike with him who desires me not (and there is no need to ask); at dinner there I am a wit, and cause much laughter and praise my host. And if anyone wants to say something hostile to him, I revile the upstart and so get myself hated. Then after eating heartily and drinking heartily I take my leave; but no slave carries a lamp ahead for me. I skulk along the slippery way and am alone in the darkness; if I meet the watchmen anywhere, the one good thing that I can ascribe to the gods is this, that patrol wants no more omen than a flogging. And when at last I get home, done of the death, I go to sleep without any bedding, and never heed the first thing so long as the neat wine holds and befuddles my senses.' </p>                        </div>

The parasite in <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> says: 'When a rich man gets up a dinner and invites me, I don't stop to notice the triglyphs or the ceiling; nor do I examine the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a> jars, but I watch intently the chef's smoke. And when it comes pouring straight up in an eager rush, I am all delight, I rejoice and am in a flutter but when it comes out crosswise and thin, I at once perceive that that dinner isn't going to have even a drop of blood for me.' But <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> was the first, as some people assert, to introduce a parasite when he says that <a href=/people/4769 target=_blank>Podes</a> was a friendly companion at the feast of <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>: 'There was a man among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a>, <a href=/people/4769 target=_blank>Podes</a>, son of <a href=/people/1342 target=_blank>Eetion</a>, rich and brave withal; more than all others among the people <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a> honoured him, for he was his comrade, a friendly companion at the feast.' For when he speaks of a friend at the feast he means a friend when it came to eating. That is why he represents him as wounded by <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> in the belly, just as, <a href=/people/10815 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398267USke class=person long=26.7002 lat=39.8074>Scepsis</a> says, <a href=/people/1635 target=_blank>Pandarus</a> for his perjury was wounded in the tongue.

But the word occurs often among more recent poets. The verb also occurs in the philosopher <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, in <a href=/people/1267 target=_blank>Laches</a>. He says, namely: 'And the lads parasite with us.' <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in The Pilot says there are two classes of parasites. The lines are: 'P.

Not a bit of it. For there doesn't exist a more useful class when it comes to the things I have just described. Again, if you grant that sociability is one of the virtues, your parasite practises that to perfection. Suppose you're in love; he proves himself in your affair a helper who never shirks. You have some business to transact; he will stand you and carry through whatever is wanted, claiming his patron's rights as if they were his own — an incomparable admirer of his friends. But, you say, they enjoy the pleasures of eating without paying their share. Well, what mortal man does not do that? Still more, what god or hero discountenances that kind of pastime? Not to drag out the army with too many instances, I think I can cite one proof of immense importance, to show that the parasites' life is held in honour. They are given for their deserts exactly the same prize as those who win at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> Games — maintenance. For all places where payment is not imposed should be called Prytaneia.' Again, <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> says in The Twins: 'For the parasite, if you look at him rightly, is a part near in both things, our fortune and our life. No parasite prays that his friends may have misfortune; quite the contrary, he prays that all may have perpetual good fortune. A man may be sumptuous in his mode of life; he feels no envy, but only prays that he may stand beside him and share his wealth. He is also a noble friend and safe as well, not contentious, not quick to take offence, not malicious, good at enduring bad temper. If you joke at his expense, he laughs. He is affectionate, amusing, gay in character; again, he is a good soldier, du passing belief, if only his ration be a dinner promptly served.' And <a href=/people/979 target=_blank>Aristophon</a> says in The Doctor: I wish to explain to him beforehand what sort of man I am in my ways. If anyone gives a dinner, I am first on the spot, so that long since I am known by the name of Broth. If someone who has drunk too much has to be tackled at the waist and you would think that you saw in me an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=demonym long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a> wrestler.

And in The Disciple of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> he says: 'When it comes to being hungry, and not eating a single bite, imagine that you are looking at <a href=/people/3983 target=_blank>Tithymallus</a> or <a href=/people/1208 target=_blank>Philippides</a>. At drinking he's a <a href=/people/10983 target=_blank>frog</a>, at getting all the benefit out of thyme and greens, caterpillar, at abstaining from a bath, a filth-pot; at passing the winter in the open, he's a <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>, at enduring heat and chattering at noonday, a cicada, at refusing to anoint himself with oil under any circumstances, a dust-cloud, at walking about shoeless in the early dawn, a crane, and at sleeping not so much as a wink, a bat.' And <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>, in Ancestors: 'You know my character, and that I hold within me no vain conceit; rather, toward my friends, good sir, I am like this: at receiving blows I am pig-iron, at giving blows, a thunder-bolt, at blinding the eyes, a lightning flash, at picking a fellow up and carrying him off, a hurricane, at choking him, a nose, at wrenching the bolts of a door, an equal, at hopping in, a cricket, at eating uninvited, a fly; as immovable as a cistern, I can choke, murder, bear false witness, do anything that one may happen to propose — all at a moment's notice. And the younger chaps for all these traits call me Thunderbolt. But I don't mind their jokes at all. For I am a friend to my friends, and it's my nature to serve them with deeds, not words alone.' <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> in The Parasite makes his parasite say these lines on the occasion of an impending marriage: 'You don't know what the curses threaten in case a man should refuse to show the way correctly, or to kindle a fire; or should he poison the water or hinder a man who wanted — to give a dinner.' And <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a> in <a href=/people/173 target=_blank>Oidipus</a>: 'The man who invites anyone to dinner, be it friend or foreigner, and then extracts a contribution — may he have to flee the country without taking any thing from home.' </p>                        </div>

As for the other arts, no gods disclosed them, but only clever men. Aye, the parasite's life was an invention of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the god of <a href=/people/1249 target=_blank>Friendship</a>, admittedly the mightiest of the gods. for this god enters our houses, making no distinction between rich and poor; and wherever he sees a couch nicely spread, with the table laid beside it holding everything that can be desired, he forthwith lies down with the guests decorously and feasts himself; and having eaten of this and drunk of that, he goes back home without paying the scot. And that is what I do today. Whenever I see couches spread, the tables ready, the door standing open, I enter there noiselessly; I assume my best manners, so as not to annoy my fellow-drinker; and after enjoying all that is served, I go back home like <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the god of <a href=/people/1249 target=_blank>Friendship</a>. And that this business has always been noble and in good repute, one may realize still more clearly from this: whenever the State honours <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> sumptuously, celebrating festivals in all the demes, never to this day has it chosen by lot, for these feasts, parasites to honour the god; and it and selected for this purpose ordinary citizens either. No, the State made a list from the citizens, carefully selecting twelve men who were sons of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> parents, who owned property, and who had lived decent lives. And so, in later times, certain rich men, imitating the example of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, picked out parasites to support, and invited them in, selecting not the finest men, but those best able to play the flatterer and praise them in everything. Why! When a patron, after eating radishes or a stale sheat-fish, belches in their faces, the flatterers say that he must have lunched on violets and roses. And when the patron breaks wind as he lies next to one of these fellows, the latter applies his nose and begs him to tell him, Where do you buy that incense? It is because of such people, who make outrageous use of flatterers, that what was once estimable and noble is today a scandal.' </p>                        </div>

It is to have seven couches, so he was telling me, unless <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a> manages to get himself stuffed in as an extra somewhere.' <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380244PKar class=person long=24.427 lat=38.027>Carystus</a> in The Priestess: 'A new <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a>, they say, has slipped uninvited into the wedding at the house of <a href=/people/2009 target=_blank>Ophelas</a>. For he took a basket and a wreath, since it was dark, and pretending that he had come from the bride as a porter bringing fowls, he thrust himself in, it appears, and so got a dinner.' Again, in The Girl what was Sacrificed: 'I call upon <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>, I call upon <a href=/people/335 target=_blank>Victory</a>, to favour my expedition; I also call <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a>, for even if I don't call, he will come uncalled.' And the comic poet <a href=/people/2167 target=_blank>Machon</a> says: 'Once upon a time <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a> came a long way from town to attend a dinner at a wedding. And they say that the poet <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> remarked, You, <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a>, had better hammer four nails into each of your jaws, that you may not twist your cheekbones out of shape every time you come a long way in frantic haste.' And again: '<a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a> once on a time went to buy some meat. And they say that the butcher sliced off for him by chance a very bony piece of meat. At which he remarked, Butcher, don't add the weight of that bone to my bill. But the butcher replied, Yes, but it is very sweet. In fact, the nearer the bone, they say, the sweeter the meat. But <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a> answered, It may be very sweet, my friend, but its added weight hurts wherever it is applied. ' There is even a book by <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a> recorded by <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a> in his Table of Miscellany; he write as follows: 'Writers on dinners: <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a>; dedicated to Pod.' And then he subjoins the beginning of it, 'Since you have often bidden me' (and adds the size) 'in three hundred and seventy-five lines.' That Pod was a parasite has been explained before. </p>                        </div>

Once, when a courtesan whose name was Resolve was at a symposium with Lark, the wine gave out, and he told each guest to contribute twopence, whereas Resolve should transmit whatever was voted by the people. The harp-player Polyctor was once greedily drinking some lentil soup, and hit his tooth on a stone. 'You poor fool,' said Lark, 'even the lentil soup throws things at you.' (Perhaps Polyctor is the man referred to by <a href=/people/2167 target=_blank>Machon</a> when he says: 'A very bad harp-singer, it appears, was about to repair his house, and asked his friend for some stones. I will pay them back to you in much greater number, he said, after the performance.) When a certain <a href=/people/4940 target=_blank>Corydon</a> was telling that he used to kiss his wife's neck, breasts, and navel (omphalon), he said now this is really wicked; for even <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> went from <a href=/people/1144 target=_blank>Omphale</a> to <a href=/people/576 target=_blank>Hebe</a>. When <a href=/people/4268 target=_blank>Phyromachus</a> upset the bowl as he was dipping bread into his lentil soup, Lark said, 'He ought to be fined for having himself registered when he does not know how to dine out.' Once a delicious vol-au-vent was passed round at <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>'s table, but always gave out at his place. He said, '<a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, am I drunk, or do I imagine that I am seeing things go round me?' And when the parasite <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a> said that he could not take wine, he remarked, 'You mean you can't take what is mixed with the wine.' And when <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a> arose at a dinner stark naked he said, '<a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a>, you are like an oil-jug; I can see how far you are full.' About the time when <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> accepted the cup from <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a> he said, 'The very man who calls other people neat-wine-goblets has grabbed the biggest one for himself.' And although <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a> was in the habit of bringing gritty loaves of bread to dinner-parties, when somebody brought in still blacker loaves he said that it was not bread, but the black shadows of bread, that the man had brought. </p>                        </div>

And when <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> asked him why he laughed when he could not overhear what they said, he replied, 'I put my trust in you, that whatever was said was laughable.' His son <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> also kept a large number of persons who flattered him, whom the people used to call 'Dionysokolakes.' These persons pretended at dinner that they were near-sighted, since <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> did not have good eyesight; and they would feel for the viands set before them as if they could not see, until <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> guided their hands toward the dishes.

He says that it was customary throughout <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> to offer sacrifices to the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> from house to house, spending the night in a drunken condition round their statues, and dancing round the goddesses. But <a href=/people/2223 target=_blank>Democles</a>, disregarding the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a>, and declaring that men should not bother with lifeless divinities, went and danced round <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>. Some time later <a href=/people/2223 target=_blank>Democles</a> went on an embassy with others, all being transported on board a trireme. He was accused by the others of stirring up sedition during the journey, and injuring <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>'s negotiations involving the public interest. at this <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> became very angry, but <a href=/people/2223 target=_blank>Democles</a> said that the quarrel between himself and his colleagues on the embassy had arisen because, after dinner, the latter, taking some of the sailors into their company, used to sing the paeans of <a href=/people/456 target=_blank>Phrynichus</a> and <a href=/people/695 target=_blank>Stesichorus</a> or again <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a>, whereas he himself, in company with volunteers, used to render the paeans composed by <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>. Moreover, he promised that he would make clear the proof of this; for the accusers could not even remember the number of his songs, while he was prepared to sing them all himself in their proper order. When the anger of <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> was thus allayed, <a href=/people/2223 target=_blank>Democles</a> resumed: 'You would do me a favour, <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, if you would command someone who knows it to teach me the paean composed in honour of <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>; for I hear that you have been occupied with that.' Once, when some friends had been invited to dinner by <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, as he entered the room, said, 'Letters have been sent to us, my friends, from the officers who were dispatched to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>.'

These, I believe, all the adulation before described brought in, like a deluge or some dreadful visitation from a god. Concerning this city <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> was right in saying that it had far better go to the vultures rather than to the flatterers, for the latter devour good men while they are still alive. <a href=/people/1329 target=_blank>Anaxilas</a>, at any rate, also testifies in . . .; 'Flatterers are worms in rich men's property. Each worm bores his way into a man of simple character, and lodged there, eats him until he makes him as empty as a wheat-stalk. After that the rich man is a mere husk, while the flatterer bites another.' And so <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> says in the <a href=/people/473 target=_blank>Phaedrus</a>: 'In the flatterer is a dreadful creature and a great nuisance; yet nature has none the less added a mixture of entertainment not wholly unrefined.' And <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, in the essay On Flattery, says that <a href=/people/2902 target=_blank>Myrtis</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=person long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>, when <a href=/people/599 target=_blank>Cleonymus</a> the dancer and also parasite persisted often in seating himself beside <a href=/people/2902 target=_blank>Myrtis</a> and his fellow-judges, being desirous of being seen in company with the distinguished men of the city, caught him by the ear, and as he dragged him out of the judgement-hall in full sight of the crowd, said, 'You shall not dance here, and you shall not hear our deliberations either.' <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> says in Marriage: 'For the parasite upsets the general, the potentate, one's friends, and our cities with his malicious tongue, though he may have delighted them for a little while. But the fact is that today an evil condition has made its insidious way into the mob; our judgements are awry, and anything to please is the rule.' For this reason the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> were quite right in demolishing the town called Kolakeia (Flattery) inhabited by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388224RMal class=ethnic long=22.4 lat=38.8>Malians</a>, as <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> says in the thirtieth book. </p>                        </div>

He begins by representing <a href=/people/9438 target=_blank>Gergithius</a> himself, from whom the book has its title, as having been one of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s parasites. And then he goes on to explain that flattery renders base the characters of flatterers, necessary their associates look on them with contempt. And the proof is that flatterers will submit to anything, though well aware of the nature of the acts which people dare to perpetrate against them. Further, those who listen to flattery become inflated with it, and that makes them frivolous and conceited, and causes them to entertain an exaggerated opinion of their own endowments. Well, <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> goes on to tell about a lad who was a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347326PPal class=place long=32.5829 lat=34.7064>Paphos</a> and a prince in rank. 'This lad,' he says, not mentioning his name, 'used to indulge in overweening luxury, lying at full length on a silver-footed couch spread with a smooth carpet of the most expensive kinds produced in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=place long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardis</a>. Over him was laid a purple robe with heavy nap on both sides, encased in a covering made of mallow fibres. Under his head he had three cushions of fine linen edged with purple, by means of which he avoided the heat; at his feet he had two crimson cushions of the kind called <a href=/people/476 target=_blank>Doric</a>; on these he lay at full length dressed in a white shirt. All the rulers in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a> have accepted the custom of having about them the class of aristocratic parasites as an institution useful to them. For to possess them is very much in the manner of despots. Of these parasites, like some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=ethnic long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagites</a>, no one knows the number or how they look, excepting the most conspicuous. The parasites in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=place long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salamis</a>, from whom are derived all the others in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, are divided into classes according to family, and are called in the one case Gergini, in the other Promalanges. Of these two classes the Gergini mingle with the people in their city, in their workshops or in the markets, and listen like spies to what they say, and they make daily reports of what they hear to the bosses, as they are called. The Promalanges in turn make scrutiny, if anything reported by the Gergini appears to deserve scrutiny, being a kind of investigators. And the intercourse of these persons with all others is so skilful and plausible, that I am convinced, as they themselves declare, that the seed of those aristocratic parasites has been from them deported in foreign parts; what is more, they take no ordinary pride in the profession, merely because they enjoy honours at the hands of the kings, but they also say that one of the Gergini was a descendant of those <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> whom <a href=/people/361 target=_blank>Teucer</a> received as his share of the captives and with whom he colonized <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>; and that he, sailing with a few men along the coast in the direction of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390271RAio class=place long=27.1 lat=39>Aeolis</a>, in order to close and settle in the land of their forefathers, founded a city in the region of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397268LIda class=place long=26.8423 lat=39.6922>Ida</a>, taking along some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=ethnic long=28 lat=40>Mysians</a> with them; this city was in old times called Gergina after their race, but today is called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392277UGer class=place long=27.6608 lat=39.1909>Gergitha</a>. Some members of that expedition, it appears, were separated from it and settled in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=place long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a>, since the inhabitants there are of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a> race; they did not come from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396218PTri class=place long=21.7647 lat=39.5564>Tricca</a>, as some aver whose ignorance, I fancy, it is not given even to the sons of <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a> to cure. There have also been in our part of the world, in the days of <a href=/people/2411 target=_blank>Glus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=person long=28.7 lat=37.01>Carian</a>, women called Kolakides, subject to female despots. A remnant of these crossed over to the mainland, being summoned to come to the wives of <a href=/people/667 target=_blank>Artabazus</a> and of <a href=/people/1294 target=_blank>Mentor</a>, and had their names changed to Ladder-lasses from the following practice: in their desire to please the women who summoned them, they made ladders of themselves so that the women riding in carts could mount or dismount on their backs. To that pitch of luxury, not to call it abjectness, did they by their devices bring these very stupid women. Therefore they, borne by the turn of fate out of their luxurious circumstances, lived lives of hard necessity in their old age; while other women, of those who have taken over these manners that were in vogue in our country, were brought to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> after they had fallen from their high estate, and it is not even decent to say how they affected by their intercourse the princesses and other women of rank in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>; this much may be said, that by the reciprocal practice of their magic enchantments they became veritable <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>-chasers and street-walkers, replete with every abomination. Thus flattery is the cause of many terrible evils to those who complacently allow it for the pleasure of being flattered.' </p>                        </div>

For his slaves stood at a little distance from his couch, clad in short tunics; and there were three men, who are in fact the occasion of this entire discussion, and who have given rise to certain names which we use. One was seated at the foot of the couch, with the legs of the lad in his lap wrapped in a thin cloth; what he was doing is of course plain even without the telling. He is called by the natives Stuffed in, because even when they do not invite him he none the less manages most skilfully you his flattery to force himself into their parties. The second man was on a stool which lay right by the couch, and while the young man let his hand drop he clung to it, and as he embraced it he separated the fingers and stroked each of them in turn, pulling and stretching them out; the man, therefore, who first gave him the name of Cucumber appears to have spoken aptly. The third man, the noblest of all, was the Beast, who was the chief actor in this degrading service. He stood next to the lad's head and shared in his cushions of fine linen, bending over into them very affectionately. With his left hand he added ornaments to the boy's locks, while with his right he ingratiated himself by moving back and forth and raising up and down a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387268UPho class=demonym long=26.7532 lat=38.6704>Phocaean</a> fan, at the same time keeping off the flies!

Attracted by the smell of this they came flying, ready to perch on his head; but slaves who sat by shooed them off.

The physician <a href=/people/3757 target=_blank>Androcydes</a> used to say that flattery gets its name from the way in which the flatterer (kolax) glues himself (kollasthai) to the company; but I think that it comes from the easy good-nature (eukolia), that is to say, dexterity, with which he submits to any treatment, being the sort of person who takes on his own shoulders the burden of another's character, never restive under anything, no matter how degrading.'

When, I say, they were at a great distance from the land on their voyage, they tied up <a href=/people/3367 target=_blank>Cnopus</a> hand and foot and threw him into the sea; and landing at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a>, where they obtained forces from the tyrants there, <a href=/people/6205 target=_blank>Amphiclus</a> and Polytecnus, they sailed by night to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384265PEry class=place long=26.4808 lat=38.3828>Erythrae</a>.

On the contrary, they set up a court and tried cases outside the gates, wrapped in purple cloaks and dressed in tunics with purple borders. They also shod their feet in summer with sandals of many lacings, while in winter they always made a practice of walking about in feminine footgear; they affected long hair and took pains to have it curly; their heads were distinguished by yellow and purple fillets; they also wore solid gold jewelry, like women. Further, they compelled the citizens to serve them in some cases as their stool-bearers, in others as wand-bearers; others still they compelled to clean the streets thoroughly. They summoned the sons of some to their joint gatherings, others they commanded to bring their own wives and daughters; and they visited with extreme penalties those who disobeyed. If any member of their clique died, they would collect the citizens with their wives and children and compel them to sing dirges for the dead, to beat their breasts under compulsion, and to cry shrilly and loudly with their voices, while a lash-bearer who forced them to do this stood over them. this went on until <a href=/people/2030 target=_blank>Hippotes</a>, the brother of <a href=/people/3367 target=_blank>Cnopus</a>, came upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384265PEry class=place long=26.4808 lat=38.3828>Erythrae</a> with an armed force during a festival, and reinforced by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384265PEry class=ethnic long=26.4808 lat=38.3828>Erythraeans</a> attacked the tyrants; and a for putting to the torture many of their partisans, they stabbed <a href=/people/6743 target=_blank>Ortyges</a> to death while he was attempting to escape, but their wives and children they tortured terribly, and so set free their native land.' </p>                        </div>

He says: '<a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a> had been a slave, one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> penestae. He enjoyed great power with <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> on account of his flattery and because, when he was with him at drinking-bouts, he danced and caused mirth. <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> dispatched him to destroy the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398232RPer class=ethnic long=22 lat=39.85>Perrhaebi</a> and to take charge of affairs in that quarter. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=person long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> always had that kind of men about him, in whose company he usually spent the greater part of his time because of their love of drinking and their vulgarity, and with them he used to hold deliberations on the most important matters.' Concerning him <a href=/people/982 target=_blank>Hegesander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=person long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> relates also this, that he used to send a large quantity of small coin to the wits assembled in the precinct of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237DDio class=person long=23.7343 lat=37.9674>Diomean</a> <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, and would order certain persons to write down what they said and report it to him. <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>, again, in the twenty-sixth book of the Histories, says that '<a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, knowing that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> were licentious and wanton in their mode of life, got up parties them and tried to amuse them in every way, dancing and rioting and submitting to every kind of licentiousness; he was himself naturally vulgar, getting drunk every day and delighting in those pursuits which tended in that direction and in those men, the so called gallants, who said and did laughable things. And so he won most <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> who consorted with him by parties rather than by presents.' The <a href=/people/5969 target=_blank>Siceliot</a> <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> behaved similarly, as the comic poet <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a> represents him in the play bearing the same name as the tyrant: 'Yet, toward the dignified and toward all flatterers he is rather stern, but toward those who jest at his expense he is good-tempered; and so thinks that only these are free men, even if they be slaves.' </p>                        </div>

Therefore he took pains that they should have these amusements, and even made them competitors in every kind of wickedness and disgusting conduct. For what scandalous or appalling act was not in their programme? Or what honourable and upright act was not missing? Did they not in some cases, grown men though they were, go shaved and depilated, in other cases even go so far as to consort infamously with each other, though they were bearded In fact each had in his train two or three prostitute companions, and they themselves granted to others the same favours. Hence one may rightly assume that they were not companions, but 'mistresses,' and might rightly call them not soldiers, but harlots; for they were man-killers by nature, man-harlots by habit. In addition, they loved drunkenness instead of soberness, they were eager to plunder and murder instead of living decent lives. Truth-telling and keeping promises they regarded as no part of their duty, whereas they readily assumed the odium of perjury and cheating in the most august sanctuary. Careless of what they had, they itched for what they had not, though they owned a whole section of Europe. For I believe that though these companions numbered at that time not more than eight hundred, yet they enjoyed the profits of as much land as any ten thousand Greeks possessing the richest and most extensive territory.' And with reference to <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> fights a similar account in the twenty-first book: '<a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, the tyrant of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, patronized those who wasted their property in drunken revels and gambling and similar licence; for he wanted all to be utterly abandoned and degenerate, and these he treated well.' </p>                        </div>

Some, remaining with <a href=/people/854 target=_blank>Phorbas</a>, went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282PIal class=place long=28.143 lat=36.399>Ialysus</a>, while others under <a href=/people/8127 target=_blank>Periergus</a> landed in the territory of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363279PKam class=place long=27.9212 lat=36.3362>Camirus</a>. It is said that on that occasion <a href=/people/8127 target=_blank>Periergus</a> cursed <a href=/people/854 target=_blank>Phorbas</a>, and for that reason the islands are called <a href=/people/8851 target=_blank>Araeae</a>. But <a href=/people/854 target=_blank>Phorbas</a> was shipwrecked, and he and <a href=/people/1895 target=_blank>Parthenia</a>, the sister of <a href=/people/854 target=_blank>Phorbas</a> and <a href=/people/8127 target=_blank>Periergus</a>, swam across to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282PIal class=place long=28.143 lat=36.399>Ialysus</a>, near the place called Schedia. There they were met by Thamneus, who happened to be hunting in Schedia, and he invited them to come home for entertainment, dispatching a slave to tell his wife to get food ready, since he was bringing guests. But when he arrived home and found that nothing had been prepared, he placed the grain on the mill himself, and having performed all other duties proper to the occasion, he entertained them. <a href=/people/854 target=_blank>Phorbas</a> was so delighted with this hospitality that when he was dying he solemnly commanded his friends that they should perform the funeral rites in his honour only through the medicament of freemen; and so this custom remained in the case of the festival of <a href=/people/854 target=_blank>Phorbas</a>. For only freemen are the servitors, and it is unholy for a slave to come near. And since this is one of <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>'s questions, I mean that having to do with servants, let us also, I pray you, consider and recite something of what we, as it happens, read about them long ago. Well, <a href=/people/749 target=_blank>Pherecrates</a> says in The Savages: 'In those days nobody had a slave, a <a href=/people/12062 target=_blank>Manes</a> or a Sekis, but the women had to toil by themselves over all the housework. And what is more, they would grind the corn at early dawn, so that the village rang with the touch of the handmills.' And <a href=/people/796 target=_blank>Anaxandrides</a> in <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a> says; 'Slaves, my good sir, have no citizenship anywhere, yet <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> shifts their bodies in all kinds of ways.

And so in this manner the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409312RMar class=ethnic long=31.2 lat=40.86>Mariandynians</a> put themselves in subjection to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=place long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heracleots</a>, promising to serve them continually so long as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=place long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heracleots</a> provided for their needs, though they stipulated in addition that there should be no selling of any of them beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=demonym long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heracleot</a> territory, but that they should stay right in their own territory.' Perhaps, therefore, it is for that reason that the epic poet <a href=/people/958 target=_blank>Euphorion</a> calls the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409312RMar class=ethnic long=31.2 lat=40.86>Mariandynians</a> tribute-bearers: 'Tribute-bearers shall they be called, secretly dreading their masters.' And <a href=/people/659 target=_blank>Callistratus</a> also, the disciple of <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>, says that they called the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409312RMar class=ethnic long=31.2 lat=40.86>Mariandynians</a> tribute-bearers to take away the sting in the term slave, as the <a href=/people/4302 target=_blank>Spartiates</a> did in the case of the <a href=/people/12102 target=_blank>Helots</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> in the case of the <a href=/people/5877 target=_blank>Penestae</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=ethnic long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretans</a> in the case of the <a href=/people/7505 target=_blank>Clarotae</a>.

The <a href=/people/7505 target=_blank>Clarotae</a> are so called because they are allotted. <a href=/people/225 target=_blank>Ephorus</a>, in the third book of the Histories, says: '<a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=ethnic long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretans</a> call their slaves <a href=/people/7505 target=_blank>Clarotae</a> from the lot which is cast for them. For these certain festivals are regularly held in the district of <a href=/people/1727 target=_blank>Cydon</a>, during which no free persons enter the city, but the slaves are masters of everything and have power to flog the freemen.' <a href=/people/1717 target=_blank>Sosicrates</a>, in the second book of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> History, says that 'the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=ethnic long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretans</a> call their public slaves mnoia, their private slaves aphamiotae, their subject population perioeci.' Osiadas records the like also in the fourth book of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> History. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> call by the name of penestae those who are not slaves from birth, but taken prisoners in war; and the comic poet <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> stretches the meaning of the word when he says: 'The wrinkled councillors of Master Poorman.' <a href=/people/377 target=_blank>Philocrates</a>, in the second book of the Thessalica (if this height be genuine), says that the penestae are also called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>-slaves. <a href=/people/3767 target=_blank>Archemachus</a>, in the third book of the Euboica, says that 'of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=ethnic long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotians</a> who settled the country round <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385229UArn class=place long=22.8616 lat=38.5112>Arne</a>, those who did not depart into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a> but came to love their new country, gave themselves up as slaves to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> according to a stipulation by which the latter were neither to carry them out of the country nor put them to death, while they themselves were to till the land for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> and render them the contributions due. These persons, therefore, who stayed behind according to this agreement and surrendered themselves were originally called menestae (stayers), though today they are called penestae. And many of them are better off than their masters.' <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, to cite him also, calls them latreis('servants') in <a href=/people/548 target=_blank>Phrixus</a>, thus: 'Servant-toiler of my ancient home.' </p>                        </div>

Of all Greek forms of slavery, the <a href=/people/12102 target=_blank>Helot</a> system of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> is perhaps the one which might arouse most doubt and dispute, some maintaining that it is good, others that it is not. Less dispute might arise in the case of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=demonym long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heracleot</a> system of enslaving the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409312RMar class=ethnic long=31.2 lat=40.86>Mariandynians</a>, and again in the case of the penestae class among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a>. Looking at these and all other systems, what are we to do in the matter of slave property? For there is nothing sound in a slave's soul, and no one in possession of his sense ought to trust them in anything. The wisest of poets says: Far-seeing <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> takes away half the understanding of men whom the day of slavery deposes. Difficult, then, is this form of property, as has often been demonstrated in fact by the many insurrections of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372218RMes class=ethnic long=21.8 lat=37.2>Messenians</a>, and the great evils which occur in states possessing many slaves who speak the same language, and again the manifold deeds of robbery and sufferings and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, inflicted by the Rovers, as they are called. With an eye to all this, one might be puzzled to know what to do in the case of all such people. Two courses are left open — those who are to be slaves must not come from the same country, nor, so far as possible, speak the same language; secondly, we must treat them properly, not merely for their sakes, but even more out of respect for ourselves, and so never do violence to them. one must punish one's slaves according to their deserts, not admonishing them as one would freemen and so making them conceited; practically every address to a slave should be a command, and one should on no account joke with them in any way, whether be females or males. This is the kind of conduct toward slaves which many persons adopt, thus very foolishly, by making them conceited, rendering life more difficult for them in serving, and for their masters in ruling.' </p>                        </div>

This is recorded by <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> in the seventeenth book of his Histories: 'The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> were the first Greeks, after the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>, to use slaves, but they did not acquire them in the same way.

The people reduced to slavery were in the first instance called helots, in the second penestae. But the slaves whom the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> own are derived from non-Greek peoples, and they pay a price for them.' This, then, is the account given by <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>. But I believe that the Deity became wroth at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> for this practice, since, at a later time, they were disastrously involved in war on account of their slaves. <a href=/people/2060 target=_blank>Nymphodorus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=person long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a>, at any rate, records the following narrative about them in his Voyage in Asia: 'The slaves of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> ran away from them, and gathering in great numbers started for the mountains (since the island is rough and wooded), inflicting injury on the country-houses of their masters. A little before our time, a certain slave, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> themselves tell the story, ran away and made his abode in the mountains. Being a brave man and successful in warfare, he led the fugitive slaves as a king leads an army. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> often sent expeditions to attack him, but were quite unable to effect anything. When <a href=/people/7615 target=_blank>Drimacus</a> (for that was the fugitive's name) saw that they were throwing their lives away without result, he said to them: <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> and masters! The trouble you are in because of your slaves will never stop. Why should it, when it happens according to an oracle given by the god? If, however, you will make a treaty with me and let us alone in peace and quiet, I will initiate many blessings for you. So the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> made a treaty and an armistice with him for a certain period, and he devised measures, weights, and a special seal. Showing the seal to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> he said: Whatever I take from any one of you, I will take according to these measures and weights, and after taking what I require I will seal up your storehouses with this seal and leave them unharmed. Those of your slaves who run away I will examine to find out the reason, and if in my judgement entreaty have run away because they have suffered something irreparable, I will keep them with me, but if they can urge no justification, I will send them back to their masters. The other slaves, therefore, seeing that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> willingly accepted this condition, were much less inclined to run away, because they dreaded the trial before him; while the runaways in his band feared him far more than their own masters, and did everything that he required, obeying him as they would a military officer. For he not only punished the disobedient, but he also would allow none to plunder a field or commit any other act of injury whatever without his consent. On festival days he would sally forth and take from the fields wine and unblemished victims, except what was voluntarily given him by the masters; and if he discovered that anyone was plotting against him or laying an ambush he took vengeance on him. Now the State had proclaimed that it would give a large reward to the man who took him alive or brought in his head, and finally, when this <a href=/people/7615 target=_blank>Drimacus</a> had grown old, he summoned his favourite boy to a certain place and said: I have loved you more than anyone else in the world; you are my favourite, my son, everything that I have. But I have lived long enough, whereas you are young and in the flower of life. What, then, remains? You must become a good and noble man. Since, now, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=demonym long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chian</a> State offers a large sum to the man who kills me, and promises him freedom, you must cut off my head and carry it to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a>; then you shall receive the money from the State and live in wealth. The lad remonstrated, but was finally persuaded; cutting off the head of <a href=/people/7615 target=_blank>Drimacus</a> he received from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> the reward that had been proclaimed, and after burying the body of the runaway he removed to his own country. And once more the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> suffered injuries at the hands of their slaves, and when they were plundered they remembered the probity of the dead runaway, and founded a shrine in his country, giving it the name of the Kindly <a href=/people/1220 target=_blank>Hero</a>. In his honour, to this very day, fugitive slaves render the first-fruits of everything that they purloin. They say also that he appears to many <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> in their sleep and warns them of plots among their slaves; and those persons to whom he appears go to the place where his shrine is and make offerings to him.' This, then, is the story told by <a href=/people/2060 target=_blank>Nymphodorus</a>. But in many copies, as I have found, the man is not mentioned by name. I imagine that none openly is ignorant, either, of the story told by the noble <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> concerning Panionius of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=person long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a> and the just deserts which he suffered for having made eunuchs of freeborn boys, and selling them. <a href=/people/2904 target=_blank>Nicolas</a> the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a> and <a href=/people/645 target=_blank>Poseidonius</a> the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a> both say in their Histories that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> were enslaved by <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=person long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocian</a> and handed over in chains to their own slaves, to be transported to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=place long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchis</a>; so truly did the Deity vent his wrath upon them for being the first to use purchased slaves, although most people did their own work when it came to menial services. Perhaps, therefore, it was because of these experiences that the proverb arose, 'A <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=demonym long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chian</a> hath bought him a master,' used by <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a> in The Friend. </p>                        </div>

Yes, and there were roasted fillets nicely dressed with all sorts of spiced sauces. Close at hand, too, on platters, were whole hams with shin and all, most tender, and trotters well boiled which gave forth a pleasant steam; <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>-guts and pork-ribs most daintily browned sat perched on cakes of finest meal. And two polenta with its snowy covering of milk showered over it in pans, and beestings in slices. B.

For roast thrushes, dressed for a rechauffe, flew round our mouths entreating us to swallow them as we lay stretched among the myrtles and anemones. And the apples!

Girls in silk shawls, just reaching the flower of youth, and shorn of the hair on their bodies, drew through a funnel full cups of red wine with fine bouquet for all who wished to drink.

But today, though they select what is useful, they are also borrowing from their enemies pernicious ideals. As <a href=/people/645 target=_blank>Poseidonius</a> says, their ancestral traits used to be rugged endurance, a frugal manner of life, a plain and simple use of material possessions in general, a religion, moreover, wonderful in its devotion to deity; upright dealing, and great care in avoiding wrongdoing in their relations with all men; associated with these qualities was the pursuit of agriculture. This may be seen in the ancestral festivals which we celebrate; for in their performance we proceed in ways regularly appointed and defined, we bring appointed offerings; what we say in prayers or do in the sacred offices is plain and frugal; again, we do not overstep nature either in our dress or in the care of our bodies or in the offering of first-fruits; and so we wear clothes and shoes which are cheap, on our heads we put hats made of rough sheepskins; the utensils which we bring are of earthenware or bronze, and in them are the simplest foods and drinks in the world, because we think it absurd that while we bring to the gods offerings ordained by ancestral custom, we should indulge ourselves in exotic luxuries; and yet of course what we spend on ourselves is measured by our necessities, whereas for the gods there are certain first-fruits. <a href=/people/1024 target=_blank>Mucius</a> <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a>, <a href=/people/499 target=_blank>Aelius</a> <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a>, and <a href=/people/1250 target=_blank>Rutilius</a> <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a> (who wrote the history of our country) are three Romans who observed in their own lives the Fannian Law. This law ordained that not more than three persons outside the family should be entertained, on market-days not more than five; these last occurred thrice a month. The law would not permit the purchase of food of more than two and a half shillings' worth. It permitted the yearly expenditure of fifteen talents for smoked meat and for all green and leguminous boiled vegetables which the earth bears. But though expenditures were very small because law-breakers and spendthrifts caused a rise in the price of commodities, these men whom I have mentioned managed to attain a more liberal mode of living without breaking the law. <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a>, for example, bought game birds from his own peasants, <a href=/people/1250 target=_blank>Rutilius</a> bought fish from those of his slaves who were fishermen, at threepence the pound, including even the delicacy called the stalk; this is a part known under this name taken from the sea-<a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>. <a href=/people/1024 target=_blank>Mucius</a>, again, fixed prices in each case in a similar way with those who were under obligations to him. Out of so many thousands of people, then, these were the only men who religiously observed the law and refused to accept even the smallest gift; but they themselves made presents to others, large presents, in fact, to the friends who were inspired by desire of self-culture; for they were adherents of the doctrines of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BSPo class=place long=23.72265 lat=37.97635>Stoa</a>. The first man who led the way to that extravagant luxury which flourishes in modern times was <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, who defeated <a href=/people/2429 target=_blank>Mithradates</a> on the high seas. This is recorded by <a href=/people/2904 target=_blank>Nicolas</a> the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a>. For on his return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> after the defeat of <a href=/people/2429 target=_blank>Mithradates</a>, as well as that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=person long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> <a href=/people/12245 target=_blank>Tigranes</a>, he celebrated a triumph, rendered an account of his operations in the war, and then, abandoning his earlier sobriety, he went to smash in a career of extravagance. He became the first to introduce luxury among the Romans, after he had harvested for himself the wealth of the two kings I have mentioned. And <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, whom everybody knows, was disgusted, as <a href=/people/160 target=_blank>Polybius</a> records in the thirty-first book of the Histories, and cried out that 'certain persons had imported foreign luxuries into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; they had, he said, bought a cask of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=demonym long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontic</a> smoked fish for three hundred shillings, and beautiful boys for more than the cost of broad acres.' </p>                        </div>

(275C) <br />Now that the dinner was in full swing, the <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynics</a>, thinking that the Eating-festival was to be celebrated, cheered up more than anyone else. And <a href=/people/1240 target=_blank>Cynulcus</a> said: While we dine, <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> (since you like to feast on words), I will put a question to you. Who is it that has used Eating-festival and Eating-and-drinking-festival as a word for a holiday? <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> was puzzled, and told the slaves to stop passing the food although it was already evening. I cannot accommodate you, my learned friend; so now is your chance to speak out, and that will make you enjoy your dinner more. <a href=/people/1240 target=_blank>Cynulcus</a> replied: If you will confess your gratitude when I have instructed you, I will speak; and when the other promised, he went on: <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a>, a disciple of <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> and native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367345PSol class=place long=34.539 lat=36.742>Soli</a>, says something like the following in the first book of his work On Riddles (I retain the memory of the word because I like it so much): 'phagesia (eating-festival), others phageisposia (eating-and-drinking-festival), is the name they give to the holiday; this festival has become extinct, as is that of the rhapsodists which they celebrated . . . and that of the <a href=/people/651 target=_blank>Dionysia</a>. In it the rhapsodists came forward and performed their rhapsody as an act of homage to the several gods.' Thus <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a>. If you don't believe it, comrade, I own the book and will and begrudge it to you; you will learn a lot from it and will be rich in questions to propound.

After all had expressed their admiration for the learning of <a href=/people/1240 target=_blank>Cynulcus</a>, <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a> said: To cite a similar case, there used to be celebrated in my native <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> also a festival named Flagon-bearing, of which <a href=/people/132 target=_blank>Eratosthenes</a> gives an account in the treatise entitled <a href=/people/509 target=_blank>Arsinoe</a>. He says: '<a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> founded all kinds of festivals and sacrifices, particularly those connected with <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>; and <a href=/people/509 target=_blank>Arsinoe</a> asked the man who carried the olive-branches what day he was then celebrating and what festival it was. He replied: It is called Flagon-bearing, and the celebrants eat what is brought to them while they recline on beds of rushes, and each man drinks out of a special flagon which he brings from his own house. When he had passed on, she looked at us and said: That must indeed be a dirty get-together. For the assembly can only be that of a miscellaneous mob who have themselves served with a stale and utterly unseemly feast. ' But if she had liked that kind of festival, the queen would, of course, never have grown tired of getting up the very same offerings which were customary at the Feast of Pitchers. For there, to be sure, they feast in solitary fashion, but the food is provided by him who invites them to the entertainment. </p>                        </div>

For <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> does not speak with face muffled, but in a loud voice he declares: As for myself, I cannot conceive of the Good if I exclude either et pleasure derived from taste or that derived from sexual intercourse. On this theory, in fact, the wise man can hold that even a prodigal's way of life is blameless, provided that the element of freedom from anxiety and the element of cheerfulness be added in his favour. Hence the comic poets, when they run down pleasure and incontinence, shout for helpers and reinforcements. Baton, in The Fellow-Cheater, portrays a father complaining of his son's nurse and saying: You have taken my boy and ruined him, you foul wretch, and have lured him into a life foreign to his nature. He now takes a morning cup through your influence, something he never did before. Nurse: And so, master, you blame me if he has seen a bit of life? Father: Life! Do you call that life? Nurse: Yes, the wise so call it. <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, anyhow, says that pleasure is the highest Galley; everybody knows that. You cannot have it any other way; whereas by living well, of course, all live rightly. Perhaps you will grant me that? Father: Tell me then, have you ever seen a true philosopher drunk, or beguiled by the doctrines you preach. Nurse: Ay, every mother's son of them. For those who walk with eyebrows uplifted and seek in their discussions and discourses for 'the wise man', as if he were a runaway slave, once you set a sea-lizard before them, know so well what 'topic' to attack first, seek so skilfully for the 'gist or head of the matter,' that everybody is amazed at their knowledge. And in The Murderer, as it is entitled, Baton, after ridiculing one of the 'nice' philosophers, proceeds: He might have taken his place on the couch with a fair lady, and had two pots of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=demonym long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbian</a>. That is the wise man, that is the chief good. <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> used to say only what I am saying now. If everybody lived the life which I am living, nobody would be a profligate or an adulterer — no, not one! So <a href=/people/2050 target=_blank>Hegesippus</a> in True Friends: A. The wise <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, when someone asked him to explain what the chief Good is that men are always seeking, replied, '<a href=/people/626 target=_blank>Pleasure</a>.' B. Bravo, my wise and able fellow! In fact there is no good at all better than eating. A. Right; for the chief Good is a property of pleasure. </p>                        </div>

Of <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, <a href=/people/12260 target=_blank>Timon</a> says in his Satires, third book: indulging his belly, than which nothing is more greedy. For it was, in fact, for the sake of the belly and the pleasures of the flesh in general that this man flattered <a href=/people/291 target=_blank>Idomeneus</a> and <a href=/people/435 target=_blank>Metrodorus</a>. And <a href=/people/435 target=_blank>Metrodorus</a> himself, making no attempt to hide these noble principles, says, I believe: Yes, <a href=/people/250 target=_blank>Timocrates</a>, devoted to the study of nature as you are, it is indeed the belly, the belly and nothing else, which any philosophy that proceeds according to nature makes its whole concern. <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, in fact, was the teacher of these men, and he used to maintain with a shout: The beginning and root of all good is the satisfaction of the belly, and all wise and notable things have in this their standard of reference. Again, in the work on the End he says something like this: As for myself, I cannot conceive of the Good if I exclude the pleasures derived from taste, or those derived from sexual intercourse, or those derived from entertainments to which we listen, or those derived from the motions of a figure delightful to the eye. And proceeding further (<a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> says), <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> declares: We should prize the Good and the virtues and such things as that, provided they give us pleasure; if they do not give us pleasure, we should renounce them. </p>                        </div>

Ay, heap up mighty wealth in your house, if you so desire, and live in tyrannical state; if, however, joy in these things be absent, I would not purchase all the rest from a man at the price of the shadow of smoke, in comparison with pleasure. <a href=/people/1454 target=_blank>Philetaerus</a> in The Huntress: For what, pray, ought a mere mortal to do except to live his life day by day in pleasure, if have the wherewithal? Nay, that is the only thing that one who looks on human circumstances should consider; as for the morrow, he should not worry, either, about what it shall be. It is altogether fussy to lay up a store of money in the house to grow stale. In <a href=/people/10621 target=_blank>Oinopion</a>, also, <a href=/people/1454 target=_blank>Philetaerus</a> says: all mortals who live unhappily when they have abundant substance I for one count as despicable.

Why do ye give up the happy life, and devote all your thought to injuring one another by making war? Can it be that some boorish fate today presides over our lives — a fate which knows no culture at all, is completely ignorant of what is bad or what is good, and in some random way tosses us about as chance decrees. I think so indeed. For what fate, were she really a Greek, would prefer to see men thrashed by one another and lying prone as corpses, when they might be jolly, playful, just a bit tipsy, enjoying the sound of music as they should? Tell me, yourself, sweetest lady, say that our fate is indeed a boor. And going on <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> says: Won't this be living what they call the very life of the gods? How much pleasanter things would be in our communities than they are today, if we completely changed our mode of living: every <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> up to thirty years engaged in drinking; the Knights, wreathed and perfumed before the dawn, marching forth to revel in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a> for ten days; the cabbage-vending <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a> boiling them undisturbed; our allies dismissed to public bath; the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=ethnic long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboeans</a> mixing wine.

And <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a>, in his work On Materials , says that some call it <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>, others beauteous-of name; its flesh is Cartilaginous, juicy, and easily eliminated, but not especially wholesome. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says that the beauty-fish, like the amias, has jagged teeth; it is carnivorous and gregarious. <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>, in The <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> , includes elops (sturgeon) in his list, but says nothing of its being the same as the beauty-fish or the beauteous-of name. Of the elops he has the following: as for the highly prized elops (the same is worth its weight in bronze), <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> took that also, but one only, and bade that it be put down for himself; and for his consort a part of another. But <a href=/people/981 target=_blank>Dorion</a>, in his work On Fishes, says that the anthias and the beauty-fish are different, and so also are the beauteous-of name and the elops. </p>                        </div>

Others understand the term sacred fish (hieron) to be the same as consecrated; still others say it means great, like the sacred might of <a href=/people/10603 target=_blank>Alcinous</a>; some, again, explain the word (hieron) as meaning that which rushes (hiemenon) up stream (roun). <a href=/people/1776 target=_blank>Cleitarchus</a>, in the seventh book of his Glossary, says that sailors call the pompilo a sacred fish because it escorts ships from the high seas into the haven; hence it is called pompilo, being really a gilt-head. And <a href=/people/132 target=_blank>Eratosthenes</a> in <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> says: They left a portion of their catch — wasses still alive, or a barbed mullet, or the hawk-wrasse, or the swift-coursing sacred fish which is golden over its eyes. In the light of our dissertation on fish, let the noble <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> ask what <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a>, in his excellent Counsels, means when he says of the smoked fish of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411291WBos class=place long=29.0753 lat=41.1194>Bosporus</a>: Of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411291WBos class=place long=29.0753 lat=41.1194>Bosporus</a> the whitest that sail forth; but let nothing be added thereto of the tough flesh of the fish which grows in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/460370WMai class=place long=37 lat=46>Maeotic</a> lake — the fish which may not be mentioned in verse.

Of the Aphye there are several kinds. There is first the kind called foam-fish, which, according to <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, is not hatched from spawn, but from the foam on the surface of the sea, whenever it forms thickly after severe showers of rain. A second kind is that called gudgeon; this comes from the small and paltry gobies which live in the sand, and from precisely this small fry others are generated which are called encrasicholi. Another kind of small fry are the young fish hatched from sprats, another from the anchovy, and still another from the small grey mullets which grow in the sand and slime. Of all these kinds the foam-fish is the best. <a href=/people/981 target=_blank>Dorion</a>, in his work On Fishes, speaks of a hepsetus made of gudgeons, as also of smelts; for smelt is the name of a small fish. He also says that the triglitis is a kind of small fry. <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>, in The Marriage of <a href=/people/576 target=_blank>Hebe</a>, enumerates with anchovies and lobsters the different kinds of small fry, distinguishing what is called gonos. <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a> says: Among small fry there is the white, very tenuous and foam-like, which some call gudgeon; another, which is less translucent than this, and thicker; the translucent and thin is superior.

The epic poet <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a>, in the third book of his Glossary, says that they are also called grylli. <a href=/people/670 target=_blank>Eudoxus</a>, in the sixth book of his Description of the <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> , says the many are caught in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=place long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sikyon</a> as large as a man can carry; in some instances one of them even fills a cart.

Not drugged with cheese, not decked on top with herbs, but even when baked it looked exactly like what it was when alive. So mild and gentle was the fire I gave it when I baked the fish, I shall not even be believed. It was exactly as when a hen catches something too big for her to swallow. She runs round and round, holding it fast, and is all eagerness to swallow it. Then other birds begin to chase her. So it was then. The First man to discover the delights of the dish jumped up and ran in flight all round, holding fast to the dish, while others followed close at his heels, I had a right to exult; for some of them seized a bit, others got nothing, others all.

He used, at any rate, to compel those whom he cured of the so called sacred diseases to sign a bond that they would obey him as his slaves if they were restored to health. And one man who became his attendant wore the dress and went by the name of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>; he was <a href=/people/474 target=_blank>Nicostratus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=person long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>, who had been cured of the sacred sickness. <a href=/people/1241 target=_blank>Ephippus</a> mentions them in The Peltast, speaking as follows: Did not <a href=/people/733 target=_blank>Menecrates</a> assert that he was <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, a god? And <a href=/people/474 target=_blank>Nicostratus</a> of argos, that he was another <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>?

Still another of his patients who had been restored to health moved about in his company clad in the garb of <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>. As for <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> himself, dressed in purple, with a gold crown on his head and carrying a sceptre, his feet shod with slippers, he walked about attended by this divine choir. In a letter to King <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> he wrote as follows <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>-<a href=/people/733 target=_blank>Menecrates</a> to <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, greeting: You are kind of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, but I am king of Medicine. You can destroy healthy people whensoever you wish, but I can save the ailing, and the robust who follow my prescriptions I can keep alive without sickness until old age comes. Therefore, while you are attended by a bodyguard of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, I am attended by all posterity. For I, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, give them life. In answer to him <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> wrote, treating him as a crazy man: <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> to <a href=/people/733 target=_blank>Menecrates</a>, come to your senses! In similar vein <a href=/people/733 target=_blank>Menecrates</a> wrote also to <a href=/people/239 target=_blank>Archidamus</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>, and in fact to all his correspondents, never refraining from the name of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. Once <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> invited him, along with his own peculiar band of gods, to a dinner, and made them all recline together on the central couch, which was raised very high and decked in a way befitting the most elaborate ritual. He then set before them a table on which lay an altar and first-fruits of all kinds of products of the earth. And when the food was brought in for the rest of the company, the slaves would burn incense and offer libations before <a href=/people/733 target=_blank>Menecrates</a> and his crew, until at last this new <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, derided as he was, fled with his subject gods from the symposium. This is narrated by <a href=/people/982 target=_blank>Hegesander</a>. But <a href=/people/733 target=_blank>Menecrates</a> is also mentioned by <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a>. Again, <a href=/people/2071 target=_blank>Themison</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=person long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, the favourite of King <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, was proclaimed at the festivals as <a href=/people/2071 target=_blank>Themison</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=person long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedon</a>, the <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> of King <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, according to <a href=/people/4283 target=_blank>Pythermus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=person long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> in the eighth book of his Histories. Not only that, but all the inhabitants also sacrificed to him, calling upon him by the name of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>-<a href=/people/2071 target=_blank>Themison</a>; and whenever any distinguished person offered sacrifice, <a href=/people/2071 target=_blank>Themison</a> was always present in person, reclining on a separate couch and clad in a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>'s skin; he also carried a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> bow and held a club. However that may be, <a href=/people/733 target=_blank>Menecrates</a>, for all that he was the kind of person I have described, never ventured a boast at all approaching that of the cook just mentioned: I have found the elixir of life; men already dead, once they but catch a whiff from the dish, I cause to live again. </p>                        </div>

My good sir, much has been said by many men on the subject of cookery. Either, then, you must prove that you can say something novel, as compared with the other authorities, or else stop making me tired. B. Not so, <a href=/people/2132 target=_blank>Syrus</a>. You had better believe that I am the only one in the world who has discovered the finishing touch in the art of cookery. I didn't learn it casually, by merely wearing an apron for a couple of years, but I have spent my whole life in studying and testing the art in all its branches; all the kinds of vegetables there are, the varieties of small fry, every kind of lentil-soup. Ay, the finishing touch, I tell you. When I chance to be the caterer serving at a funeral-feast, the moment they return from the funeral clad in garments dyed black, I take the lid from the pot and make the mourners laugh. Such is the titillation which courses inside their bodies, as though they were at a wedding. A. What, you mean by serving them lentil soup and small fry? Tell me! B. They are mere side-issues with me. But if I get what I require, and can once arrange the kitchen to suit myself, you shall now, <a href=/people/2132 target=_blank>Syrus</a>, again see the self-same thing which happened in the time of the <a href=/people/605 target=_blank>Sirens</a> of old. The fragrance is such that, to put it simply, not a man of them will be able to pass through this alley. Every passer-by will immediately come to a stop at the front door, open-mouthed, nailed to the wall speechless; until finally one of his friends, some other person who has stopped up his own nostrils, comes running up and pulls him away. A. You are a mighty artist. B. You don't know the man you are speaking to. Why, I know of many persons seated here in the audience who have eaten up their estates for my sake. In the name of the gods, what is the difference, think you, between this fellow and the Charmers in <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a>, who, like the <a href=/people/605 target=_blank>Sirens</a>, caused those who listened to them to forget their mother-cities and wither away in pleasure. </p>                        </div>

Anyway, this fellow says to the man who has hired him: A. You indicate a character that is, to be sure, very charming and gentle, but you have been negligent in one detail. B. What is that? A. You have failed to scrutinize carefully our importance as artists. Or have you, before hiring me, asked of those who know me well? B. No, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, I have not. A. Then look you! You have no notion, perhaps, of how one cook differs from another. B. But I shall know if you tell me. A. To take a fish purchased by someone else and dish it up with an artistic dressing is not within the capacity of any ordinary servant, is it? B. <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> defend us! A. The complete cook is made on a different plan. You must acquire many arts held in high esteem, which anyone that wishes to learn them properly should not approach offhand; no, you must first grasp the art of painting. Then there are other arts, too, which you must learn before the art of cookery, and which it would have been better for you to know about before you spoke to me. They are astrology, geometry, and medicine. For from these you will learn the potencies and tricks of fishes; you will carefully observe the seasons, to see when any fish, in each case, is served untimely or in season. For in pleasures the divergences are it. Sometimes a boax proves to be better than a <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a>. B. That may be so. But what business have you with geometry? A. We regard the kitchen as a globe. We must divide it into segments, and after finding one locus separate it into specific parts as the advantage of the art decrees. These are processes borrowed from geometry. B. Stop! I believe you even if you don't tell me the rest. But what about medicine? A. There are foods which in some cases cause winds and dyspepsia and bring dire vengeance, not nourishment. Every one who dines on hostile food becomes quarrelsome and loses his self-control. For such foods, then, you must find the antidote in the art of medicine, and it's a borrowing of art. Again, it is a matter of military tactics as well — this use of reason and harmony, the knowing just where in cookery each unit is to be posted in number and in quantity. In that respect no one else can be enrolled as my equal. B. Now listen to a few things in answer in my turn. A. Say on. B. Don't bother yourself about me, but go spend the rest of the day at your ease! </p>                        </div>

For things that are to be baked, just see to it that the fire is night too slow (for that is right for boiling but not for baking) nor yet too hot; for then in turn it burns up whatever it touches on the outside, but does not penetrate to the flesh. A man isn't a cook merely because he comes to a customer with soup-ladle and carving-knife, nor even if he tosses some fish into a casserole; no, <a href=/people/603 target=_blank>Wisdom</a> is required in his business. But the cook in The Painter, by <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>, tells us to whom he should let himself out for hire in se words: A. No, <a href=/people/1130 target=_blank>Draco</a>, I won't take you on for a job anywhere unless you are likely to spend the day as a table-maker with a lavish abundance of good materials. For I never go to a man until I first make sure who is giving the sacrificial feast, or why the dinner is given, or what people he has invited. I have a diagram of all classes, those to whom I should let myself out, and those of whom I must beware. Take, for example, the class that belongs in the Port. A sea-captain offers sacrifice to pay a vow; he has lost the mast or rudder of his ship and completely wrecked it, or has tossed the cargo overboard when he was full of water. I let that kind of man alone, because he never does anything for pleasure, but only through custom. While the libations are poured he is calculating how big a share of the loss he can levy on the passengers, reckoning it all up; and so each of them must eat his own vitals. But another man has sailed into port from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>; only a two days' voyage, without a scratch; he has made money, and is overjoyed that he has made a profit of ten or twelve per cent. He is full of talk about his fares, he belches forth his loans, celebrating a debauch with the help of tough panders. Up to him I sidle purring, that moment he disembarks; I put my hand in his, I remind him of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the <a href=/people/1517 target=_blank>Saviour</a>, I am all engrossed in the thought of serving him. That's my way! Again, a lad is gobbling up his patrimony in a love affair, he's a fast worker when it comes to spending. I go to him. Other lads, perhaps, get up a subscription dinner. God save the mark! They put into the urn what money they can find, and as they tightly clutch the fringes of their clothes they cry: 'Who's willing to get up a cheap little dinner in the market?' I let them bawl. For to go there means getting a lot of blows besides, as well as serving the whole night through. If you ask them for your fee, they say, 'First bring me the pot.' 'The lentil soup didn't have any vinegar in it.' Again you ask. 'You'll be the foremost cook to get — a beating.' I might recite an unending list of other customers like these. But where I am taking you now is to a brothel. There a courtesan is celebrating the <a href=/people/430 target=_blank>Adonis</a> festival sumptuously in company with other harlots. You will stuff yourself lavishly, and the folds of your tunic as well, when you amble from there. And in The Treasure , by <a href=/people/5451 target=_blank>Archedicus</a>, another little cook-professor has this to say: First the guests arrive while the fish are still lying uncooked. 'Give employ water for the hands,' they demand. 'Take the fish and be off!' I put the casseroles on the fire, sprinkle the coals with oil thoroughly, and make a blaze. While the greens and the pungent smells from the side-dishes cheer my patron, I boil the fish nicely with all its juices in it and just the right strength of brine, into which any gentleman might dip. Thus, by the sacrifice of a small cup of cheap oil I have saved for my benefit perhaps fifty feasts. <a href=/people/2916 target=_blank>Philostephanus</a>, in The Man from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a>, gives even the names of distinguished cooks in these lines: I know that you, <a href=/people/310 target=_blank>Daedalus</a>, excel all men in your profession and in your keen intelligence, next to <a href=/people/975 target=_blank>Thibron</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> cook surnamed Perfection; and so I have come to pay the price you demanded and fetch you hither. </p>                        </div>

A huge Dogfish is put in my class; I baked the middle slices, but the rest of the stuff I boiled, after making a mulberry sauce. Here I fetch two very large pieces of grey-fish cut near the head, in a big casserole; in it I have added sparingly some herbs, caraway-seed, salt, water, and oil. After that I bought a very fine sea-bass. It shall be served boiled in an oily pickle with herbs, after I have served the meats roasted on spits. Some fine red mullets I purchased, and some lovely wasses. These I <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> tossed upon the coals, and to an oily pickle I added some marjoram. Besides these I bought some cuttle-fish and squids. A boiled squid stuffed with chopped meat is nice, and so are the tentacles of a cuttle-fish when roasted tender. To these I fitted a fresh sauce of many vegetables, and after them came some boiled dished, for which I made a mayonnaise to give them flavour. To top this I bought a very fat conger-eel. I smothered it in a fresher pickle. Some gobies, and some rock-fish of course; I snipped off their heads and smeared their bodies in a batter of flour, just a little, and sent them on the same journey as the shrimps. Then a widowed bonito, a very fine creature, I soaked just enough in oil, wrapped in swaddling-bands of fig-leaves, sprinkled it with marjoram, and hid it like a firebrand in a heap of hot ashes. With it I got some small fry from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379237DPha class=place long=23.7062 lat=37.9373>Phalerum</a>. Half a gill of water poured over this is generous.

Necks, a shilling; yet the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> is my witness, if I had been able to get another neck for myself, and it had been possible to buy it somewhere, I should have hanged myself by the neck which I have before I had ever brought home this stuff.

These fish have no fait either hard or soft, because they are cartilaginous. The spiny shark is peculiar in having a heart of fifth legion shape. The Dogfish in general spawns three times a year at most; it takes the young just hatched into its mouth and emits them again. This is particularly true of the spotted and the thresher sharks. The others cannot do that because of the roughness. <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a>, who affected a mode of life like that of <a href=/people/630 target=_blank>Sardanapalus</a>, speaking of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=demonym long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodian</a> Dogfish, expresses the belief that it is the same as that which is carried about at Roman banquets to the accompaniment of pipes and wreaths; it is, he thinks, the fish called <a href=/people/8670 target=_blank>Accipesius</a>. But the latter is small, longer of snout, and more triangular in shape than the former, and the cheapest and smallest of them is sold for not less than a thousand drachmas, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> currency. The grammarian <a href=/people/1363 target=_blank>Apion</a>, in the work On the Luxury of <a href=/people/2714 target=_blank>Apicius</a>, says that the fish called elops is this <a href=/people/8670 target=_blank>Accipesius</a>.

We need not wonder that they sacrifice eels like other victims, seeing that <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380244PKar class=person long=24.427 lat=38.027>Carystus</a> also, in his work On Diction, says that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387232PHal class=ethnic long=23.1896 lat=38.6583>Halaians</a>, when they celebrate a festival to <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> in the <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a> season, offer to the god in the event of a good catch the first <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a> caught; and this offering is called a thynnaion. Even preserved fish (tarichoi) are offered in sacrifice by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365306PPha class=ethnic long=30.552 lat=36.524>Phaselites</a>. <a href=/people/6529 target=_blank>Heropythus</a>, at any rate, when describing the founding of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365306PPha class=place long=30.552 lat=36.524>Phaselis</a> in his Chronicles of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=person long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophon</a>, says that <a href=/people/5072 target=_blank>Lacius</a>, the organizer of the colony, gave as the price of the territory preserved fish to <a href=/people/5586 target=_blank>Cylabras</a>, a shepherd pasturing his <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> there, since that was what <a href=/people/5586 target=_blank>Cylabras</a> demanded. For when <a href=/people/5072 target=_blank>Lacius</a> offered him his choice of barley or tarichos for the region, he chose the preserved fish; and for that reason the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365306PPha class=ethnic long=30.552 lat=36.524>Phaselites</a> annually sacrifice tarichoi to <a href=/people/5586 target=_blank>Cylabras</a> to this very day. <a href=/people/2916 target=_blank>Philostephanus</a>, in the first book of his work On the Cities of Asia, writes thus: <a href=/people/5072 target=_blank>Lacius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=person long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a> was one of those who came with <a href=/people/872 target=_blank>Mopsus</a>. Some say he was a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361281PLin class=place long=28.0882 lat=36.0913>Lindus</a> and a brother of <a href=/people/4851 target=_blank>Antiphemus</a>, who founded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371143PGel class=place long=14.2587 lat=37.063>Gela</a>.

At this time the sterns of their own vessels collided and were crushed to pieces off the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362304IChe class=place long=30.4072 lat=36.1771>Chelidonian</a> promontory, those under command of <a href=/people/5072 target=_blank>Lacius</a> being late and hitting them in the dark. <a href=/people/5072 target=_blank>Lacius</a>, I say, purchased the land where the city stands today, according to <a href=/people/1762 target=_blank>Manto</a>'s command, from a certain <a href=/people/5586 target=_blank>Cylabras</a>, giving him, it is said, preserved fish. For that is what he chose to receive from among the goods which they brought with them. Hence the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365306PPha class=ethnic long=30.552 lat=36.524>Phaselites</a> offer each year preserved fish as a sacrifice to <a href=/people/5586 target=_blank>Cylabras</a>, honouring him as a hero. Returning to the subject of eels: <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a> says, in his work On Materials, that eels are juicier than all other fish, and that in wholesomeness they surpass most; for they are filling and nutritious. He puts <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> eels in the class of preserved fish. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says that eels like the cleanest water. Hence the keepers of eel-hatcheries keep pouring in clean water for them, since they are suffocated in turbid water. Therefore eel-catchers muddy the water to kill them by suffocation. Having small gills, the breathing-passages are immediately choked up by the mud. Hence even in a storm, when the water is tossed about by winds, they die by suffocation. They copulate by mutual interlocking, and afterwards emit a glutinous substance which, after it has been in the slime, hatches out the young. The keepers of eel-hatcheries say that they feed by night, but by day lie motionless in the mud; they generally live for eight years. In another passage, again, <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> records that they generated neither from eggs nor viviparously, in fact not by copulation at all, but by a decomposition occurring in the mud and slime, as is said to happen in the case of earthworms. Hence, <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> distinguished the nature of eels from that of fishes when he uttered the line: Sore afflicted were the eels and also the fishes beneath the eddies. </p>                        </div>

But <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> writers, according to <a href=/people/1120 target=_blank>Tryphon</a>, although when they use the singular number they know the form in y, nevertheless do not carry out the plural cases to match the singular. For example, <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> says in The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381237DAch class=ethnic long=23.7332 lat=38.0803>Acharnians</a>: Look, my church, at this most valiant eel (enchelyn).

And the accusative singular: For a heron found a buzzard eating a Maeandrian eel (enchelyn) and stole it from him. But <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, in his work On Animals, has a form with i, encheli. Yet when <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> says in The Knights: in fact, what ails you is exactly what the catchers of eels experience. When the pond is still, they catch nothing; but if they roil the mud this way and that, they can catch them. And you make your catch only when you put the city in a turmoil — he plainly shows that the eel is taken from the slime. Hence the name ended in -ys. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, therefore, wishing to show how deeply the fire descended into the river, expressed himself thus: Sore afflicted were the eels and also the fishes.

The best are the cephali as regards both taste and flavour. next to these come the so called cestreis, while the myxini are inferior; poorer than any others are the chellones (although those called bacchi are of very good flavour), and they are not nourishing, and are easily eliminated. <a href=/people/981 target=_blank>Dorion</a>, in his work On Fishes, while he discusses in detail the sea mullet, does not recommend the river mullet. The prickly protuberance on the head of the cestreus he calls a drum, and says that the Cephalinus, also called blepsias, is different from the cephalus. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, in the fifth book of The Parts of Animals, says that among the mullets, the chellones begin to gestate in the month of December; so also the sarg, the so called myxus, and the cephalus. The period of gestation is thirty days. But some of the mullets are not propagated by copulation, but grow out of the slime and the sand. </p>                        </div>

There is one kind called chellon, another <a href=/people/8151 target=_blank>Pheraeus</a>; the chellon feeds close to shore, the <a href=/people/8151 target=_blank>Pheraeus</a> does not. The <a href=/people/8151 target=_blank>Pheraeus</a> uses as food the mucus which comes from itself, but the chellon eats sand and slime. It is even said that no creature eats the spawn of mullets because the mullets, in turn, eat no other fish. <a href=/people/329 target=_blank>Euthydemus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, in his treatise On Salt Meats, says that the kinds of mullets are cephalus, spheneus (wedge-fish), and dactyleus (inch-fish).

The mullet is eaten off by the sea-bass, the conger-eel by the lamprey. The well-known proverb, a mullet goes hungry: is said of men who practise just dealing, since the mullet is not carnivorous. <a href=/people/1329 target=_blank>Anaxilas</a> in The Recluse says of the sophist <a href=/people/5109 target=_blank>Maton</a>, whom he decries for gluttony: <a href=/people/5109 target=_blank>Maton</a> has snatched away and eaten up the mullet's head, and I am undone.

For you shall not have a portion of anything until either you or your fellow-disciple <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> explains why the mullet is the only fish that is called faster. And <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> answered: Because he eats no live bait, and when he has been pulled in is not baited by meat or by any other living thing, as <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> records. He says that en when he is empty he makes poor food, and that when he is frightened he hides his head as if he were hiding his whole body. And so <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> says in Holidays: 'For as I was coming out, a fisherman met me with a load of mullets — fish that fast and are poor food, at least in my judgement.'

You don't know this, to be sure, being ellops (dumb) yourself. But I answer, since the <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynic</a>'s explanation is nonsense, in the words of the clever <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>: 'That which it took two men to say before me, I can answer sufficiently alone'; and I assert that fish are ellopes because they have scales. I will also explain, even if the question has not been asked, why the <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagoreans</a>, who eat moderately of other live animals, some of which they even sacrifice, nevertheless utterly refuse to touch fish alone. Is it because of their silence? They regard silence, in fact, as divine. Since then you also, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398206RMol class=demonym long=20.6 lat=39.8>Molossian</a> <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a>, are altogether silent though you are no <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagoreans</a>, we will proceed to the discussion of other fish.

It spawns close to shore, in places full of sea-weed and leaves. <a href=/people/661 target=_blank>Speusippus</a>, in the second book of <a href=/people/2446 target=_blank>Similars</a>, says that the black-tail and the <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>-fish resemble each other. <a href=/people/1005 target=_blank>Numenius</a>, in The Art of Angling, says: Easily may you pull in also the speckled <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>-fish. Perhaps, therefore, the speckled-beauties mentioned in <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>'s <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> are <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>-fishes. He says: Speckled-beauties and floaters, and <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-tongues. Yet, in The Marriage of <a href=/people/576 target=_blank>Hebe</a>, he mentions the speckled-beauties as though they were different: File-fish and wasses and dark-gleaming <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>-fishes, speckled-beauties and floaters, and <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-tongues. Again, <a href=/people/329 target=_blank>Euthydemus</a>, in his work On Salt Meats, says that the <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>-fish is by many called saperda.

But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> call it broad-fish from its extraordinary contour. The Carp. — This also, according to <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>'s account, is of the carnivorous and gregarious type. It has a tongue which is attached to the top, not the under part, of the mouth. <a href=/people/981 target=_blank>Dorion</a>, who enumerates it among lake and river fish, writes as follows: Scaly, which some call carp. Gobies. — Very juicy, as <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a> says, excellent in taste, easily eliminated, of little nourishment, and full of humours. The whiter varieties are better than the black in taste. The flesh of the yellow gobies is rather loose and skinny; they also produce in digestion less and thinner juice, but they are more nourishing on account of their size. <a href=/people/336 target=_blank>Diocles</a> says that those of them which inhabit rocky waters are soft-fleshed. <a href=/people/1005 target=_blank>Numenius</a>, in The Art of Angling, calls them cothi: Or a parrot-fish, or fat and very shameless goby (cothus).

But whatsoever you stew within the ribs of the hollow casserole, mix no water from a sacred spring, nor wine-vinegar, but simply pour over it oil and dry caraway and some fragrant leaves all together. Cook it over the hot embers without letting the flame touch it and stir it diligently lest you unwittingly scorch it. Nay, not many mortals know of this heavenly viand or consent to eat it — all those mortals, that is, who possess the puny soul of the booby-bird, and are smitten with palsy because, as they say, the creature is a man-eater. But every fish loves human flesh if it can but get it.' A part taken from this fish is what the Romans call tursio; it is the sweetest and most luxurious part. Sea-bass. — These fish, according to <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>'s account, are solitary and carnivorous. They have a bony tongue, closely attached, and a triangular heart. In the fifth book of The Parts of Animals he says that they, like the mullets and the gilt-heads, spawn chiefly where rivers flow. They spawn in the winter and spawn twice. <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a> says that sea-bass are well-flavoured but not very nourishing, and inferior as regards elimination, but are rated first in excellence of taste. The fight got its name (labrax) from its voracity (labrotes). It is said, too, that it is superior to all other fishes in sagacity, showing cunning in contriving its escape.

But there are many others besides. The Ray. — This is also called file-fish. Its flesh is white, according to <a href=/people/1534 target=_blank>Epaenetus</a> in The Art of Cookery. <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, in The Sophists: Though it be a Dogfish, or a ray, or an eel. Murries. — <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, in his work On Land Animals, says that the eel and the murry can live a long time out of water because they have small gills and take in but little water. <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a> says that murries are as nourishing as eels, not even excepting conger-eels. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, in the second book of The Parts of Animals, says that the murry takes on a rapid growth from a small beginning, that it has jagged teeth, and that it spawns small eggs in any season. <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> in The <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> calls them myraenae without the s in these words: Naught of fat conger-eels or murries (myraenae) was absent from his store. Similarly also <a href=/people/1229 target=_blank>Sophron</a>. But <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> (or Cantharus), in The Alliance, has it with the s: There's a ray and a murry (<a href=/people/10289 target=_blank>Smyraena</a>) besides. <a href=/people/981 target=_blank>Dorion</a>, in his work On Fishes, says that the river murry has only one spiny fin, similar to that of the oniscus known as gallarias. <a href=/people/2091 target=_blank>Andreas</a> in his treatise On Poisonous Animals, says that only those murries have a fatal bite which come from a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>viper</a>, and they are less round and speckled. <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a>, in Theriaca: But there is the terror of the murry, since it often bites the wretched fisher-folk and sends them in headlong flight from their skiffs into the sea when it suddenly darts up from the hold; if, to be sure, it is true that the murry leaves her pasturage in the sea and consorts with venomous <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>vipers</a> on dry land. But <a href=/people/2091 target=_blank>Andreas</a>, in his work On Popular Superstitions, says that it is not true that the murry moves into lagoons and there mingles with the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>viper</a>; for <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>vipers</a> do not feed in a lagoon, preferring sandy deserts. Nevertheless <a href=/people/988 target=_blank>Sostratus</a> in his work On Animals (it is in two books) agrees as to this mingling. The Male Murry. — The male murry, as <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> declares in his fifth book of The Parts of Animals, is different from the <a href=/people/10289 target=_blank>Smyraena</a>. For she is speckled and not so strong, but he is smooth-skinned and powerful, and has a colour like that of the wryneck, and teeth both inside and outside. <a href=/people/981 target=_blank>Dorion</a> says that the male murry has no spiny bones in its flesh, but is available for use throughout, and extraordinarily tender; that there are two kinds of them; some are black, others rather reddish, the black being superior.

Sprats. — These, as <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a> says, are juicier than gobies, but inferior to them in flavour and in assisting elimination from the digestive tract. <a href=/people/661 target=_blank>Speusippus</a>, in the second book of <a href=/people/2446 target=_blank>Similars</a>, says that boces and smarides, mentioned by <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> in <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> and Sea, resemble the sprat.

He says: A. Yes, I hold that all these large fishes are man-eaters. B. How's that, dear friend? Man-eaters! What do you mean? CC. He means, of course, what a man would eat. But these are <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a>'s food that he speaks of, sprats and minnows. A certain kind are also called white sprats, and these are named boaces by some. <a href=/people/10118 target=_blank>Poliochus</a>, in The Corinthiast: In the name of the gods, let nobody who shall come, no matter who he is, persuade you to call boaces white sprats. The Black-tail. — Of this fish <a href=/people/1005 target=_blank>Numenius</a> says, in The Art of Angling: A sculpin or a black-tail, guide to the perches. <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a> says that it is similar to the sarg, but inferior in juiciness and flavour; that it is slightly astringent, and is filling. It is mentioned by <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> in The Marriage of <a href=/people/576 target=_blank>Hebe</a>: There were garfish and black-tails too. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, in the work Pertaining to Animals, writes: Fishes with spotted tail-fins are the black-tail and the sarg, marked with many stirpes, that is, many black stripes.

The Electric Ray. — <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> or Cantharus in The Alliance: For a stew made of electric ray is a nice dish. And the philosopher <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> has a phrase in <a href=/people/2426 target=_blank>Meno</a>: To the electric ray out of the sea; for this creature causes a numbness in anyone who touches her. And so its name is implied also in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s phrase: And his hand grew numb at the wrist. <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> used the form narca, with an a, in <a href=/people/8142 target=_blank>Phanium</a>: And a numbness has crept all over my skin — though none of the old writers so employed it. <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a> says that the electric ray is rather lacking in nourishment and juiciness, having a gristly texture throughout its system, and yet it is very wholesome. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, in Animals Which Live in Holes, says that the electric ray creeps under the earth to avoid the cold. And in his book on Biting and Venomous Animals, he declares that the electric ray can send its shock even through clubs and spearing-irons, numbing those who hold them in their hands. <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367345PSol class=person long=34.539 lat=36.742>Soli</a> states the cause in his book On the Electric Ray, but since what he says is rather long, I have forgotten it, and refer you to the treatise. The electric ray, as <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says, belongs to the class of cartilaginous and viviparous fishes. It catches the little fishes for its food by touching them, causing them to grow numb and motionless. But <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> of Laodicaea, in his commentary on <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a>'s Theriaca, says that not all of the creature can infect one with numbness, but only a certain part of it. He alleges that he has often experimented with it. <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a> says: And an electric ray stewed in oil, wine, fragrant herbs, with a little grated cheese. <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in <a href=/people/2230 target=_blank>Galateia</a>: The electric ray, then, so they say, is to be stuffed and baked whole. And in <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>: Then I took an electric ray, being mindful that when a lady lays tender fingers upon it she must not suffer any hurt in them from its thorny touch. The Sword-Fish. — <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says that this fish has a snout the lower part of which is small, but the upper part is bony and large, equal to the entire length of its body; this part is called a sword. The fish has no teeth. <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a> says: But when thou comest to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, get a slice of sword-fish, the joint cut right from the tail.

So diligently, to satisfy his dainty appetite, did he even sail through the strait, and put to the test the qualities and flavours of the parts of every fish because of that appetite, with the idea of laying the foundation of a work which should be useful in men's lives. </p>                        </div>

It is both carnivorous and jagged-toothed, besides being solitary. A peculiarity of the fish is that no seminal ducts are found in it, and it stays alive a long time after dissection. It belongs to the class which live in holes during the most wintry days, and likes grounds closer to shore rather than in deep seas. It does not live more than two years.

Thus <a href=/people/875 target=_blank>Archippus</a> in The Fishes, cited above. <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> has the genitive, also oxytone, in The <a href=/people/5139 target=_blank>Odysseis</a>: A hot slice of sea-perch (orpho). The <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>Horse</a>-mackerel. — <a href=/people/981 target=_blank>Dorion</a>, in his work On Fishes, says that the horse-mackerels made their way from the ocean at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361000LPHe class=place long=-5.3464 lat=36.123>Pillars of Heracles</a> clear through to our own sea; hence a great many are caught in the Spanish and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Etruscan</a> seas; from there they disperse to other parts. <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a> says that those which are caught at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Cadiz</a> are fatter, and next to them in merit are those caught in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>.

Now in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Cadiz</a> the shoulder-bones are preserved separately, just as in the case of sturgeons the jaws and the roofs of the mouth and the so called 'heart-of oak' are cut from them and preserved. But <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a> declares that the belly-pieces taken from them are fatty and far superior in taste to the other parts; but the shoulder-bones have a better taste than these. The Onus and the <a href=/people/6726 target=_blank>Oniscus</a>. — The cod, says <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> in his work Pertaining to Animals, like the Dogfishes, has a widely gaping mouth, and is not gregarious.

Also it is the only fish that lives in holes during the hottest <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-days, whereas all the others seek holes during the most wintry days. <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> mentions them in The Marriage of <a href=/people/576 target=_blank>Hebe</a>: Wide-gaping perches and hakes with extraordinary paunches.

The Polyp (octopus), genitive poulypodos. — The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> Greeks say poulypous (sic) by analogy. So also does <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>: As when a polyp (poulypous) is drawn out of its lair. For it comes from pous (foot). For the accusative they say poulypoun, like Alcinoun and Oidipoun. So also it is said that <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a> has tripoun, meaning cauldron, in <a href=/people/528 target=_blank>Athamas</a>, from the simple form pous, like nous (mind). But to say polypon for the accusative is Aeolic, since <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> writers say poulypoun. <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in <a href=/people/310 target=_blank>Daedalus</a>: And that though he had poulypous and cuttle-fishes. Again: He laid the polypoun before me. And again: Twice seven poundings of the beaten poulypous, as the proverb goes. <a href=/people/529 target=_blank>Alcaeus</a> in Sisters Seduced: To be a simpleton and have the sense of a poulyp. <a href=/people/2386 target=_blank>Ameipsias</a> in The Devourer: We need a lot of poulyps, that is plain. <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, in The Baby: like the poulyps, you first of all. <a href=/people/529 target=_blank>Alcaeus</a>: I, like a poulyp, eat myself. But others decline the words poulypous like pous (foot), podos, podi, poda. <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a> in The Demes: A citizen who is a very polyp in his ways. <a href=/people/336 target=_blank>Diocles</a>, in the first book of his Hygiene, says: The molluscs incite to pleasure and desire, especially polyps. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> records that the polyp has eight feet, of which the two upper and lower are smallest, while those in the middle are largest; it also has two suckers by which its food is drawn in; two eyes above the two front feet; the mouth and teeth in the centre, between the feet. Dissection discloses that it has a bipartite brain. It also has the well-known dark juice, not black like that of the sepia, but reddish, contained in what is known as the poppy. This ink-bag, resembling a bladder, is situated above the stomach. It has no corresponding gut. As food it sometimes uses the tiny flesh-parts of shell-fish, throwing the shells outside its lairs; from this habit the fishermen detect its presence. Generation takes place by embrace, and coition lasts a long time because the creature has no blood. It spawns through the so called blow-pipe, which is a tube in its body. The eggs thus spawned are in clusters. They say that whenever it lacks food it eats itself. One of these authorities is the comic poet, <a href=/people/749 target=_blank>Pherecrates</a>. He, namely, in the play entitled Savages, says: What! Live on chervil, wild herbs, and shriveled olives, and when their hunger becomes so very extreme, then, like the polyps, gnaw at neither their own fingers? And <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> in The Merchant: A. He's a polyp, that has all its feelers whole. B. You mean, dear friend, that he hasn't gnawed himself off. But this notion is false. For it is hunted by conger-eels and has its feet injured by them. It is also said that if you drop salt on its lurk-hole, it will immediately come out. Further, it is recorded that when it runs away in fear it changes colour, taking on the same hues as the places in which it hides. </p>                        </div>

The polyp is easily liquefied, also very stupid; for it goes up to the hand of its pursuers and sometimes, when pursued, it does not retreat. The females liquefy after spawning and grow weak, hence they are easily caught. They have even been seen at times to come out on the shore, especially in rocky places; for they avoid smooth ground. They even like plants, such as olives, and are found with their tentacles grasping the stalk. (They have also been caught closely entwined with fig-trees which grow near the water, and eating figs, as <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> says in his book On Water Animals.) A proof of their liking for the olive is also this: if you let down a branch of this tree into the water where there are polyps, and wait a little, you will easily pull up as many as you want clinging to the branch. Though the other parts are very strong, the neck is weak. It is said that the male trails along a kind of genital organ in one of the tentacles in which are the two larger suckers. It is a sinewy substance adhering throughout its entire length to the tentacles as far as its middle. In the fifth book of The Parts of Animals <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says: The polyp copulates in winter and spawns in the spring. It lives in holes for about two months. The creature is very prolific. The male differs from the female in having a head which is more extended in length, and in having what fishermen call its male organ in one tentacle. It broods upon its eggs after it spawns them, hence it is poorest at that season. The polyp drops its spawn into holes or a jar or anything else like it which is hollow. After fifty days the young polyps issue from the eggs like <a href=/people/10968 target=_blank>spiders</a>, in great numbers. The female polyp sometimes sits over the eggs, sometimes over the mouth of its lair, with tentacles outstretched. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, in the book On Animals that change Colour, says that the polyp blends its colour only with that of rocky places, doing this through fear and in self-protection. In his book On Animals living on Land he says that polyps do not take in sea-water. In the book On Local Differences he says that they are not found in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>. For the water here is cold and less salty, and both these conditions are inimical to a polyp. The so called nautilus, says <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, is really not a polyp, though having a resemblance in the tentacles.

It drops two other tentacles into the water, which it uses like rudders. But when it sees anything approaching, it contracts its feet, fills itself with water, and retires to the bottom with all speed. But in the work Pertaining to Animals and Fishes he says: One kind of polyp is the turn-colour, another the nautilus.

She, moreover, will grant a fair voyage, and when the storm rages will make smooth as oil the broad sea for them that entreat her.

So the perch is classed among those fishes marked with lines and having cross-wise stripes. There is also a proverb: The perch follows the blacktail. Needle-fishes. — These also are mentioned by <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> in the line: And needle-fishes with sharp snouts, and horse-tails too. <a href=/people/981 target=_blank>Dorion</a>, also, in his work On Fishes, has: The needle, which they call the needle-fish. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, in the fifth book of Parts of Animals, calls it needle (belone). But in Pertaining to Animals or Fishes he calls it needle-fish (raphis) and says that it has no teeth. <a href=/people/661 target=_blank>Speusippus</a> also gives it the name belone. The File-shark. — <a href=/people/981 target=_blank>Dorion</a>, in his work On Fishes, says that the file-sharks (monk-fish) of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> are especially good, and, in fact, that all the selachians contained in the Bay of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> are superior.

Of all fishes it is the only one that chews its cud. It likes to feed on seaweed, and therefore can be caught with it. It is at its best in summer. <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> says in The Marriage of <a href=/people/576 target=_blank>Hebe</a>: Of the sailorfolk, sea-breams and parrot-fish, whose dung, even, the gods may not lawfully throw aside. </p>                        </div>

The Sea-bream. — <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a> says that this is better flavoured than the sprat, and is more nourishing than many other kinds of fish. <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>, in The Marriage of <a href=/people/576 target=_blank>Hebe</a> <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, that leader of the fisherfolk, came in person, bringing, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> barques, the fairest sea-breams and parrot-fishes that heart could desire; whose dung, even, the gods may not lawfully throw aside. And <a href=/people/1005 target=_blank>Numenius</a>, in The Art of Angling: Or a sea-bream, or hycae swimming in schools. The sea-bream is mentioned also by <a href=/people/981 target=_blank>Dorion</a> in his work On Fishes. The Sculpin. — <a href=/people/981 target=_blank>Dorion</a>, in the first book of his Hygiene, addressed to <a href=/people/2539 target=_blank>Pleistarchus</a>, says that of the deep-water fishes those which have harder flesh are the sculpins, pipers, sole, sarg, and scad, while the red mullets are less hard-fleshed than these. For the rock fishes are soft-fleshed. And <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a> says: Of the sculpins, one kind is found in deep water, the other in lagoons. The deep-water sculpin is yellowish-red, the other inclined to black. The deep-water kind is superior in taste and nourishment. Sculpins are purgative, easily eliminated, full of juice, and very nourishing; for they are cartilaginous. The sculpins spawns twice a year, according to <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> in the fifth book of Parts of Animals. <a href=/people/1005 target=_blank>Numenius</a> in The Art of Angling: Forked hake, and labrus too, and sculpin with red skin, or a black-tail, guide to the perches. That the sculpin can sting is also attested by <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> in the book On Fishes or Pertaining to Animals. <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> in The Musessays that the sculpin is speckled: Sculpins speckled, and grey-fish, and fat horse-mackerel. It is solitary, and lives on seaweed. In the fifth book of Parts of Aias, <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> calls the sculpin scorpios and scorpis in different passages. But it is uncertain whether he means that they are the same; that we have often eaten both a scorpaena and a scorpios, and that their flavour and colour differ, everyone knows. The fancy cook <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a> says in his golden verses: But in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=place long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasos</a> buy the sculpin, if it be not bigger than thine arm's length; from one too large keep thy hands away! The Mackerel. — Mentioned by <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in <a href=/people/2883 target=_blank>Gerytades</a>. <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a> says that though mackerel are very small in size, they are more nourishing and better flavoured than <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a>, but not so easily eliminated. They are mentioned thus by <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> in The Marriage of <a href=/people/576 target=_blank>Hebe</a>: Flying-fish also, and breams, which are larger than <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunnies</a> and mackerel, but smaller, indeed, than female <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunnies</a>. Sargs. — These, says <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a>, are more costive and filling than black-tails. <a href=/people/1005 target=_blank>Numenius</a>, in The Art of Angling, calls the sarg a mischievous fish to catch: Blackbird or thrushes with hues of the sea; at different times and places, a sarg on the point of being landed, that fish most harmful to the line. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, in the fifth book of Parts of Animals, says that it spawns twice, once in spring, again in autumn. <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>, in The Marriage of <a href=/people/576 target=_blank>Hebe</a>: And if thou desire, sargs there be, and sardines, and those deep-sea creatures . . . But the Sargini he lists in the following lines as something different: There were gar-fish and black-tails too, and the beloved ribbon-fish, thin but sweet. A similar statement is found in <a href=/people/981 target=_blank>Dorion</a>'s work On Fishes; hence he calls them chalcides (sardines) as well as sargini. The wise <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a> says: Whensoe'er <a href=/people/297 target=_blank>Orion</a> is setting in the heavens, and the mother of the wine-bearing cluster begins to cast away her tresses, then have a baked sarg, overspread with cheese, large, hot, and rent with pungent vinegar. For its flesh is by nature tough. And so be mindful and dress every tough fish in the same way. But the good fish, with naturally tender, fat flesh, sprinkle with a little salt only, and baste with oil. For it contains within itself alone the reward of joy. The Salpa. — <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>, in The Marriage of <a href=/people/576 target=_blank>Hebe</a>: <a href=/people/3763 target=_blank>Aones</a> and sea-breams, bass also, and the fat and loathsome scavenger saupes, yet sweet in the summertime. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, in the fifth book of Parts of Animals, says that it spawns once a year, in autumn. It is heavily marked with red lines, has, moreover, jagged teeth, and is solitary. Fishermen declare, so he says, that it can be caught with a gourd, since it likes that food. <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a> says: As for the saupe, I shall for ever judge it to be a poor fish. It is most palatable when the grain is being harvested. Buy it in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391265PMyt class=place long=26.5621 lat=39.1114>Mytilene</a>. <a href=/people/2907 target=_blank>Pancrates</a> in Occupations at Sea: And saupes too, fishes of equal length, which the masters of the net, who live by the sea, call <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a>, because for their belly's sake they ever grind seaweed with their teeth. This fish is also speckled. Hence <a href=/people/1566 target=_blank>Mnaseas</a>, who was either a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386231ROpu class=demonym long=23.04 lat=38.65>Locrian</a> or a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=person long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophonian</a>, and who composed the work entitled Bagatelles, was nicknamed Salpa by his acquaintances because of the varied contents of his compilation.

A similar fish called patchwork occurs in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Red Sea</a>, having stripes of a golden tinge extending across his whole body, as <a href=/people/1485 target=_blank>Philon</a> narrates in his work On metals. </p>                        </div>

The penultimate syllable in sepia is accented with the acute, like aitia (cause), so <a href=/people/638 target=_blank>Philemon</a> explains, and similarly the following: telia (board), tainia (ribbon), oikia (house). <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says that the cuttle-fish has eight feet, of which the two hindmost are largest; also two feelers, between which are the eyes and the mouth. It also has two teeth, one upper and one lower, and what is called the shell is on its back. The inky fluid is in the sac; this lies close beside the mouth, presenting the character of a bladder. The stomach is flat and smooth, resembling the rennet-bag of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>. Small cuttle-fish feed on the minute sorts of fishes, extending their feelers like fishing-lines and catching the fish with them. It is said that when a storm arises they grasp small stones with their feelers and ride, as it were, at anchor. When the cuttle-fish is pursued, it emits its inky fluid and conceals itself in it, giving the appearance of flying forward. It is also said that when the female is caught on a trident the males go to her aid and pull her away; but if the males are caught, the females run away. The cuttle-fish, like the polyp also, does not live more than a year. In the fifth book of The Parts of Animals, <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says that cuttle-fishes and squids swim together and interlocked, fitting their mouths and feelers closely against each other. They also fit proboscis to proboscis. Among the molluscs the cuttle-fishes spawn the earliest, in spring, and continue spawning in every season; gestation last fifteen days. When the eggs are cast, the male follows closely and discharges (the inky fluid) over them and so hardens them. They move in ranks. The male is more speckled and has a darker back than the female. <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> in The Marriage of <a href=/people/576 target=_blank>Hebe</a> says: polyps and cuttle-fish, and scudding squids. This line should be noted in controverting <a href=/people/661 target=_blank>Speusippus</a>, who says that cuttle-fish and squid are alike. The expression used by <a href=/people/1171 target=_blank>Hipponax</a> in his iambic verse, a cuttle-fish's suffusion, is explained by the commentators as the inky fluid of the cuttle-fish. This suffusion, as <a href=/people/763 target=_blank>Erasistratus</a> declares in The Art of Cookery, is a sauce-like mixture. He writes: A suffusion consists of cooked meat, stewed in blood which has been thoroughly beaten up, honey, cheese, salt, caraway-seed, silphium, and vinegar. And <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386231ROpu class=person long=23.04 lat=38.65>Locris</a>, in his Art of Cookery, writes thus: A suffusion — blood stewed with silphium and boiled wine, or honey, vinegar, milk, cheese, and chopped leaves of fragrant herbs. And the learned <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a> says: Cuttle-fishes in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410250PAbd class=place long=24.9833 lat=40.95>Abdera</a>, and in mid <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409255PMar class=place long=25.511 lat=40.874>Maroneia</a> as well. <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in <a href=/people/1058 target=_blank>Thesmophoriazusae</a>: Hasn't anybody bought a fish? a cuttle-fish maybe?  And in The Daughters of <a href=/people/303 target=_blank>Danaus</a>: Little polyps and spratlets and squidlets. <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> in <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>: Nay, my girl, take this cuttle-fish and this bit of polyp here and have a feast. <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, in The Lovelorn Lass, introduces a cook who speaks these lines on the method of cooking cuttle-fish: Three times as many cuttle-fish for only a shilling. Of all these I cut up the feelers and the fins and stew them. The rest of the creature I chop into many cubes, and rubbing them with ground salt, while the diners are beginning their dinner, my next act is to carry it sizzling to the frying-pan. </p>                        </div>

For all feminines ending in la require a second L: <a href=/people/10625 target=_blank>Scylla</a>, <a href=/people/2263 target=_blank>Telesilla</a>. But all words in which G is inserted end in E, like trogle (hole), aigle (brilliance), zeugle (yoke-strap). The red mullet, <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says in the fifth book of Parts of Animals, spawns thrice a year. He says that fishermen infer this from the roe, which is seen three times a year in certain localities. Perhaps, therefore, the name trigle is derived from this circumstance, just as the amias are so called because they do not go solitarily, but in schools, scarus (parrot-fish) and caris (shrimp) from scairo (leap), aphyae (anchovies) because they are aphyes, that is, of poor size; from thyo, dart, the darting thynnys (<a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a>), because at the time when the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a>-star rises it is driven forth by the bot-fly on its head. The trigle (red mullet) is jagged-toothed, gregarious, spotted all over, and also carnivorous. The third spawning is infertile; for certain worms develop in the womb, which devour the roe that is to be spawned. From this circumstance <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> calls them the squirming in these lines from The Marriage of <a href=/people/576 target=_blank>Hebe</a>: So he brought some squirming mullets and disgusting baiones. <a href=/people/1229 target=_blank>Sophron</a>, again, mentions trigolae, whatever they may be, in Mimes of Men, thus: With a trigolas that cuts the navel-cord; and the trigolas that brings fair weather. On the other hand, in the mime entitled Puffing Passion, he has: The jaw of a <a href=/people/3273 target=_blank>Trigle</a>, but the hind parts of a trigolas. And in Mimes of Women: 'The barbelled <a href=/people/3273 target=_blank>Trigle</a>. <a href=/people/336 target=_blank>Diocles</a>, in his work addressed to <a href=/people/2539 target=_blank>Pleistarchus</a>, mentions the <a href=/people/3273 target=_blank>Trigle</a> among fish with hard flesh. <a href=/people/661 target=_blank>Speusippus</a> says that the piper, flying-fish, and <a href=/people/3273 target=_blank>Trigle</a> are similar. Hence <a href=/people/1120 target=_blank>Tryphon</a> declares in his work On Animals that some persons identify the trigolas with the piper because of the hardness of their hind parts, which <a href=/people/1229 target=_blank>Sophron</a> has indicated when he says, the jaw of a <a href=/people/3273 target=_blank>Trigle</a>, but the hind parts of a tirgolas. <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> says in <a href=/people/11023 target=_blank>Phaon</a>: But the red mullet will give no strength to the glands. For she is a daughter of the virgin <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> and loathes the rising passion. The <a href=/people/3273 target=_blank>Trigle</a>, on account of the syllable in its name which is common to the epithets of <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a>, is dedicated to her. For she is the goddess of the three ways and looks three ways, and they offer her meals on the thirtieth days. By like analogies they associate the turbot (citharus) with <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, the boax [fish] with <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, the ivy with <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, the coot (phalaris) with <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, by way of insinuating phallus, like <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>'s pun in The Birds. (So some persons associate the duck, called netta, with <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>.) The sea product which we call aphye, others aphritis, others still, aphros (foam) — this, I say, is most dear to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, because she also sprang from foam. <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> also, in his treatise On the Gods, says that the <a href=/people/3273 target=_blank>Trigle</a> is sacrificed to <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a> because of the associations in the name; for the goddess is tri-form. But <a href=/people/921 target=_blank>Melanthius</a>, in his work On the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235SEle class=place long=23.538 lat=38.0411>Eleusinian Mysteries</a>, includes the sprat with the <a href=/people/3273 target=_blank>Trigle</a> because <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a> is a sea-goddess also. <a href=/people/982 target=_blank>Hegesander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=person long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> declares that a <a href=/people/3273 target=_blank>Trigle</a> is carried in the procession at the festival of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, because it is reputed to hunt sea-hares relentlessly and devour them; for they are deadly. Hence, inasmuch as the <a href=/people/3273 target=_blank>Trigle</a> does this to benefit mankind, this huntress fish is dedicated to the huntress goddess. Further, <a href=/people/1229 target=_blank>Sophron</a> called the <a href=/people/3273 target=_blank>Trigle</a> barbelled, because those mullets which have barbels are better to eat than other kinds. At <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> there is also a place called Trigla, and there is a shrine there dedicated to <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a> Triglanthine. Hence <a href=/people/7473 target=_blank>Charicleides</a> says in The Chain: Mistress <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a> of the three ways, with three forms and three faces, beguiled with triglas. If a <a href=/people/3273 target=_blank>Trigle</a> be smothered alive in wine and a man drinks this, he will not be able to have sexual intercourse, as Τerpsicles narrates in his book On Sexual <a href=/people/626 target=_blank>Pleasure</a>. If a woman, also, drink of the same wine, she cannot conceive. The same is true even of a bird. The encyclopaedic <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a>, after praising the triglas of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374275UTei class=place long=27.4109 lat=37.4124>Teichious</a>, in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=demonym long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Milesian</a> territory, goes on to say: Also in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=place long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasos</a> buy a red mullet, and you will get one that is not bad. In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382268PTeo class=place long=26.7877 lat=38.1717>Teos</a> it is inferior, yet even it is good. In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384265PEry class=place long=26.4808 lat=38.3828>Erythrae</a>, too, it is good, when caught by the shore. And <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> says in <a href=/people/786 target=_blank>Trophonius</a>: No longer may we eat a red mullet from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379238DAix class=person long=23.7625 lat=37.8614>Aexone</a>, nor taste sting-ray or black-tail of huge growth.

But in the case of the squid the hind feet are small, the front feet larger; and of the feelers, that on the right is thicker; the whole of its small body is plump and rather more extended. It also has an inky fluid in the sac, but it is yellow, not black. Its shell is very small and cartilaginous. The Teuthus. — The Teuthus (totaro) differs from the squid solely in point of size, which reaches as much as three spans. It is of a reddish colour; the lower tooth is smaller, the upper is larger; both are black and resemble a hawk's beak. Dissection discloses inner organs like <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>'s tripe.

As for the squids, I chopped up their fins, mixed in a little lard, sprinkled them with seasoning and stuffed them with finely-chopped greens.

But he also speaks of certain fish called hyes in this line: Sardines and hyes too (<a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>-fish), flying gurnards and the fat Dogfish. These may, to be sure, be the same as <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>-fish. <a href=/people/1005 target=_blank>Numenius</a>, in The Art of Angling, expressly includes in his list a fish called hyaena in this line: A black bream which had appeared, a hyaena, and a red mullet. <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, in The Art of Cookery, also mentions the hyaena. <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a>, the master-chef, says: In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407261PAin class=place long=26.0812 lat=40.7238>Aenus</a> and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> buy the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>-fish, which some mortals call sand-digger.

For in the agreements made between the fishes and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> he has introduced the following: To restore mutually whatever property of the other party we now hold, to wit: We shall give up the Thracian wives and Sardella the flute-girl, Cuttle-fish, daughter of Tursio, and the Mullet family; also <a href=/people/1627 target=_blank>Eucleides</a>, former archon, the <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>Crow</a>-fish tribe from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378238DAna class=place long=23.7976 lat=37.83>Anagyrus</a>, the son of Gobio of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379235PSal class=person long=23.5408 lat=37.952>Salamis</a>, and the assessor Fishing-<a href=/people/10983 target=_blank>frog</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389231UOre class=place long=23.096 lat=38.9513>Oreus</a>. In case someone should ask what these Thracian wives in the custody of the fishes happened to be, which they agree to restore to men, since I have composed a personal treatise on this play, I will now set forth the chief points of importance. As a matter of fact, the Thracian wife is a small sea fish. <a href=/people/3047 target=_blank>Mnesimachus</a> mentions it in The <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>Horse</a>-breeder.

But the word thetta does not so much as occur anywhere in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> writers. On the other hand, <a href=/people/796 target=_blank>Anaxandrides</a> in <a href=/people/78 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a> shows that they called the small sea fish thrattam when he says: He sports with the shrimplets among the perchlets and the whitebait.

He says (I think I can remember his statement, which is as follows): 'The out-lying fish (called by some adonis) has this name because it often takes its siestas out of water. It is rather reddish, and extending from the gills, on each side of the body as far as the tail, it has a single white stripe. It is round, but since it is not broad, it has the same size as the smaller mullets found near the shore, which are eight inches, at most, in length. In general appearance it is most like the so called buck fish, except for the black spot under the gullet, which they call the buck's beard. The out-lying belongs to the hand of rock fishes, living as it does near rocky shoals. When it is calm, the fish leaps out with the surf and lies a long time on the pebbles, sleeping on dry land and turned toward the sun. When it has had all the sleep it wants, it rolls close to the water, until once more the surf catches it up and carries it with the reflux back into the sea. When it happens to be awake on land, it guards itself against the birds called fair-weather-fowl, such as the halcyon, sandpiper, and that heron which resembles the landrail. These birds, feeding in calm weather along the shore, often encounter the fish, but when it sees them in time it jumps and struggles until finally it escapes by diving back into the water.' </p>                        </div>

And on another occasion he purloined in jest a fish from one of the fishermen, and having taken it he handed it over to one of the bystanders. When the fisherman exacted an oath from him, he swore that he did not have it himself nor did he know of anybody else who had taken it; because he had taken it himself, but somebody else had it, and this person he had instructed to swear on oath, in turn, that he had not taken it himself, nor did he know of anyone else who had it.

And <a href=/people/1454 target=_blank>Philetaerus</a>, in <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>, says that <a href=/people/326 target=_blank>Hypereides</a>, besides being an epicure, was also a gamester, exactly as <a href=/people/3777 target=_blank>Axionicus</a> in Lover of <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> says of the orator <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a>: 'Another fish, confident in his size, hath a certain <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucus</a> (grey-fish) caught in the sea, brought to these parts to be food for epicures, bearing on his shoulders a dear delight for greedy men. What manner of dressing shall I say it must have? Whether to souse it in yellow sauce, or to oil its body with sprinklings of biting pickle and render it over to flaming fire? One hath spoken; and saith that <a href=/people/1890 target=_blank>Moschion</a>, that man devoted to the pipes, will eat it stewed in hot pickle. But he clamours a reproach meant only for thee, O <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a>.

He asked, 'What?' <a href=/people/1300 target=_blank>Stratonicus</a> replied, 'An audience in your own house.' When somebody asked him why he roamed all over Greece, instead of staying continuously in one city, he answered that he had received all Greeks as toll from the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, and he exacted pay from them for their ignorance of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. Of <a href=/people/11023 target=_blank>Phaon</a> he used to say that he played not harmony, but <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a>, on his pipes. When <a href=/people/11023 target=_blank>Phaon</a> pretended to be a proficient piper, and alleged that he possessed a chorus at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=place long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megara</a>, he said: 'Nonsense!

He said that a poor doctor could send his patients to <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a> in a single day.

Indeed, the things he has recorded are such as to be what the comic poet calls 'Marvels for simpletons.' He says, namely, that periwinkles and all testacea are, as a class, non-copulating, and that the purple-shell and the periwinkle are long-lived. How could he know, in fact, that the purple-shell lives six years? Or that the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>viper</a> remains the longest time in the act of copulation, that the ringdove is the largest of the doves, and next comes the rock-pigeon, while the turtle-dove is the smallest? How does he know, too, that the stallion lives thirty-five years, whereas the mare lives more than forty? He even declares that one lived for seventy-five years! He records that from the copulation of lice nits are generated; that from the transformation the grub comes the caterpillar from which is formed the silk-cocoon, and from this, what is termed the 'necydallus.' What is more, he says that <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> live as much as six years; some, even seven. No <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a> or drone, he declares, has ever been seen in the act of copulating, hence it is impossible to tell which of them are males, which females.

That the eye of man varies in all sorts of ways, and that differences in character are associated with their eyes, is another assertion.

Again, as to rock-fish, the forked hake, male and female, are very tender small fishes, free from smell and easily digested; the sea-perch has resemblance to them, yet differs slightly according to locality. Gobies are like the perch; the small white ones are tender, free from smell, juicy, and easily digested; the yellow (also called stalk-fish) are dry and lean. The cannas have tender meat, yet are tougher than the perch. The parrot-fish has tender meat, flaky, sweet, light, easily digested and assimilated, loosening the bowels. But when recently caught the parrot-fishes should be eaten with caution, since they hunt and feed on the sea-hares. Hence their inner parts may cause cholera morbus. The fish called ceris has tender meat, loosens the bowels, and is wholesome. The cyle from it gently moistens and purges. The sea-perch (orphos or orphos) has healthy and abundant juices, is viscous, not easily digested, very filling, and diuretic. That is, the parts next its head are viscous and easily digested, while the meaty parts are hard to digest and heavier. The cut by the tail is more tender. This fish is likely to cause clammy humours and to be hard to digest. Hammer-fish are more nourishing than conger-eels. The lake-eel is more tasty and nourishing than the sea-eel. The gilt-head has qualities resembling those of the black-tail. The yellow deep-sea sculpins are more nourishing than the large ones caught in lagoons by the shore. </p>                        </div>

The sea-bass called acarnan is sweet and astringent, also filling and easily eliminated. The anchovy is rich and hard to digest. The white variety is called cobitis. The hepsetus, that very tiny fish, belongs to the same class. Of the selachians the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>-fish is fleshy, but the Dogfish, especially that called stellata, is superior. The thresher shark (<a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>fox</a>-fish) resembles the land animal in taste, whence it got is name. The ray is tasty, but the stellated ray is tenderer and juicy. The smooth-ray is more costive, and is smelly. The electric ray, in general hard to digest, has parts near the head which are tender and wholesome and even digestible, but the other parts are not; the small ones are superior, especially when cooked plainly. The file-fish, another selachian, is digestible and light. The larger is also the more nourishing. In general, all the selachians are windy and meaty and hard to digest, and when eaten too plentifully they dull the eyesight. The cuttle-fish even when boiled is tender, tasty, and digestible, and also eases the bowels. The chyle from it is adapted to thinning the blood and assisting purgation when that is obstructed by piles. The squid is more digestible and filling, especially when small. But the boiled squid is tougher and not tasty. The polyp, while it is an active aphrodisiac, is tough and indigestible. The larger sized is more nourishing. When cooked for a long time it gently moistens the bowels and settles the stomach. <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in <a href=/people/2337 target=_blank>Pamphila</a> makes plain the usefulness of the polyp when he says: 'What is better for a man in love, <a href=/people/6397 target=_blank>Cteson</a>, than the things which I have brought with me here? There are periwinkles, scallops, bulbs, a large polyp, and fine large fish.' The palamyde is filling and rich, diuretic also and hard to digest; but when smoked like the cube <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a> it eases the bowels and is attenuating. The larger-sized is called synodontis. The chelidonias <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a>, though resembling the palamyde <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a>, is tougher. The flying-fish that resembles the polyp produces a liquid which promotes a good complexion and stirs the blood. The horse-mackerel is miry; the larger sort resembles the chelidonias <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a> in point of toughness, but the slices from under its belly and the shoulder-bone are tasty and tender. The so called costae, when smoked, are of moderate value. The yellow <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a> is to a certain degree unsavoury; it is tenderer than the horse-mackerel. This, then, is what <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> has to say. </p>                        </div>

They are hard to digest, yet when digested they afford many times more nourishment. Then there is the kind known as scale-less fishes, such as <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunnies</a>, mackerel, female <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a>, congers and the like, which, as it happens, are gregarious. Those kinds which neither appear solitarily nor yet run in schools are more digestible, such as congers, sharks, and the like. The gregarious kinds among these fish afford eating which is delightful (for they are rich), but heavy and hard to digest. Hence they are best adapted to smoking, and of all preserved fish these are the best kinds. But they are good when baked, since their rich fat is then melted. The kinds called darta are in general those which have a rough top-growth on the skin, not scales, but the kind deified on rays and file-fishes. All these, to be sure, are digestible, but not of good odour; they also furnish the body with moist nutriment, and purge the bowels better than all other boiled fish; for those which are baked are inferior. The mollusc class, such as polyps, cuttle-fishes, and the like, have a flesh which is not easily digested; hence they are adapted to stimulating sexual desire. For they are in themselves of the nature of breath, and the sexual crisis requires a bodily state which is full of breath. Molluscs are better when boiled, since the liquids which they contain are poor, as may be seen, at least, from those which they exude when they are washed. These liquids, then, are elicited from the meat by boiling. For if the heat is applied gently, together with the water it acts as a cleansing process. Baking, on the other hand, tends to dry up these liquids; and further, since their meat is naturally tough, it is to be expected that they should become so (when baked). </p>                        </div>

Since the process of digestion here is not even, but the meat is very quickly digested while the bones are dissolved slowly (for small fry, undressed, are full of bones), the digestive process is impeded in the case of each by the other. The result is that digestion causes winds, while the food causes humours to arise. And so they are better when boiled, and their purgative action on the bowels is uneven. The so called rock-fish, gobies, sculpins, plaice, and the like, yield our bodies a nutriment which is dry (they have compact flesh, are filling and digest quickly, and do not leave behind much refuse), and they are not productive of winds. Every kind of fish is more easily digested when it is prepared for the table in a simple manner; in fact rock-fishes taste better when dressed simply. Like these are the class called soft-fleshed, thrushes, blackbirds, and so on. They are, to be sure, more liquid than rock-fishes, but afford more enjoyment in the process of assimilation. They are more purgative and diuretic than rock-fishes because their flesh is more liquid and abundant than that of the aforesaid. If one desires to purge the bowels, he should boil them before giving; if, however, the bowels regular, they are nourishing even when baked. For diuretic purposes, they are useful when prepared in both ways. </p>                        </div>

On the other hand, on the shores facing deep seas, or very much exposed, most fish are tough, thin, and wave-battered. In places where the sea is deep inshore, and not oppressed by strong gales, especially if there are any towns near — in such places, I say, most kinds of fish are uniformly the best, whether in respect of flavour, or ease of digestion, or nourishment of the body. But those sea fishes which migrate from the sea into streams and lakes are hardest to digest and heaviest, such as the mullet, and, in a word, all fishes which have the power of living in both kinds of water. Of those which live entirely in rivers or marshes, the river fish are the better; for a marshy place is the putrefaction of water. And of the river fishes, in turn, those are best which are found in the most rapid streams, especially the fiery-spots, for these are not found except when a stream is rapid and cold, and they are supreme among river fish in digestibility. </p>                        </div>

Since, then, they were confident that this would never happen, they became more lax in carrying on the war. <a href=/people/1102 target=_blank>Iphiclus</a> learned from some source about the oracles given to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a>; so he intercepted by means of an ambush a trusted follower of <a href=/people/11028 target=_blank>Phalanthus</a>, named <a href=/people/7859 target=_blank>Larcas</a>, as he was going to get water, and having exchanged pledges with him, he caught some small fish in the spring, and placing them in a water-jar he gave it to <a href=/people/7859 target=_blank>Larcas</a>, and told him to take this water and pour it into the mixing-bowl from which <a href=/people/11028 target=_blank>Phalanthus</a> was accustomed to have his wine dispensed. This <a href=/people/7859 target=_blank>Larcas</a> did. Then <a href=/people/1102 target=_blank>Iphiclus</a> caught some <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>, and having smeared them with gypsum, he let them go. <a href=/people/11028 target=_blank>Phalanthus</a> saw the <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crows</a> and then went up to the mixing-bowl; and when he saw the fish as well, he reasoned that the country was theirs no longer and made overtures through heralds to <a href=/people/1102 target=_blank>Iphiclus</a>, proposing that he should be allowed to retire with all that were with him, under the protection of a truce. <a href=/people/1102 target=_blank>Iphiclus</a> agreed to this, but <a href=/people/11028 target=_blank>Phalanthus</a> devised a trick, as follows: he slaughtered and disembowelled some sacrificial victims, and tried to carry out his gold and silver money in their bellies. But <a href=/people/1102 target=_blank>Iphiclus</a> was apprised of the trick and succeeded in preventing it. </p>                        </div>

What hast thou to do with it? Is it a solemn banquet, or a wedding? For surely this cannot be a dinner to which all men bring their share' — you are the right man to tell us how these terms differ. But since you keep silence, I will explain. For, just as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=demonym long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracusan</a> poet says: 'That which it took two men to say before me, I can answer sufficiently alone.' All sacrifices and the more elaborate feasts were called eilapinae by the ancients, and those who participated in them, eilapinastae. But eranoi are dinners got together from food contributed by the diners, the word being derived from eran (love), because all mutually love and contribute. The same kind of dinner may be called either eranus or thiasus, and the members who come together eranistae or thiasotae. Again, the noisy crowd which follows in the train of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> is a thiasus, as <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> says: 'And I saw three troops (thiasi) of women in revel bands.' Now the thiasi were so called from the word theos (god). And (if you object that it has an i instead of an e), the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> call the gods sioi. But eilapinae are so called from the elaborate preparation and expense connected with them, since laphytto and lapazo mean to empty out, to spend; hence the poets use alapazo even of sacking a town, and the loot which is carried away is called laphyra because of the greed for spoiling (laphyxis). </p>                        </div>

Again there is a verb lapto meaning to digest food, to become loose by emptying; hence, from the word meaning loose (lagaros) comes lagon meaning flank, as also laganon, a thin wafer, and from lapatto comes lapara, also meaning flank. Laphytto means the same as lapatto, that is, to loosen or empty out in a lavish and extensive fashion. The verb dapano (spend) arises from dapto (devour), since this latter word is closely connected with the idea of abundance; hence, of persons who eat greedily and bestially, we have the words dapto and dardapto. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> has catadapto: 'Nay, <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> and birds of prey had devoured him.' But they called feasts euochiaenot from oche, which means food, but from eu echo, meaning well-being in respect of these things. At these feasts, accordingly, people who honoured the divinity gathered and gave themselves up (methiemi) to jollity and relaxation; and so they called the drink methy, while the god whose gift this is they called Methymnaeus or Lyaeus or Euius or Ieius, just as they called the man who was not scowling or gloomy hilaros (cheerful). Wherefore, they thought that the divinity must prove propitious (hileos) when they shouted the refrain Ie, Ie! So also they named the place in which they practised this ritual <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hieron</a> (temple). <a href=/people/1241 target=_blank>Ephippus</a>, in the play entitled <a href=/people/7965 target=_blank>Merchandise</a>, makes it clear that they could call the same person hileos or hilaros. Of a certain courtesan he says: 'And then, let me tell you, if one of us happen to come in feeling downcast, she greets him with pleasant flattery; she kisses him, not tightly pressing her lips together, as if he were hateful to her, but opening her mouth as fledgling sparrows do; she gives him a chair, she speaks consoling words, she makes him cheerful (hilaros), and soon takes away all his gloom, and renders him propitious (hileos) again.' </p>                        </div>

For they observed that it was not possible for men to resist the impulse to enjoyment, while on the other hand it was useful and expedient to accustom men to a disciplined and orderly use of such things; so they set definite times, and after first sacrificing to the gods they let themselves go in relaxation, their purpose being that everyone should believe that the gods had come to receive the first-fruits and libations, and so might join in the assemblage with due reverence. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> says, for example: '<a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> too came to receive her sacrifice.' And <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> 'had departed for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Aethiopians</a> far away, to receive his hecatomb of <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> and rams.' And <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> 'went yesterday for a feast, and all the gods followed together with him.'

In their assumption, then, that the gods were near them, they conducted their festivals in an orderly and sober manner. Hence among the ancients it was neither customary to recline, but 'they feasted sitting down'; nor yet to drink to intoxication, but 'when they had poured libations and drunk all that heart desired, they went each to his own house.' </p>                        </div>

At this very moment the boss has sent me out to fetch a jar of wine from the neighbours within. B. From in there? I understand. That is going to be something added to all the rest. A. I like an old woman who is so discerning!' And <a href=/people/2042 target=_blank>Crobylus</a> in The False Substitute: 'A. And I was coming to see you, <a href=/people/1267 target=_blank>Laches</a>. Do you go, on ahead. L. Where to? A. You ask me where to! Why, to Philumena's, in whose house our special contributions are. It was in her honour that you forced me yesterday to drink a pint of wine neat.' The ancients also know of what are today called 'basket dinners.' <a href=/people/749 target=_blank>Pherecrates</a> explains what this is in The Forgetful Man, or The Sea, as follows: 'He packed a dinner into the basket and went off, as though he were going to the house of <a href=/people/9938 target=_blank>Ophelias</a>.' This clearly refers to the basket dinner, when a man gets up a dinner for himself, and putting it into a basket goes to somebody's house to eat it. <a href=/people/142 target=_blank>Lysias</a> has used the word syndeipnon for symposium in the speech Against Micinus, a murder case. He says: 'He had been invited to a syndeipnon.' And <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> also said:'With those who had got up the syndeipnon.' </p>                        </div>

Hence some authorities require that the title of <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>' play be written in the neuter, Syndeipnon. Sometimes dinners are also called synagogima; so <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, in A Man of Taste, or The <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a>: 'Lie down now and call in the girls. Let's have a get-together. Although to be sure I know that your ways have long been those of a skinflint.' And <a href=/people/1241 target=_blank>Ephippus</a> in <a href=/people/1730 target=_blank>Geryones</a>: 'And they are paying more than their share for a get-together symposium.' They also used the verb synago (gather) of drinking one with another, and synagogion (gathering) of the symposium. <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>, In the Flames: 'And at this moment, for these reasons, they are gathering (drinking) apart by themselves.' Then in what follows he said: 'He paid for the gathering.' Possibly the dinner called 'contributed' is meant here. And what 'contributions' are is indicated by <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in The Woman who drank Belladonna by these lines:'A. I will come then with you, bringing contributions. B.

In fact, no sooner were some hams served to us, and someone had asked whether they were tender, than <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> began: In what author is that word takeron for 'tender' found? And who has called napy (mustard) sinapy? For I see that it is served in side-dishes along with the hams (koleoi). Yes, koleoi; for I know that this word is used thus as a masculine, and not, as our native <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> would have it, solely as a feminine. <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>, at any rate, says in The Woman from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=place long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megara</a>: 'Sausage, cheese, hams (koleoi), vertebrae; but of things fit to eat, not a single thing.' And in <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a>: 'Sausages are nice, I swear by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, and so is a ham (koleos).' Learn this, too, of me, most learned men, that in this line <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> speaks of sausage as chorde, though elsewhere he always calls it orya. Again, I see seasoned salt in other side-dishes. But our <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynics</a> are full of unseasoned salt; among them, to quote <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>, another <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynic</a> says in The Bag: C'A. Of the relishes which come from the sea we always have one, and that day in, day out. I mean salt. . . . With that to season it, we manage to drink our poor wine — a speciality, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> be my witness, that matches our house. B. What do you mean, then, by calling it a speciality? A. Why, it's the kind do thing that is expedient for the entire company to drink from the cruet, like a cup.' And I also see garum sauce beaten up in a mixture with vinegar. I know that in our day some inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> prepare a special kind which is called vinegar-garum. In answer to this <a href=/people/1800 target=_blank>Zoilus</a> said: <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>, sir, applied the word 'tender' to what is dainty when he said, in The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=demonym long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnian</a> Women: '<a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=place long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnos</a>, which grows fine, tender beans.' And <a href=/people/749 target=_blank>Pherecrates</a> in Good-for-Nothings 'To make the chick-peas tender on the spot.' As for mustard, <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=person long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophon</a> gave it the name sinepy in Theriaca thus: 'Yea, verily, a brass-bound gourd, or sinepy.' And in the Georgics he says: 'Seeds of mustard (sinepy) with sharp bite.' And again: 'Pepper-grass and nose-smart and dark-leaved sinepy.' <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a>, in the treatise On <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> Diction, cites <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> as saying: </p>                        </div>

Thus <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a>, according to <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> in his work On Hellenism. But the verse is from The Knights, and runs thus:'He had a mustard (napy) look.' No <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> writer ever said sinapy. Yet either form is reasonable. For napy is, as it were, naphy, because it has lost growth; for it is without size and small, just like aphye. Sinapy, on the other hand, is so called because it hurts (sinetai) faces (ops) in the smelling, just as the onion (krommyon) is so called because we close (myomen) our eyes (korai). The comic poet <a href=/people/2019 target=_blank>Xenarchus</a> said in The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>: 'This pain isn't pain any more; my little daughter has applied a mustard-plaster by the help of the foreign woman.' Salt and vinegar also are mentioned by the excellent <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in the lines about the tragic poet <a href=/people/844 target=_blank>Sthenelus</a>. He says: 'And how could I ever chew the words of <a href=/people/844 target=_blank>Sthenelus</a>? Can I souse them in vinegar or white salt?' We then, my good fellow, have contributed these examples to help you answer your questions. And now you should answer the question, in what author the word paropsis is used of the well-known vessel. For I know that <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, in Holidays, uses the word of a specially prepared, mixed dish, or some spice of that sort, thus: 'Whence we might have a barley-cake and side-dishes.' But in <a href=/people/434 target=_blank>Europa</a>, again, he uses the word in an extended passage of any exquisite delight; in it is the following: 'A. A sleeping woman is inert. Z. I understand that! A. But when she is awake, the side-dishes, taken by themselves alone, are a much greater contribution to pleasure than all else. Z. What, are there 'side-dishes' in loving, I entreat you?' And in the next lines he goes on to describe these 'side-dishes' as if he were speaking of a relish at table. Again, in <a href=/people/11023 target=_blank>Phaon</a>: 'Frivolous dallyings are like side-dishes; their delight is brief, and quickly are they spent.' <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in <a href=/people/310 target=_blank>Daedalus</a>: 'To all women, in one way or another, an adulterer ready for his work is like a side-dish.' Since, then, <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> had nothing to say, <a href=/people/1837 target=_blank>Leonides</a> spoke up: But I have a right to speak, having for a long time kept silence. As <a href=/people/2485 target=_blank>Evenus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371252PPar class=person long=25.1483 lat=37.0844>Paros</a> says: 'Many there be whose habit is to dispute everything indiscriminately, but further than that, it is not their habit to dispute soundly. And against these one ancient saying suffices: To you these things may seem so to be, but to me they seem otherwise. One can very soon convince the wise by a word well spoken, for they are the easiest to instruct.' And so, <a href=/people/841 target=_blank>Myrtilus</a>, my love (for I have got the floor before you), <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> uses the word paropsis of the vessel in The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=demonym long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotian</a> Woman: 'He called out, and served in a saucer' . . .

And the comic poet <a href=/people/2448 target=_blank>Sotades</a> in Ransomed: 'Plainly I am only a side-dish to <a href=/people/2042 target=_blank>Crobylus</a>; he masticates <a href=/people/2042 target=_blank>Crobylus</a>, but bolts me on the side.' But <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>'s use of the word, in the first book out of Cyropaedeia, is ambiguous. For that philosopher says: 'He set before him side-dishes and all kinds of sauces and meats.' And in the author of <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Cheiron</a>, which is attributed to <a href=/people/749 target=_blank>Pherecrates</a>, the word paropsis is used of a sauce, and not, as <a href=/people/700 target=_blank>Didymus</a> maintains in his treatise on The Corrupt Use of Words, of the vessel containing it. <a href=/people/749 target=_blank>Pherecrates</a> says: '<a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> is my witness, these fellows, like side-dishes, have qualities according to their seasoning, and the host who has invited them regards them as a worthless trifle.' <a href=/people/3434 target=_blank>Nicophon</a> in The <a href=/people/605 target=_blank>Sirens</a>: 'Let sausage fight for a place with the side-dishes.' <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in <a href=/people/310 target=_blank>Daedalus</a>: 'To all women, in one way or another, at least, an adulterer ready for his work is like a side-dish.' <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> in Holidays: 'Whence we might have a barley-cake and side-dishes.' He speaks, too, of the seasoning and dressing of bulbs. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> writers, you Syro-Atticist, <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, say embamma for sauce. Thus <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> in The <a href=/people/280 target=_blank>Peace</a>: 'The weather loaf is nice, but to cheat us with the addition of sauces to the loaves is vicious.' Attic writers say both kolen and kole for ham. <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a> in <a href=/people/1000 target=_blank>Autolycus</a>: 'Legs and haunches (kolenes) aimed straight at the ceiling.' <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> in <a href=/people/1303 target=_blank>Sciron</a>: 'Not even haunches (kolens) of young venison.' But from the form kolea there is a contracted form; like syke, syke (fig-tree), leontea, leonte (<a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>-skin), so kolea, kole. <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in the second <a href=/people/641 target=_blank>Plutus</a>: 'Alas for the ham (kole) which I used to eat!'

There is nothing else similar to these except what is today called bounias. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, though he does not mention the bounias by name, speaks of a certain turnip which he calls male-turnip, and perhaps this is the bounias. <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> mentions the bounias in the Georgics: 'Turnips shalt thou <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> on ground levelled with a roller, that they may grow more level and equal to their moulds. <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>Sow</a> bouniades, too, and carrots, evenly with cabbages. Of turnip and cabbage, in truth, two families appear in our gardens, long and solid. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388228WKep class=demonym long=22.91 lat=38.496>Cephisian</a> turnips are mentioned by <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a> in Orators thus: Very much like <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388228WKep class=demonym long=22.91 lat=38.496>Cephisian</a> turnips. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> says there are two kinds of turnips, male and female; both grow from the same seed. <a href=/people/645 target=_blank>Poseidonius</a> (he of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BSPo class=place long=23.72265 lat=37.97635>Stoa</a>), in the twenty-seventh book of his Histories, says that in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a> there are turnips that grow without cultivation, and carrots that grow wild. <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>, the physician of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370247PSip class=place long=24.745 lat=36.975>Siphnos</a>, says that the turnip is thinning, acrid, and hard to digest; it is also likely to cause flatulence. The bounias, he says, is better; for it is sweeter and more digestible, in addition to being wholesome and nourishing. The roasted turnip, he adds, is more easily digested, but is excessively thinning. <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a> mentions it thus in <a href=/people/5433 target=_blank>Ancylion</a>: I bring you here a turnip for roasting. And <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in God-inspired: I babble the while I roast slices of turnip for <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>. The pickled turnip is more thinning than the boiled, especially when it is done in mustard, according to <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>. The Cabbage. — <a href=/people/1475 target=_blank>Eudemus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, in his book On Vegetables, says that there are three sorts of cabbage, the so called halmyris, the smooth-leaf, and the parsley-leaved; in flavour the halmyris is judged supreme. It grows in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=place long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretria</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388269UCym class=place long=26.9363 lat=38.7595>Cyme</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>, also in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=place long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>. The smooth-leaf grows in all countries. The parsley-leaved has its name from its curliness, for in this respect it resembles parsley, and also in its tendency to compactness. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> writes thus: Of the rhaphanos (by which I mean the cabbage) there are two sorts, one curly-leaved, the other wild. <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370247PSip class=person long=24.745 lat=36.975>Siphnos</a> says: The cabbage which grows in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388269UCym class=place long=26.9363 lat=38.7595>Cyme</a> is very good and sweet, but in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> it is bitter.

He says that the seutlis is different from the teutlon. Hence the comic poet <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> criticizes someone in the play of The <a href=/people/1220 target=_blank>Hero</a> for misuse of the word, and calling teutla seutlides. <a href=/people/1475 target=_blank>Eudemus</a>, in his book On Vegetables, says there are four kinds of beets — the drawn, the stalked, the white, the common; the last is dun-coloured. <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370247PSip class=person long=24.745 lat=36.975>Siphnos</a> says that the beet is juicier than the cabbage and is somewhat more nourishing; when boiled and eaten with mustard it is more thinning and calculated to destroy worms. The white acts more readily on the bowels, the red is more diuretic. Their roots are also better flavoured and more nourishing. The Carrot. — This is pungent, says <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>, very nourishing and fairly wholesome, with a tendency to loosening and windiness; not easy to digest, very diuretic, calculated to rouse sexual desire; hence by some it is called love-philtre.' <a href=/people/1005 target=_blank>Numenius</a> says in The Art of Angling: Of the herbs which grow unsown or are found rooted in our fields in winter, or when flowering springtime comes, there are the scraggly cardoon and the wild carrot, the deep-rooted rape-turnip, and the wild bur-parsley. <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> in the second book of the Georgics says: Among them, too, are the high stalk of the fennel, the roots of rock-parsley, with it, also, the scraggly carrot itself, horse-parsley, <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a>-thistle, <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hound</a>'s-tongue, and chicory; with them, too, thou shalt pound the pungent leaves of edderwort, or the herb which is called bird's milk. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, also, mentions the carrot. <a href=/people/1847 target=_blank>Phaenias</a>, in the fifth book of his work On Plants, writes as follows: With respect to the qualities of its seed, the so called seps and the seed of the carrot. And in the first book he says: Umbelliferous types of seeded plants are found in anise, fennel, carrot, bur-parsley, hemlock, coriander, and squill, which some call <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mouse</a>-bane. Since <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> has mentioned edderwort, it will be added that <a href=/people/1847 target=_blank>Phaenias</a>, also, writes as follows in the book before-mentioned: Edder-wort, which some call arum. . . . <a href=/people/336 target=_blank>Diocles</a>, in the first book of his Hygiene, calls the carrot (staphylinus) astaphylinus. What is called the sliced, which is a large, well-grown carrot, is juicier than the carrot and more heating, diuretic, wholesome, and easy to digest, as <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> records. The Leek. — This, the same <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>, is also called prasium, and it is more juicy than the sliced plant (carrot). It is also moderately thinning, nourishing, and also likely to cause flatulence. <a href=/people/1534 target=_blank>Epaenetus</a> in The Art of Cookery says that leeks are called gethyllides (spring onions). This name, I find, has received mention in <a href=/people/392 target=_blank>Eubulus</a>'s Pimp, as follows: I couldn't touch a bit of bread; for I have just eaten at the house of <a href=/people/7721 target=_blank>Gnathaenium</a>; I found her cooking spring onions.

The Gourd. — Once, in the season of winter, cucumbers were served to us, and we all wondered, thinking they were fresh, and we recalled what the witty <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> said in The <a href=/people/2317 target=_blank>Seasons</a> when he praised the fair city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> in these lines: A. You will see, in midwinter, cucumbers, grapes, fruit, wreaths of violets, roes, and lilies — a dust-cloud utterly blinding. The same tradesman sells thrushes, pears, honeycomb, olives, beestings, haggis, celandine, cicadas, embryo-meat. You can see baskets of figs and of myrtle-berries together, covered with snow, and what is more, they sow cucumbers at the same time with turnips, so that nobody knows any longer what time of the year it is. . . . A very great boon, if one may get throughout the year whatever he wants. B. A very great evil, rather! For if they couldn't get these things, they wouldn't be so eager for them and spend so much money on them. As for me, I would supply these things for a brief season and then take them away. A. I too do that for other cities, but not for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> enjoy all these things because they revere the gods. B. Much good, then, does it do them for revering you, as you say! A. Why, how's that? B. You have made their city <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> instead of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. We wondered, as I was saying, that we should be eating cucumbers in the month of January; for they were fresh and had all their native savour. But it so happened that they belonged to the class of things which are compounded by cooks who know how to play these kinds of tricks. Accordingly, Larensis asked whether the ancients also understood this use. <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> replied: <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=person long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophon</a>, in the second book of his Georgics, mentions this use, but he names these gourds sikyae; they were, in fact, called thus, as we have explained before. He says: 'As for the gourds themselves, cut and skewer them in clues and dry them in the air; then hang them up over the smoke, so that when winter comes the slaves may have enough to fill the capacious pot and gulp it down at their ease, and that the girl who grinds the corn may pour in to the vat boiled pulse of every kind. In it, too, they have laid the clues of gourd, after thoroughly washing them, and mushrooms and dried vegetables long since plaited in strings, with broccoli-stalks as well — to lie all together until spring comes.' </p>                        </div>

This last is a term used by <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in The Woman of delos, of chopped vegetables: Shredded, or pressed in cakes. So <a href=/people/841 target=_blank>Myrtilus</a> spoke up: Colloquial usage today calls only hens by the name of birds and birdlings, a great number of which I see being served. (And the philosopher <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a>, in the fifth book On <a href=/people/626 target=_blank>Pleasure</a> and the Good, writes as follows: 'Just as some persons are more inclined to regard white fowls as pleasanter to the taste than dark.') But the male birds are called cocks or cockerels. Yet among the ancients the word ornis (bird) was used, both as a masculine and a feminine, of other birds as well, and not merely of this special sort, concerning which colloquial usage speaks of 'buying birds.' <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, at any rate, says: 'Many birds, under the sun's rays.' And elsewhere he has the feminine: 'To the shrill bird.' Also: 'As a bird brings to her unfledged nestling as morsel when she has found it, but with herself it goes hard.' But <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>, in the first edition of The Heiress, clearly brings out the colloquial usage when he says: 'A cock crowed lustily. Won't you shoo away,' says he, 'these birds (ornithas) from us?' And again 'She has at last shooed away the birds (ornis) with difficulty.' <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> uses the term ornithia (birdlings) thus in <a href=/people/623 target=_blank>Nemesis</a>: 'All the other birdlings.' Of the male bird we have not only the accusative form ornin, but also ornitha. This <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> in the same play: 'A red-winged bird' (ornitha). And again:'So, then, you must turn into a large bird.' And <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> in Sons of <a href=/people/915 target=_blank>Antenor</a>: 'Bird and herald and minister.' <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a> in The <a href=/people/1091 target=_blank>Cabeiri</a>: 'I make you not the bird (omen) of my journey.' <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> in the second book of Cyropaedeia: 'Against the birds in the severest weather.' <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> in The Girl Twins: 'I have come with a present of birds (orneis).' And later on he says: 'He sends birds (ornithas).' But that for the plural they also say ornis is shown by the testimony of <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> quoted above. Why, even <a href=/people/769 target=_blank>Alcman</a> says, I believe: 'The maidens scattered without finishing their song, like birds (ornis) when a hawk flies over them.' And <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a> in The Demes: 'Isn't it dreadful, then, that I should bring forth children who are rams, and chicks who are birds (ornis) like their father?' On the other hand, old writers use the word alectryon even as a feminine. <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> in <a href=/people/623 target=_blank>Nemesis</a>: '<a href=/people/596 target=_blank>Leda</a>, it is now thy task; thou must needs be in no wise different from a well-behaved hen (alectryon) in thy ways, clucking over the egg here, that thou may hatch out for us a beautiful and marvellous bird from it.' <a href=/people/1377 target=_blank>Strattis</a> in Keeping Cool: 'All the hens and sucking-<a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> are dead, and the little birds (ornithia) as well.' <a href=/people/796 target=_blank>Anaxandrides</a> in <a href=/people/682 target=_blank>Tereus</a>: 'They like to watch the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> copulating, and the hens when they are covered.'

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001:9.374'><b>&sect; 9.374</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to quote for your opinion, my friends, what <a href=/people/1696 target=_blank>Chamaeleon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=person long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heracleia</a> says in the sixth book of his work On Comedy. He writes as follows: 'Once when <a href=/people/796 target=_blank>Anaxandrides</a> was producing a dithyramb at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, he entered the theatre on horseback and recited something from the song. He was fine-looking and tall, affected long hair, and wore a purple cloak with golden hem. Being of a morose disposition, he used to do this with his comedies: whenever he failed to win, he took and gave them to the grocer to cut up for wrappings, and he never revised them, as most writers did. In this way he destroyed many plays which had been elaborately composed, because his old age made him peevish towards the spectators.' It is said that he was <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=demonym long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodian</a>-born, from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363279PKam class=place long=27.9212 lat=36.3362>Camirus</a>. Therefore I wonder how the <a href=/people/682 target=_blank>Tereus</a> survived, since it did not win a victory, and other plays of the same au which had a similar fate. <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>, in The <a href=/people/280 target=_blank>Peace</a>, also used the word alectryon of the female bird when he said: 'I am grieved at the loss of my hen, that laid very nice eggs.' And <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in <a href=/people/310 target=_blank>Daedalus</a>: 'She has laid a very large egg, like a hen.' And again: 'Many a hen, whether she will or no, lays wind-eggs often.' And in The Clouds, when the old man is being instructed in the proper distinction of terms, he says: 'STREPS. Well, now, how am I to call it? SOCRATES. Call this a fowless, but the other a fowl.' That pair of words is also found for hen and cock. <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> said: 'Thou cock with lovely song.' <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> in The <a href=/people/2317 target=_blank>Seasons</a>: 'Like the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> cock whose whole-voiced note rings out at all hours.' It is spoken of in this way because it wakes us up from our bed. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor class=ethnic long=22.4 lat=38.7>Dorians</a> use the nominative ornix, and pronounce the genitive, ornichos, with ch. Yet <a href=/people/769 target=_blank>Alcman</a> shows the nominative in s: 'The sea-purple bird (ornis) of spring,' even with the genitive in ch: 'I know the melodies of all birds (ornichon).' The Shoat. — <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> thus calls the male <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> (delphax) in <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> the Runaway: While I had charge of my neighbours' shoat at the <a href=/people/4515 target=_blank>Eleusinia</a> I lost it in some mysterious way, not willingly; and so he said that I was trading in these wares with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a>, and he swore that I had played false with that shoat. <a href=/people/1329 target=_blank>Anaxilas</a> also, in <a href=/people/245 target=_blank>Circe</a>, uses the word delphax as a masculine, but applies the name to the adult <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>hog</a>, saying: Some of you she will turn into mountain-ranging, forest-roving shoats, others into panthers, others into savage <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a> or <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a>. But <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> applies the word to female <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> in Masters of the Frying-pan: Or the paunch of a shoat killed in the autumn. Also in The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381237DAch class=ethnic long=23.7332 lat=38.0803>Acharnians</a>: That's because she is too young; but when she is grown to the size of a shoat, she will have a tail that is large and thick and red. </p>                        </div>

So <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a> in The Golden Age. <a href=/people/1171 target=_blank>Hipponax</a> also had its feminine: Like an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=demonym long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesian</a> shoat. Properly, only the females would be so called (delphakes), as having wombs (delphyas), since the uterus is called by that name, and the word for brothers (adelphoi) is derive from it. Concerning the age of the animal, <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> says in The Archilochuses: Already shoats, but <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> in the eyes of all the others. Now <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> the grammarian says in the book On Ages: As to <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>, those whose growth has already been reached are shoats (delphakes), but the tender, juicy ones are <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a>. Thus the Homeric expression becomes clear: What the slaves have at hand — flesh of sucking-<a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a>; but the suitors eat the fatted <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>hogs</a>. The comic poet <a href=/people/2345 target=_blank>Plato</a>, in The Poet, used the word delphax as a masculine: He led away the shoat in silence. There was an old law, according to <a href=/people/534 target=_blank>Androtion</a>, that in order to ensure the increase of domestic animals they should not sacrifice a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> that had not been shorn, or that had not had a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a>; hence they used to eat only the adult animals; but the suitors eat the fatted <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>hogs</a>. So today, also, it is the custom that the priestess of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> shall not sacrifice a ewe <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a> or taste of cheese. At one time, also, when there was a dearth of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a>, according to <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philochorus</a>, a law was passed, on account of the scarcity, that they should abstain from these animals, since they wished to amass them and fill up their numbers by not slaughtering them. The female <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> is called choiros by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=ethnic long=27.3 lat=38>Ionians</a>, as in <a href=/people/1171 target=_blank>Hipponax</a>: With libation and entrails of a wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>. And <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> in The Epitaenarians: Therefore guard it like a dun <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> on a rope. But King <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, in the ninth book of his Reminiscences, says: When I journeyed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395263UAss class=place long=26.3371 lat=39.4906>Assus</a>, the people there offered me a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> (choiros) which was two and one-half cubits high, with a length which exactly accorded with that height, and snow-white in colour. They said, too, that King <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a> bought such creatures expressly from them, paying four thousand drachmas for one. <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a> says: And I will place this well-suckled <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> in a roaring oven. For what dish could be better for a man than that? And again: White, of course, and nicely singed is the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>. Cook yourself, <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>, and don't be bothered by a little fire! Still again: I have sacrificed this <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>, from the same <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> that has done me much mischief in the house by romping about and turning things pele-mele up and down. These examples were cited by <a href=/people/1696 target=_blank>Chamaeleon</a> in his work On <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a>.

Hence this creature is universally regarded with great reverence, and no one, <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a> says, would eat of its flesh. The people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/351261PPra class=place long=26.0907 lat=35.1228>Praesus</a> even offer sacrifices to the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>, and this rite is regularly observed by them before the marriage ceremony. A similar narrative is given by <a href=/people/1754 target=_blank>Neanthes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404279UCyz class=person long=27.8878 lat=40.3895>Cyzicus</a> in the second book of his work On Ritual of <a href=/people/4359 target=_blank>Initiation</a>. <a href=/people/431 target=_blank>Achaeus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=person long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretria</a> mentions full-grown <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sows</a>, which he calls petalides, in the satyric drama <a href=/people/2490 target=_blank>Aethon</a>, thus: Full oft did I hear full-grown <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sows</a> . . . in these shapes. He calls them petalides, transferring the term from calves; for these are called petaloi (spreading) when their horns are outspread. Following the example of <a href=/people/431 target=_blank>Achaeus</a>, <a href=/people/132 target=_blank>Eratosthenes</a> also, in Anterinys, called <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>hogs</a> larinoi (fatted), transferring the term, in this case also, from larinoi <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>; these were so called either from the verb larineuesthai, which means to be fattened — <a href=/people/1229 target=_blank>Sophron</a>; The <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> are being fattened — or from a village <a href=/people/7860 target=_blank>Larina</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epeirus</a>, or from the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>-tender; he was named <a href=/people/5741 target=_blank>Larinus</a>. 376C) Once a shoat was brought in for us, one half of which had been carefully prepared as a roast, while the other half was as soft as though it had been boiled in water, and all of us admired the skill of the chef. He, with great pride in his art, said: But, let me tell you, not one of you can show where his throat was cut, or how his belly has been stuffed with all sorts of goodies. For he has thrushes inside him, as well as other small birds; portions of pork paunches, cuts from the matrix, yolks of eggs, and also bird's 'bellies, matrix and all, and full of lovely sauces'; also the stuffing of meats grated into fine bits and concocted with pepper; I describe it thus because 'I am ashamed to mention' hash before <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, although I know that he likes to eat it. Yet my own authority, Paxamus, mentions hash, and I don't bother about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> usage. Do you, then, show me how the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>'s throat was cut, and how it comes to be roasted on one half but boiled on the other. While, therefore, we were still trying to find out, the chef continued: Do you really think that I am less well trained than the famous cooks of old mentioned by the comic poets? Take <a href=/people/2540 target=_blank>Poseidippus</a>, for example, in Dancing-girls. There a cook has these words to say to his pupils: 'My pupil <a href=/people/1350 target=_blank>Leucon</a>, and all you fellow-assistants! Every place is suitable for talking about one's profession; of all possible seasonings, effrontery is best in the art of cookery. In fact in all the arts you will see this generally taking the lead. Here, for example, is a captain of free lances, who wears a coat of mail with scale armour, or carries a dragon-standard wrought in iron; he seemed a <a href=/people/1609 target=_blank>Briareos</a>, but if it comes to an issue, he is a hare. Now if the cook enters with a train of underlings and pupils into the house of a common citizen, and calls everybody a skinflint or starveling, everyone soon cowers before him. But if you show yourself merely as you are, you will find yourself thoroughly trimmed when you depart. To repeat, then, what I admonished you, let yourself go in boastful pretence, and study the mouths of the guests. It's like steering into the harbour of a great market; this is the finishing touch to our art, if you can run safely into the harbour's mouth. Today we are serving a wedding-feast; the animal to be to be slaughtered is an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>. The father of the bride is distinguished, distinguished too is the groom. The women of this company are priestesses to goddess and to god; there will be drunken revellers, pipes playing, all-night vigils, a riot. This is the course your cook's art must run. So remember that! And concerning another cook (his and is <a href=/people/328 target=_blank>Seuthes</a>), the same poet says: '<a href=/people/328 target=_blank>Seuthes</a> is just a big private soldier in their eyes? Don't you know, my friend, that he is evidently not a whit different from a good general? The enemy are upon him; the general of profound genius stands his ground and receives the attack. The whole drinking rabble is his foe. It moves its forces on in a body; it has entered after waiting for fifteen days in expectation of the dinner; it is full of desire, all aflame, waiting for the moment when things will be brought within its reach. Study with care the massed surge of a mob like that.' </p>                        </div>

This profession of ours is not to be altogether despised if you study it carefully, <a href=/people/3818 target=_blank>Demylus</a>; but today the business is washed out, and they all say they are cooks when they know nothing about it. Through such persons our profession loses its reputation. For, once you range the a genuine cook, rightly inducted from childhood into the business, one who grasps the possibilities of the profession and knows all the subjects of our curriculum from a to z, the business will perhaps take on a quite different appearance in your eyes. There are only three of us left today, Boidion, Chariades, and myself. You may snap your fingers at the rest. DEM. You mean it? A. I? I tell you that we alone preserve the school of <a href=/people/5252 target=_blank>Sicon</a>. He was the founder of the art. He taught us, first, to practise astrology; to follow that up immediately by architecture. He had by heart all the treatises on nature. Capping it all, he used to say, came the science of strategy. Before we studied the art itself he was eager that we should learn these subjects. DEM. You're like to tire me out, dear friend, aren't you? A. No, but while my slave is coming up from market, I'm going to put you through a little examination on the business, that we may seize a guy opportunity for talking. DEM. Heavens, this is getting tiresome! A. Listen, good sir. The cook must know, first and foremost, all about the heavenly bodies, the setting of the stars, their risings, when the sun reaches the long day and returns again to the short day, and in what part of the Zodiac he is. For all our dishes and foods virtually take on a flavour that is different at different times, in the revolution of the universal system. The man, then, who has grasped these facts sees the proper time and will make use as he should of all his materials. But he who is ignorant of them naturally gets mired. Again, you must have wondered, perhaps, what architecture can contribute to our profession. DEM. I must have wondered? A. Yes; still, I will tell you. To lay out the kitchen correctly, to have it receive all the light it should, to understand where the draft of air comes from, have great importance in promoting the business. Whether the smoke is carried this way or the other is apt to make some difference to the dishes. What next? I will now explain the strategic elements. . . . There I have the true cook, at least. Order is a wise thing everywhere and in every art, but in ours it practically takes command. For to serve and then remove each course in order and to understand the proper time for them, when to lead them on more quickly, when slowly, how the guests eel toward the dinner, when it is the proper moment in their eyes to serve some dishes hot, others partly cool, others moderate, others entirely cold, all these points, you see, are carefully considered by military methods of study. DEM. Now that you explained to my satisfaction what are the essentials, leave me and keep quiet yourself.' </p>                        </div>

However, this is what he says: 'Though I have had many pupils, <a href=/people/398 target=_blank>Lycus</a>, you, because of your constant good sense and spirit, depart from my house a perfect cook, made so in less than ten months, and much the youngest of them all. <a href=/people/175 target=_blank>Agis</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=person long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a> was the only one who could bake a fish to perfection; <a href=/people/428 target=_blank>Nereus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=person long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a> could boil a conger to suit the gods; Chariades, who came from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, could make an egg mosaic with white sauce; black broth began to exist with <a href=/people/1071 target=_blank>Lamprias</a> first, Aphthonetus cooked sausages, <a href=/people/3836 target=_blank>Euthynus</a> lentil-soup, <a href=/people/1393 target=_blank>Aristion</a> gilt-heads for club assemblies. After the famous sophists of old, these men have become our second group of Seven Sages. As for myself, seeing that most specialities were preempted, I was the first to invent thieving in such a way that nobody dislikes me for that, but they all hire me. The(, when you saw that this had been preempted by me, you added an invention of your own, and that is yours. Four days ago the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375252PTen class=ethnic long=25.1617 lat=37.538>Tenians</a> were offering sacrifice: people a plenty present, who had sailed the salt sea long. The victim was a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kid</a>, thin and tiny. No meat was to be taken away on that occasion for <a href=/people/398 target=_blank>Lycus</a> or his teacher. You made them produce two more <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kids</a>; for while they were looking intently at the liver, you lowered one hand secretly and tossed the kidney quickly into the cistern. Then you raised a big hullabaloo. It hasn't any kidney! they cried. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375252PTen class=ethnic long=25.1617 lat=37.538>Tenians</a> there poked about to find the missing member.

You alone have discovered the art, how not to be a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> vainly gaping.

When, therefore, we begged and entreated him to explain his skill, he replied, I won't tell you this year, 'by the men who faced danger at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381241LMaB class=place long=24.0002 lat=38.144>Marathon</a>, or, what is more, by those who fought the sea-fight at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379235PSal class=place long=23.5408 lat=37.952>Salamis</a>.' So we all agreed, because of an oath as strong as that, not to force the fellow, but to lay hands on something else among the viands passed round.

Not that I want the flute-player to get a beating; for <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a> said in The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconians</a> or <a href=/people/596 target=_blank>Leda</a>: 'But we once heard at home this — the goddess of the hearth be my witness! — that for all the mistakes made by the cook, the flute-player, as the saying goes, gets a beating in our house.' <a href=/people/2342 target=_blank>Philyllius</a>, too, or whoever wrote The Island-towns, says: 'Whatever wrong a cook happens to commit, for that the flute-player gets a beating.' Well, as to my invention of the stuffed <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> which is half-roasted, half-boiled, and shows no cut: the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> was killed by a short incision under the shoulder. Thereupon he showed us. Then, after most of the blood had flowed out, I carefully washed with wine, many times, all the insides along with the offal (yes, for the word offal is used, ye babbling Dinnervillians), and I hung the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> up by the feet. Then I soaked it again in wine, and after a preliminary boiling I crushed the aforesaid tid-bits, with a lot of pepper, through its mouth, pouring on them abundance of gravy very nicely made. And after that I plastered half of the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>, as you can see, with a lot of barley meal, having made a batter of it with wine and olive oil. Then I set it in an oven, placing under it a bronze tray; and so I roasted it at the fire in such a way as not to scorch it, nor yet have it underdone when taken off. After the skin had been crisply roasted I guessed that the remaining part of the animal was done, so I removed the barley meal from it and brought it in and served it to you. As for the word 'offal,' my good <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, the comic poet <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> in his play, Namesakes, represents a cook conversing with his pupils, and he says: 'Come now, Dromon, whatever cunning, clever, or subtle trick you know in your profession, bring it to light for the benefit of your teacher. Today I demand of you an exhibition of your skill. I am taking you into the enemy's country; charge right in without fear. They give out the cuts of meat carefully counted, and they keep their eyes on you Boil the cuts well and make them tender, and mix up the count as I have told you. They are going to have a fine large fish; the inwards are yours. And if you can dislodge a nice slice from it, that also is yours so long as we are in the house; once outdoors, it is mine. As for the offal and other accompaniments which by their nature can't be counted or tested, but which have only the rank or station of mince-meat, tomorrow we'll cheer ourselves, you and I, with them. By all means give a share to the master of the booty, that you may find a more friendly passage through the front door. Why need I say too much to one who understands as well as I? You are my scholar, I am your teacher. Remember the rules I have given you, and step this way with me.' </p>                        </div>

Then our noble host, Larensis, spoke up: How much better it is that our cooks should learn such things as these, rather than the things they learn at the house of a certain compatriot of ours! He, puffed up with wealth and luxury, used to compel the cooks to learn the dialogues of the most admirable <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, and, as they brought in the dishes, to say: 'One, two, three; but where, my dear <a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaeus</a>, is he who was the fourth among our guests of yesterday, who today are our hosts?' Then another answered: 'Some illness has fallen upon him, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>.' And so the slaves would go through with most of the dialogue in this manner. The result was that the feasters were bored, and that pedantic fellow was insulted every day, and for that reason many men of nice taste solemnly declined to attend the entertainments at his house. These cooks of ours, on the other hand, when they learn the things they do, perhaps afford you at the same time no little delight. And the slave, after being applauded for his skill in cookery, said: What have my predecessors discovered or declaimed that is like what I have done? Or may I weigh myself against ordinary cooks without boasting out of highly of my own success? And yet, even the first man to tie on the wreath of victory at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> contest, <a href=/people/1396 target=_blank>Coroebus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=person long=21.374 lat=37.89>Elis</a>, was a cook, and he did not puff himself up over his art so much as did the cook in <a href=/people/1718 target=_blank>Straton</a>'s phoenicides, of whom the man who hired him says the following: 'I have taken into my house a male <a href=/people/974 target=_blank>Sphinx</a>, not a cook. Really, I understand absolutely not one thing, the gods are my witness, of all that he says. He has come with a stock of strange expressions. For the moment he entered he looked at me and loudly asked, How many articulates have you invited to dinner? Tell me. I have invited Articulates to dinner? You're mad! Think you that I am acquainted with these Articulates? Not one of them is coming. That, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, is really the last straw — inviting Articulates to dinner! And so there is going to be no <a href=/people/5637 target=_blank>Epulator</a> present at all? <a href=/people/5637 target=_blank>Epulator</a>? No, at least I think not. I began to count up. There'll be <a href=/people/922 target=_blank>Philinus</a>, <a href=/people/1890 target=_blank>Moschion</a>, <a href=/people/1333 target=_blank>Niceratus</a>, Mr. What's-his-name, and Mr. Thingumbob. I ran over them all by name. I couldn't find even one named <a href=/people/5637 target=_blank>Epulator</a>. No, I said; no <a href=/people/5637 target=_blank>Epulator</a> will be here. What do you mean? Not even one? He became very indignant, as if he were wronged because I hadn't invited an <a href=/people/5637 target=_blank>Epulator</a>. It was very strange. Are you, then slaughtering a 'voracious <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>'? No, I replied. Nor 'broad-browed beef'? I'm not slaughtering a beef, you poor fool. Perchance you have an oblation of mutton? Not I, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, neither one of them; I'm killing a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>. Well, then, said he, is not mutton <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>? mutton <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>? I don't take you at all I don't know any of these things and I don't want to. I am too countrified. So talk to me simple. Don't you know that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> used these words? He might have used whatever he wanted to, cook, for all I care.

Do thou now, as <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> would say, give heed to what I still have to tell. So you really mean to kill me in Homeric fashion? That's my way of talking. Well, don't talk in that way when you are in my house. What, for your paltry four shillings, I am to throw away, says he, my scholastic principles? Hand me the sacrificial groats. What's that? The barley. Why, then, you paralytic, do you talk in tangled circumlocutions? Have you any precipitate? Precipitate! Get you into a bagnio, won't you, and speak out more plainly what you want to say to me. Unrecking of thy words art thou, old man, says he; hand me the salt! So that is a precipitate? Now show me the lustral water. It came. He slaughtered and kept on saying other words of such a nature that nobody, by <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Mother Earth</a>, could have understood them: cuttings, portions, double-folds, spits. I had to get some of <a href=/people/5182 target=_blank>Philitas</a>'s books and look up the meaning of every single word; but I entreated him to change his ways forthwith, and talk like a human being.

He cooked, I thought, a dish of stewed pork. GL. That's nice, certainly. A. But then he scorched it. GL. Don't worry; for that accident is easily remedied. A. How? GL. Just take some vinegar, pour it cold into a shallow pan, you understand, then put the pot, when still warm, into the vinegar; for if the pot is still hot, it will draw the moisture through itself, and in this ferment it will take on porous passages through it, like pumice, and through these will absorb the moisture. And so the pieces of meat will not be completely dried up, but will be nice and savoury, and of moist condition. A. <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>! No physician could cure better. <a href=/people/1094 target=_blank>Glaucias</a>, I will do that very thing. GL. Yes, and serve them, my boy, when you serve them, thoroughly cooled, you understand. For in that way no steam will leap to the nostrils, but will surely go up and be lost in flight. A. You're a much better speech-writer, as it now turns out, than cook. What you say you unsay. You bring your art into disrepute. And now enough of cooks, gentlemen of <a href=/people/3819 target=_blank>Dinnerville</a>; for I fear that one of them may take umbrage and bawl these words from <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>'s Peevish Man: the a single person has ever escaped scot-free after he wronged a cook.

Also: 'As yonder <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> snatched away the goose that was fed in the house.' And: 'Twenty geese I have in my house, that each wheat from the water-trough.' As for goose-livers, which are excessively sought after in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a> mentions them in The Wreath-sellers, saying: 'Unless you have the liver or mind of a goose.' There were also many half-heads of shoats. These are mentioned by <a href=/people/2042 target=_blank>Crobylus</a> in The False Substitute: There came in the tender half-head of a shoat. Of that, I swear by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, I didn't leave a bit. Next came the meat-pot, as it is called. This is composed of meats chopped fine, with the blood and the fat, in sweetened gravy. <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> the grammarian says that the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=place long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaea</a> give it this name. So spoke <a href=/people/841 target=_blank>Myrtilus</a>, and he added: <a href=/people/4845 target=_blank>Anticleides</a> in the eighth book of his <a href=/people/12255 target=_blank>Returns</a> says that 'the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> were once on the point of being massacred at a feast by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384265PEry class=ethnic long=26.4808 lat=38.3828>Erythraeans</a> as the result of a concerted plot; someone perceived what was on foot and recited: O ye <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a>, since mighty violence has the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384265PEry class=ethnic long=26.4808 lat=38.3828>Erythraeans</a> for its own, flee after ye have feasted on <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>'s flesh, but stay not for the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>. ' Boiled meat is mentioned by <a href=/people/353 target=_blank>Aristomenes</a> in Quacks thus: . . . They also ate testicles, which they called kidneys; <a href=/people/1208 target=_blank>Philippides</a> in The Fountain of Youth, dilating on the gluttony of the courtesan <a href=/people/1349 target=_blank>Gnathaena</a>, says: 'Then after all these viands a slave came bearing heaps of testicles. Now all the other females tittered with embarrassment, but that bloodthirsty <a href=/people/1349 target=_blank>Gnathaena</a>, with a loud laugh cried out at the same time, These are indeed fine kidneys, by the dear <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>. Then she snatched two of them and gulped them down, so that we tumbled on our backs with laughter.' Another speaker remarked that a very nice dish was capon with vinegar-oil sauce. Whereupon <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, who is so fond of criticizing others, and who lay on the couch alone, </p>                        </div>

Unless, to be sure, you are trying to tellings of what we call 'poll-fish' and 'sweet-fish,' the viands which are well known in my native land. To which the other said: The comic poet <a href=/people/937 target=_blank>Timocles</a> mentions vinegar-oil sauce in The Ring, saying: 'Dogfish and rays, and all the kinds of fish which are dressed with vinegar-oil sauce.' And some men were called 'oil-tops' by <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in The Lovelorn Lass, thus: 'Oil-tops they, though the rest of their bodies is wooden.' When a large fish was served once in an oil-pickle, someone said that any fish was very nice if served in an oil pickle; but <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, who likes to collect thorny questions, contracted his brows and said: Where is 'oil-pickle' to be found? As for your word for fish (opsarion), I know that that is not used in any author alive. Now most of the company told him to mind his own business, and went on eating; but <a href=/people/1240 target=_blank>Cynulcus</a> shouted the lines from The Breezes of <a href=/people/2115 target=_blank>Metagenes</a>: Nay, my good sir, let us dine first, and after that you may ask me anything you like; for just now I am hungry, and somehow have an awfully poor memory. And <a href=/people/841 target=_blank>Myrtilus</a> spoke up quite sweetly, enlisting in <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>'s cause, that he might not have a share in any food, but might spend all his time in talking; so he said: <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> in The <a href=/people/5139 target=_blank>Odysseis</a> has the word 'oil-pickle' in these lines: 'In return for this, I am going to seize all you trusty companions and toast, roast, and broil you on the brazier; and dipping you into pickle, oil-pickle, and after that garlic-pickle hot, I shall eat up that man among you all, O ye troopers, who looks to me the most nicely done.' And <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in The Wasps: Blow me away and hurl me into a hot oil-pickle.' As for opsarion, we use the word, and we are among 'authors who are alive.' But even <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> has it of fish in <a href=/people/1403 target=_blank>Peisander</a>: 'A. Have you ever, as sometimes happens, eaten a bit of fish (opsarion) and been sick, and it has disagreed with you? B. Indeed I have; last year, when I ate a crayfish.' <a href=/people/749 target=_blank>Pherecrates</a> in The Deserters: 'Somebody placed before us this fish.' <a href=/people/638 target=_blank>Philemon</a> in The Treasure: 'You can't cheat me, damn you, when you have rotten fish before my very eyes.' <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> in The Carthaginian: 'Although I offered a bit of incense to <a href=/people/208 target=_blank>Boreas</a>, yet I have caught never a fish; I shall have to make lentil-soup.' And in The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=demonym long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesian</a>: 'I got a fish for my luncheon.'

But if you will tell me, Master <a href=/people/841 target=_blank>Myrtilus</a>, said <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, where your word 'finding-happiness-in-the belly' comes from, and whether any of the ancients mentions <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=demonym long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasian</a> birds, I, in my turn, without 'sailing at break of day over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>,' will go to the market-place and buy a pheasant, which I will eat up with you. <a href=/people/841 target=_blank>Myrtilus</a> replied: On those conditions I will speak. finding-happiness-in-the belly' is a word used by <a href=/people/1583 target=_blank>Amphis</a> in Woman-<a href=/people/1051 target=_blank>Madness</a>.

There are first the heavy and non-flying, like the francolin, partridge, cock, pheasant, able to walk and covered with plumage as soon as hatched.' And <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> in the eighth book of his History of Animals writes as follows: 'Among the birds, some are given to dusting themselves, others to bathing, while others neither dust nor bathe. All that are non-flying, but keep to the ground, like to dust themselves, such as the hen, partridge, francolin, pheasant, and crested lark.' <a href=/people/661 target=_blank>Speusippus</a> also mentions the pheasant in the second book of <a href=/people/2446 target=_blank>Similars</a>.

If they are caught they not only cannot be tamed, but they do not even utter a note any more. If released, they become vocal again. <a href=/people/1171 target=_blank>Hipponax</a> mentions them thus: 'Eating not of francolins or hares.

For words of more than two syllables ending in as with a long, when the penult contains a, are barytone; thus, akamas (untiring), <a href=/people/2661 target=_blank>Sacadas</a>, adamas (adamant). Further, in the plural one should say attagai and not attagenes. The Purple Coot. — It is well known at the <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> mentions this bird also. <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a>, in the fifth book of his Address to <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> and <a href=/people/2580 target=_blank>Adaeus</a>, says of the purple coot that when it is domesticated the bird keeps a sharp eye on married women and is so affected if the wife commits adultery that when it suspects this it ends its life by strangling and so gives warning to its master. <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> adds that the bird does not take food until it has walked round and found a spot suitable to itself; after doing this it rolls in the dust and bathes, and then only does it feed. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says that it has parted toes, a bluish colour, long legs, a beak which is red all the way from the head; it is of the size of the cock, but has a small gullet, hence it grasps its food with its feet and breaks it up into small bits; it drinks, however, in gulps. It has five toes, the middle being the largest. <a href=/people/10765 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=person long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndus</a> in the second book of Inquiry into Birds says that this bird is Libyan and sacred to the gods which are worshipped in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. The Redbird. — <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a>, in his treatise On Birds, says that the purple coot (porphyrion) is distinct from the redbird (porphyris), classifying each separately; he further says that the purple coot eats its food burrowing in a dark place, that no one may observe it. For it hates those who approach its food. The redbird is mentioned also by <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in The Birds. <a href=/people/1631 target=_blank>Ibycus</a> gives the name of hiding-red to certain birds in these lines: 'Here, on the topmost boughs, perch speckled guans, and hiding-redbirds with necks of sheen, and long-winged halcyons. And in other lines he says: . . . me ever, O heart of mine, as when a long-winged redbird . . .

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001:9.389'><b>&sect; 9.389</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=/people/456 target=_blank>Phrynichus</a> in The Tragedians: also <a href=/people/450 target=_blank>Cleombrotus</a>, son of Partridge (perdikos). The name of the creature is often employed symbolically to describe salaciousness. <a href=/people/3434 target=_blank>Nicophon</a> in Hand-to-mouth Toilers: The boiled small fry and those partridges yonder. <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> makes the penult short in Revellers: They brought cuttlefish a swimming and partridges (perdikas) on the wing. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says of the creature: The partridge lives on land and has parted toes; it lives for fifteen years, but the female may even longer. For in the case of birds the females are more long-lived than the males. It sits on the eggs and hatches them out just as the hen does. When it becomes aware that it is being hunted, it proceeds away from the nest and hobbles along near the hunter's legs, exciting hopes of being caught, and so deceives him until the young have flown away, when it also flies out of reach. The creature is malicious and mischievous, also salacious. Hence it crushes the female's eggs in order to gratify its desires. The female, becoming aware of this, runs away and lays its eggs. The same facts are recorded by <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a> also in his work On Birds. Those which have no mates fight against each other, and the one that is defeated is forced to mate with the victor. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says that all the males mate in turn with the defeated bird. Even the tame birds mate with the wild. When one bird is beaten by the second, it is mated by the victor in secret. This happens at a certain season of the year, as <a href=/people/10765 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=person long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndus</a> also declares. Males and females nest on the ground, each in a separate place. Against a decoy partridge the leader of the wild birds forces his way to fight him; if the leader is beaten another comes up to fight. Now when the decoy bird is a male, this is their procedure; but when the decoy is a female, she sings until the leader comes to meet her. The other birds gather and try to chase him away from the female because he pays attention to her instead of to them. Hence it often happens, for this reason, that he approaches her silently, that no other bird may hear his call and come to fight him. Sometimes the female puts the male to silence when he approaches her. Often, too, it rises from the nest where it is brooding, whenever it sees her male approaching the decoy, and even submits to copulation in order to draw him away from the decoy. Partridges and quails are excited to such a degree over the act of copulation that they throw themselves among the decoy birds, alighting upon their heads. They even say that the female partridges, which are led as decoys to the hunt, the moment they catch sight or smell of the males standing or flying about to windward of them, become pregnant, and some even lay immediately. And so, at the season of mating, they fly about with beak open and with tongue projecting, the females as well as the males. <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> says in the essay On Panic: Sparrows, partridges, cocks less, and quails emit screams not merely if they see the females, but even if they hear their call. The cause of this is the imaginative thought of union arising in their consciousness. This becomes most obvious at the season of mating, when you place a mirror directly in their path; for, deceived by the reflection, they run up to it and so are caught; they then emit semen — all, that is, excepting the barn-yard fowls. The latter are simply provoked of the fight by the sight of the reflection. So much, then, for what <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> says. </p>                        </div>

Hence also <a href=/people/1696 target=_blank>Chamaeleon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=person long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> has said: The men of old devised the invention of music from the birds singing in solitary places; by way of imitating them, men instituted the art of music. But not all partridges, he adds, utter the note caccabe; <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, at any rate, in the chapter On the Difference in Voice among Congeners, says that the partridges of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> found on this side of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236LKor class=place long=23.632 lat=37.995>Corydallus</a> in the direction of the city, cry caccabe, but those on the other side cry tittybe. <a href=/people/6290 target=_blank>Basilis</a>, in the second book of the History of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, says that the dwarfs, who continually wage war with the cranes, use partridges as mounts to ride upon. But menecles, in the first part of his Collection, says that the <a href=/people/10944 target=_blank>Pygmies</a> wage war on the partridges and the cranes. There is another kind of partridge in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> with dark plumage and smaller in build, having a beak not of vermilion colour. The partridges from the neighbourhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384225PKir class=place long=22.4455 lat=38.4296>Cirrha</a> have a flesh which is uneatable on account of their food. Those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=person long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a> either do not cross over into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, or if they do, they become recognizable by their note, as we have said before. The partridges that are found in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap class=place long=30 lat=41>Paphlagonia</a>, says <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, have two hearts; those on the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392235PSki class=place long=23.4885 lat=39.164>Sciathos</a> eat snails. Partridges sometimes lay as many as fifteen or even sixteen eggs. They can fly only a short distance, as <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> says in the first book of his Anabasis, writing as follows: 'As for the bustards, if one starts them up suddenly it is possible to catch them; for they can fly only a short distance, like partridges, and they soon get tired. But their flesh is of good flavour. <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a> says that <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> is quite right about the bustards. For these creatures are brought in very large numbers to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, which is adjacent, and the mode of catching them is this. This creature, the otus, is given to mimicry, particularly of anything which it sees a man doing. At any rate, it does the same things that it sees the hunters doing. So the hunters take a position in plain sight of the birds and smear their eyes with an unguent after preparing other unguents which cause eyes and eyelids to stick together; these they place at no great distance from themselves in small pans. The bustards, therefore, seeing the men smearing themselves, take the unguent from the pans and do the same thing, and are quickly caught. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> writes thus concerning them: It belongs to the class of migrating birds, and of those which have parted toes and are three-toed; in size like a large rooster; coloured like a quail, head elongated, beak sharp, neck slender, eyes large, tongue bony; it has no crop. <a href=/people/10765 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=person long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndus</a> says that it is also called lagodias. He says that it chews the cud and takes delight in a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. If, at any rate, one should put on a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>'s hide, he would catch as many as he likes. For they will come close. In another passage, again, <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says: The otus is like the <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a>, but is not nocturnal. It has horns at the ears (ota), whence its name, otus; it has the size of a pigeon, and imitates human beings; when it dances, at any rate, in imitation of man, it can be caught. It looks like a man in its features, and is imitative of everything that a man does. </p>                        </div>

In catching <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owls</a>, at any rate, the man who is most adept dances after he has taken his place where they can see him, and the creatures, looking at the dancer, move like marionettes. Another hunter, taking his station behind them, catches them when rapt in the pleasure of mimicry before they know it. They say that the horned <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owls</a> also do the same thing; for it is common report that they are caught by dancing. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> mentions them. A kind of dance is called skops from them, receiving its name from the variety of movements observed in the creature. These <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owls</a> also delight in mimicry, and from them we give the term skoptein to the copying and hitting off of persons we ridicule, because we practise the method of the <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owls</a> (skopes). All birds which have well-developed tongues can also make articulate tones, and can imitate the sounds made by men by other birds; such are the parrot and the magpie. Now the horned <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a>, as <a href=/people/10765 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=person long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndus</a> says, is smaller than the common <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a>, and upon a ground of lead-colour it has whitish spots; at the brow it bears feathers extending upwards beside each temple. <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a> says that there are two kinds of horned <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owls</a> (skopes), and that the one kind utters notes, the other does not. Hence, he says, the first are called skopes, the second aeiskopes; their eyes are glaring. <a href=/people/10765 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=person long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndus</a> says that the word for horned <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owls</a> in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> is written without the s (kopes), and <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> has called them by that name. These <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owls</a> appear at all seasons and cannot be eaten. But those which appear one or two days in the autumn are edible. They differ from the aeiskopes in plumpness, and are similar to the turtle-dove and the ringdove. <a href=/people/661 target=_blank>Speusippus</a>, also, in the second book of <a href=/people/2446 target=_blank>Similars</a>, gives them the name kopes, without the s. <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> has: Horned <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owls</a> (skopes), hoopoes, common <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owls</a>. <a href=/people/435 target=_blank>Metrodorus</a>, again, says in the treatise On Habit that horned <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owls</a> are caught by their imitation of dancing. Since, in our account of partridges, we mentioned that they are very much given to copulation, let it be recorded that the bird which is also lustful is the rooster. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, at any rate, says that when roosters are dedicated in sacred places, those which have been there for some time before cover the one newly dedicated until another bird is dedicated; and if none be dedicated, they fight against one another, and the victor continually covers the vanquished. It is also recorded that a rooster, when entering any door, raises his crest, and that he does not cede to another bird the right to cover without a battle. <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> declares that wild birds are more given to covering than the domestic. He even says that the males are eager to consort as soon as they rise from the nest, the females as the day advances farther. Sparrows, too, are given to copulation; hence terpsicles says that they who eat sparrows are prone to lust. Perhaps, then, <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a> draws from a fact in nature when she makes <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> ride in a car drawn by sparrows; for the creature is given to riding, and is prolific. At any rate, the sparrow lays as many as eight eggs, according to <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>. <a href=/people/10765 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=person long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndus</a> says that there are two kinds of sparrows, domestic and wild; the females among them are more insignificant, especially in their beak, which is more hornlike in colour, and they have faces neither very white nor very dark. </p>                        </div>

Quails. — The question is raised in general concerning nouns which end in YX, why it is that in the genitive these nouns do not employ the same consonant in forming the last syllable (I mean nouns like onyx, nail, and ortyx, quail). Simple dissyllabic masculines ending in x, when preceded by y, and when they have at the beginning of the last syllable one of the unchangeable sounds, or one of the sounds characteristic of what is called the first declension of barytone words, are inflected in the genitive with k; thus keryx, herald, genitive kerykos; pelyx, axe, pelykos; <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380126UEry class=place long=12.588 lat=38.04>Eryx</a>, the mountain, Erykos; <a href=/people/5508 target=_blank>Bebryx</a>, <a href=/people/8978 target=_blank>Bebrykos</a> But all those which do not have this character are inflected with g: ortyx, quail, genitive ortygos; oryx, pickaxe, orygos; kokkyx, cuckoo, kokkygos. Noteworthy is onyx, nail, onychos. Furthermore, as a general rule, the genitive singular follows the nominative plural and employs the same consonant in forming the last syllable. This is also true if the noun is inflected without a consonant. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says: The quail belongs to the class of migrating birds, and of those which have parted toes; it does not make a nest, but a rolling-place in the dust; this it shelters with twigs, on account of the hawks, and here it broods over its eggs. <a href=/people/10765 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=person long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndus</a>, in the second book of his work On Animals, says: The female quail is slender-necked, and has not the black markings of male under the chin. When dissected, it is seen not to have a large crop, but it has a large heart, and this has three lobes. It has also the liver and the gall bladder tightly joined in the intestines, a spleen small and difficult to discover, and testicles under the liver, as in the case of roosters. Respecting their origin, <a href=/people/3232 target=_blank>Phanodemus</a> says in the second book of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> History: When <a href=/people/1871 target=_blank>Erysichthon</a> perceived the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a>, which was called <a href=/people/3650 target=_blank>Ortygia</a> (Quail Island) by the ancients because of the flocks of these birds, as they were borne from the sea, settled upon the island, since it offered security . . . <a href=/people/670 target=_blank>Eudoxus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=person long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidus</a>, in the first book of his Description of the <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>, says that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a> sacrifice quails to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, because <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, the son of <a href=/people/2083 target=_blank>Asteria</a> and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, went into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> and was killed by <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a>; but <a href=/people/502 target=_blank>Iolaus</a> brought a quail to him, and having put it close to him, he smelt it and came to life again. For when he was alive, <a href=/people/670 target=_blank>Eudoxus</a> says, <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> had delighted in this bird. <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a> in The Island Towns gives a diminutive form to their name, saying: A. Have you ever at any time kept quails? B. Indeed I have; some tiny little quails (ortygia). And what of it? <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> in The Farmer has this diminutive in the singular, thus: Why! What then are you able to do, you with the heart of a quail (ortygion)? <a href=/people/2778 target=_blank>Pratinas</a>, singularly enough, in The Dymaenae or <a href=/people/11093 target=_blank>Caryatids</a>, calls the quail sweet-voiced; but perhaps among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378226PPhl class=ethnic long=22.648 lat=37.846>Phliasians</a> or the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconians</a> they may be tuneful, as the partridges are.

He says: In the mating season of the quails, if one places a mirror in their path and a noose in front of the mirror, they will run to meet the reflection in the mirror and will be caught in the noose. <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> records similar facts of the birds called koloioi (jackdaws) in these words: So it is also with jackdaws, because of their innate love of their kind. Although they beat everything else in craftiness, nevertheless when a bowl full of oil is set, those of them which stand on the brim and look down cast themselves headlong upon the reflection.

But <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> made it short in The <a href=/people/280 target=_blank>Peace</a>, for the sake of the metre: Home-bred quails (ortyges). The so called chennia (it is a small quail) are mentioned by <a href=/people/81 target=_blank>Cleomenes</a> in his Letter to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, writing as follows: Ten thousand smoked coots, five thousand thrushes, ten thousand smoked quails (chennia).

Even swans were not often missing at our banquet; of them <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says: The swan loves its young, and it is belligerent; the belligerent, at any rate, is inclined to mutual slaughter. It will even fight the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>, though it will not provoke the fight. They are also given to song, especially as their end draws near. They even sing while they are crossing the deep sea. It belongs to the class of web-footed and grass-eating birds. But <a href=/people/10765 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=person long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndus</a> says that, although he has closely followed many dying swans, he never heard them sing. <a href=/people/2749 target=_blank>Hegesianax</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398262UAnt class=person long=26.159 lat=39.752>Alexandria</a>, who composed the work entitled <a href=/people/4475 target=_blank>Cephalion</a>'s <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> War, says that the <a href=/people/853 target=_blank>Cycnus</a> (Swan) who fought in single combat against <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> was reared in <a href=/people/2528 target=_blank>Leucophrys</a> by the bird whose name he bore. According to <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philochorus</a>, <a href=/people/3547 target=_blank>Boeus</a>, or <a href=/people/7386 target=_blank>Boeo</a>, in the Ornithogony, says that <a href=/people/853 target=_blank>Cycnus</a> was changed into a bird by <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>, and come gate to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397165PSyb class=place long=16.491 lat=39.714>Sybaris</a> river he consorted with a crane. He also says that <a href=/people/853 target=_blank>Cycnus</a> placed in his nest the grass that is called willow-grass. <a href=/people/3547 target=_blank>Boeus</a> says also, of the crane, that she had been a woman eminent among the <a href=/people/10944 target=_blank>Pygmies</a>, named Gerana. She, honoured as a god by her citizens, held the true gods in low esteem herself, especially <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> and <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>. <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>, therefore, became angry, metamorphosed her into a bird of ugly shape, and made her an enemy and hateful to the <a href=/people/10944 target=_blank>Pygmies</a> who had honoured her; <a href=/people/3547 target=_blank>Boeus</a> also says that from her and Nicodanas was born the land tortoise.

But in the fifth book of Parts of Animals he does not mention the stock-dove, although <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a>, in the satyric drama <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a>, mentions the bird thus: The poor, unhappy stock-dove feeding, its shattered sides broken in two when caught on the winnowing-fans. In <a href=/people/448 target=_blank>Philoctetes</a>, declining the word in the genitive (plural), he has phabon. Now the rock-dove, <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says, is larger than the pigeon, and has a winey colour. The stock-dove is intermediate between the pigeon and the rock-dove, while the ring-dove is of the size of the cock, with ashy colour; the turtle-dove is smaller than all the others, and has a grey colour. It appears in summer, but during the winter lives in holes. The stock-dove and the pigeon appear at all seasons, but the rock-dove only in the autumn. The ring-dove is said to be more long-lived than these others; in fact it lives thirty or forty years. Until death comes, the males do not desert the females, nor the females the males, but when one dies, whichever is left lives in solitary bereavement. The same is true also of <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crows</a>, ravens, and jackdaws. In the entire pigeon class, male and female sit on the eggs in turn, and when the young are hatched the male spits on them that they may not be bewitched. It lays two eggs, the first of which makes a male, the second a female. They lay at all seasons of the year; hence they lay as much as ten times in Tyr, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> even twelve times. Having laid once, the hen conceives again the next day. Again, in the same passage, <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says that the pigeon (peristera) is different; that the wild pigeon is smaller, and that it becomes tame; the pigeon, moreover, is dark and small, with red, rough feet; hence nobody keeps it as a domestic fowl. DA peculiarity of the pigeon, he says, is that they bill each other when they are about to couple; otherwise the females will not tolerate the male. But the older bird, he says, can mount the female first even without billing. Younger birds always cover only after they have done this. Even the females cover each other when no male is near, after billing. And though they eject nothing into each other, they lay eggs, but no chick comes from them. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor class=ethnic long=22.4 lat=38.7>Dorians</a> use the word peleias for peristera, as, for example, <a href=/people/1229 target=_blank>Sophron</a>, in his Mimes of Women. But <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a>, in his book On Birds, explains phassa (ring-dove), pyrallis, pigeon, and turtle-dove, as different birds. <a href=/people/10765 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=person long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndus</a> says that the ring-dove, does not raise its head when drinking, as does the turtle-dove, and that it makes no sound in the winter season except after a period of fair weather. It is said that if the rock-dove eats the seed of the mistletoe and then lets a dropping fall upon a tree, a new growth of mistletoe is produced. <a href=/people/4135 target=_blank>Daimachus</a>, in his History of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, records that yellow pigeons occur in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>. <a href=/people/537 target=_blank>Charon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403267UPit class=person long=26.6992 lat=40.3467>Lampsacus</a>, in giving an account of <a href=/people/252 target=_blank>Mardonius</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> host that was destroyed off Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402243LAth class=place long=24.327 lat=40.158>Athos</a>, writes, in his History of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>: On that occasion white pigeons appeared for the first time in Greece, having never occurred there before. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says that when their young are hatched, pigeons open their mouths and spit into them salty earth with they have chewed, and by this means prepare them for taking their food.

The kind called glaucion, because of the colour of its eyes, is a little smaller than the common duck. Of those called feeders, the male has conspicuous markings; but it is less . . . than the duck. The males have beaks which are flat and proportionately smaller than the duck's. The little grebe, smallest of all aquatic birds, is a dirty black in colour, and it has a beak which is sharp and protects the eyes; it dives below frequently. There is also another kind of feeder larger than the common duck, but smaller than a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> goose. The birds called phaskades are a little larger than the grebes; they resemble ducks in other repulses. The so called uria is not much smaller than a duck; in colour it is of a dirty clay, and it has a long and narrow bill. The coot, likewise, has a narrow bill; it is rounder in appearance; its breast is ashy-coloured, its back somewhat darker. The duck (netta) and the grebe (kolymbas), from which are derived the verbs nechesthai (swim) and kolymban (dive), are mentioned along with many other marsh birds by <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381237DAch class=ethnic long=23.7332 lat=38.0803>Acharnians</a>, in these lines: Ducks, jackdaws, francolins, coots, sandpipers, grebes. <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a>, too, mentions them in his work On Birds.

And all this is not a matter of recent times, but has been going on for more than thirty years. The word for <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peacock</a> (tahos), says <a href=/people/1120 target=_blank>Tryphon</a>, is pronounced by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> with circumflex accent and the rough breathing on the last syllable. And it is in this way that the reading occurs in <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a>, Out of the Service (the testimony has been given above), and in The Birds of <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>: 'What! You are really <a href=/people/682 target=_blank>Tereus</a>? Are you a bird or a <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peacock</a> (tahos)?' And again: 'It's a bird, of course. What in the related is it: It can't be a <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peacock</a> (tahos), can it?' They also use the dative form tahoni, as <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in the same play. But it is difficult for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=ethnic long=27.3 lat=38>Ionians</a>, in words of more than one syllable, to put the rough breathing on the last syllable beginning with a vowel. In any case consistency requires that the last syllable have the smooth breathing, like neos (temple), leos (people), <a href=/people/7021 target=_blank>Tyndareos</a>, Meneleos, leiponeos (deserting the ship), euneos (supplied with ships), Neileos, praos (mild), hyios (son), Ceios (<a about=https://topostext.org/place/376243IKeo class=demonym long=24.3333 lat=37.6167>Cean</a>), <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a>) (<a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=demonym long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chian</a>), dios (divine), chreios (useful), pleios (full), leios (smooth), laios (left), baios (little), phaios (grey), peos (kinsman), goos (mourning), thoos (quick), rhoos (stream), zoos (alive).

The bird is called tahos from the extending (tasis) of its feathers. <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>, in the fifth book of his work On Greek, says: Tahos; contrary to the rule, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> writers aspirate and circumflex. In the simple pronunciation of words, the rough breathing is wont to be pronounced in connexion with the initial vowel, and in that position it speeds forward and hurries faster and so extends over the whole word. Hence the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, recognizing also the true nature of this accent by its position, do not put it directly over the vowels as they do the other marks of accent, but place it in front of them. I believe also that the ancients expressed the rough breathing by the letter H (eta). Hence, too, the Romans write H before all aspirated words, thus marking clearly its quality of leadership. If, then, that is the nature of the rough breathing, perhaps its addition on the last syllable of the word taos by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> writers is irrational. Many other remarks were made in the course of the symposium concerning each of the dishes brought in; and Larensis then said: Well, even I myself, like the altogether noble <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a>, have something to propound to you; for we feed on questions. What do you think the tetrax is? Someone replied, A kind of bird. Now it is the fashion among grammarians to say to their pupils, concerning all kinds of problems, That's a kind of plant, or A kind of bird, or A kind of stone. Larensis said: Even I know, good sir, that the witty <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> mentions it in these words, in The Birds: 'To the purple coot and the pelican, to the pelicinus and the phlexis, to the tetrax and the <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peacock</a>.' I am anxious to learn from you whether any mention of it occurs in any other author. For <a href=/people/10765 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371272UMyn class=person long=27.2347 lat=37.058>Myndus</a>, in the second book of his work On Winged Animals, makes no mention of the large bird called tetrax, but of one which is very small. He says, namely: 'The tetrax is equal in size to the francolin; in colour it is like clay, varied with dusky spots and large lines; it is a fruit-eater. When it lays an egg, it utters a cackling sound.' And <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> in The Marriage of <a href=/people/576 target=_blank>Hebe</a>: 'For they take quails and sparrows, and crested larks that love to roll in the dust, seed-picking pheasants too, and shining fig-peckers.' And in other verses he says: there were also many herons with long curving necks and seed-licking pheasants.' Now, since you have nothing to add (for you are silent), I will exhibit the bird to you. For being procurator of the Lord Emperor in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440205RMys class=place long=20.5 lat=44>Moesia</a> and having charge of the administration of that province, I have seen the bird in that country. Learning that that was the name given to the bird among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440205RMys class=ethnic long=20.5 lat=44>Moesians</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415220RPai class=ethnic long=22.01 lat=41.5>Paeonians</a>, I recalled it in the verse of <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>. I thought, too, that the creature must have been deemed worthy of mention by the learned <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> in that costly treatise of his; for the story goes that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406238PSta class=demonym long=23.7946 lat=40.5918>Stagirite</a> received eight hundred talents from <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> to further his research on animals; but I could not find anything said about it, and I was glad to have the witty <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> as a most trustworthy witness. As he said these words, someone came in bringing the pheasant in its cage. In size it was larger than the largest cock, in appearance it resembled a purple coot; from its ears, on each side of the head, hung the wattles, like those of cocks; its voice was of low pitch. </p>                        </div>

But among us the ordinary form of the nominative case is λαγός; and as we say ναὸς, and the Attics νεὼς, and as we say λαὸς, and the Attics λεώς; so, while we call this animal λαγὸς, they call him λαγώς.

But some people, contrary to all reason, circumflex the last syllable of this form λαγώ; but it ought to have an acute accent, since all the nouns which end in ος, even when they. are changed into ως by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> writers, still preserve the same accent as if they had undergone no alteration; as ναὸς, νεώς; κάλος, κάλως.

And it has in its womb at one time one litter with the fur on, and another bare, and another just formed, and a fourth only just conceived. And <a href=/people/160 target=_blank>Polybius</a>, in the twelfth book of his History, says that. there is another animal like the hare which is called the rabbit (κούνικλος); and he writes as follows — The animal called the rabbit, when seen at a distance, looks like a small hare; but when any one takes it in his hands, there is a great difference between them, both in appearance and taste: and it lives chiefly underground.

But he, without giving the matter any long consideration, but rather turning the question off, said — But it does seem to me, my friends, that if you are not yet satisfied, after having had such plenty of all these things, that you surpass every one who has ever been celebrated for his powers of eating, — and who those people are you can find out by inquiry. But it is more correct and more consistent with etymology to make the name σὺς, with a ς; for the animal has its name from rushing (σεύομαι) and going on impetuously; but men have got a trick of pronouncing the word without the ς,ὗς; and some people believe that it is called σῦν, by being softened from θῦν, as if it had its name from being a fit animal to sacrifice (θύειν). But now, if it seems good to you, answer me who ever uses the compound word like we do, calling the wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> not σῦς ἄγριος, but σύαγρος̣ At all events, <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>, in his Lovers of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, has applied the word σύαγρος to a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, as hunting the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> (ἀπὸ τοῦ σῦς ἀγρεύειν), where he says — And you, Syagre, child of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394230LPel class=place long=23.046 lat=39.437>Pelion</a>.

At all events, Chitomachus the Carthaginian, who is inferior to no one of the new <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAca class=place long=23.707 lat=37.992>Academy</a> for his spirit of philosophical investigation, says that a certain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=demonym long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Theban</a> athlete surpassed all the men of his time in strength, because he ate <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>'s flesh; for the juice of that meat is nervous and sticky, and such as can remain a long time in the substance of the body. And this wrestler used to be much laughed at, because of the unpleasant smell of his perspiration. And all the meat of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> and <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a>, while it remains undigested in the system, is very apt to turn, because of the fat. But the banquets spoken of by the comic poets rather please the ears by sweet sounds, than the palate by sweet tastes; as, for instance, the feast mentioned by <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>, in his Female Physician — A. But what meat do you eat with most delight? B. What meat? — why if you mean as to its cheapness, There's mutton ere it bears you wool or milk, That is to say, there's <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a>, my friend; and so There's also meat of <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> which give no milk, That is to say, of <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kids</a>.

These men effaced all vulgar old recipes Out of their cookery books, and took away The mortar from the middle of the kitchen. They brought into disuse all vinegar, Cummin, and cheese, and assafoetida, And coriander seed, and all the sauces Which <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a> used to keep within his cruets. And the cook who employ'd such means they thought A humbug, a mere mountebank in his art. They used oil only, and clean plates, O father, And a quick fire, wanting little bellows: With this they made each dinner elegant. They were the first who banish'd tears and sneezing, And spitting from the board; and purified The manners of the guests. At last the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=demonym long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodian</a>, Drinking some pickle by mistake, did die; For such a draught was foreign to his nature.

And if you will, you too shall taste a specimen Of this my skill. I do not always give The self-same dishes to all kinds of guests; But I regard their lives and habits all. One dish I set before my friends in love, Another's suited to philosophers, Another to tax-gatherers. A youth Who has a mistress, quickly will devour His patrimonial inheritance; So before him I place fat cuttle-fish Of every sort; and dishes too of fish Such as do haunt the rocks, all season'd highly With every kind of clear transparent sauce. For such a man cares nought about his dinner, But all his thoughts are on his mistress fix'd. Then to philosophers I serve up ham, Or pettitoes; for all that crafty tribe Are wonderful performers at the table. <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>Owls</a>, eels, and spars I give the publicans, When they're in season, but at other times Some lentil salad. And all funeral feasts I make more splendid than the living ones. For old men's palates are not critical; At least not half so much as those of youths. And so I give them mustard, and I make them Sauces of pungent nature, which may rouse Their dormant sense, and make it snug the air; And when I once behold a face, I know The dishes that its owner likes to eat. </p>                        </div>

For he should regard This single point — whom he has got to please While seasoning his sauces properly; And by this means he'll know the proper way And time to lay his table and to dress His meats and soups. But he who this neglects Is not a cook, though he may be a seasoner. But these are different arts, a wondrous space Separates the two. It is not every one That's called a general who commands an army, But he who can with prompt and versatile skill Avail himself of opportunities, And look about him, changing quick his plans, He is the general. He who can't do this Is only in command. And so with us. To roast some beef, to carve a joint with neatness, To boil up sauces, and to blow the fire, Is anybody's task; he who does this Is but a seasoner and broth-maker: A cook is quite another thing. His mind Must comprehend all facts and circumstances: Where is the place, and when the time of supper; Who are the guests, and who the entertainer; What fish he ought to buy, and when to buy it. . . . . . For all these things You'll have on almost every occasion; But they're not always of the same importance, Nor do they always the same pleasure give. <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a> has written on this art, And is by many people highly thought of, As having given us a useful treatise; But still there's much of which he's ignorant, And all his rules are really good for nothing, So do not mind or yield to all the rules Which he has laid down most authoritatively, For a more empty lot of maxims you Will hardly find. For when you write a book On cookery, it will not do to say, As I was just now saying; for this art Has no fix'd guide but opportunity, And must itself its only mistress be. But if your skill be ne'er so great, and yet You let the opportunity escape, Your art is lost, and might as well be none. BO man, you're wise. But as for this man who You just now said was coming here to try His hand at delicate banquets, say, does he Forget to come? A. If I but make you now One forced meat ball, I can in that small thing Give you a specimen of all my skill.

Do you then — Give us now something new to see beyond Your predecessor's art, or plague us not; But show me what you've got, and tell its name. And he rejoins — You look down on me, since I am a cook. But perhaps — What I have made by practising my art — according to the comic poet <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, who, in his play entitled The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=person long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagite</a>, has spoken as follows — What I have made by practising my art Is more than any actor e'er has gain'd, — This smoky art of mine is quite a kingdom. I was a caper-pickler with <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>, And at the court of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> king, <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a>, I was the very first To introduce the royal dish of lentils. My chief exploit I have not mention'd yet: There was a famine, and a man named <a href=/people/1538 target=_blank>Lachares</a> Was giving an entertainment to his friends; Whom I recovered with some caper-sauce. <a href=/people/1538 target=_blank>Lachares</a> made <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> naked, who caused him no inconvenience; but I will now strip you who are inconveniencing me, said <a href=/people/1261 target=_blank>Aemilianus</a>, unless you show me what you have got with you. And he said at last, rather unwillingly, I call this dish the Dish of Roses. And it is prepared in such a way, that you may not only have the ornament of a garland on your head, but also in yourself, and so feast your whole body with a luxurious banquet. Having pounded a quantity of the most fragrant roses in a mortar, I put in the brains of birds and <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> boiled and thoroughly cleansed of all the sinews, and also the yolks of eggs, and with them oil, and pickle-juice, and pepper, and wine. And having pounded all these things carefully together, I put them into a new dish, applying a gentle and steady fire to them. And while saying this, he uncovered the dish, and diffused such a sweet perfume over the whole party, that one of the guests present said with great truth — The winds perfumed the balmy gale convey Through heav'n, through earth, and all the aerial way; so excessive was the fragrance which was diffused from the roses. </p>                        </div>

But the grammarian appears to have taken this observation from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> writers, since <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> says, somewhere or other — Marshall'd in order due, to each a sewer Presents, to bathe his hands (νίψασθαι), a radiant ewer; Luxuriant then they feast.

And χέρνιψ means the water into which they used to dip a firebrand which they took from the altar on which they were offering the sacrifice, and then sprinkling the bystanders with it, they purified them. But the accusative χερνιβα ought to be written with an acute accent on the antepenultima; for all compound words like that, ending in ψ, derived from the perfect passive, preserve the vowel of the penultima of that perfect tense. And if the perfect ends its penultimate syllable with a double μμ, then the derivative has a grave on the ultima, as λέλειμμαι αἰγίλιψ, τέτριμμαιοἰκότριψ, κέκλεμμαι βοόκλεψ (a word found in <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> and applied to <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a>), βέβλεμμαι κατώβλεψ (a word found in <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403265LChe class=place long=26.5 lat=40.3333>Chersonese</a>, in his poem on Things of a Peculiar Nature: and in the oblique cases such words keep the accent on the same syllable.

On which account <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> says, in the first edition of his <a href=/people/1000 target=_blank>Autolycus</a>- For when there are ten thousand ills in Greece, There's none that's worse than the whole race of athletes. For, first of all, they learn not to live well, Nor could they do so; for could any man Being a slave to his own jaws and appetite . Acquire wealth beyond his father's riches! How could a man like that increase his substance? Nor yet can they put up with poverty, Or ever accommodate themselves to fortune; And so being unaccustomed to good habits, They quickly fall into severe distress. In youth they walk about in fine attire, And think themselves a credit to the city; But when old age in all its bitterness Overtakes their steps, they roam about the streets, Like ragged cloaks whose nap is all worn off. And much I blame the present fashions, too, Which now in Greece prevail; where many a feast Is made to pay great honour to such men, And to show false respect to vain amusements. . For though a man may wrestle well, or run, Or throw a discus, or strike a heavy blow, Still where's the good his country can expect From all his victories and crowns and prizes? Will they fight with their country's enemies With discus in hand? Or will their speed assist To make the hostile bands retreat before them? When men stand face to face with the hostile sword They think no more of all these fooleries. It were better to adorn good men and wise With these victorious wreaths; they are the due Of those who govern states with wisdom sound, . And practise justice, faith, and temperance; Who by their prudent language ward off evils, Banishing wars and factions. These are the men, Who're not alone a grace and ornament To their own land, but to the whole of Greece. </p>                        </div>

And you find some people say that the expression in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> — Take care and give less water (ζωρότερον κέραιρε), does not mean that there is to be less water, but that the draught is to be hot; urging derivation from ζωτικος (giving life), and from ζεσις (boiling); — for that, as there were companions present, it would have been absurd to begin mixing the cups of wine over again. But some say that the word is to be understood as equivalent to ευκρατον (well mixed); just as we find the form δεξιτερόν used instead of δεξιόν. And some say that, since the year is called ωρος, and since the particle ζα indicates magnitude or number, ζωρος means merely what has been made many years. And <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>, in his Paederasts, says — Pour me now out a cup of wine to drink; Give it, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>! εύζωροτερον than that; For wat'ry things are ruinous to the stomach. And <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, in his treatise on Drinking, says that ζωρότερον means mixed; quoting the following lines of <a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a>; — And soon the things which formerly they learnt Immortal were, did mortal now become, And things unmixed before became now mixed (ζωρά) Changing their previous ways and habits all. </p>                        </div>

And he also says, Old men become drunk more quickly on account of the small quantity of natural warmth which there is in them, and also of the weakness of what there is. And again, those who are very young get drunk very quickly, on account of the great quantity of natural warmth that there is in them; for, in consequence, they are easily subdued by the warmth proceeding from the wine which is added to their natural warmth. And some of the brute beasts are also capable of becoming intoxicated; such as <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> when they are filled with the husks of pressed grapes; and the whole race of <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crows</a>, and of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>, when they have eaten of the herb called oenussa: and the monkey and the elephant get intoxicated if they drink wine; on which account they hunt monkeys and <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crows</a> when the former have been made drunk with wine, and the latter with oenussa. But to drink unceasingly — as <a href=/people/2042 target=_blank>Crobylus</a> says, in his Woman who deserted her Husband — Can have No pleasure in it, surely; how should it, When it deprives a living man of power To think as he should think and yet is thought The greatest blessing that is given to man.

But I, since I have now made this digression about the mixtures of the ancients, will resume the thread of my original discourse where I let it drop; considering what was said by <a href=/people/529 target=_blank>Alcaeus</a> the lyric poet. For he speaks, somewhere or other, in this way — Pour out, in just proportion, one and two. For in these words some people do not think that he is alluding to the mixture of wine and water at all; but that, being a moderate and temperate man, he would not drink more than one cyathos of pure wine, or perhaps, at the most, two. And this is the interpretation given to the passage by <a href=/people/1696 target=_blank>Chamaeleon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=person long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>, who was ignorant how fond of wine <a href=/people/529 target=_blank>Alcaeus</a> had been. For this poet will be found to have been in the habit of drinking at every season and in every imaginable condition of affairs. In winter he speaks thus — Now the storm begins to lower, And <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> descends in heavy snow, And streams of water stand congealed In cruel ice: let's drive away The wintry cold, and heap up fire, Anil mingle with unsparing hand The honied cup, and wreathe our brows With fragrant garlands of the season. And in summer, he writes — Now it behoves a man to soak his lungs In most cool wine; for the fierce <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> star rages, And all things thirst with the excessive heat. And in spring, he says — Now does the flowery spring return, And shed its gifts all o'er the land; and he continues — Come then, my boy, and quickly pour A cup of luscious <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=demonym long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbian</a> wine. And in his misfortunes he sings — One must not give one's thoughts up wholly To evil fortune; for by grieving We shall not do ourselves much good. Come to me, <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a>; you are ever The best of remedies, who bring Us wine and joyous drunkenness. And in his hours of joy he says — Now is the time to get well drunk, Now e'en in spite of self to drink, Since <a href=/people/3431 target=_blank>Myrsilus</a> is dead at last. And, giving some general advice, he says — Never plant any tree before the vine. How, then, could a man who was so very devoted to drinking be a sober man, and be content with one or two cups of wine? At all events, his very poem, says <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>, testifies against those people who receive the line in this sense. For ho says, in the whole passage — Let us now drink, — why put we out the light] Our day is but a finger: bring large cups, Filled with the purple juice of various grapes; For the great son of <a href=/people/205 target=_blank>Semele</a> and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> Gave wine to men to drive away their cares. Pour on, in just proportion, one and two, And let one goblet chase another quickly Out of my head.

And it is impossible for a woman to drink wine without being detected: for, first of all, she has not the key of the cellar; and, in the next place, she is bound to kiss her relations, and those of her husband, down to cousins, and to do this every day when she first sees them; and besides this, she is forced to be on her best behaviour, as it is quite uncertain whom she may chance to meet; </p>                        </div>

Then he goes on to speak of the oligarchy which he established with his friends, saying — And they violated a great number of nobly-born women, wives of the first men in the state; and they corrupted no small number of boys and young men; and they carried their profligacy to such a height that they even ventured to play with one another at dice for the free-born women, and they made a bargain which of the nobly-born matrons he who threw the lowest number on the dice should bring to the winner for the purpose of being ravished; allowing no exception at all; but the loser was bound to bring her to the place appointed, in whatever way he could, using persuasion, or even force if that was necessary. And some of the other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=ethnic long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodians</a> also played at dice in this fashion; but the most frequent and open of all the players in this way was <a href=/people/7745 target=_blank>Hegesilochus</a>, who aspired to become the governor of the city.

But it is only those who get drunk on beer who fall on their backs, and lie with their faces upwards.

And <a href=/people/7863 target=_blank>Laurentius</a> said, — <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> the Solensian defines the word thus: γριφος, says he, is a sportive problem, in which we are bidden to seek out, by the exertion of our intellect and powers of investigation, what is proposed to us, which has been uttered for the sake of some honour or some penalty. And in his discussion on these griphi, the same <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> asserts that there are seven kinds of griphi. In the letter, when we say that there is a certain name of a fish or plant, beginning with a. And similarly, when he who proposes the griphus desires us to mention some name in which some particular letter is or is not. Such are those which are called sigma-less griphi; on which account <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> has composed an ode on the σ, as if some griphus had been proposed to him as a subject for a lyric poem. Then griphi are said to be in the syllable, when we are desired to recite some verse which begins with the syllable βα, as with βασιλεύς, for instance, or which ends with ναξ, as Καλλιάναξ, or some in which the syllables Λεων take the lead, as Λεωνίδας, or on the other hand close the sentence, as Θρασυλεων. They are in the name, when we utter simple or compound names of two syllables, by which some tragic figure, or on the other hand some humble one, is indicated; or some names which have no connexion with anything divine, as Κλεώνυμος, or which have some such connexion, as Διονύσιος: and this, too, whether the connexion be with one God or with more, as Ερμαφρόδιτος; or whether the name begins with <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, as Διοκλής, or with <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a>, as Έρμόδωρος; or whether it ends, as it perhaps may, with νΐκος. And then they who were desired to say such and such things, and could not, had to drain the cup. And <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> defined the word in'this way.

I thought before that those who while at meals Bade me solve griphi, were the silliest triflers, Talking mere nonsense. And when any one Was bade to say what a man bore and bore not, I laughed and thought it utter childishness; And did not think that truth did lie beneath, But reckoned them as traps for the unwary. But now, indeed, I see there is some truth in them; For we, ten men, contribute now for supper, But no one of them all bears what he brings, So here's a case where he who bears bears not, And this is just the meaning of a griphus. So surely this may fairly be excused; But others play tricks with the things themselves, Paying no money, as, for instance, <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>. B. A wise and fortunate man, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>, is he. And in his Aphrodisian he says — A. Suppose I want to say now  dish to you, Shall I say  dish, or shall I rather say, Λ hollow-bodied vessel, made of earth, Formed by the potter's wheel in rapid swing, Baked in another mansion of its mother, Which holds within its net the tender milk-fed Offspring of new-born flocks untimely choked? B. By <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, you'll kill me straight if you Do not in plain words say a  dish of meat. A. 'Tis well. And shall I speak to you of drops Flowing from bleating <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>, and well compounded With streams proceeding from the yellow <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>, Sitting on a broad receptacle provided By the chaste virgin born of holy <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a>, And now luxuriating beneath a host Of countless finely-wrought integuments; Or shall I say  a cheesecake? B. Prithee say a cheesecake. A. Shall I speak of rosy sweat From Bacchic spring? B. I'd rather you'd say wine. A. Or shall I speak of dusky dewy drops? B. No such long paraphrase, — say plainly, water. A. Or shall I praise the cassia-breathing fragrance That scents the air? B. No, call it myrrh, — forbear Those sad long-winded sentences, those long And roundabout periphrases; it seems To me by for too great a labour thus To dwell on matters which are small themselves, And only great in such immense descriptions. </p>                        </div>

It is not mortal, Dor immortal either, But as it were compounded of the two, So that it neither lives the life of man, Nor yet of God, but is incessantly New born again, and then again deprived Of this its present life; invisible, Yet it is known and recognised by all.

And <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a>, in his Sphingocarion, proposes griphi of this kind, himself afterwards giving the solution of them — A. There is a thing which speaks, yet has no tongue; A female of the same name as the male; The steward of the winds, which it holds fast; Bough, and yet sometimes smooth; full of dark voices Scarce to he understood by learned men; Producing harmony after harmony; 'Tis one thing, and yet many; e'en if wounded 'Tis still invulnerable and unhurt. B. What can that be? A. Why, don't you know, <a href=/people/659 target=_blank>Callistratus</a>? It is a bellows. B. You are joking now. A. No; don't it speak, although it has no tongue? Has it not but one name with many people? Is't not unhurt, though with a wound i' the centre? Is it not sometimes rough, and sometimes smooth] Is it not, too, a guardian of much wind? Again: — There is an animal with a locust's eye, With a sharp mouth, and double deathful head; A mighty warrior, who slays a race Of unborn children. ('Tis the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> ichneumon.) For he does seize upon the crocodile's eggs, And. ere the latent offspring is quite formed, Breaks and destroys them: he's a double head. For he can sting with one end, and bite with th' other. Again: — I know a thing which, while it's young, is heavy, But when it's old, though void of wings, can fly With lightest motion, out of sight o' th' earth. This is thistledown. For it — While it is young, stands solid in its seed, But when it loses that, is light and flies, Blown about every way by playful children. Listen, now, to this one — There is an image all whose upper part Is its foundation, while the lower part Is open; bored all through from head to feet: 'Tis sharp, and brings forth men in threefold way, Some of whom gain the lot of life, some lose it: All have it; but I bid them all beware.

As that riddle about shade, for instance; — for he said that there was a nature which is greatest at its birth and at its decease, and least when at its height. And he speaks thus: — Of all the things the genial earth produces, Or the deep sea, there is no single one, Nor any man or other animal Whose growth at all can correspond to this: For when it first is born its size is greatest; At middle age 'tis scarcely visible, So small it's grown; but when 'tis old and hastens Nigh to its end, it then becomes again Greater than all the objects that surround it. And in the <a href=/people/173 target=_blank>Oidipus</a>, which is a tragedy, he speaks of night and day in the following riddle: — There are two sisters, one of whom brings forth The other, and in turn becomes its daughter. And <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a>, in his Greek History, tells the following story, that  when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a> were besieging <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373221PKro class=place long=22.0851 lat=37.3267>Cromnus</a>, (and that is a small town near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374221PMeg class=place long=22.1273 lat=37.4124>Megalopolis</a>,) <a href=/people/1782 target=_blank>Hippodamus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=person long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonian</a>, being one of the besieged persons, gave a message to the herald who came to them from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>, showing the condition in which they were by a riddle, and he bade him tell his mother — 'to be sure and release within the next ten days the little woman who was bound in the Apollonion; as it would not be possible to release her if they let those days elapse.' And by this message he plainly enough intimated what he was desirous to have understood; for the little woman meant is Famine, of which there was a picture in the Apollonion, near the throne of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, and it was represented under a woman's form; so it was evident to every one that those who were besieged could hold out only ten days more because of famine.

What do we all teach when we do not know it ourselves?  and, What is the same nowhere and everywhere?  and also, What is the same in the heavens and on the earth and in the sea? But this is a riddle arising from an identity of name; for there is a bear, and a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>, and an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>, and a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, both in the heavens and on the earth and in the sea. And the other riddle means Time; for that is the same to all people and everywhere, because it has not its nature depending on one place. And the first riddle means How to live, for though no one knows this himself' he teaches his neighbour. </p>                        </div>

The prologue consists of the elements, and the actor should recite it, dividing it into paragraphs, and making the termination in the manner of a dramatic catastrophe, into Alpha, beta, gamma, delta, eta, theta. For ei is sacred to the God; iota, kappa, lambda, mu, nu, xi, the diphthong ou, pi, rho, sigma, tau, the present n, phi, chi, which is next to psi, all down to omega. And the chorus consisted of women, in pairs, made of two elements taken together, composed in metre and lyrical odes in this fashion; —  Beta alpha ba, beta ei be, beta eta be, beta iota bi, beta ou bo, beta upsilon bu, beta omega bo. And then, again, in the antistrophe of the ode and of the metre, Gamma alpha, gamma ei, gamma eta, gamma iota, gamma omieron, gamma upsilon, gamma omega. And in the same way he dealt with all other syllables — all which have the same melody and the same metre in the antistrophes. So that people not only suspect that <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> drew all his <a href=/people/165 target=_blank>Medea</a> from this drama, but they think that it is perfectly plain that he drew the system of his choruses from it. And they say that <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>, after he had heard this drama, endeavoured to divide his poem in respect of the metre, and did it thus, in the <a href=/people/173 target=_blank>Oidipus</a>, — I shall not grieve myself nor you, Being convicted of this action. On which account, all the rest admitted the system of antistrophes from his example, as it should seem, into their tragedies. Then, after this chorus, <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a> introduces another speech of vowels, in this manner: (and this also the reciter must divide into paragraphs in the same way as the previous portions, in order that that delivery may be preserved which the author originally intended) — Alpha alone, O woman; then one should Say Ei alone in the second place: next, Still by itself you will say, thirdly, Eta; Fourth, still alone, Iota; fifthly, Ou. In the sixth place, Upsilon by itself. The last of all the seven vowels is The slow-paced Omega. The seven vowels In seven verses; and when you've recited All these, then go and ponder by yourself. </p>                        </div>

There is a line Upright and long; and from the middle of it There juts forth on each side a little one, With upward look: and next a circle comes, On two short feet supported. And afterwards, following this example, as any one may suspect, <a href=/people/5099 target=_blank>Maeandrius</a> the prose writer, turning away a little from the usual pronunciation in his descriptions, wrote those sayings which are found in his Precepts, in a less polished style than the above-mentioned <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a>. And <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> appears to have followed the same model when he composed those verses, in his <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>, in which the elements of writing are described. But the character is an illiterate shepherd, who is showing that the name of <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a> is inscribed in the place in this way — For I indeed do nothing know of letters, But I will tell you all their shapes, and give Clear indications by which you may judge. There is a circle, round as though it had been Worked in a lathe, and in its centre space It has a visible sign. Then the second Has first of all two lines, and these are parted By one which cuts them both across the middle. The third's a curly figure, wreathed round. The fourth contains one line which mounts right up, And in a transverse course three others hang From its right side. The letter which comes fifth Admits of no such easy explanation; For there are two diverging lines above, Which meet in one united line below. The letter which comes last is like the third. [So as to make ΘΗΣEYΣ.] And <a href=/people/484 target=_blank>Agathon</a> the tragic poet has composed a similar passage, in his <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephus</a>; for there also some illiterate man explains the way of spelling <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a> thus: — The letter which comes first is like a circle, Divided by a navel in the middle; Then come two upright lines well joined together; The third is something like a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> bow: Next comes a trident placed upon its side; And two lines branching from one lower stem: The last again the same is as the third.

And <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> has said something like this, in his <a href=/people/284 target=_blank>Amphiaraus</a>, which is a satyric drama, where he introduces an actor dancing in unison with his explanation of the letters. </p>                        </div>

And in whatever order you place each of these pairs of feet it will give the same metre; as you may, for instance, transpose the first line, and instead of — σε, τον βόλοις νιφοκτύποις δυσχείμερον, you may read it — νιφοκτύποις σε τον βόλους δυσχειμερον. You may also remark that each pair of feet consists of ten letters; and you may produce the same effect not in this way, but in a different one, so as to have many ways of putting one line; for instead you may read — μέτρον φράσον μοι, των ποδών μέτρον λαβών' or this way — λάβων μέτρον μοι των ποδών, μέτρον φράσον. [And you may take this line too — ] ου βούλομαι γαρ των ποδων μέτρον λαβειν, [and transpose it thus — ] λαβειν μέτρον γαρ των ποδων ού βούλομαι. </p>                        </div>

And, in the first book of his treatise on Proverbs, he writes thus —  The investigation of riddles is not unconnected with philosophy; for the ancients used to make a display of their erudition by such things; for they used at their entertainments to ask questions, not such as the men of the present day ask one another, as to what sort of amorous enjoyment is the most delicious, or what kind of fish is nicest, or what is most in season at the moment; or again, what fish is best to eat at the time of <a href=/people/632 target=_blank>Arcturus</a>, or what after the rising of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a>, or of the Dogstar. And then they offer kisses as prizes for those who gain the victory in such questions; such as are hateful to men of liberal sentiments; and as a punishment for those who are defeated they enjoin them to drink sheer wine; which they drink more willingly than the cup of health. For these things are well adapted to any one who has devoted his attention to the writings of <a href=/people/1787 target=_blank>Philaenis</a> and <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a>, or who has studied the books called Gastrologies. They preferred such plays as these; — when the first person had recited a verse, the others were bound to quote the verse following; or if any one had quoted a sentence from some poet, the rest were bound to produce a sentence from some other poet expressing the same sentiments. After that, every one was bound to repeat an iambic. And then, each person was to repeat a line of such and such a number of syllables precisely; and so on with everything that related to any acquaintance with letters and syllables. And in a similar manner they would be bound to repeat the names of all the commanders in the army which attacked <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, or of all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> leaders: or to tell the name of some city in Asia beginning with a given letter; and then the next person was to tell the name of a city in Europe: and then they were to go through the rest according as they were desired to give the names of Grecian or barbarian cities; so that this sport, not being an inconsiderate one, was a sort of exhibition of the ability and learning of each individual. And the prizes given were a garland and applause, things by which love for one another is especially sweetened. </p>                        </div>

For one person to quote a line in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> beginning with Alpha, and ending with the same letter, such as — 'Αγχου δ' ισταμενη επεα πτερόεντα προσηυδα. Άλλ' αγε νυν μάστιγα καί ήνια σιγαλοεντα. Άσπίδας ευκυκλους λαισήαϊ τε πτεροεντα. And, again, they quoted iambics on a similar principle — Αγαθος ανηρ λεγοιτ' αν, ο φερων τ αγαθά. 'Αγαθος αν εϊη καί ό φερων καλώς κακά. Or lines in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> beginning and ending with ε, as — Ευρε Λυκάονος υιον αμύμονά τε κρατερόν τε. 'Εν πόλει υμετερη επει ουκ αρ εμελλον εγωγε. And iambics on the same principle — εὐκαταφρόνητός ἐστι πενία, Δερκύλε ἐπὶ τοῖς παροῦσι τὸν βίον διάπλεκε. And lines of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> beginning and ending with η. as — ἣ μὲν ἄρ' ὣς εἰποῦσ' ἀπέβη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη ἣ δ' ἐν γούνασι πῖπτε Διώνης δῖ' Ἀφροδίτη.

Lines in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> beginning and ending with i, as — Ἰλίου ἐξαπολοίατ' ἀκήδεστοι καὶ ἄφαντοι' Ἱππόλοχος δέ μ' ἔτικτε καὶ ἐκ τοῦ φημι γενέσθαι. Beginning and ending with σ, as — Συμπαντων Δαναών, οΰδ' ην Άγαμεμνονα ειπης. And iambics as — Σοφος εστιν ό φερων τάπο της τυχης καλώς. And beginning and ending with ω, as — Ως δ' οτ' άπ' Ούλύμπου νεφος ερχεται ουρανον εισω. And iambics as — 'Ώρθωμενην προς απαντα την ψυχήν εχω. Sometimes too, it is well to propound lines without a sigma, as — Πάντ' εθελω δόμεναι, και ετ οϊκοθεν αλλ' έπιθειναι and again, to quote lines of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, of which the first syllable when connected with the last, will make some name, such as — ΑΙας δ' εκ Σαλαμΐνος αγεν δύο και δέκα νηΑΣ ΦΥΛειδης ον τίκτε Διι φίλος ϊπποτα ΦυλΕΥΣ. Ιητηρ δ' αγαθος Ποδαλείριοs ηδε ΜάχαΩΝ. There are also other lines in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> expressing the names of vessels from the first and last syllable, such as — ΌΛλυμενων Δαναών ολοφύρεται εν φρεσι θυΜΟΣ, which makes Ολμος, a mortar; ΜΥΘεΐται κατά μοίραν άπερ κ οίοιτο καϊ αλΛΟΣ, which makes Μύλος, a millstone; ΛΥγρος εων μη πού τι κακόν καϊ μεΐζον επαίΡΗ, which makes λυρη, a lyre. And other lines, the first and last syllables of which give some eatable, as — ΑΡγυροπεζα Θετις θυγατηρ άλίοιο γέρονΤΟΣ, which makes άρτος, bread; ΜΗτι σύ ταυτα εκαστα διειρεο, μη δέ μετάλΛΑ, which makes μήλα, apples. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/1696 target=_blank>Chamaeleon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=person long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heraclea</a>, in his essay on <a href=/people/1458 target=_blank>Drunkenness</a>, (if I only recollect his words correctly,) says — But if those who are in power and who are rich prefer this drunkenness to other pleasures, it is no great wonder, for as they have no other pleasure superior to this, nor more easy to obtain, they naturally fly to wine: on which account it has become customary among the nobles to use large drinking-cups. For this is not at all an ancient custom among the Greeks; but one that has been lately adopted, and imported from the barbarians. For they, being destitute of education, rush eagerly to much wine, and provide themselves with all kinds of superfluous delicacies. But in the various countries of Greece, we neither find in pictures nor in poems any trace of any cups of large size being made, except indeed in the heroic times. For the cup which is called ῥυτὸν they attributed only to the heroes, which fact will appear a perplexing one to some people; unless indeed any one should choose to say that this custom was introduced because of the fierceness of the appearance of these demigods. For they think the heroes irascible and quarrelsome, and more so by night than by day. In order, then, that they may appear to be so, not in consequence of their natural disposition, but because of their propensity for drinking, they represent them as drinking out of large cups. And it appears to me not to have been a bad idea on the part of those people who said that a large cup was a silver well. In all this <a href=/people/1696 target=_blank>Chamaeleon</a> appears to be ignorant that it is not a small cup which in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> is given to the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a> by <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>; for if it had been a small one, he would not have been so overcome with drunkenness after drinking it three times only, when he was a man of such a monstrous size. There were therefore large cups at that time; unless any one chooses to impute it to the strength of the wine, which <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> himself has mentioned, or to the little practice which the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a> had in drinking, since his usual beverage was milk; or perhaps it was a barbaric cup, since it was a big one, forming perhaps a part of the plunder of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410255RKik class=ethnic long=25.5 lat=41>Cicones</a>.

And it has the name of ἄλεισον, either from being very smooth (ἄγαν λεῖον), or because the liquor is collected (ἁλίζεται) in it.

But in this passage we want the final v which ought to have ended the word. Since all the ancients used the omicron not only with the power which it has now, but also when they meant to indicate the diphthong ει they wrote it by o only.

And accordingly, in the above-cited verses, the <a href=/people/185 target=_blank>Satyrs</a> wrote the final syllable of the genitive case διονύσου with ο only; as being short to engrave: so that we are in these lines to understand the final upsilon, so as to make the whole word διονύσου.

And, perhaps, it is out of a thericlean cup that <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, in his <a href=/people/1581 target=_blank>Hesione</a>, represents <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> to be drinking, when he speaks thus — And when he had, though scarcely, come t' himself, He begg'd a cup of wine (κύλικα), and when he'd got it, He drank down frequent draughts, and drain'd it well; And, as the proverb says, the man sometimes Is quite a bladder, and sometimes a sack. And that the thericlean cup belongs to the class κύλιξ is plainly stated by <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, in his History of Plants. For speaking of the turpentine-tree, be says — And thericlean cups (κύλικες θηρίκλειοι) are turned of this wood, in such a manner that no one can distinguish them from earthenware ones.

And <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> speaks of this cup, in his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378227SNem class=place long=22.7108 lat=37.8085>Nemea</a>, where he says — A. Come hither you, you faithful child of <a href=/people/5277 target=_blank>Thericles</a>, You noble shape, and what name shall we give you Are you a looking-glass of nature? If You were but full, then I could wish for nothing Beyond your presence. Come then — B. How I hate you, You old Theolyta. A. Old dost thou call me, friend? B. What can I call you else? but hither come, Let me embrace you; come to your fellow-servant: Is it not so? A. . . . . . . . . . . . . . you try me. B. See here I pledge you in fair friendship's cup. A. And when you've drunk your fill, then hand the cup Over to me the first. But <a href=/people/561 target=_blank>Cleanthes</a>, in his treatise on Interpretation, says — And as for all these inventions, and whatever others there are of the same kind, such as the thericlean cup, the deinias, the iphicratis, it is quite plain that these, by their very names, indicate their inventors. And the same appears to be the case even now. And if they fail to do so, the name must have changed its meaning a little. But, as has been said before, one cannot in every case trust to a name. But others state that the thericlean cup has its name from the skins of wild beasts (θηρίων) being carved on it. And <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=person long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> says that it is so called from the fact of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a> disturbing the beasts (τοὺς θῆρας) by pouring libations out of these cups over them. </p>                        </div>

And indeed, the carchesium is a tolerably oblong cup, and perhaps it has its name from its being stretched upwards. But the carchesium is an extremely old description of cup; if at least it is true that <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, when he had gained the affections of <a href=/people/1123 target=_blank>Alcmena</a>, gave her one as a love gift, as <a href=/people/582 target=_blank>Pherecydes</a> relates in his second book, and <a href=/people/2235 target=_blank>Herodorus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=person long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heraclea</a> tells the same story.

For the lower part of the mast is called the pterna, which goes down into the socket; and the middle of the mast is called the neck; and towards the upper part it is called carchesium. And the carchesium has yards running out on each side, and in it there is placed what is called the breastplate, being four-cornered on all sides, except just at the bottom and at the top. Both of which extend a little outwards in a straight line. And above the breastplate is a part which is called the distaff, running up to a great height, and being sharp-pointed. And <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a> also speaks of the carchesia, where she says — And they all had well-fill'd carchesia, And out of them they pour'd libations, wishing All manner of good fortune to the bridegroom. And <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>, in his <a href=/people/1524 target=_blank>Tyro</a>, says — And they were at the table in the middle, Between the dishes and carchesia; saying that the dragons came up to the table, and took up a position between the meats and the carchesia, or cups of wine. For it was the fashion among the ancients to place upon the table goblets containing mixed wine; as <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> also represents the tables in his time. And the carchesium was named so from having on it rough masses like millet (κεγχροειδὴς), and the α is by enallage instead of ε, καρχήσιον for κερχήσιον. On which account <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> calls those who are overcome by thirst καρχαλέους.

But it is uncertain what description of cup it is, or whether every cup is not called celebe, because one pours libations into it (ἀπὸ τοῦ χέειν λοιβὴν), or from one's pouring libations (λείβειν). And the verb λείβω is applied habitually to every sort of liquid, from which also the word λέβης is derived. But <a href=/people/344 target=_blank>Silenus</a> and <a href=/people/1776 target=_blank>Clitarchus</a> say that celebe is a name given to drinking-cups by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390271RAio class=ethnic long=27.1 lat=39>Aeolians</a>.

And in a subsequent passage he says — But taking up a mighty celebeum In both his hands, well filled with richest honey, Which in great store he had most excellent. And again he says — And golden cups of wine, and then besides, A celebeum yet untouch'd by man, Full of pure honey, his most choice of treasures. And in this passage he very evidently speaks of the celebeum as some kind of vessel distinct from a drinking-cup, since he has already mentioned drinking-cups under the title of δέπαστρα. And <a href=/people/759 target=_blank>Theocritus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=person long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracusan</a>, in his Female Witches, says — And crown this celebeum with the wool, Well dyed in scarlet, of the fleecy <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>.

But that men drank out of horns (κέρατα) is plain from the fact that to this very day, when men mix water with wine, they say that they κερᾶσαι (mix it). And the vessel in which the wine is mixed is called κρατὴρ, from the fact of the water being mingled (συγκιρνᾶσθαι) in it, as if the word were κερατὴρ, from the drink being poured εἰς τὸ κέρας (into the horn); and even to this day the fashion of making horns into cups continues: but some people call these cups rhyta. And many of the poets represent the ancients as drinking out of horns. <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a>, speaking of the <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a>, says — After those monsters fierce Learnt the invincible strength of luscious wine; Then with a sudden fury, With mighty hands they threw the snow-white milk Down from the board, And of their own accord Drank away their senses in the silver-mounted horns. And <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, in the seventh book of his Anabasis, giving an account of the banquet which was given by the Thracian <a href=/people/328 target=_blank>Seuthes</a>, writes thus: But when <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, with his companions, arrived at <a href=/people/328 target=_blank>Seuthes</a>'s palace, first of all they embraced one another, and then, according to the Thracian fashion, they were presented with horns of wine.

For, as he here calls the same cup both κισσύβιον and ἄλεισον, he does not preserve the accurate distinction between the names. And any one may conjecture that the κισσύβιον was originally made by the shepherds out of the wood of the ivy (κισσός).

For they vied with one another, not only in throwing their liquor at the mark, but also in doing everything with elegance; for a man was bound to lean on his left elbow, and, making a circuit with his right hand, to throw his drops (τὴν λάταγα) over gently — for that was the name which they gave to the liquor which fell from the cup: so that some prided themselves more on playing elegantly at the cottabus than others did on their skill with the javelin. </p>                        </div>

Now it seems to me, that he had one for the use of men, but the other for the purpose of doing honour to the Gods. And at that time they never used the cyathus nor the cotyla. For they used to employ, in the sacrifices of the Gods, a crater, not made of silver nor inlaid with precious stones, but made of Coliad clay. And as often as they replenished this, pouring a libation to the Gods out of the phiale, they then poured out wine to all the company in order, bailing out the newly-mixed wine in a cymbium, as they do now among us at the phiditia. And if ever they wished to drink more, they also placed on the table beside them the cups called cotyli, which are the most beautiful of all cups, and the most convenient to drink out of.

And the reason why it is so peculiarly well-suited to a soldier is, because a soldier often is forced to drink water which is not very clean; and, in the first place, this cup is not one in which it can be very easily seen what one is drinking; and, secondly, as its brim is rather curved inwards, it is likely to retain what is not quite clean in it. And <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>, in his work addressed to <a href=/people/2580 target=_blank>Adaeus</a> and <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>, says that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> used to use vessels made of earthenware; and proceeds to say further — And this was a very common practice among the ancients, such as is now adopted in some of the Greek tribes.

But at other banquets and at their <a href=/people/5890 target=_blank>Phiditia</a> they use small casks. And <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a> also mentions the cothon as a kind of cup, in his Elegies, where he says — But come now, with your cothon in your hand, Move o'er the benches of the speedy ship, And lift the covers from the hollow casks, And drain the rosy wine down to the dregs; For while we're keeping such a guard as this, We shan't be able to forego our wine; as if the κύλιξ were here called κώθων. <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>, in his Knights, says — They leapt into th' horse-transports gallantly, Buying cothones; but some bought instead Garlic and onions. And <a href=/people/4553 target=_blank>Heniochus</a>, in his <a href=/people/1237 target=_blank>Gorgons</a>, says — Let a man give me wine to drink at once, Taking that capital servant of the throat, The ample cothon — fire-wrought, and round, Broad-ear'd, wide-mouth'd.

And <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, in his Spinners, says — And then he hurl'd a four-pint cothon at me, An ancient piece of plate, an heirloom too.

For there are some little roughnesses on the surface, arising from daily banquets; now for getting rid of these there is no easier channel than the wine. But of all modes of purging, that which' is caused by hard drinking is the most advantageous; for then the body is as it were washed out by the wine; for the wine is both liquid and heating: but the wine which we secrete is harsh; accordingly, fullers use it as a cleanser when they are cleaning garments. But when you are drinking hard, you should guard against three things, — against drinking bad wine, against drinking unmixed wine, and against eating sweetmeats while you are drinking. And when you have had enough, then do not go to sleep, until you have had a vomit, moderate or copious as the case may be; and when you have vomited, then go to sleep after having taken a slight bath. And if you are not able to empty yourself sufficiently, then you must take a more copious bath, and lie down in the bath in exceedingly warm water.

And in his <a href=/people/2883 target=_blank>Gerytades</a> he says — But there was then a festival: a slave Went round, and brought us all a lepaste, And pour'd in wine dark as the deep-blue sea; but the poet means here to indicate the depth of the cup.

Now concerning the shape of the cup of <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>, the poet speaks thus — Next her white hand a spacious goblet brings, A goblet sacred to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370217XNes class=demonym long=21.695 lat=37.027>Pylian</a> kings From eldest times; the massy, sculptured vase, Glittering with golden studs, four handles grace, And curling vines, around each handle roll'd, Support two turtle-doves emboss'd in gold. On two firm bases stood the mighty bowl, Lest the top weight should make it loosely roll: A massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him, Though all too great for men of lesser limb. Now with reference to this passage a question is raised, what is the meaning of glittering with golden studs: — and again, what is meant by the massy, sculptured vase four handles grace. For <a href=/people/625 target=_blank>Asclepiades</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404289PBry class=person long=28.8827 lat=40.3756>Myrlean</a>, in his treatise on the <a href=/people/5132 target=_blank>Nestoris</a>, says that the other cups have two handles. And again, how could any one give a representation of turtle- doves feeding around each of the handles? How also can he say, On two firm bases stood the mighty bowl? And this also is a very peculiar statement that he makes, that he could heave it with ease, though all too great for men of lesser limb. Now <a href=/people/625 target=_blank>Asclepiades</a> proposes all these difficulties, and especially raises the question about the studs, as to how we are to understand that they were fastened on. Now some say that golden studs must be fastened on a silver goblet from the outside, on the principles of embossing, as is mentioned in the case of the sceptre of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> — He spoke, — and, furious, hurl'd against the ground His sceptre, starr'd with golden studs around; for it is plain here that the studs were let into the sceptre, as clubs are strengthened with iron nails. He also says of the sword of <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> — A radiant baldric, o'er his shoulder tied, Sustain'd the sword that glittered at his side: Gold were the studs — a silver sheath encased The shining blade. But <a href=/people/460 target=_blank>Apelles</a> the engraver, he says, showed us on some articles of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a> workmanship the way in which studs were put on. For there was a small projection raised up by the chisel, to form, as it were, the heads of the nails. And these studs are said by the poet to be fixed in, not because they are on the outside and are fixed by nails, but because they resemble nails driven through, and project a little on the outside, being above the rest of the surface. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/460 target=_blank>Apelles</a> explained the system of the four handles very artistically in the following manner. He said, tat from one root, as it were, which is attached to the bottom of the cup, there are diverging lines extending along each handle, at no great distance from each other: and these reach up to the brim of the cup, and even rise a little above it, and are at the greatest distance from each other at the point where they are furthest from the vessel itself; but at the lower extremity, where they join the rim, they are again united. And in this way there are four handles; but this kind of ornament is not seen in every cup, but only on some, and especially on those which are called seleucides. But with respect to the question raised about the two bases, how it can be said, On two firm bases stood the mighty bowl, some people explain that line thus: — that some cups have one bottom, the natural one, being wrought at the same time as, and of one piece with, the whole cup; as for instance, those which are called cymbia, and the phialae, and others of the same shape as the phialae. But some have two bottoms; as for instance, the egg-shaped cups called ooscyphia, and those called cantharia, and the seleucides, and the carchesia, and others of this kind. For they say that one of these bottoms is wrought of the same piece as the entire cup, and the other is attached to it, being sharp at the upper part, and broader towards the lower end, as a support for the cup; and this cup of <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>'s, they say, was of this fashion. But the poet may have represented this cup as having two bottoms; the one, that is to say, bearing the whole weight of the cup, and having an elevation proportionate to the height, in accordance, with its greater circumference; and the other bottom might be smaller in circumference, so as to be contained within the circumference of the larger circle, where the natural bottom of the cup becomes sharper; so that the whole cup should be supported on two bases. But <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> the Thracian is said to have made the cup called <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>'s, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>, all his pupils contributing silver for the work; of which Promethidas of Heraclea, explaining the way in which it was made on the system of <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, says that it is a cup having its handles made side by side, as the ships with two prows have their prows made; and that turtle-doves are represented sitting on the handles; and that two small sticks, as it were, are placed under the cup as a support to it, running transversely across in a longitudinal direction, and that these are the two bottoms meant by <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>. And we may to this day see a cup of that fashion at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>, a city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>, consecrated to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=ethnic long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capuans</a> assert that that is the identical cup which belonged to <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>.

And this is the origin of their giving bread the name of ἄρτος, because of all figures the circle is the one which is the most complete (ἀπήρτισται), and it is a perfect figure. And accordingly they made a drinking-cup, being that which receives moist nourishment, circular, in imitation of the shape of the world. But the cup of <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a> has something peculiar about it, for it has stars on it, which the poet compares to studs, because the stars are as round as the studs, and are, as it were, fixed in the heaven; as also <a href=/people/93 target=_blank>Aratus</a> says of them — There do they shine in heaven, — ornaments Fix'd there for ever as the night comes round. But the poet has expressed this very beautifully, attaching the golden studs to the main body of the silver cup, and so indicating the nature of the stars and of the heaven by the colour of the ornaments. For the heaven is like silver, and the stars resemble gold from their fiery colour. </p>                        </div>

I mean the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a>. For when he says δύο δὲ πελειάδες were placed in gold around each handle, he does not mean the birds called πελειάδες, that is to say, turtle-doves; and those who think that he does use πελειάδες here as synonymous with περιστεραὶ are wrong. For <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says expressly that the πελειὰς is one bird, and the περιστερὰanother. But the poet calls that constellation πελειάδες which at present w call πλειάδες; by the rising of which men regulate their swing and their reaping, and the beginning of their raising their crops, and their collection of them; as <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> says: — When the seven daughters of the Libyan king Rise in the heavens, then begin to mow; And when they hide their heads, then plough the ground. And <a href=/people/93 target=_blank>Aratus</a> says — Their size is small, their light but moderate, Yet are they famous over all the world; At early dawn and late at eve they roll, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> regulating all their tranquil motions; He has ordain'd them to give signs to men, When winter, and when summer too begins, — What is the time for ploughing, what for sowing. And accordingly it is with great appropriateness that the poet has represented the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a>, who indicate the time of the generation and approach to perfection of the fruits of the earth, as forming parts of the ornaments of the cup of that wise prince <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>. For this vessel was intended to contain any kind of food, whether solid or liquid; on which account he also says that the turtle-doves bring ambrosia to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>: — No bird of air, nor dove of trembling wing, That bears ambrosia to th' ethereal king, But shuns these rocks. For we must not think here that it is really the birds called turtle-doves which bring ambrosia to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, which is the opinion of many; for that were inconsistent with the majesty of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>; but the daughters of <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a>, turned into the constellation of <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> or doves. For it is natural enough that they who indicate the appropriate seasons to the human race should also bring ambrosia to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, on which account also he distinguishes between them and other birds, saying — No bird of air, nor dove of trembling wing; and that he considers the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> as the most famous of all fixed stars is plain, from his having placed them in the first rank when giving a list of other constellations: — There earth, there heaven, there ocean he design'd, — Th' unwearied sun, the moon completely round, — The starry lights, that heaven's high convex crown'd, — The <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiads</a>, Hyads, with the Northern Team, And great <a href=/people/297 target=_blank>Orion</a>'s more refulgent beam; To which, around the axle of the sky, The Bear, revolving, points his golden eye; Still shines exalted on th' ethereal plain, Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main, — The Bear, whom trusting rustics call the Wain. But people in general have been deceived by fancying the πελειάδες here spoken of to be birds, first of all from the poetical form of the word, because of the insertion of the letter ε; and secondly, because they have taken the word τρήρωνες, 'trembling,' as an epithet only of doves; since, owing to its weakness, that is a very cautious bird; and when he calls it τρήρων, this word is derived from τρέω, and τρέω is the same as εὐλαβέομαι, to be cautious. But still there is a good deal of reason in attributing the same characteristic also to the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a>: for the fable is, that they are always fleeing from <a href=/people/297 target=_blank>Orion</a>, since their mother <a href=/people/4012 target=_blank>Pleione</a> is constantly pursued by <a href=/people/297 target=_blank>Orion</a>. </p>                        </div>

First of all, <a href=/people/6676 target=_blank>Myro</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=person long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantian</a> admirably caught the feeling of the Homeric poems, saying in her poem entitled <a href=/people/767 target=_blank>Memory</a>, that the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> convey ambrosia to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. But <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a> the critic, endeavouring to appropriate to himself the credit due to her, produces that assertion as his own. <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> also has called the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> πελειάδες, in the following lines: — And may great <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a>, whose protecting pow'r Watches o'er contests, <a href=/people/525 target=_blank>Maia</a>'s mighty son, Grant you success. But <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a> was the sire Of seven dark-hair'd daughters, beautiful, Surpassing all the maidens upon earth, And now in heaven they're call'd <a href=/people/2435 target=_blank>Peleiades</a>. Here he distinctly calls the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> πελειάδες, for they it was who were the daughters of <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a>; as <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> says — And it is natural That great <a href=/people/297 target=_blank>Orion</a> should advance Not far from the seven <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a>, at the tail (ὀρίας). For, in the arrangement of the stars, <a href=/people/297 target=_blank>Orion</a> is not far from the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a>; from which circumstance has arise the fable about them, that they, with their mother <a href=/people/4012 target=_blank>Pleione</a>, are always fleeing from <a href=/people/297 target=_blank>Orion</a>. But when he calls the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> ὄριαι here, he means οὔριαι, only he has left out the v, because the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> are close to the tail of the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>Bull</a>. And Aechylus has spoken still more plainly, playing on their name on account of the resemblance of its sound, where he says — The seven celebrated daughters of The mighty <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a>, much bewail'd with tears Their father's heaven-supporting toil; where they Now take the form of night-appearing visions, The wingless <a href=/people/2435 target=_blank>Peleiades</a>. For he calls them here wingless on account of the similarity of the sound of their name to that of the birds πελειάδες And <a href=/people/6676 target=_blank>Myro</a> herself also speaks in the same manner — The mighty <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> was nourished long in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>, Nor yet had any of the heav'nly beings E'er recognised their king; meanwhile he grew In all his limbs; and him the trembling doves Cherish'd, while hidden in the holy cave, Bringing him, from the distant streams of ocean, Divine ambrosia: and a mighty <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>, Incessant drawing with his curved beak Nectar from out the rock, triumphant brought The son of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a>'s necessary drink. Him, when the God of mighty voice had cast His father <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a> from his unjust throne, He made immortal, and in heaven placed. And so, too, did he give the trembling doves (πελειάσιν) Deserved honour; they who are to men Winter's and summer's surest harbingers. And <a href=/people/386 target=_blank>Simmias</a>, in his <a href=/people/2818 target=_blank>Gorge</a>, says — The swiftest ministers of air came near, The quivering peleiades. And <a href=/people/3076 target=_blank>Posidippus</a>, in his <a href=/people/7316 target=_blank>Asopia</a>, says — Nor do the evening cool πέλειαι set. But <a href=/people/4180 target=_blank>Lamprocles</a> the Dithyrambic poet has also expressly and poetically said that the word πελειάδες is in every sense synonymous with περιστεραὶ, in the following lines — And now you have your home in heaven, Showing your title with the winged doves. And the author of the poem called Astronomy, which is attributed to <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a>, always calls the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> πελειάδες, saying — Which mortals call <a href=/people/2435 target=_blank>Peleiades</a>. And in another place he says — And now the <a href=/people/2435 target=_blank>Peleiades</a> of winter set. And in another passage we find — Then the <a href=/people/2435 target=_blank>Peleiades</a> do hide their heads; so that there is nothing at all improbable in the idea of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> having lengthened the name πλειάδες by poetic licence into πελειάδες. </p>                        </div>

And accordingly, when he says — And curling vines, around each handle roll'd, Bear two <a href=/people/2435 target=_blank>Peleiades</a> emboss'd in gold; On two firm bases stood the mighty bowl; we are by that to understand one <a href=/people/390 target=_blank>Peleias</a> to. each section of the handles.

So that the goblet is supported by two <a href=/people/2435 target=_blank>Peleiades</a> which lie under the bottom, and in that way there are altogether six <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> in all, since that is the number which are seen, though they are said to be seven in number, as <a href=/people/93 target=_blank>Aratus</a> says — They are indeed declared by mortal man To be in number seven; yet no more Than six have e'er been seen by mortal eyes.

And many fancy that the poet is here referring to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, when he says — No bird of air, nor dove of trembling wing, That bears ambrosia to th' ethereal king, But shuns these rocks. In vain she cuts the skies, They fearful meet, and crush her as she flies. Meaning in reality, that one of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> was destroyed by the sharpness of the rocks and their smooth edge, and that another is substituted in her place by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> for the sake of keeping the number undiminished. Expressing by the enigmatical figures of speech common to poets, that, though there are only six <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> seen, still their real number is not actually diminished; but there are said to be seven in number, and also the names of the seven are distinctly given. </p>                        </div>

For it appeared unreasonable, that when <a href=/people/3742 target=_blank>Diomede</a> and <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>, and even <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> too were present, <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a> should be represented as more vigorous than they, when he was so far advanced in years. But though these accusations are brought against him, we may release the poet from them by transposing the order. For in that hexameter — πλεῖον ἐὸν, νέστωρ δ᾽ ὁ γέρων ἀμογητὶ ἄειρεν, if we take γέρων out of the middle, we shall unite that to the beginning of the preceding line, after ἄλλος μὲν, and then we shall connect the words as before — ἄλλος μὲν γέρων μογέων ἀποκινήσασκε τραπέζης: πλεῖον ἐὸν, ο ῾δὲ νέστωρ ἀπονητὶ ἄειρεν.

But <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> <a href=/people/814 target=_blank>Philadelphus</a> the king jested upon him with some wit, on account of this and other much talked-of solutions. For as <a href=/people/889 target=_blank>Sosibius</a> received a royal stipend, <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, sending for his treasurers, desired them, when <a href=/people/889 target=_blank>Sosibius</a> came to demand his stipend, to tell him that he had received it already. And when, not long after, he did come and ask for his money, they said they had given it to him already, and said no more. But he, going to the king, accused the treasurers. And <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> sent for them, and ordered them to come with their books, in which were the lists of those who received those stipends. And when they had arrived, the king took the books into his hands and looking into them himself, also asserted that <a href=/people/889 target=_blank>Sosibius</a> had received his money; making it out in this way: — These names were set down, — <a href=/people/1517 target=_blank>Soter</a>, <a href=/people/2546 target=_blank>Sosigenes</a>, <a href=/people/1168 target=_blank>Bion</a>, <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollon</a>, <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a>; and the king, looking on these names, said — My excellent solver of difficulties, if you take σω from σωτὴρ, and σι from σωσιγένης, and the first syllable βι from βίων and the last syllable from 'απόλλωνος, you will find, on your own principles, that you have received your stipend. And you are caught in this way, not owing to the actions of others, but by your own feathers, as the incomparable <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a> says, since you yourself are always occupied about solutions of difficulties which are foreign to the subject in hand. </p>                        </div>

I can tell a way; For I will break his jugs and measures all, And crush his casks as with a thunderbolt, And all his other vessels which serve to drink: Nor shall he have a single oxybaphum left, Fit to hold wine. But that the oxybaphum is a kind of small κύλιξ, made of earthenware, <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> proves plainly enough, in his Mystis, in the following words. There is a wine-bibbing old woman praising a large cup, and disparaging the oxybaphum as small. So when some one says to her — Do you, then, drink; she answers — There I will obey you. And, by the gods, the figure of the cup Is quite inviting, worthy of the fame Of this high festival; for have we not — Have we not, and not long ago, I say, Drunk out of earthenware oxybapha?

But when <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> calls it also ἀπύρωτος, he means either that it was wrought without fire, or never put on the fire.

But when he calls it ἀμφίθετος, can we understand that it has two bases, one on each side; or is ἀμφὶ here to be taken as equivalent to περὶ, and then again is περὶ to be taken as equivalent to περιττὸν, so that in fact all that is meant by the epithet is beautifully made; since θεῖναι was often used by the ancients for 'to make?'

And it appears to me that the bodies of men are liable to the same influences which affect the bodies of those things which grow in the ground; for the very plants, when God gives them too much to drink, cannot hold up their heads, nor can they expand at their proper seasons. But when they drink just as much as is good for them, and no more, then they grow in an upright attitude, and flourish, and come in a flourishing state to produce fruit.

For they have both written a piece called the Banquet; and in these two pieces, one of them turns out the female flute-players, and the other introduces them; and one, as has been already said, refuses to drink out of large cups, but the other represents <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> as drinking out of a psycter till morning.

And in his Polity, he banishes <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> from his city, and all poetry of the theatrical kind; and yet he himself wrote dialogues in a theatrical style, — a manner of writing of which he himself was not the inventor; for <a href=/people/2385 target=_blank>Alexamenus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382268PTeo class=person long=26.7877 lat=38.1717>Teian</a> had, before him, invented this style of dialogue, as <a href=/people/12472 target=_blank>Nicias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404297PNic class=person long=29.7168 lat=40.4266>Nicaea</a> and <a href=/people/1539 target=_blank>Sotion</a> both agree in relating.

For <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> was considered to be an envious man, and to have a disposition which was far from praiseworthy; for he ridiculed <a href=/people/345 target=_blank>Aristippus</a> when he went to visit <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, though he himself had three times sailed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, — once for the purpose of investigating the torrents of lava which flow from Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377150LAit class=place long=15.001 lat=37.748>Aetna</a>, when he lived with the elder <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, and was in danger from his displeasure; and twice he went to visit the younger <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>. And again, though <a href=/people/1038 target=_blank>Aeschines</a> was a poor man, and had but one pupil, <a href=/people/365 target=_blank>Xenocrates</a>, he seduced him from him; and he was also detected in instigating the commencement of a prosecution against <a href=/people/1077 target=_blank>Phaedo</a>, which, if successful, would have reduced him to slavery; and altogether he displayed the feelings of a stepmother towards all the pupils of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>. On which account, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, making a not very unreasonable Conjecture respecting him, said in the presence of several persons that he had had a dream, in which he thought he had seen the following vision. For I thought, said he, that <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> had become a <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>, and leaped on my head, and began to scratch my bald place, and to take a firm hold, and so to look about him. I think, therefore, said he, that you, O <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, will say a good many things which are false about my head. And <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, besides his ill-nature, was very ambitious and vainglorious; and he said, My last tunic, my desire of glory, I lay aside in death itself — in my will, and in my funeral procession, and in my burial; as <a href=/people/2405 target=_blank>Dioscorides</a> relates in his Memorabilia. And as for his desire of founding cities and making laws, who will not say that these are very ambitious feelings? And this is plain from what he says in the <a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaeus</a> — I have the same feelings towards my constitution that a painter would have towards his works; for as he would wish to see them possessed of the power of motion and action, so too do I wish to see the citizens whom I here describe. </p>                        </div>

For the doctrine respecting the soul, which he makes out to be immortal, even after it is separated from the body, and after the dissolution of this latter, was first mentioned by <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>; for he has said, that the soul of <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a> — Fled to the shades below, Lamenting its untimely fate, and leaving Its vigour and its youth. If, then, any one were to say that this is also the argument of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, still I do not see what good we have got from him; for if any one were to agree that the souls of those who are dead do migrate into other natures, and do mount up to some higher and purer district, as partaking of its lightness, still what should we get by that theory? For, as we have neither any recollection of where we formerly were, nor any perception whether we really existed at all, what do we get by such an immortality as that? And as to the book of the Laws composed by him, and the Polity which was written before the Laws, what good have they done us?

For a law (as <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says) is a form of words decided on by the common agreement of a city, pointing out how one ought to do everything. And how can we consider <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s conduct anything but ridiculous; since, when there were already three <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> lawgivers who had a great name, — <a href=/people/1130 target=_blank>Draco</a>, and <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> himself, and <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>, — the citizens abide by the laws of the other two, but ridicule those of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>? And the case of the Polity is the same. Even if his Constitution is the best of all possible constitutions, yet, if it does not persuade us to adopt it, what are we the better for it? <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, then, appears to have written his laws, not for men who have any real existence, but rather for a set of men invented by himself; so that one has to look for people who will use them. But it would have been better for him to write such things as he could persuade men of; and not to act like people who only pray, but rather like those who seize hold of what offers itself to them. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly, all those who have honoured pleasure above everything, and who have deliberately chosen to live a life of luxury, have been magnanimous and magnificent people, as, for instance, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>. For they, of all men, are those who hold pleasure and luxury in the highest honour; and they, at the same time, are the most valiant and magnanimous of all the barbarians. For to indulge in pleasure and luxury is the conduct of freeborn men and of a liberal disposition. For pleasure relaxes the soul and invigorates it. But labour belongs to slaves and to mean men; on which account they are contracted in their natural dispositions. And the city of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, while it indulged in luxury, was a very great city, and bred very magnanimous men. For they wore purple garments, and were clad in embroidered tunics; and they bound up their hair in knots, and wore golden grasshoppers over their foreheads and in their hair: and their slaves followed them, bearing folding chairs for them, in order that, if they wished to sit down, they might not be without some proper seat, and forced to put up with any chance seat. And these men were such heroes, that they conquered in the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381241LMaB class=place long=24.0002 lat=38.144>Marathon</a>, and they alone worsted the . power of combined Asia. And all those who are the wisest of men, and who have the greatest reputation for wisdom, think pleasure the greatest good. <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> certainly does when he says — For what kind of human life Can be worth desiring, If pleasure be denied to it? What kingly power even? Without pleasure e'en the gods Have nothing to be envied for.

And <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, too, speaks of pleasure and indulgence in the following terms — How sweet the products of a peaceful reign, — The heaven-taught poet and enchanting strain, The well-fill'd palace, the perpetual feast, A loud rejoicing, and a people blest! How goodly seems it ever to employ Man's social days in union and in joy; The plenteous board high heap'd with cates divine, And o'er the foaming bowl the laughing wine. And again, he calls the gods living at ease. And at ease certainly means without labour; as if he meant to show by this expression, that the greatest of all evils is labour and trouble in life. </p>                        </div>

For any one might say to those who do not admit all this — Whence, my good friends, is it that you attribute to him all this excessive love of eating; or whence is it that the custom has originated among men of leaving nothing in the cup when we pour a libation to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, if he had no regard for pleasure? or why are the hot springs which rise out of the ground universally said to be sacred to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>; or why are people in the habit of calling soft couches the beds of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, if he despised all those who live luxuriously? Accordingly, says he, the later poets represent him as going about in the guise of a robber by himself, having a club, and a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>'s hide, and his bow. And they say that <a href=/people/695 target=_blank>Stesichorus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380138PHim class=person long=13.8225 lat=37.9708>Himera</a> was the original inventor of this fable. But <a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthus</a> the lyric poet, who was more ancient than <a href=/people/695 target=_blank>Stesichorus</a>, as <a href=/people/695 target=_blank>Stesichorus</a> himself tells us, does not, according to the statement of <a href=/people/4605 target=_blank>Megaclides</a>, clothe him in this dress, but in that which <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> gives him. But <a href=/people/695 target=_blank>Stesichorus</a> perverted a great many of the accounts given by <a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthus</a>, as he does also in the case of what is called the Orestea.

And a similar man is he who recommends <a href=/people/1085 target=_blank>Amphilochus</a> his son. — Remember thou, my son, to always dwell In every city cherishing a mind Like to the skin of a rock-haunting fish; And always with the present company Agree, but when away you can change your mind.

And <a href=/people/1029 target=_blank>Theognis</a> says — Imitate the wary cunning of the polypus. And some say that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> was of this mind, when he often prefers the voluptuous life to the virtuous one, saying: <br />And now <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a>' shining gates unfold; <br />The Gods with <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> assume their thrones of gold; <br />Immortal <a href=/people/576 target=_blank>Hebe</a>, fresh with bloom divine, <br />The golden goblet crowns with purple wine; <br />While the full bowl flows round the Powers employ <br />Their careful eyes on long-contended <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>.

But they pass their autumns in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/299529PPer class=place long=52.8909 lat=29.9352>Persepolis</a>; and the rest of the year they spend in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>.

And even the very thing which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> monarchs used to wear on their heads, showed plainly enough their extreme devotion to luxury. For it was made, according to the account of <a href=/people/2046 target=_blank>Dinon</a>, of myrrh and of something called labyzus. And the labyzus is a sweet-smelling plant, and more valuable than myrrh. And whenever, says <a href=/people/2046 target=_blank>Dinon</a>, the king dismounts from his chariot, he does not jump down, however small the height from the chariot to the ground may be, nor is he helped down, leaning on any one's hand, but a golden chair is always put by him, and he gets on that to descend; on which account the king's chairbearer always follows him. And three hundred women are his guard, as <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a> of Cumae relates, in the first book of his history of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>. And they sleep all day, that they may watch all night; and they pass the whole night in singing and playing, with lights burning. And very often the king takes pleasure with them in the hall of the <a href=/people/5779 target=_blank>Melophori</a>. The <a href=/people/5779 target=_blank>Melophori</a> are one of his troops of guards, all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> by birth, having golden apples (μήλα) on the points of their spears, a thousand in number, all picked men out of the main body of ten thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> who are called the Immortals. And the king used to go on foot through this hall, very fine <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=demonym long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardian</a> carpets being spread in his road, on which no one but the king ever trod. And when he came to the last hall, then he mounted a chariot, but sometimes he mounted a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>; but on foot he was never seen outside of his palace. And if he went out to hunt, his concubines also went with him. And the throne on which he used to sit, when he was transacting business, was made of gold; and it was surrounded by four small pillars made of gold, inlaid with precious stones, and on them there was spread a purple cloth richly embroidered. </p>                        </div>

For, as it seems, the unseasonable and superfluous luxury of their daily life could make even the men who are armed with spears, mere mountebanks. And a little further on he says — And accordingly, while he gave to all those who could invent him any new kind of food, a prize for their invention, he did not, while loading them with honours, allow the food which they had invented to be set before them, but enjoyed it all by himself, and thought this was the greatest wisdom.

And at his feet was another supper-room, prepared with three couches, in which there were constantly kept three thousand talents of silver; and this was called the king's footstool. And in his bed-chamber there was also a golden vine, inlaid with precious stones, above the king's bed. And this vine, <a href=/people/246 target=_blank>Amyntas</a> says in his Posts, had bunches of grapes, composed of most valuable precious stones; and not far from it there was placed a golden bowl, the work of <a href=/people/6987 target=_blank>Theodoras</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=person long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>.

And I think it a good opportunity to give an account of their luxurious habits. For, in the first place, it is not enough for them to have their beds softly spread, but they put even the feet of their couches upon carpets in order that the floor may not present resistance to them, but that the carpets may yield to their pressure. And as for the things which are dressed for their table, nothing is omitted which has been discovered before, and they are also continually inventing something new; and the same is the way with all other delicacies. For they retain men whose sole business it is to invent things of this kind. And in winter it is not enough for them to have their head, and their body, and their feet covered, but on even the tips of their fingers they wear shaggy gloves and finger-stalls; and in summer they are not satisfied with the shade of the trees and of the rocks, but they also have men placed in them to contrive additional means of producing shade. And in the passage which follows this one, he proceeds to say — But now they have more clothes laid upon their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> than they have even on their beds. For they do not pay so much attention to their horsemanship as to sitting softly. Moreover, they have porters, and breadmakers, and confectioners, and cup-bearers, and men to serve up their meals and to take them away, and men to lull them to sleep and men to wake them, and dressers to anoint them and to rub them, and to get them up well in every respect. </p>                        </div>

For to be governed and insulted by a woman is a sufficient proof of the severity with which they were treated. Accordingly she, being a very intemperate woman herself, and meaning to revenge the insults to which she herself had been subjected, gave the maiden daughters of the masters to their slaves, in the very same place in which she herself had been ravished. And then having forcibly collected them all in this place, she shut up the mistresses with their slaves. On which account the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=ethnic long=28 lat=38.5>Lydians</a>, wishing to soften the bitterness of the transaction, call the place the Woman's <a href=/people/4053 target=_blank>Contest</a> — the Sweet Embrace.

And <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>, in the forty-third book of his History, states, that it is a law among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenians</a> that all their women should be in common: and that the women pay the greatest attention to their persons, and often practise gymnastic exercises, naked, among the men, and sometimes with one another; for that it is not accounted shameful for them to be seen naked. And that they sup not with their own husbands, but with any one who happens to be present; and they pledge whoever they please in their cups: and that they are wonderful women to drink, and very handsome. And that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenians</a> bring up all the children that are born, no one knowing to what father each child belongs: and the children, too, live in the same manner as those who have brought them up, having feasts very frequently, and being intimate with all the women. Nor is it reckoned among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenians</a> at all disgraceful either to do or suffer anything in the open air, or to be seen while it is going on; for it is quite the custom of their country: and they are so far from thinking it disgraceful, that they even say, when the master of the house is indulging his appetites, and any one asks for him, that he is doing so and so, us'ng the coarsest possible words for his occupation. But when they are together in parties of companions or relations, they act in the following manner. First of all, when they have stopped drinking, and are about to go to sleep, while the lights are still burning, the servants introduce sometimes courtesans, and sometimes beautiful boys, and sometimes women; and when they have enjoyed them, they proceed to acts of still grosser licentiousness: and they indulge their appetites, and make parties on purpose, sometimes keeping one another in sight, but more frequently making tents around the beds, which are made of plaited laths, with cloths thrown over them. And the objects of their love are usually women; still they are not invariably as particular as they might be; and they are very beautiful, as is natural for people to be who live delicately, and who take great care of their persons. And all the barbarians who live towards the west, smooth their bodies by rubbing them with pitch, and by shaving them; and among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenians</a> there are many shops in which this trade is practised, and many artists whose sole employment it is, just as there are barbers among us. And when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenians</a> go to these men, they give themselves wholly up to them, not being ashamed of having spectators, or of those who may be passing by. And many of the Greeks, and of those who inhabit <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, adopt this practice, having learnt it from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413148RSam class=ethnic long=14.8 lat=41.3>Samnites</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405188RMes class=ethnic long=18 lat=40.3>Messapians</a>.

At first the people got the better, and drove out the rich men, and, collecting the children of those who fled into some threshing-floors, collected a lot of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, and so trampled them to death, destroying them in a most impious manner. Therefore, when in their turn the rich men got the upper hand, they smeared over all those whom they got into their power with pitch, and so burnt them alive. And when they were being burnt, they say that many other prodigies were seen, and also that a sacred olive took fire of its own accord; on which account the God drove them for a long time from his oracle; and when they asked the oracle on what account they were driven away, he said — My heart is grieved for the defenceless <a href=/people/9437 target=_blank>Gergithae</a>, So helplessly destroy'd; and for the fate Of the poor pitch-clad bands, and for the tree Which never more shall flourish or bear fruit.

And this is plain from the traccs which exist of it to this day in the apparel worn, and way of life practised, by their chief men. For they, being very luxurious, and indeed being the first men who abandoned themselves wholly to luxury, proceeded to such a pitch of insolence that they used to cut off the noses of all the men wherever they came; and their descendants, after they emigrated to other countries, even now derive their name from this treatment.

And he also erected on the funeral pile a chamber a hundred feet long, made of wood; and in it ho had couches spread, and there he himself lay down with his wife, and his concubines lay on other couches around.

And he made the roof of this apartment of large stout beams, and then all the walls of it he made of numerous thick planks, so that it was impossible to escape out of it. And in it he placed ten millions of talents of gold, and a hundred millions of talents of silver, and robes, and purple garments, and every kind of apparel imaginable. And after that he bade the slaves set fire to the pile; and it was fifteen days burning.

Now others Will have th' enjoyment of my luxuries, Which I do leave behind me. For these reasons I never ceased one single day from pleasure.

For as <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> has represented the <a href=/people/629 target=_blank>Phaeacians</a> as living feasting and drinking, and listening to harp-players and rhapsodists. so also did <a href=/people/1718 target=_blank>Straton</a> pass the whole of his life; and so much the more devoted to pleasure was he than they, that the Phteacians, as <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> reports, used to hold their banquets in the company of their own wives and daughters; but <a href=/people/1718 target=_blank>Straton</a> used to prepare his entertainments with flute-playing and harp-playing and lyre-playing women.

He then, delighting in such a life as this, and being by nature a slave to his passions, was also especially urged on by rivalry with <a href=/people/878 target=_blank>Nicocles</a>. For he and <a href=/people/878 target=_blank>Nicocles</a> were always rivalling one another; each of them devoted all his attention to living more luxuriously and pleasantly than the other. And so they carried their emulation to such a height, as we have heard, that when either of them heard from his visitors what was the furniture of the other's house, and how great was the expense gone to by the other for any sacrifice, he immediately set to work to surpass him in such things. And they were anxious to appear to all men prosperous and deserving of envy. Not but what neither of them continued prosperous throughout the whole of their lives, but were both of them destroyed by violent deaths. And <a href=/people/666 target=_blank>Anaximenes</a>, in his book entitled the Reverses of Kings, giving the same account of <a href=/people/1718 target=_blank>Straton</a>, says that he was always endeavouring to rival <a href=/people/878 target=_blank>Nicocles</a>, who was the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=place long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salamis</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, and who was exceedingly devoted to luxury and debauchery, and that they both came to a violent end. </p>                        </div>

And going round all the country, wherever he saw any place shaded with trees and well watered with springs, he made it into a banqueting place. And going to them whenever he chose, he used to celebrate sacrifices to the gods, and there he would stay with his lieutenants, being a very happy and enviable man, until he took it into his head to blaspheme <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, and to treat her with contempt. And the historian goes on to say, that <a href=/people/530 target=_blank>Cotys</a> once prepared a feast, as if <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> had married him; and prepared a bedchamber for her, and then, in a state of intoxication, he waited for the goddess. And being already totally out of his mind, he sent one of his body-guards to see whether the goddess had arrived at the bedchamber. And when he came there, and went back and reported that there was nobody there, he shot him and killed him. And he treated a second in the same way, until a third went, and on his return told him that the goddess had been a long time waiting for him.

And about <a href=/people/462 target=_blank>Chares</a> he says, in his forty-fifth book — But <a href=/people/462 target=_blank>Chares</a> was a slow and stupid man, and one wholly devoted to pleasure. And even when he was engaged in his military expeditions, he used to take about with him female flute-players, and female harp-players, and a lot of common courtesans. And of the money which was contributed for the purposes of the war, some he expended on this sort of profligacy, and some he left behind at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, to be distributed among the orators and those who propose decrees, and on those private individuals who had actions depending. And for all this the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> populace was so far from being indignant, that for this very reason he became more popular than any other citizen; and naturally too: for they all lived in this manner, that their young men spent all their time among flute-players and courtesans; and those who were a little older than they, devoted themselves to gambling, and profligacy of that sort; and the whole people spent more money on its public banquets and entertainments than on the provision necessary for the well-doing of the state. But in the work of <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>, entitled, Concerning the Money of which the Temple at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> was pillaged, he says — <a href=/people/462 target=_blank>Chares</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> got sixty talents by means of <a href=/people/107 target=_blank>Lysander</a>. And with this money he gave a banquet to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237XAgo class=place long=23.723 lat=37.975>Agora</a>, celebrating a triumphal sacrifice in honour of their victory gained in the battle which took place against the foreign troops of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>. And these troops were commanded by Adieus, surnamed the Cock, concerning whom <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a> the comic poet speaks in the following manner — But when he caught the dunghill cock of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> Crowing too early in the morn, and straying, He kill'd him; for he had not got his crest on. And having kill'd this one, then <a href=/people/462 target=_blank>Chares</a> gave A splendid banquet to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> people; So liberal and magnificent was he.

And this it was that made their government so oppressive. And yet their father, <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a>, had been a moderate man in his pleasures, so that he never stationed guards in his fortified places, nor in his gardens, as <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> relates in his twenty-first book, but let any one who chose come in and enjoy them, and take whatever he pleased. And <a href=/people/198 target=_blank>Cimon</a> afterwards adopted the same conduct, in imitation of <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a>.

And besides this, he opened his house to every one, and made a daily practice of providing a plain meal for a great number of people; and all the poor <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> who came that way might enter and partake of it. He also paid great attention to all those who from day today came to ask something of him; and they say that he used always to take about with him one or two young men bearing bags of money. And lie ordered them to give money to whoever came to him to ask anything of him. And they say that lie also often contributed towards the expense of funerals. And this too is a thing that he often did; whenever he met any citizen badly clad, he used to order one of the young men who were following him to change cloaks with him. And so by all these means he acquired a high reputation, and was the first of all the citizens. But <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a> was in many respects very oppressive; and some say that that statue of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a> which there is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> was made in his likeness. </p>                        </div>

For, as different people were publishing different proclamations, and proposing to make <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> large presents, which they called crowns, one of the keepers of his armoury, going beyond all previous flattery, having previously arranged the matter with <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, ordered the herald to proclaim that <a href=/people/1265 target=_blank>Gorgus</a>, the keeper of the armoury, presents <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, the son of <a href=/people/577 target=_blank>Ammon</a>, with three thousand pieces of gold; and will also present him, when he lays siege to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, with ten thousand complete suits of armour, and with an equal number of catapults and all weapons required for the war. </p>                        </div>

There was a house built capable of containing a hundred couches; and in it every couch was adorned with wedding paraphernalia to the value of twenty minae, and was made of silver itself; but his own bed had golden feet. And he also invited to the banquet which be gave, all his own private friends, and those he arranged opposite to himself and the other bridegrooms; and his forces also belonging to the army and navy, and all the ambassadors which were present, and all the other strangers who were staying at his court. And the apartment was furnished in the most costly and magnificent manner, with sumptuous garments and cloths, and beneath them were other cloths of purple, and scarlet, and gold. And, for the sake of solidity, pillars supported the tent, each twenty cubits long, plated all over with gold and silver, and inlaid with precious stones; and all around these were spread costly curtains embroidered with figures of animals, and with gold, having gold and silver curtain-rods. And the circumference of the court was four stades. And the banquet took place, beginning at the sound of a trumpet, at that marriage feast, and on other occasions whenever the king offered a solemn sacrifice, so that all the army knew it.

And <a href=/people/1287 target=_blank>Cleitus</a>, who was surnamed The White, whenever he was about to transact business, used to converse with every one who came to him while walking about on a purple carpet. And <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a> and <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a>, who were fond of athletic exercises, had men follow them with hides fastened together, so as to cover a place an entire stade in extent; and then they selected a spot within the encampment which they had covered with these skins as an awning; and under this they practised their gymnastics. They were followed also by numerous beasts of burden, which carried sand for the use of the palaestra. And <a href=/people/1114 target=_blank>Leonnatus</a> and <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, who were very fond of hunting, had curtains brought after them calculated to enclose a space a hundred stades in circumference, with which they fenced in a large space and then practised hunting within it.

And so, not long afterwards, they who had been insulted in this manner having got his wife and children into their power, prostituted them in the public roads with great insult, sparing them no kind of degradation. And when they had wreaked their vengeance upon them, they thrust needles under the nails of their fingers, and put them to death with torture. And when they were dead, they pounded their bones in mortars, and having cut up and distributed the rest of their flesh, they imprecated curses on all who did not eat of it; and in accordance with this unholy imprecation, they put their flesh into the mills with the flour, that it might be eaten by all those who made bread. And all the other parts they sunk in the sea. But <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> himself, at last going about as a begging priest of <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>, and beating the drum, ended his life very miserably.

And so great was his luxury, that he wore a purple robe, and a white turban on his head; and used to lean on a stick, ornamented all round with golden fretted work: and he used even to fasten the strings of his sandals with golden clasps.

And there is the school called the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=demonym long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrenaic</a>, which derives its origin from <a href=/people/345 target=_blank>Aristippus</a> the pupil of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>: and he devoted himself to pleasure in such a way, that he said that it was the main end of life; and that happiness was founded on it, and that happiness was at best but short-lived. And he, like the most debauched of men, thought that he had nothing to do either with the recollection of past enjoyments, or with the hope of future ones; but he judged of all good by the present alone, and thought that having enjoyed, and being about to enjoy, did not at all concern him; since the one case had no longer any existence, and the other did not yet exist and was necessarily uncertain: acting in this respect like thoroughly dissolute men, who are content with being prosperous at the present moment. And his life was quite consistent with his theory; for he spent the whole of it in all kinds of luxury and extravagance, both in perfumes, and dress, and women. Accordingly, he openly kept <a href=/people/620 target=_blank>Lais</a> as his mistress; and he delighted in all the extravagance of <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, although he was often treated insultingly by him. Accordingly, <a href=/people/982 target=_blank>Hegesander</a> says that once, when he was assigned a very mean place at a banquet by <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, he endured it patiently; and when <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> asked him what he thought of his present place, in comparison of his yesterday's seat, he said, That the one was much the same as the other; for that one, says he, is a mean seat today, because it is deprived of me; but it was yesterday the most respectable seat in the room, owing to me: and this one today has become respectable, because of my presence in it; but yesterday it was an inglorious seat, as I was not present in it. And in another place <a href=/people/982 target=_blank>Hegesander</a> says- <a href=/people/345 target=_blank>Aristippus</a>, being ducked with water by <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>' servants, and being ridiculed by <a href=/people/292 target=_blank>Antiphon</a> for bearing it patiently, said, 'But suppose I had been out fishing, and got wet, was I to have left my employment, and come away?' And <a href=/people/345 target=_blank>Aristippus</a> stayed a considerable time in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig class=place long=23.425 lat=37.75>Aigina</a>, indulging in every kind of luxury; on which account <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> says in his Memorabilia [ 2. ], that <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> often reproved him, and invented the parable of <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a> and <a href=/people/626 target=_blank>Pleasure</a> to apply it to him. And <a href=/people/345 target=_blank>Aristippus</a> said, respecting <a href=/people/620 target=_blank>Lais</a>, I have her, and I am not possessed by her. And when he was at the court of <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, he once had a quarrel with some people about a choice of three women. And he used to wash with perfumes, and to say that — Even in the midst of Bacchanalian revels A modest woman will not be corrupted. And <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, turning him into ridicule in his <a href=/people/2230 target=_blank>Galateia</a>, represents one of the slaves as speaking in the following manner of one of his disciples: For this my master once did turn his thoughts To study, when he was a stripling young, And set his mind to learn philosophy.

Him my master sought, Giving a talent to become his pupil: He did not learn, indeed, much skill or wisdom, But got instead a sad complaint on his chest. And <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>, in his <a href=/people/931 target=_blank>Antaeus</a>, speaking of the luxurious habits of the philosophers, says- My friend, now do you know who this old man Is called?

And he was a friend of <a href=/people/944 target=_blank>Archytas</a>, and not wholly unversed in philosophy; and so he used to come with him into the sacred precincts, and to walk with him and with his friends, listening to his lectures and arguments: and once, when there was a long dispute and discussion about the passions, and altogether about sensual pleasures, <a href=/people/2653 target=_blank>Polyarchus</a> said- I, indeed, my friends, have often considered the matter, and it has seemed to me that this system of the virtues is altogether a long way removed from nature; for nature, when it utters its own voice, orders one to follow pleasure, and says that this is the conduct of a wise man: but that to oppose it, and to bring one's appetites into a state of slavery, is neither the part of a wise man, nor of a fortunate man, nor indeed of one who has any accurate understanding of what the constitution of human nature really is. And it is a strong proof of this, that all men, when they have acquired any power worth speaking of, betake themselves to sensual pleasures, and think the power of indulging them the principal advantage to be gained from the possession of power, and everything else, so to say, as unimportant and superfluous. And we may adduce the example of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> king at present, and every other tyrant possessed of any power worth speaking of,- and in former times, the sovereigns of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=ethnic long=28 lat=38.5>Lydians</a> and of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>,- and even in earlier times still, the tyrants of the [<a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>] behaved in the same manner; for all these men left no kind of pleasure unexplored: and it is even said that rewards were offered by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> to any one who was able to invent a new pleasure. And it was a very wise offer to make; for the nature of man is soon satiated with long-continued pleasures, even if they be of a very exquisite nature. So that, since novelty has a very great effect in making a pleasure appear greater, we must not despise it, but rather pay great attention to it. And on this account it is that many different kinds of dishes have been invented, and many sorts of cakes; and many discoveries have been made in the articles of incenses and perfumes, and clothes, and beds, and, above all, of cups and other utensils. For all these things contribute some amount of pleasure, when the material which is admired by human nature is properly employed: and this appears to be the case with gold and silver, and with most things which are pleasing to the eye and also rare, and with all things which are elaborated to a high degree of perfection by manual arts and skill. </p>                        </div>

And they have written laws about contracts and other matters of the same kind, and whatever appeared to be necessary for relationships within the state, and also with respect to dress, and to all the other circumstances of life, that they should be similar among all the citizens. And so, as all the lawgivers made war upon every kind of covetousness, then first the praises of justice began to be more thought of: and one of the poets spoke of- The golden face of justice; and in another passage some one speaks of- The golden eye of justice. And the very name of justice came to be accounted divine, so that in some countries there were altars erected and sacrifices instituted to <a href=/people/194 target=_blank>Justice</a>. And next to this they inculcated a respect for modesty and temperance, and called an excess in enjoyment covetousness; so that a man who obeyed the laws and was influenced by the common conversation of men in general, was necessarily moderate with respect to sensual pleasures. </p>                        </div>

But afterwards having become the chief man of the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a> school, he used to entertain his friends at banquets with excessive arrogance and extravagance. For, besides the music which was provided at his entertainments, and the silver plate and coverlets which were exhibited, all the rest of the preparation and the superb character of the dishes was such, and the multitude of tables and cooks was so great, that many people were actually alarmed, and, though they wished to be admitted into his school, shrunk back, fearing to enter, as into a badly governed state, which was always burdening its citizens with the duty of choregus and other expensive offices. For men were compelled to undertake the regular office of manager of the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a> school. And the duties of this office were, to superintend all the new students for thirty days, and see that they behaved appropriately. And then, on the last day of the month, having received nine obols from each of the new students, he received at supper not only all those who contributed their share, but all those also whom <a href=/people/1009 target=_blank>Lycon</a> might chance to invite, and also all those of the elders who were diligent in attending the school; so that the money which was collected was not sufficient even for providing sufficient unguents and garlands. He also was bound to perform the sacrifices, and to oversee the rites of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. All which duties appeared to have but little connexion with reason or with philosophy, but to be more akin to luxury and parade. For even if they did not compel any person to spend money on these objects, if he had only very scanty and meagre resources, yet the practice was very harmful. For <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> and <a href=/people/661 target=_blank>Speusippus</a> had not established these entertainments, in order that people might dwell upon the pleasures of dinner from day-break, or for the sake of getting drunk; </p>                        </div>

And accordingly, he, playing on his appearance, continually addresses him- Φθιῶτ' Ἀχιλλεῦ. But others, as, for instance, <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> [ Birds], often call him φιλύρινος Κινησίας, because he took a plank of linden wood (φιλύρα), and fastened it to his waist under his girdle, in order to avoid stooping, because of his great height and extreme thinness. But that <a href=/people/1882 target=_blank>Cinesias</a> was a man of delicate health, and badly off in other respects, we are told by <a href=/people/142 target=_blank>Lysias</a> the orator, in his oration inscribed For <a href=/people/1636 target=_blank>Phanias</a> accused of illegal Practices, in which he says that [<a href=/people/1882 target=_blank>Cinesias</a>], having abandoned his regular profession, had taken to trumping up false accusations against people, and to making money by such means. And that he means the poet here, and no one else, is plain from the fact that he shows also that he had been attacked by the comic poets for impiety. And he also, in the oration itself, shows that [<a href=/people/1882 target=_blank>Cinesias</a>] was a person of that character. And the words of the orator are as follows:- But I marvel that you are not indignant at such a man as <a href=/people/1882 target=_blank>Cinesias</a> coming forward in aid of the laws, whom you all know to be the most impious of all men, and the greatest violator of the laws that has ever existed. Is not he the man who has committed such offences against the gods as all other men think it shameful even to speak of, though you hear the comic poets mention such actions of his every year? Did not <a href=/people/978 target=_blank>Apollophanes</a>, and Mystalides, and <a href=/people/7905 target=_blank>Lysitheus</a> feast with him, selecting one of the days on which it was not lawful to hold a feast, giving themselves the name of Cacodaemonistae [Evil-Spiriters], instead of Numeniastae [New-Mooners], a name indeed appropriate enough to their fortunes? Nor, indeed, did it occur to them that they were really doing what that name denotes; but they acted in this manner to show their contempt for the gods and for our laws. </p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a>, surnamed Periegetes, in his treatise on Wonderful People and Things, says that <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a> the soothsayer, being taken prisoner by the enemy, and being put into the scale, was found to weigh only one obol, so very thin was he.

And <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>, in his Passion, says- If hunger should attack your well-shaped person, It would make you thinner than <a href=/people/1208 target=_blank>Philippides</a>.

Perhaps also people are fond of those things, and carry them about them in order to comfort and mitigate the vexation which arises from the neglect or absence of those whom they love. For by the presence of these agreeable objects, the desire for those persons whom we love is blunted; unless, indeed, we may rather say that it is for the sake of personal ornament that people carry those things, and take delight in them, just as they wear anything else which tends to ornament. For not only those people who are crowned with flowers, but those also who carry them in their hands, find their whole appearance is improved by them. Perhaps also, people carry them simply because of their love for any beautiful object. For the love of beautiful objects shows that we are inclined to be fond of the products of the seasons. For the face of spring and autumn is really beautiful, when looked at in their flowers and fruits. And all persons who are in love, being made, as it were, luxurious by their passion, and inclined to admire beauty, are softened by the sight of beauty of any sort.

And he entered them in his books as such; and sent them away, and regulated their affairs in his mind, and when they returned to port he received them with great joy, as a man might be expected to who was master of so much wealth. And when any were lost, he never inquired about them, but he rejoiced in all that arrived safe; and so he lived with great pleasure. But when his brother <a href=/people/1825 target=_blank>Criton</a> returned from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, and took him and put him into the hands of a doctor, who cured him of his madness, he himself often related his madness, and said that he had never been happier in his life; for that he never felt any grief, but that the quantity of pleasure which he experienced was something unspeakable. </p>                        </div>

On which account, he says in his Republic, that <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> is a God, being one who cooperates in securing the safety of the city. And the philosophers, who were earlier than him, also considered <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> a venerable Deity, removed from everything discreditable: and this is plain from their having set up holy statues in his honour in their gymnasia, along with those of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> and <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> — the one of whom is the patron of eloquence, and the other of valour.

And first I thought that all the painters seem Ignorant of the real nature of <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a>; And so do all the other artists too, Who make statues of this deity: For he is neither male nor female either; Again, he is not god, nor yet is he man: He is not foolish, nor yet is he wise; But he's made up of all kinds of quality, And underneath one form bears many natures. His courage is a man's; his cowardice A very woman's. Then his folly is Pure madness, but his wisdom a philosopher's; His vehemence is that of a wild beast, But his endurance is like adamant; His jealousy equals any other god's. And I, indeed,- by <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athene</a> and all the gods,- Do not myself precisely understand him; But still he much resembles my description, And I have come close to the truth. And <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a>, or <a href=/people/2834 target=_blank>Araros</a>, in his <a href=/people/6325 target=_blank>Campylion</a>, says:- What man was he, what modeller or painter, Who first did represent young <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> as winged? He was a man fit only to draw swallows, Quite ignorant of the character of the god. For he's not light, nor easy for a man Who's once by him been mastered, to shake off; But he's a heavy and tenacious master. How, then, can he be spoken of as winged: The man's a fool who such a thing could say. And <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, in his Cut off, says:- For this opinion is by all the sophists Embraced, that <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> is not a winged god; But that the winged parties are the lovers, And that he falsely bears this imputation: So that it is out of pure ignorance That painters clothe this deity with wings. </p>                        </div>

On which account the same poet [<a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>] afterwards, as he aptly distinguishes the god's powers, says [<a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, IA.548]:- For he doth bend a double bow of beauty, And sometimes men to fortune leads, But sometimes overwhelms their lives With trouble and confusion. . . . But the same poet [<a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>] also, in his play entitled The Wounded Man, speaks of people in love in this manner:- Who would not say that those who love Live a life of hard labour? For first of all they must be skilful soldiers, And able to endure great toil of body, And to stick close to the objects of their love: They must be active, and inventive too, Eager, and fertile in expedients, And prompt to see their way in difficulties. [563] And <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a>, in his Man fond of the Flute, says:- Who says that lovers are devoid of sense? He is himself no better than a fool: For if you take away from life its pleasures, You leave it nothing but impending death. And I myself am now indeed in love With a fair maiden playing on the harp; And tell me, pray, am I a fool for that? She's fair, she's tall, she's skilful in her art; And I'm more glad when I see her, than you (?) When you share the admission price among you. But <a href=/people/979 target=_blank>Aristophon</a>, in his <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagorean</a>, says:- Now, is not <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> deservedly cast out From his place among the twelve immortal gods? For he did sow the seeds of great confusion, And quarrels dire, among that heavenly band, When he was one of them. And, as he was Bold and impertinent, they clipped his wings, That he might never soar again to heaven; And then they banished him to us below; And for the wings which he did boast before, Them they did give to <a href=/people/335 target=_blank>Victory</a>, a spoil Well won, and splendid, from her enemy. <a href=/people/1583 target=_blank>Amphis</a>, too, in his <a href=/people/5616 target=_blank>Dithyrambus</a>, speaks thus of loving:- What do you say?- do you think that all your words Could ever persuade me that that man's a lover Who falls in love with a girl's manners only, And never thinks what kind of face she's got? I call him mad; nor can I ever believe That a poor man, who often sees a rich one, Forbears to covet some of his great riches. But <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> says in his <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helene</a>:- The man who falls in love with beauty's flower, And takes heed of nothing else, may be A lover of pleasure, but not of his love; And he does openly disparage <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a>, And causes him to be suspect to others. </p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>, when he saw some one once whose chin was smooth, said, 'I am afraid you think you have great ground to accuse nature, for having made you a man and not a woman.' And once, when he saw another man, riding a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, who was shaved in the same manner, and perfumed all over, and clothed, too, in a fashion corresponding to those particulars, he said that he had often asked what a Ἱππόπορνος was; and now he had found out. And at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>, though there is a law against shaving, still no one ever prosecutes another for doing so, as the whole population is shaved.

[566] But <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a> <a href=/people/5077 target=_blank>Lembus</a> relates that in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> the handsomest man and the handsomest woman have special honours conferred on them; and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> is famous for producing the handsomest women in the world. On which account they tell a story of king <a href=/people/239 target=_blank>Archidamus</a>, that when one wife was offered to him who was very handsome, and another who was ugly but rich, and he chose the rich one, the ephors imposed a fine upon him, saying that he had preferred begetting kinglings rather than kings for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a>. And <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> has said:- Firstly, a form that is worthy of a kingdom. And in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, the old men among the people marvelling at the beauty of <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helene</a>, are represented as speaking thus to one another [ Il.3' ]:- They cried, No wonder the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a> Have suffered woes so long for this woman;- Her countenance is like to an immortal goddess! And even <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priamus</a> himself is moved at the beauty of the woman, though he is in great distress. And also he admires <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> for his beauty, and uses the following language respecting him [ Il.3' ]:- Say, what Greek is he Around whose brow such martial <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a> shine,- So tall, so awful, and almost divine! Though some of larger stature tread the green, None match his grandeur and exalted mien. And many nations have made the handsomest men their kings on that account.

For, as it would seem, they consider beauty as the especial attribute of kings. And goddesses have contended with one another respecting beauty; and it was on account of his beauty that the gods carried off <a href=/people/1283 target=_blank>Ganymedes</a> to be the cupbearer of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> [ <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, Il.20' ]:- The matchless <a href=/people/1283 target=_blank>Ganymedes</a>, divinely fair, Whom Heaven, enamoured, snatched to upper air. And who are they whom the goddesses have carried off? are they not the handsomest of men? And they cohabit with them; as <a href=/people/683 target=_blank>Dawn</a> does with <a href=/people/4337 target=_blank>Cephalus</a> and <a href=/people/1287 target=_blank>Cleitus</a> and <a href=/people/5362 target=_blank>Tithonus</a>; and <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a> with <a href=/people/1611 target=_blank>Iasion</a>; and <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> with <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a> and <a href=/people/430 target=_blank>Adonis</a>. And it was for the sake of beauty also that the greatest of the gods entered through a roof under the form of gold, and became a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>, and often transformed himself into a winged <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>, as he did in the case of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig class=place long=23.425 lat=37.75>Aigina</a>.

For these gay girls will ravish you by force, And drag you in to them; if old, they'll call you Their dear papa; if young, their darling baby; And these a man may fearlessly and cheaply Amuse himself with, morning, noon, or night, In any way he please. But the other women He dares not gaze on openly nor look at, But fearing, trembling, shivering, with his heart, As they say, in his mouth, he creeps towards them. How can these men, sea-born immortal <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, Press on, even when they have the opportunity, If any thought of <a href=/people/1130 target=_blank>Dracon</a>'s laws comes over them. </p>                        </div>

But at present, Now that she's more advanced in years, and age Has meddled with her body's round proportions, 'Tis easy both to see her and to scorn her.

And after having begun in this manner, he proceeds to say:- But now I marvel, and wait anxiously To see what will my masters say of me, Who thus begin My scolium with this amatory preface, Willing companion of these willing damsels.

And he writes as follows:- <a href=/people/1021 target=_blank>Hystaspes</a> had a younger brother whose name was <a href=/people/4743 target=_blank>Zariadres</a>; and they were both men of great personal beauty. And the story told concerning them by the natives of the country is, that they were the offspring of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> and <a href=/people/430 target=_blank>Adonis</a>.

Now the daughter of <a href=/people/6722 target=_blank>Omartes</a>, the king of the Marathi, a tribe dwelling on the other side of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/473393WTan class=place long=39.336 lat=47.268>Tanais</a>, was named <a href=/people/4236 target=_blank>Odatis</a>. And concerning her it is written in the Histories, that she in her sleep beheld <a href=/people/4743 target=_blank>Zariadres</a>, and fell in love with him; and that the very same thing happened to him with respect to her. And so for a long time they were in love with one another, simply on account of the visions which they had seen in their dreams. And <a href=/people/4236 target=_blank>Odatis</a> was the most beautiful of all the women in Asia; and <a href=/people/4743 target=_blank>Zariadres</a> also was very handsome. Accordingly, when <a href=/people/4743 target=_blank>Zariadres</a> sent to <a href=/people/6722 target=_blank>Omartes</a> and expressed a desire to marry the girl, <a href=/people/6722 target=_blank>Omartes</a> would not agree to it, because he did not have any male offspring; for he wished to give her to one of his own people about his court. Not long afterwards, <a href=/people/6722 target=_blank>Omartes</a>, having assembled all the chief men of his kingdom and all his friends and relations, held a marriage feast. But he had not said beforehand to whom he was going to give his daughter. And as the wine went round, her father summoned <a href=/people/4236 target=_blank>Odatis</a> to the banquet, and said, in the hearing of all the guests,- 'We, my daughter <a href=/people/4236 target=_blank>Odatis</a>, are now celebrating your marriage feast; so now do you look around, and survey all those who are present, and then take a golden goblet and fill it, and give it to the man to whom you like to be married; for you shall be called his wife.' And she, having looked round upon them all, went away weeping, being anxious to see <a href=/people/4743 target=_blank>Zariadres</a>, for she had sent him word that her marriage feast was about to be celebrated. But he, being encamped on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/473393WTan class=place long=39.336 lat=47.268>Tanais</a>, and leaving the army encamped there without being perceived, crossed the river with his charioteer alone; and going by night in his chariot, passed through the city, having gone about eight hundredstades without stopping. And when he got near the town in which the marriage festival was being celebrated, and leaving, in some place near, his chariot with the charioteer, he went forward by himself, clad in a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> robe. And when he arrived at the palace, and seeing <a href=/people/4236 target=_blank>Odatis</a> standing in front of the sideboard in tears, while she filled the goblet very slowly, he stood near her and said, '<a href=/people/4236 target=_blank>Odatis</a>, here I have come, as you requested me to, — I, <a href=/people/4743 target=_blank>Zariadres</a>.' And she, perceiving a stranger, and a handsome man, and that he resembled the man whom she had beheld in her sleep, being exceedingly glad, gave him the bowl. And he, seizing on her, led her away to his chariot, and fled away, having <a href=/people/4236 target=_blank>Odatis</a> with him. And the servants and the handmaidens, knowing their love, said not a word. And when her father ordered them to summon her, they said that they did not know which way she had gone. And the story of this love is often told by the barbarians who dwell in Asia, and is exceedingly admired; and they have painted representations of the story in their temples and palaces, and also in their private houses. And a great many of the princes in those countries give their daughters the name of <a href=/people/4236 target=_blank>Odatis</a>. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> the comic poet was violently in love with <a href=/people/1349 target=_blank>Gnathaena</a>, (as has been already stated [ 579'e ], and as <a href=/people/6078 target=_blank>Lynceus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=person long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samian</a> relates in his Commentaries;) and so once, when on the stage he had acted very badly, and was turned out (ἠρμένος) of the theatre, and, for all that, came to <a href=/people/1349 target=_blank>Gnathaena</a> as if nothing had happened; and when he, after he had arrived, begged <a href=/people/1349 target=_blank>Gnathaena</a> to wash his feet, Why do you want that? said she; were you not carried (ἠρμένος) here? And <a href=/people/1349 target=_blank>Gnathaena</a> was very ready with her repartees.

There was a parasite who used to live upon an old woman, and kept himself in very good condition; and <a href=/people/1349 target=_blank>Gnathaena</a>, seeing him, said, My young friend, you appear to be in very good case. What then do you think, said he, that I should be if I slept by myself? Why, I think you would starve, said she. Once, when <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a>, who was nicknamed Laccus, was dancing, he fell into a cask. The cellar (λάκκος), says <a href=/people/1349 target=_blank>Gnathaena</a>, has fallen into the cask. On one occasion, some one put a very little wine into a wine-cooler, and said that it was sixteen years old. It is very little of its age, said she, to be as old as that. Once at a drinking party, some young men were fighting about her, and beating one another, and she said to the one who was worsted, Be of good cheer, my boy; for it is not a contest to be decided by laurel, but by silver. There was a man who once gave her daughter a mina, and never brought her anything more, though he came to see her very often. Do you think, my boy, said she, that now you have once paid your mina, you are to come here for ever, as if you were going to <a href=/people/3400 target=_blank>Hippomachus</a> the trainer? On one occasion, when <a href=/people/987 target=_blank>Phryne</a> said to her, with some bitterness, What would become of you if you had the stone? I would give it to you, said she, to wipe yourself with. For it was said that <a href=/people/1349 target=_blank>Gnathaena</a> was liable to the stone, while the other suffered from diarrhoea. On one occasion, some men were drinking in her house, and were eating some lentils dressed with onions (βολβοφάκη); as the maidservant was clearing the table, and putting some of the lentils in her bosom (κόλπον), <a href=/people/1349 target=_blank>Gnathaena</a> said, She is thinking of making some bosom-lentils (κολποφάκη). Once, when <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronicus</a> the tragic actor had been acting his part in the representation of the Epigoni with great applause, and was coming to a drinking party at her house, and sent a boy forward to bid her make preparation to receive him, she said- O cursed boy, what word is this you've spoken? And once, when a chattering fellow was relating that he was just come from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>, Why, then, said she, did you not go to the first city in that country? and when he asked what city, To <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262USig class=place long=26.1802 lat=39.9901>Sigeium</a>, said she. Once, when a man came to see her, and saw some eggs on a dish, and said, Are these raw, <a href=/people/1349 target=_blank>Gnathaena</a>, or boiled? They are made of brass, my boy, said she. On one occasion, when <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a> came to sup with her without an invitation, <a href=/people/1349 target=_blank>Gnathaena</a> pledged him in a cup of wine.

And <a href=/people/1349 target=_blank>Gnathaena</a> was always very neat and witty in all she said; and she even compiled a code of laws for banquets, according to which lovers were to be admitted to her and to her daughters, in imitation of the philosophers, who had drawn up similar documents. And <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a> has recorded this code of hers in the third Catalogue of Laws which he has given; and he has quoted the first words of it as follows:- This law has been compiled, being fair and equitable; and it is written in three hundred and twenty-three verses. </p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> mentions her in his Cleobuline, and <a href=/people/710 target=_blank>Callicrates</a> speaks of her in his <a href=/people/1890 target=_blank>Moschion</a>; and concerning Phanostrate <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a>, in his treatise on Courtesans at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, says that she was called Phtheiropyle, because she used to stand at the, door (πύλη) and hunt for lice (φθεῖρες). And in his oration against <a href=/people/2289 target=_blank>Aristagora</a>, <a href=/people/326 target=_blank>Hypereides</a> says- And again you have named, in the same manner, the animals called aphyae. Now, aphyae, besides meaning anchovies, was also a nickname for some courtesans; concerning whom the before-mentioned <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> says- Stagonium and Anthis were two sisters, and they were called <a href=/people/8843 target=_blank>Aphyae</a>, because they were white, and thin, and had large eyes. And <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>, in his book on Courtesans, says that Nicostratis was called Aphya for the same reason. And the same <a href=/people/326 target=_blank>Hypereides</a>, in his speech against <a href=/people/1841 target=_blank>Mantitheus</a>, who was being prosecuted for an assault, speaks in the following manner respecting <a href=/people/1312 target=_blank>Glycera</a>- Bringing with him <a href=/people/1312 target=_blank>Glycera</a> the daughter of Thalassis in a pair-horse chariot. But it is uncertain whether this is the same <a href=/people/1312 target=_blank>Glycera</a> who was the mistress of <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a>; concerning whom <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> speaks in his treatise On the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=demonym long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chian</a> Letter, saying that after the death of <a href=/people/2780 target=_blank>Pythionice</a>, <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a> sent for <a href=/people/1312 target=_blank>Glycera</a> to come to him from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>; and when she came, she lived in the palace which is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349UTar class=place long=34.897 lat=36.9122>Tarsus</a>, and was honoured with royal honours by the populace, and was called queen; and an edict was issued, forbidding any one to present <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a> with a crown, without at the same time presenting <a href=/people/1312 target=_blank>Glycera</a> with another. And at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364359URho class=place long=35.883 lat=36.413>Rhossos</a>, he went so far as to erect a brazen statue of her by the side of his own statue.

[587] And <a href=/people/326 target=_blank>Hypereides</a> mentions <a href=/people/12212 target=_blank>Nannium</a> in his oration against <a href=/people/1025 target=_blank>Patrocles</a>.

But <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>, in his play called The Shepherds, mentions that this animal does browse upon the young shoots, speaking as follows- For early in the morning, before I saw Any of the farmers here about, As I was bringing to the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> a shoot (θαλλὸν) Fresh plucked, I saw the army marching on By the projecting headland. <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> also mentions <a href=/people/12212 target=_blank>Nannium</a>, in his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=ethnic long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentines</a>, thus- But <a href=/people/12212 target=_blank>Nannium</a> is mad for love of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>,- jesting upon her as addicted to intoxication.

And <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a>, in his treatise On Courtesans, says- <a href=/people/12212 target=_blank>Nannium</a> was nicknamed the Proscenium, because she had a beautiful face, and used to wear very costly garments embroidered with gold, but when she was undressed she was a very bad figure. And <a href=/people/5576 target=_blank>Corone</a> was <a href=/people/12212 target=_blank>Nannium</a>'s daughter, and she was nicknamed Tethe, from her exceedingly debauched habits. <a href=/people/326 target=_blank>Hypereides</a>, in his oration against <a href=/people/1025 target=_blank>Patrocles</a>, also speaks of a female flute-player named Nemeas.

He also gave them an oracle respecting <a href=/people/3154 target=_blank>Chariton</a>, putting the pentameter before the hexameter, in the same way as afterwards <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> did, who was nicknamed the Brazen, in his Elegies; and the oracle runs as follows- Happy were <a href=/people/3154 target=_blank>Chariton</a> and <a href=/people/3495 target=_blank>Melanippus</a>, Guides in heavenly love to many men. The circumstances, too, that happened to <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, are well known.

And after his death, <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a>, his friend, also devoted himself to death, and so the calamities of the country were terminated. And owing to love affairs of this kind, the tyrants (for friendships of this sort were very adverse to their interests) altogether forbade the fashion of making favourites of boys, and wholly abolished it. And some of them even burnt down and razed to the ground the palaestrae, considering them as fortresses hostile to their own citadels; as, for instance, <a href=/people/331 target=_blank>Polycrates</a> the tyrant of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a> did. </p>                        </div>

For though the king was of a very amorous disposition, still he was at all times sufficiently master of himself to have a due regard to decorum, and to the preservation of appearances. And in the same spirit, when he had taken as prisoners the daughters of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareius</a>, and his wife, who was of extraordinary beauty, he not only abstained from offering them any insult, but he took care never to let them feel that they were prisoners at all; but ordered them to be treated in every respect, and to be supplied with everything, just as if <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareius</a> had still been in his palace; on which account, <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareius</a>, when he heard of this conduct, raised his hands to the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> and prayed that either he might be king, or <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>.

And as the boy blushed all the more at this, <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> said to the guest who was sitting next to him, 'How well did <a href=/people/456 target=_blank>Phrynichus</a> speak when he said- [604] The light of love doth shine in purple cheeks.' And a man from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=person long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretria</a>, or from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384265PEry class=place long=26.4808 lat=38.3828>Erythrae</a>, who was a school-master, answered him,- 'You are a great man in poetry, O <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>; but still <a href=/people/456 target=_blank>Phrynichus</a> did not say well when he called purple cheeks a mark of beauty. For if a painter were to cover the cheeks of this boy with purple paint he would not be beautiful at all. And so it is not well to compare what is beautiful with what is not so.' And on this <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>, laughing at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=person long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretrian</a>, said,- 'Then, my friend, I suppose you are not pleased with the line in <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> which is generally considered among the Greeks to be a beautiful one- The maid poured forth a gentle voice From out her purple mouth. And you do not either like the poet who spoke of the golden-haired <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>; for if a painter were to represent the hair of the god as actually golden, and not black, the picture would be all the worse. Nor do you approve of the poet who described women as rosy-fingered. For if any one were to dip his fingers in rosy-coloured paint he would make his hands like those of a purple-dyer, and not of a pretty woman.' And when they all laughed at this, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=person long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretrian</a> was checked by the reproof; and <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> again turned to pursue the conversation with the boy; for he asked him, as he was brushing away the straws from the cup with his little finger, whether he saw any straws: and when he said that he did, he said, 'Blow them away, then, that you may not dirty your fingers.' And when he brought his face near the cup he held the cup nearer to his own mouth, so as to bring his own head nearer to the head of the boy. And when he was very near he took him by the hand and kissed him. And when all clapped their hands, laughing and shouting out, to see how well he had taken the boy in, he said, 'I, my friends, am practising the art of generalship, since <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a> has said that I know how to compose poetry, but not how to be a general; now has not this stratagem of mine succeeded perfectly?' And he both said and did many things of this kind in a witty manner, drinking and giving himself up to mirth: but as to political affairs he was not able nor energetic in them, but behaved as any other virtuous <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> might have done. </p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> the poet mentions this circumstance in his drama entitled The Picture, where he says- [606] And such another circumstance, they say, Took place in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>: there a man did fall In love with a fair maiden wrought in marble, And shut himself up with her in the temple.

This story is told by <a href=/people/1019 target=_blank>Duris</a>, in the ninth book of his History; and the subject of that book is the history of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, and the historian's words are these: He likewise sent for the boy from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373276UIas class=place long=27.5846 lat=37.2795>Iasus</a>. For near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373276UIas class=place long=27.5846 lat=37.2795>Iasus</a> there was a boy whose name was <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, and he once, when leaving the palaestra with the rest of the boys, went down to the sea and bathed; and a <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphin</a> came forward out of the deep water to meet him, and taking him on his back, swam away with him a considerable distance into the open sea, and then brought him back again to land. But the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphin</a> is an animal which is very fond of men, and very intelligent, and one very susceptible of gratitude. Accordingly <a href=/people/724 target=_blank>Phylarchus</a>, in his twelfth book, says- <a href=/people/2303 target=_blank>Coeranus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=person long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a>, when he saw some fishermen who had caught a <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphin</a> in a net, and who were about to cut it up, gave them some money and bought the fish, and took it down and put it back in the sea again. And after this it happened to him to be shipwrecked near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PMyk class=place long=25.3286 lat=37.446>Myconos</a>, and while every one else perished, <a href=/people/2303 target=_blank>Coeranus</a> alone was saved by a <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphin</a>. And when, at last, he died of old age in his native country, as it so happened that his funeral procession passed along the sea-shore close to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=place long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a>, a great shoal of <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphins</a> appeared on that day in the harbour, keeping only a very little distance from those who were attending the funeral of <a href=/people/2303 target=_blank>Coeranus</a>, as if they also were joining in the procession and sharing in their grief. The same <a href=/people/724 target=_blank>Phylarchus</a> also relates, in the twentieth book of his History, the great affection which was once displayed by an elephant for a boy. And his words are these: But there was a female elephant kept with this elephant, and the name of the female elephant was <a href=/people/1952 target=_blank>Nicaea</a>; and to her the wife of the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, when dying, entrusted her child, which was just a month old. And when the woman did die, the affection for the child displayed by the beast was most extraordinary; for it could not endure the child to be away; and whenever it did not see him, it was out of spirits. And so, whenever the nurse fed the infant with milk, she placed it in its cradle between the feet of the beast; [607] and if she had not done so, the elephant would not take any food; and after this, it would take whatever reeds and grass there were near, and, while the child was sleeping, beat away the flies with the bundle. And whenever the child wept, it would rock the cradle with its trunk, and lull it to sleep. And very often the male elephant did the same. </p>                        </div>

And at those times we should praise those who indulge in that kind of conversation to a moderate and temperate degree, but blame those who go to excess in it, and behave in a beastly manner. But if logicians, when assembled in a social party, were to talk about syllogisms, then a man might very fairly think that they were acting very unseasonably. And a respectable and virtuous man will at times get drunk; but they who wish to appear extraordinarily temperate, keep up this character amid their cups for a certain time, but afterwards, as the wine begins to take effect on them, they descend to every kind of impropriety and indecency. And this was the case very lately with the ambassadors who came to <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a>; for they sat at dinner with great severity of countenance, and with great propriety, as they thought, not only not looking at any one of us, but not even looking at one another. But as the wine went round, and music of different kinds was introduced, and when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> dancing-women, as their fashion is, came in, and danced quite naked, except that they had girdles round their waists, then the men could not restrain themselves any longer, but jumped up off the couches, and shouted as if they were beholding a most gratifying sight; and they congratulated the king because he had it in his power to indulge in such pastimes; and they did and said a great many more vulgar things of the same kind. And one of the philosophers who was once drinking with us, when a flute-playing girl came in, and when there was plenty of room near him, when the girl wished to sit down near him, would not allow her, but drew himself up and looked grave. And then afterwards, when the girl was put up to auction, as is often the fashion at such entertainments, he was exceedingly eager to buy her, and quarreled with the man who sold her, on the ground that he had knocked her down too speedily to someone else; and he said that the auctioneer had not fairly sold her. And at last this grave philosopher, he who at first would not permit the girl even to sit near him, came to blows about her. And perhaps this very philosopher, who came to blows about the flute-playing girl, may have been <a href=/people/1353 target=_blank>Persaeus</a> himself; for <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380244PKar class=person long=24.427 lat=38.027>Carystus</a>, in his treatise on <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zenon</a>, makes the following statement:- <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zenon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/349336PKit class=person long=33.632745 lat=34.920211>Citium</a>, when once <a href=/people/1353 target=_blank>Persaeus</a> at a drinking-party bought a flute-playing girl, and after that was afraid to bring her home, because he lived in the same house with <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zenon</a>, becoming acquainted with the circumstance, brought the girl home himself, and shut her up with <a href=/people/1353 target=_blank>Persaeus</a>.

Another bared Her lovely arms and shoulders all: Another, with her robe high round her neck, Concealed her bosom, but a rent below Showed all her shapely thighs. I was led on, Not without hope, by desire for her smiling beauty.

And <a href=/people/724 target=_blank>Phylarchus</a>, in his nineteenth book, says that Timosa, the concubine of <a href=/people/1954 target=_blank>Oxyartes</a>, surpassed all women in beauty, and that the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> had originally sent her as a present to <a href=/people/2260 target=_blank>Stateira</a>, the wife of the king. And <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>, in the fifty-sixth book of his History, speaks of Xenopitheia, the mother of <a href=/people/9716 target=_blank>Lysandrides</a>, as the most beautiful of all the women in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a>.

Pantica of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=person long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a> was also a very beautiful woman and she is mentioned by <a href=/people/724 target=_blank>Phylarchus</a>, in the tenth book of his History, where he says that when she was with <a href=/people/272 target=_blank>Olympias</a>, the mother of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, <a href=/people/3211 target=_blank>Monimus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/3463 target=_blank>Pythion</a>, asked her in marriage. And, as she was a very licentious woman, <a href=/people/272 target=_blank>Olympias</a> said to him- O wretched man, you are marrying with your eyes, and not with your understanding. They also say that the woman who brought back <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a> to assume the tyranny, clad in the semblance of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athene</a> the <a href=/people/1517 target=_blank>Saviour</a>, was very beautiful, as indeed she ought to have been, seeing that she assumed the appearance of a goddess. And she was a seller of garlands; and <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a> afterwards gave her in marriage to <a href=/people/251 target=_blank>Hipparchus</a> his son, as <a href=/people/3365 target=_blank>Cleidemus</a> relates in the eighth book of his <a href=/people/12255 target=_blank>Returns</a>, where he says- And he also gave the woman, by name <a href=/people/10081 target=_blank>Phya</a>, who had been in the chariot with him, in marriage to his son <a href=/people/251 target=_blank>Hipparchus</a>. And she was the daughter of a man named <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>. And he took for <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a>, who succeeded him in the tyranny, the daughter of <a href=/people/2507 target=_blank>Charmus</a> the polemarch, who was extraordinarily beautiful. And it happened, as it is said, that <a href=/people/2507 target=_blank>Charmus</a> was a great admirer of <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a>, and that he was the man who first erected a statue of <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAca class=place long=23.707 lat=37.992>Academy</a>, on which there is the following inscription- O wily <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a>, <a href=/people/2507 target=_blank>Charmus</a> this altar raised At the well-shaded bounds of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BGAP class=place long=23.7082 lat=37.9911>Gymnasium</a>. <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a>, also, in the third book of his <a href=/people/790 target=_blank>Melampodia</a>, calls <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236PCha class=place long=23.6153 lat=38.4597>Chalcis</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a> Land of fair women — for the women there are very beautiful, as <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> also asserts.

But in some places, says the same <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, there are contests between the women in respect of modesty and good management, as there are among the barbarians; and at other places also there are contests about beauty, on the ground that this also is entitled to honour, as for instance, there are in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398261ITen class=place long=26.0715 lat=39.8337>Tenedos</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=place long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbos</a>.

And after what I have already quoted, the orator proceeds to say:- And I was persuaded by this speech of his, considering also that this <a href=/people/1038 target=_blank>Aeschines</a> had been the pupil of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, and was a man who uttered fine sentiments about virtue and justice, and who would never attempt nor venture on the actions practised by dishonest and unjust men. </p>                        </div>

Are not even all the wine-sellers who live near him, from whom he gets wine for his entertainments and never pays for it, bringing actions against him, having already closed their shops against him? And his neighbors are ill-treated by him to such a degree that they leave their own houses, and go and rent others which are at a distance from him. And with respect to all the contributions which he collects, he never himself puts down the remaining share which is due from him, but all the money which ever gets into this peddler's hands is lost as if it were utterly destroyed. And such a number of men come to his house daily at dawn, to ask for their money which he owes them, that passers-by suppose he must be dead, and that such a crowd can only be collected to attend his funeral.

Has he not got possession of the property of Hermaeus the perfumer, after having seduced his wife, though she was seventy years old? He pretended to be in love with her, and then treated her in such a manner that she reduced her husband and her sons to beggary, and made him a perfumer instead of a peddler! He handled the lady in this amorous manner, enjoying the 'fruit of her youth', when it would have been less trouble to him to count her teeth than the fingers of her hand, they were so much fewer.

And the fact of this king having been a man who was very fond of jokes is testified to us by <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> the orator in his Philippics. <a href=/people/234 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> Poliorcetes was a man very eager for anything which could make him laugh, as <a href=/people/724 target=_blank>Phylarchus</a> tells us in the sixth book of his History.

And having brought these men in front of the stage after the chorus was over, he ordered them all to play the flute. And as they accompanied their music with appropriate gestures, he sent to them and said that they were not playing well, and desired them to be more vehement. And while they were in perplexity, one of the lictors told them that what <a href=/people/1345 target=_blank>Anicius</a> wished was that they should turn round so as to advance towards each other, and give a representation of a battle. And then the flute-players, taking this hint, and adopting a movement not unsuited to their habitual wantonness, caused a great tumult and confusion; and turning the middle of the chorus towards the extremities, the flute-players, all blowing unpremeditated notes, and letting their flutes be all out of tune, rushed upon one another in turn: and at the same time the choruses, all making a noise to correspond to them, and coming on the stage at the same time, rushed also upon one another, and then again retreated, advancing and retreating alternately. But when one of the chorus-dancers tucked up his garment, and suddenly turned round and raised his hands against the flute-player who was coming towards him, as if he was going to box with him, then there arose an extraordinary clapping and shouting on the part of the spectators. And while all these men were fighting as if in regular battle, two dancers were introduced into the orchestra with a symphony, and four boxers mounted the stage, with trumpeters and horn-players: and when all these men were striving together, the spectacle was quite indescribable: and as for the tragedians, says <a href=/people/160 target=_blank>Polybius</a>, if I were to attempt to describe what took place with respect to them, I should be thought by some people to be jesting. </p>                        </div>

And the expression of <a href=/people/8358 target=_blank>Tachaos</a> was as follows: — The mountain was in labour; <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> Was greatly frighten'd: lo! a <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mouse</a> was born. And <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a> hearing of this, and being indignant at it, said, I will prove a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> to you.

For concerning flutes, somebody said that <a href=/people/3045 target=_blank>Melanippides</a>, in his <a href=/people/451 target=_blank>Marsyas</a>, disparaging the art of playing the flute, had said very cleverly about <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>: — <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> cast away those instruments Down from her sacred hand; and said, in scorn, Away, you shameful things — you stains of the body! Shall I now yield myself to such malpractices' And some one, replying to him, said, — But Telestes of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376128PSel class=person long=12.8251 lat=37.5828>Selinus</a>, in opposition to <a href=/people/3045 target=_blank>Melanippides</a>, says in his <a href=/people/352 target=_blank>Argo</a> (and it is of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> that he too is speaking): — It seems to me a scarcely credible thing That the wise <a href=/people/681 target=_blank>Pallas</a>, holiest of goddesses, Should in the mountain groves have taken up That clever instrument, and then again Thrown it away, fearing to draw her mouth Into an unseemly shape, to be a glory To the nymph-born, noisy monster <a href=/people/451 target=_blank>Marsyas</a>. For how should chaste <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> be so anxious About her beauty, when the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> had given her A childless, husbandless virginity? intimating his belief that she, as she was and always was to continue a maid, could not be alarmed at the idea of disfiguring her beauty. And in a subsequent passage he says — But this report, spread by vain-speaking men, Hostile to every chorus, flew most causelessly Through Greece, to raise an envy and reproach Against the wise and sacred art of music. And after this, in an express panegyric on the art of flute-playing, he says — And so the happy breath of the holy goddess Bestow'd this art divine on <a href=/people/1553 target=_blank>Bromius</a>, With the quick motion of the nimble fingers. And very neatly, in his <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Aesculapius</a>, has Telestes vindicated the use of the flute, where he says — And that wise <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> king who first poured forth The notes from sweetly-sounding sacred flutes, Rivalling the music of the <a href=/people/476 target=_blank>Doric</a> <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a>, Embracing with his well-join'd reeds the breath Which fills the flute with tuneful modulation. </p>                        </div>

It is wren there is a union of the flute and of rhythm in alternation, without any words accompanying the melody. And <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> explains it very neatly in his Flute-player, where he says — Tell me, I pray you, what this concert (ἡ συναυλία αἵτη) was Which he did give you.

But the poets frequently call the flute the Libyan flute, as <a href=/people/1019 target=_blank>Duris</a> remarks in the second book of his History of <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a>, because Seirites, who appears to have been the first inventor of the art of flute-playing, was a Libyan, of one of the Nomad tribes; and he was the first person who played airs on the flute in the festival of <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>. And the different kinds of airs which can be played on the flute (as <a href=/people/1120 target=_blank>Tryphon</a> tells us in the second book of his treatise on Names) have the following names: — the Comus, the Bucoliasmus, the <a href=/people/9445 target=_blank>Gingras</a>, the Tetracomus, the Epiphallus, the Choreus, the <a href=/people/2600 target=_blank>Callinicus</a>, the Martial, the Hedycomus, the Sicynnotyrbe, the Thyrocopicum, which is the same as the Crousithyrum (or Door-knocker), the Cnismus, the Mothon.

He says — There is the Himaeus, which is also called the Millstone song, which men used to sing while grinding corn, perhaps from the word ἱμαλίς.. But ἱμαλίς is a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor class=demonym long=22.4 lat=38.7>Dorian</a> word, signifying a return, and also the quantity of corn which the millers gave into the bargain. Then there is the Elinus, which is the song of the men who worked at the loom; as <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> shows us in his Atalantas. There is also the Ioulos, sung by the women who spin. And <a href=/people/3691 target=_blank>Semus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=person long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delian</a>, in his treatise on Paeans, says — 'They used to call the handfuls of barley taken separately, ἄμάλαι; but when they were collected so that a great many were made into one sheaf, then they were called οὔλοι and ἴουλοι.. And <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a> herself was called sometimes <a href=/people/12225 target=_blank>Chloe</a>, and sometimes Ioulo; and, as being the inventions of this goddess, both the fruits of the ground and also the songs addressed to the goddess were called οὖλοι and ἴουλοι: and so, too, we have the words δημήτρουλοι and καλλίουλοι, and the line — πλεῖστον οὖλον οὖλον ἵει, ἴουλον ἵει. But others say that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376243PIou class=place long=24.341 lat=37.642>Ioulis</a> is the song of the workers in wool. There are also the songs of nurses, which are called καταβαυκαλήσεις. There was also a song used at the feast of Swings, in honour of <a href=/people/1213 target=_blank>Erigone</a>, which is called Aletis. At all events, <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says, in his treatise on the Constitution of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=ethnic long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophonians</a> — <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a> also himself died afterwards by a violent death. And he is said to have been a very luxurious man, as is evident from his poetry; for even now the women sing his songs on the festival of the Swing. There was also a reaper's song called <a href=/people/9703 target=_blank>Lityerses</a>; and another song sung by hired servants when going to the fields, as <a href=/people/1794 target=_blank>Teleclides</a> tells us in his <a href=/people/371 target=_blank>Amphictyons</a>. There were songs, too, of bathing men, as we learn from <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a> in his Deeds of Daring; and a song of women baking, as <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> intimates in his <a href=/people/1058 target=_blank>Thesmophoriazusae</a>, and <a href=/people/3904 target=_blank>Nicochares</a> in his <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> Choregus. And another song in use among those who drove herds, and this was called the Bucoliasmus. And the man who first invented this species of song was <a href=/people/9273 target=_blank>Diomus</a>, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=person long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> cowherd; and it is mentioned by <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> in his Halcyon, and in his <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> Shipwrecked. The song used at deaths and in mourning is called Olophyrmus; and the songs called Iouli are used in honour of <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a> and <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Proserpine</a>. The song sung in honour of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> is called Philhelias, as we learn from <a href=/people/2263 target=_blank>Telesilla</a>; and those addressed to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> are called Upingi.

But the <a href=/people/696 target=_blank>Linus</a> and the Aelinus are not confined to occasions of mourning, but are in use also in good fortune, as we may gather from <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>. </p>                        </div>

For often frequenting the mountains, and wandering over them, she came to the different groves, equalling in her wanderings the celebrated journeys of <a href=/people/389 target=_blank>Io</a>; so that not only those men who were most remarkable for their deficiency in the tender passion, but even the fiercest beasts, joined in weeping for her misfortunes, perceiving the lengths to which her passionate hopes carried her. Therefore she wrote poems; and when she had composed them, as it is said, she roamed about the desert, shouting and singing the kind of song called <a href=/people/5135 target=_blank>Nomium</a>, in which the burden of the song is — The lofty oaks, <a href=/people/7958 target=_blank>Menalcas</a>. And <a href=/people/633 target=_blank>Aristoxenus</a>, in the fourth book of his treatise on <a href=/people/1268 target=_blank>Music</a>, says — Anciently the women used to sing a kind of song called <a href=/people/9065 target=_blank>Calyca</a>. Now, this was a poem of <a href=/people/695 target=_blank>Stesichorus</a>, in which a damsel of the name of <a href=/people/9065 target=_blank>Calyca</a>, being in love with a young man named <a href=/people/3172 target=_blank>Euathlus</a>, prays in a modest manner to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> to aid her in becoming his wife.

And the poet has represented the disposition of the maiden as very modest; so that she was not willing to live with the youth on his own terms, but prayed that, if possible, she might become the wedded wife of <a href=/people/3172 target=_blank>Euathlus</a>; and if that were not possible, that she might be released from life. But, in his Brief Memoranda, <a href=/people/633 target=_blank>Aristoxenus</a> says — <a href=/people/1102 target=_blank>Iphiclus</a> despised <a href=/people/2481 target=_blank>Harpalyce</a>, who was in love with him; but she died, and there has been a contest established among the virgins of songs in her honour, and the contest is called from her, <a href=/people/2481 target=_blank>Harpalyce</a>.

And they say that he was the son of an illustrious and wealthy man, and that he was far superior to all his fellows in beauty and in the vigour of youth; and as he was superintending the cultivation of some of his own lands, and wishing to give his reapers something to drink, he went to fetch some water, and disappeared. Accordingly, they say that on this the natives of the country sought him with a kind of dirge and invocation set to music, which even to this day they are in the habit of using frequently. And a similar kind of song is that which is in use among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, and is called <a href=/people/4599 target=_blank>Maneros</a>. </p>                        </div>

And they both sing the same songs, and in other respects they are similar. The Ionic dialect also supplies us with poems of <a href=/people/2448 target=_blank>Sotades</a>, and with what before his time were called Ionic poems, such as those of <a href=/people/12374 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=person long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aetolian</a>, and Pyres the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=person long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Milesian</a>, and <a href=/people/3329 target=_blank>Alexas</a>, and other poets of the same kind; and <a href=/people/2448 target=_blank>Sotades</a> is called κιναιδόλογος.

And Aristoxeus says that the business of singing joyous songs is a respectable one, and somewhat akin to tragedy; but that the business of a <a href=/people/7915 target=_blank>Magodus</a> is more like comedy.

Long ago the geese Have all been deftly carved limb from limb; Long the hot pork has had the meat cut off From the long backbone, and the stuffing, which Lay in the middle of his stomach, has Been served around; and all his pettitoes, The dainty slices of fat, well-season'd sausages, Have all been eaten. The well-roasted cuttle-fish Is swallow'd long ago; and nine or ten Casks of rich wine are drain'd to the very dregs. So if you'd like some fragments of the feast, Hasten and enter. Don't, like hungry <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>, Losing this feast, then run about at random. For as that delightful writer <a href=/people/238 target=_blank>Antiphanes</a> says, in his Friend of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a>, — A.

B. Say you the cook is living A. There is near A cestreus, all unfed both night and day, Scaled, wash'd, and stain'd with cochineal, and turned; And as he nears his last and final turn He cracks and hisses; while the servant bastes The fish with vinegar: then there's Libyan silphium, Dried in the genial rays of midday sun: — B. Yet there are people found who dare to say That sorcerers possess no sacred power; For now I see three men their bellies filling While you are turning this. A.

But the manners of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=ethnic long=27.3 lat=38>Ionians</a> of the present day are more luxurious, and the character of their present music is very far removed from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=demonym long=27.3 lat=38>Ionian</a> harmony we have been speaking of.

This is that <a href=/people/4283 target=_blank>Pythermus</a> whom <a href=/people/4409 target=_blank>Ananius</a> or <a href=/people/1171 target=_blank>Hipponax</a> mentions in his Iambics in this way: — <a href=/people/4283 target=_blank>Pythermus</a> speaks of gold as though all else were nought. And <a href=/people/4283 target=_blank>Pythermus</a>'s own words are as follows: — All other things but gold are good for nothing. Therefore, according to this statement, it is probable that <a href=/people/4283 target=_blank>Pythermus</a>, as coming from those parts. adapted the character of his melodies to the disposition of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=ethnic long=27.3 lat=38>Ionians</a>; on which account I suppose that his was not actually the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=demonym long=27.3 lat=38>Ionian</a> harmony, but that it was a harmony adapted in some a admirable manner to the purpose required. And those are contemptible people who are unable to distinguish the characteristic differences of these separate harmonies; but who are led away by the sharpness or flatness of the sounds, so as to describe one harmony as ὑπερμιξολύδιος, and then again to give a definition of some further sort, refining on this: for I do not think that even that which is called the ὑπερφρύγιος has a distinct character of its own, although some people do say that they have invented a new harmony which they call Sub-<a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> (ὑποφρύγιος).

Nor must we think that the ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=ethnic long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretans</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> used flutes and songs at random to excite their military ardour, instead of trumpets. Nor are we to imagine that the earliest <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a> had no reason whatever for doing so, when they introduced music into every department of their management of the republic; so that, though the nation in every other respect was most austere in its manner of life, they nevertheless compelled music to be the constant companion, not only of their boys, but even of their youths up to thirty years of age. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a> are the only people among whom the boys are trained from infancy to sing hymns and paeans to regular airs, in which indeed every city celebrates their national heroes and gods with such songs, in obedience to ancient custom. But after this, learning the airs of <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a> and <a href=/people/489 target=_blank>Philoxenus</a>, they every year, at the festival of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a>, dance in their theatres to the music of flute-players; the boys dancing in the choruses of boys, and the youths in those of men. And throughout the whole duration of their lives they are addicted to music at their common entertainments; not so much, however, employing musicians as singing in turn: and to admit themselves ignorant of any other accomplishment is not at all reckoned discreditable to them; but to refuse to sing is accounted a most disgraceful thing. And they, practising marches so as to march in order to the sound of the flute, and studying their dances also, exhibit every year in the theatres, under public regulations and at the public expense. These, then, are the customs which they have derived from the ancients, not for the sake of luxury and superfluity, but from a consideration of the austerity which each individual practised in his private life, and of the severity of their characters, which they contract from the cold and gloomy nature of the climate which prevails in the greater part of their country. And it is the nature of all men to be in some degree influenced by the climate, so as to get some resemblance to it themselves; and it is owing to this that we find different races of men, varying in character and figure and complexion, in proportion as they are more or less distant from one another. In addition to this, they instituted public banquets and public sacrifices, in which the men and women join; and also dances of the maidens and boys together; endevouring to mollify and civilize the harshness of their nature character by the influence of education and habit. And as the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380221UKyn class=place long=22.128 lat=38.033>Cynaetha</a> neglected this system (although they occupy by far the most inclement district of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a>, both as respects the soil and the climate), they, never meeting one another except for the purpose of giving offence and quarrelling, became at last so utterly savage, that the very greatest impieties prevailed among them alone of all the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a>; and at the time when they made the great massacre, whatever <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a> cities their emissaries came to in their passage, the citizens of all the other cities at once ordered them to depart by public proclamation; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376224UMan class=ethnic long=22.3933 lat=37.6181>Mantineans</a> even made a public purification of their city after their departure, leading victims all round their entire district. </p>                        </div>

Now, formerly music was an exhortation to courage; and accordingly <a href=/people/529 target=_blank>Alcaeus</a> the poet, one of the greatest musicians that ever lived, places valour and manliness before skill in music and poetry, being himself a man warlike even beyond what was necessary. On which account, in such verses as these, he speaks in high-toned language, and says — My lofty house is bright with brass, And all my dwelling is adorn'd, in honour Of mighty <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, with shining helms, O'er which white horsehair crests superbly wave, Choice ornament for manly brows; And brazen greaves, on mighty pegs suspended, Hang round the hall; fit to repel The heavy javelin or the long-headed spear. There, too, are breastplates of new linen, And many a hollow shield, thrown basely down By coward enemies in flight: There, too, are sharp Chalcidic swords, and belts, Short military cloaks besides, And all things suitable for fearless war; Which I may ne'er forget, Since first I girt myself for the adventurous work — although it would have been more suitable for him to have had his house well stored with musical instruments. But the ancients considered manly courage the greatest of all civil virtues, and they attributed the greatest importance to that, to the exclusion of other good qualities. <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a> accordingly, who was a distinguished poet, boasted in the first place of being able to partake in all political undertakings, and in the second place he mentioned the credit he had gained by his poetical efforts, saying, — But I'm a willing servant of great <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, Skilled also in the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>' lovely art. And, in the same spirit, <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a>, though a man who had acquired such great renown by his poetry, nevertheless preferred having his valour recorded on his tomb, and composed an inscription for it, of which the following lines are a part: — The grove of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381241LMaB class=place long=24.0002 lat=38.144>Marathon</a>, and the long-hair'd <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>; Who felt his courage, well may speak of it. </p>                        </div>

And, moreover, many of the barbarians make all their public proclamations to the accompaniment of flutes and harps, softening the souls of their enemies by these means. And <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>, in the forty-sixth book of his History, says — The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435268RGet class=ethnic long=26.8 lat=43.5>Getae</a> make all their proclamations while holding harps in their hands and playing on them. And it is perhaps on this account that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, having due regard to the ancient institutions and customs of the Greeks, says — I hear, what <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a> every feast, the lyre; as if this art of music were welcome also to men feasting. Now it was, as it should seem, a regular custom to introduce music, in the first place in order that every one who might be too eager for drunkenness or gluttony might have music as a sort of physician and healer of his insolence and indecorum, and also because music softens moroseness of temper; for it dissipates sadness, and produces affability and a sort of gentlemanlike joy. From which consideration, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> has also, in the first book of the <a href=/people/12111 target=_blank>Iliad</a>, represented the gods as using music after their dissensions on the subject of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>; for they continued for some time listening to it — Thus the blest gods the genial day prolong In feasts ambrosial and celestial song: <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> tuned the lyre, — the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> round, With voice alternate, aid the silver sound. [Il i. 603] For it was desirable that they should leave off their quarrels and dissensions, as we have said. And most people seem to attribute the practice of this art to banquets for the sake of setting things right, and of the general mutual advantage. And, besides these other occasions, the ancients also established by customs and laws that at feasts all men should sing hymns to the gods, in order by these means to preserve order and decency among us; for as all songs proceed according to harmony, the consideration of the gods being added to this harmony, elevates the feelings of each individual. And <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philochorus</a> says that the ancients, when making their libations, did not always use dithyrambic hymns, but when they pour libations, they celebrate <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a> with wine and drunkenness, but <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> with tranquillity and good order. Accordingly <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a> says — I, all excited in my mind with wine, Am skilful in the dithyrambic, knowing The noble melodies of the sovereign <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a>. And <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a>, in his <a href=/people/448 target=_blank>Philoctetes</a>, says — A water-drinker knows no dithyrambics. So, that it was not merely with a view to superficial and vulgar pleasure, as some assert, that music was originally introduced into entertainments, is plain from what has been said above. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> do not assert that they used to learn music as a science, but they do profess to be able to judge well of what is done in the art; and they say that they have already three times preserved it when it was in danger of being lost. </p>                        </div>

And it was a good saying of <a href=/people/859 target=_blank>Damon</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, that songs and dances must inevitably exist where the mind was excited in any manner; and liberal, and gentlemanly, and honourable feelings of the mind produce corresponding kinds of music, and the opposite feelings likewise produce the opposite kinds of music. On which account, that saying of <a href=/people/2041 target=_blank>Clisthenes</a> the tyrant of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=place long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sicyon</a> was a witty one, and a sign of a well-educated intellect. For when he saw, as it is related, one of the suitors for his daughter dancing in an unseemly manner (it was <a href=/people/9516 target=_blank>Hippoclides</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>), he told him that he had danced away his marriage, thinking, as it should seem, that the mind of the man corresponded to the dance which he had exhibited; for in dancing and walking decorum and good order are honourable, and disorder and vulgarity are discreditable. And it is on this principle that the poets originally arranged dances for freeborn men, and employed figures only to be emblems of what was being sung, always preserving the principles of nobleness and manliness in them; on which account it was that they gave them the name of ὑπορχήματα(accompaniment to the dance). And if any one, while dancing indulged in unseemly postures or figures, and did nothing at all corresponding to the songs sung, he was considered blameworthy; on which account, <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> or <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, in his Preparations (as <a href=/people/1696 target=_blank>Chamaeleon</a> quotes the play), spoke thus: — So that if any one danced well, the sight Was pleasing: but they now do nothing rightly, But stand as if amazed, and roar at random. For the kind of dancing which was at that time used in the choruses was decorous and magnificent, and to a certain extent imitated the motions of men under arms; on which account <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> in his Poems says that those men who dance best are the best in warlike exploits; and thus he writes: — But they who in the dance most suitably Do honour to the Gods, are likewise best In all the deeds of war. For the dance is very nearly an armed exercise, and is a display not only of good discipline in other respects, but also of the care which the dancers bestow on their persons. </p>                        </div>

And it was a good answer which was made by Caphesias the flute-player, when one of his pupils began to pay on the flute very loudly, and was endeavouring to play as loudly as he could; on which he struck him, and said, Goodness does not consist in greatness, but greatness in goodness There are also relics and traces of the ancient dancing in some statues which we have, which were made by ancient statuaries; on which account men at that time paid more attention to moving their hands with graceful gestures; for in this particular also they aimed at graceful and gentlemanlike motions, comprehending what was great in what was well done. And from these motions of the hands they transferred some figures to the dances, and from the dances to the palaestra; for they sought to improve their manliness by music and by paying attention to their persons. And they practised to the accompaniment of song with reference to their movements when under arms; and it was from this practice that the dance called the Pyrrhic dance originated, and every other dance of this kind, and all the others which have the same name or any similar one with a slight change: such as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> dances called orsites ὀρσίτης and epikredios ἐπικρήδιος; and that dance, too, which is named apokinos ἀπόκινος, (and it is mentioned under this name by <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> in his <a href=/people/623 target=_blank>Nemesis</a>, and by <a href=/people/619 target=_blank>Cephisodorus</a> in his <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a>, and by <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in his <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaur</a>, and by several other poets,) though afterwards it came to be called maktrismos μακτρισμός; and many women used to dance it, who, I am aware, were afterwards called marktypiai μαρκτύπιαι. </p>                        </div>

The figures used in dances are the Xiphismus, the Calathismus, the <a href=/people/7420 target=_blank>Callabides</a>, the Scops, and the Scopeuma.

But Scamon, in the first book of his treatise on Inventions, says that this dance is called <a href=/people/5251 target=_blank>Sicinnis</a>, from being shaken (ἀπὸ τοῦ σείεσθαι), and that <a href=/people/4720 target=_blank>Thersippus</a> was the first person who danced the <a href=/people/5251 target=_blank>Sicinnis</a>. Now in dancing, the motion of the feet was adopted long before any motion of the lands was considered requisite; for the ancients exercised their feet more than their hands in games and in hunting; and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=ethnic long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretans</a> are greatly addicted to hunting, owing to which they are swift of foot. But there are people to be found who assert that <a href=/people/5251 target=_blank>Sicinnis</a> is a word formed poetically from κίνησις, because in dancing it the <a href=/people/185 target=_blank>Satyrs</a> use most rapid movements; for this kind of dance gives no scope for a display of the passions, on which account also it is never slow. Now all satyric poetry formerly consisted of choruses, as also did tragedy, such as it existed at the same time; and that was the chief reason why tragedy had no regular actors. Arid there are three kinds of dance appropriate to dramatic poetry, — the tragic, the comic, and the satyric; and in like manner, there are three kinds of lyric dancing, — the pyrrhic the gymnopaedic, and the hyporchematic. And the pyrrhic dance resembles the satyric; for they both consist of rapid movements; but the pyrrhic appears to be a warlike kind of dance, for it is danced by armed boys. And men in war have need of swiftness to pursue their enemies, and also, when defeated, To flee, and not like madmen to stand firm, Nor be afraid to seem a short time cowards. But the dance called <a href=/people/7732 target=_blank>Gymnopaedica</a> is like the dance in tragedy which is called <a href=/people/7636 target=_blank>Emmelea</a>; for in each there is seen a degree of gravity and solemnity. But the hyporchematic dance is very nearly identical with the comic one which is called <a href=/people/4936 target=_blank>Cordax</a>. And they are both a sportive kind of figure. </p>                        </div>

But the Pyrrhic dance is not preserved now among any other people of Greece; and since that has fallen into disuse, their wars also have been brought to a conclusion; but it continues in use among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> alone, being a sort of prelude preparatory to war: and all who are more than five years old in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> learn to dance the Pyrrhic dance. But the Pyrrhic dance as it exists in our time, appears to be a sort of Bacchic dance, and a little more pacific than the old one; for the dancers carry thyrsi instead of spears, and they point and dart canes at one another, and carry torches. And they dance in figures having reference to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a>, and to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, and to the story of <a href=/people/283 target=_blank>Pentheus</a>: and they require for the Pyrrhic dance the most beautiful airs, and what are called the stirring tunes. </p>                        </div>

And the different modes of dancing it are called the Oschophoricus, and the Bacchic, so that this kind of dance, too, has some reference to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a>. But <a href=/people/633 target=_blank>Aristoxenus</a> says that the ancients, after they had exercised themselves in the <a href=/people/7732 target=_blank>Gymnopaedica</a>, turned to the Pyrrhic dance before they entered the theatre: and the Pyrrhic dance is also called the Cheironomia. But the Hyporchematic dance is that in which the chorus dances while singing. Accordingly <a href=/people/1587 target=_blank>Bacchylides</a> says — There's no room now for sitting down, There's no room for delay.

Now the best modes are those which combine dancing with the singing; and they are these-the Prosodiacal, the Apostolical (which last is also called (παρθένιος), and others of the same kind. And some danced to the hymn and some did not; and some danced in accompaniment to hymns to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> and <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a>, and to the Paean, dancing at one time and resting at another.

But one Greek festival they do celebrate even to the present day, in which they meet and recollect all their ancient names and customs, and bewail their loss to one another, and then, when they have wept for them, they go home. And so, says he, we also, since the theatres have become completely barbarised, and since music has become entirely ruined and vulgar, we, being but a few, will recal to our minds, sitting by ourselves, what music once was.

And altogether the ancient philosophy of the Greeks appears to have been very much addicted to music; and on this account they judged <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> to have been the most musical and the wisest of the gods, and <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a> of' the demigods. And they called every one who devoted himself to the study of this art a sophist, as <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a> does in the verse where he says — And then the sophist sweetly struck the lyre. And that the ancients were excessively devoted to the study of music is plain from <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, who, because all his own poetry was adapted to music, makes, from want of care, so many verses which are headless, and weak, and imperfect in the tail. But Xenophobes, and <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>, and <a href=/people/1029 target=_blank>Theognis</a>, and <a href=/people/2917 target=_blank>Phocylides</a>, and besides them <a href=/people/346 target=_blank>Periander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=person long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>, an elegiac poet, and the rest of those who did not set melodies to their poems, compose their verses with reference to number and to the arrangement of the metres, and take great care that none of their verses shall be liable to the charge of any of the irregularities which we just now imputed to <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>. Now when we call a verse headless (ἀκέφαλος), we mean such as have a mutilation or lameness at the beginning, such as — ᾿επειδὴ νῆάς τε καὶ ῾ελλήσποντον ἵκοντο. ᾿επίτονος τετάνυστο βοὸς ἶφι κταμένοιο. Those we call weak (λαγαρὸς) which are defective in the middle, as — αἶψα δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ αἰνείαν υἱὸν φίλον ᾿αγχίσαο. τῶν δ᾽ αὖθ᾽ ἡγείσθην ᾿ασκληπιοῦ δύο παῖδες. Those again are μείουροι, which are imperfect in the tail or end, as — τρῶες δ᾽ ἐῤῥίγησαν ὅπως ἴδον αἴολον ὄφιν.

And even to this day they preserve their ancient songs carefully, being possessed of very varied and very accurate learning on the subject; on which account <a href=/people/2778 target=_blank>Pratinas</a> says — The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonian</a> grasshopper sweetly sings, Well suited to the chorus. And on this account the poets also continually styled their odes — President of sweetest hymns: and — The honey-wing'd melodies of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a>. For owing to the general moderation and austerity of their lives, they betook themselves gladly to music, which has a sort of power of soothing the understanding; so that it was natural enough that people who hear it should be delighted. And the people whom they called Choregi, were not, as <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=person long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> tells us in the fourth book of his treatise on Poetry, those who have that name now, the people, that is to say, who hire the choruses, but those who actually led the choruses, as the name intimates: and so it happened, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> were good musicians, and did not violate the ancient laws of music. Now in ancient times all the Greeks were fond of music; but when in subsequent ages disorders arose, when nearly all the ancient customs had got out of fashion and had become obsolete, this fondness for music also wore out, and bad styles of music were introduced, which led all the composers to aim at effeminacy rather than delicacy, and at an enervated and dissolute rather than a modest style. And perhaps this will still exist hereafter in a greater degree, and will extend still further, unless some one again draws forth the national music to the light. For formerly the subjects of their songs used to be the exploits of heroes, and the praises of the Gods; and accordingly <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> says of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> — With this he soothes his lofty soul, and sings Th' immortal deeds of heroes and of kings. And of Phemius he says — Phemius, let acts of gods and heroes old, What ancient bards in hall and bower have told, Attemper'd to the lyre your voice employ, Such the pleased ear will drink with silent joy. And this custom was preserved among the barbarians, as <a href=/people/2046 target=_blank>Dinon</a> tells us in his history of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>. Accordingly, the poets used to celebrate the valour of the elder <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, and they foresaw the war which was going to be waged against <a href=/people/578 target=_blank>Astyages</a>. For when, says he, <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> had begun his march against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, (and he had previously been the commander of the guards, and afterwards of the heavy-armed troops there, and then he left;) and while <a href=/people/578 target=_blank>Astyages</a> was sitting at a banquet with his friends, then a man, whose name was Angares, (and he was the most illustrious of his minstrels,) being called in, sang other things, such as were customary, and at last he said that — A mighty monster is let loose at last Into the marsh, fiercer than wildest <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>; And when once master of the neighbouring ground It soon will fight with ease 'gainst numerous hosts. And when <a href=/people/578 target=_blank>Astyages</a> asked him what monster he meant, he Said — ' <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=person long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>.'

But <a href=/people/457 target=_blank>Posidonius</a> asserts that <a href=/people/543 target=_blank>Anacreon</a> mentions three kinds of melodies, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor class=demonym long=22.4 lat=38.7>Dorian</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a>; for that these were the only melodies with which he was acquainted. And as every one of these is executed on seven strings, he says that it was very nearly correct of <a href=/people/543 target=_blank>Anacreon</a> to speak of twenty strings, as he only omits one for the sake of speaking in round numbers. But <a href=/people/457 target=_blank>Posidonius</a> is ignorant that the magadis is an ancient instrument, though <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> says plainly enough that <a href=/people/1164 target=_blank>Terpander</a> invented the barbitos to correspond to, and answer the pectis in use among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=ethnic long=28 lat=38.5>Lydians</a> — The sweet responsive lyre Which long ago the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=demonym long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbian</a> bard, <a href=/people/1164 target=_blank>Terpander</a>, did invent, sweet ornament To the luxurious <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> feasts, when he Heard the high-toned pectis.

And this last author says that <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a>, who is more ancient than <a href=/people/543 target=_blank>Anacreon</a>, was the first person to use the pectis. Now, that <a href=/people/1164 target=_blank>Terpander</a> is more ancient than <a href=/people/543 target=_blank>Anacreon</a>, is evident from the following considerations: — <a href=/people/1164 target=_blank>Terpander</a> was the first man who ever got the victory at the <a href=/people/3152 target=_blank>Carnean</a> games, as <a href=/people/637 target=_blank>Hellanicus</a> tells us in the verses in which he has celebrated the victors at the <a href=/people/6332 target=_blank>Carnea</a>, and also in the formal catalogue which he gives us of them. But the first establishment of the <a href=/people/6332 target=_blank>Carnea</a> took place in the twenty-sixth Olympiad, as <a href=/people/889 target=_blank>Sosibius</a> tells us in his essay on Dates. But <a href=/people/478 target=_blank>Hieronymus</a>, in his treatise on Harp-players, which is the subject of the fifth of his Treatises on Poets, says that <a href=/people/1164 target=_blank>Terpander</a> was a contemporary of <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a> the law-giver, who, it is agreed by all men, was, with <a href=/people/751 target=_blank>Iphitus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=person long=21.374 lat=37.89>Elis</a>, the author of that establishment of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> games from which the first Olympiad is reckoned.

And he himself sitting on a chair made on the same principles and after the same pattern, putting out his left hand so as to take hold of the instrument, and using the plectrum in his other hand, moved the pedestal with his foot very easily, so as to use whichever side of the instrument he chose to begin with; and then again turning to the other side he went on playing, and then he changed to the third side. And so rapidly did the easy movement of the pedestal, when touched by the foot, bring the various sides under his hand, and so very rapid was his fingering and execution, that if a person had not seen what was being done, but had judged only by his ear, he would have fancied that he was listening to three harp-players all playing on different instruments. But this instrument, though it was so greatly admired, after his death rapidly fell into disuse. </p>                        </div>

Come, tell me now, Why are so few of the ἐπιτραπεζώματα Remaining? B. That man hated by the gods <a href=/people/2150 target=_blank>Ate</a> them all up. And <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, in his treatise on <a href=/people/1458 target=_blank>Drunkenness</a>, says that sweetmeats (τραγήματα) used to be called by the ancients τρωγάλια; for that they come in as a sort of second course. But it is <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> who said — And τρώγαλον is nice when supper's over, And when the guests have eaten plentifully. And he was quite right. For <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> says, when one looks on what is served up before one, one may really say — You see how happily life passes when A man has always a well-appointed table. </p>                        </div>

Pind. Ol. i. And the ancients often called this second course simply τράπεζαι, as, for instance, <a href=/people/431 target=_blank>Achaeus</a> in his <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Vulcan</a>, which is a satyric drama, who says, — A. First we will gratify you with a feast; Lo! here it is. B. But after that what means Of pleasure will you offer me? A. We'll anoint you All over with a richly-smelling perfume. B. Will you not give me first a jug of water To wash my hands with! A. Surely; the dessert (τράπεζα) Is now being clear'd away. And <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>, in his Wasps, says — Bring water for the hands; clear the dessert. Ar. Vespae, And <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, in his treatise on <a href=/people/1458 target=_blank>Drunkenness</a>, uses the term δεύτεραι τράπεζαι, much as we do now; saying, — We must therefore bear in mind that there is a difference between τράγημα and βρῶμα, as there is also between ἔδεσμαand τρωγάλιον. For this is a national name in use in every part of Greece, since there is food (βρῶμα) in sweetmeats (ἐντραγήμασι), from which consideration the man who, first used the expression δευτέρα τράπεζα,, appears to have spoken with sufficient correctness. For the eating of sweetmeats (τραγηματισμὸς) is really an eating after supper (ἐπιδορπισμὸς); and the sweetmeats are served up as a second supper.

I know, too, that <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a>, in his List of Various Books, mentions the treatises on the Art of Making Cheesecakes, written by <a href=/people/2572 target=_blank>Aegimius</a>, and <a href=/people/2050 target=_blank>Hegesippus</a>, and <a href=/people/5118 target=_blank>Metrobius</a>, and also by Phaetus.

(This story is related by <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, in the first book of his essay on Passion.) But I, as I am fond of cheesecakes, should have been very sorry to see that divine cheesecake so injuriously treated. Accordingly, <a href=/people/2345 target=_blank>Plato</a> the comic poet mentions cheesecakes in his play called The Poet, where he says — Am I alone to sacrifice without Having a taste allow'd me of the entrails, Without a cheesecake, without frankincense?

Now, the word πλακοῦς ought to have a circumflex in the nominative case; for it is contracted from πλακόεις, as τυροῦς is from τυρόεις, and σησαμοῦς from σησαμόεις.. And it is used as a substantive, the word ἄρτος (bread) being understood. Those who have lived in the place assure us that there are capital cheesecakes to be got at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404271UPar class=place long=27.0671 lat=40.4257>Parium</a> on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>; for it is a blunder of <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, when he speaks of them as coming from the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371252PPar class=place long=25.1483 lat=37.0844>Paros</a>.

This last, he says, you will soften with sour wine, and if you have a little cheese you may mash the montianum up half with wine and half with cheese, and so it will be more palatable. Then there is the clustrum curianum, the clustrum tuttatum, and the clustrum tabonianum. There are also mustacia made with mead, mustacia made with sesame, crustum purium, gosgloanium, and paulianum. The following cakes resembling cheesecakes, he says, are really made with cheese: — the enchytus, the scriblites, the subityllus. There is also another kind of subityllus made of groats. Then there is the spira; this, too, is made with cheese. There are, too, the lucuntli, the argyrotryphema, the libos, the cercus, the aexaphas, the clustroplacous. There is also, says <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a>, a cheesecake made of rye. The phthois is made thus: — Take some cheese and pound it, then put it into a brazen sieve and strain it; then put in honey and a hemina of flour made from spring wheat, and beat the whole together into one mass. There is another cake, which is called by the Romans catillus ornatus, and which is made thus: — Wash some lettuces and scrape them; then put some wine into a mortar and pound the lettuces in it; then, squeezing out the juice, mix up some flour from spring wheat in it, and allowing it to settle, after a little while pound it again, adding a little <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>'s fat and pepper; then pound it again, draw it out into a cake, smoothe it, and cut it again, and cut it into shape, and boil it in hot oil, putting all the fragments which you have cut off into a strainer. Other kinds of cheesecakes are the following: — the ostracites, the attanites, the amylum, the tyrocoscinum. Make this last thus: — Pound some cheese (τῦρον) carefully, and put it into a vessel; then place above it a brazen sieve (κόσκινον) and strain the cheese through it. And when you are going to serve it up, then put in above it a sufficient quantity of honey. The cheesecakes called ὑποτυρίδες are made thus: — Put some honey into some milk, pound them, and put them into a vessel, and let them coagulate; then, if you have some little sieves at hand, put what is in the vessel into them, and let. the whey run off; and when it appears to you to have coagulated thoroughly, then take up the vessel in which it is, and transfer it to a silver dish, and the coat, or crust, will be uppermost. But if you have no such sieves; then use some new fans, such as those which are used to blow the fire; for they will serve the same purpose. Then there is the coptoplacous. And also, says he, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> they make a kind of cheesecake which they call gastris. And it is made thus: — Take some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=demonym long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasian</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=demonym long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontic</a> nuts and some almonds, and also a poppy. Roast this last with great care, and then take the seed and pound it in a clean mortar; then, adding the fruits which I have mentioned above, beat them up with boiled honey, putting in plenty of pepper, and make the whole into a soft mass, (but it will be of a black colour because of the poppy;) flatten it and make it into a square shape; then, having pounded some white sesame, soften that too with boiled honey, and draw it out into two cakes, placing one beneath and the other above, so as to have the black surface in the middle, and make it into a neat shape.

Now this dish consists of a number of cakes mashed up together and boiled with honey.

And as for the honey-cake which is now served up before each of us, <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> the Solensian, in his treatise on Riddles, mentions that, saying — If any one were to order a number of vessels to be mentioned which resemble one another, he might say, A tripod, a bowl, a candlestick, a marble mortar, A bench, a sponge, a caldron, a boat, a metal mortar, An oil-cruse, a basket, a knife, a ladle, A goblet, and a needle.

And in the same way he gives a catalogue of cakes, and sweetmeats, thus — Ames, placous, entiltos, itrium, Pomegranates, eggs, vetches, and sesame; Copte and grapes, dried figs, and pears and peaches Apples and almonds.

Your stomach Is hard with indigestion; give up eating (ἀπέσθιε) Those fish that cling to the rocks; the lees of wine Will make your head and senses clear, and thus You'll find your health, and your estate too, better. Men do, however, use ἀπεσθίω for to eat a portion of anything, as <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a> does, in his Soldiers — Alas! alas! he bites me now, he bites, And quite devours (ἀπεσθίει) my ears. </p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/457 target=_blank>Posidonius</a> the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a>, in the third book of his History, writes thus: But both <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> produce the peach, and the nut which is called βιστάκιον; which bears a fruit in bunches like bunches of grapes, of a sort of tawny white, long shaped, like tears, and the nuts lie on one another like berries. But the kernel is of a light green, and it is less juicy than the pine-cone, but it has a more pleasant smell. And the brothers who together composed the Georgics, write thus, in the third book — There is also the ash, and the turpentine tree, which the Syrians call πιστάκια. And these people spell the word πιστάκια with a π, but <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> writes it φιττάκια, and <a href=/people/457 target=_blank>Posidonius</a> βιστάκια. </p>                        </div>

And this tree is not at all inferior in size to the elm or the fir. And it has great numbers of branches, of great length and rather thorny; but its leaf is tender and green, and of a round shape. And it bears fruit twice a year, in spring and autumn. And the fruit is very sweet, and of the size of a phaulian olive, which it resembles both in its flesh and in its stone; but it is superior in the good flavour of its juice. And the fruit is eaten while still green; and when it has become dry they make it into paste, and eat it without either bruising it or softening it with water, but taking it in very nearly its natural state.

But those which were destined for the masters were all carefully selected, being of a wonderful size and beauty, and their colour was like amber. And some they dry and serve up as sweetmeats; and the wine made from the date is sweet, but it produces headache. And <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>, in his first book, speaking of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> says, — There are palm-trees there growing over the whole plain, most of them being very fruitful; and they make bread, and wine, and honey of them. And they manage the tree in the same way as the fig-tree. For those palm-trees which they call the males they take, and bind their fruit to the other palm-trees which bear dates, in order that the insect which lives in the fruit of the male palm may get into the date and ripen it, and so prevent the fruit of the date-bearing palm from being spoilt. For the male palm has an insect in each of its fruits, as the wild fig has. And <a href=/people/160 target=_blank>Polybius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374221PMeg class=person long=22.1273 lat=37.4124>Megalopolis</a>, who speaks with the authority of an eye-witness, gives very nearly the same account of the lotus, as it is called, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, that <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> here gives of the palm-tree; for he speaks thus of it: And the lotus is a tree of no great size, but rough and thorny, and its leaf is green like that of the rhamnus, but a little thicker and broader. And the fruit at first resembles both in colour and size the berries of the white myrtle when full grown; but as it increases in size it becomes of a scarlet colour, and in size about equal to the round olives; and it has an exceedingly small stone. But when it is ripe they gather it. And some they store for the use of the servants, bruising it and mixing it with groats, and packing it into vessels. And that which is preserved for freemen is treated in the same way, only that the stones are taken out, and then they pack that fruit also in jars, and eat it when they please. And it is a food very like the fig, and also like the palm-date, but superior in fragrance. And when it is moistened and pounded with water, a wine is made of it, very sweet and enjoyable to the taste, and like fine mead; and they drink it without water; but it will not keep more than ten days, on which account they only make it in small quantities as they want it. They also make vinegar of the same fruit. </p>                        </div>

And that the word σταφυλὴ is used by <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> is known to every one. But <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, in the eighth book of his Laws, uses both βότρυς and σταφυλὴ, where he says — Whoever tastes wild fruit, whether it be grapes (βοτρύων) or figs, before the time of the vintage arrives, which falls at the time of the rising of <a href=/people/632 target=_blank>Arcturus</a>, whether it be on his own farm, or on any one else's land, shall be fined fifty sacred drachmas to be paid to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a>, if he plucked them off his own land; but a mina if he gather them on a neighbour's estate; but if he take them from any other place, two-thirds of a mina. But whoever chooses to gather the grapes (τὴν σταφυλὴν), which are now called the noble grapes, or the figs called the noble figs, if he gather them from his own trees, let him gather them as he pleases, and when he pleases; but if he gathers them from the trees of any one else without having obtained the leave of the owner, then, in accordance with the law which forbids any one to move what he has not placed, he shall be invariably punished. These are the words of the divine <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>; but I ask now what is this noble grape (γενναῖα), and this noble fig that he speaks of? And you may all consider this point while I am discussing the other dishes which are on the table. And Masurius said — But let us not postpone this till tomorrow, Still less till the day after. When the philosopher says γενναῖα, he means εὐγενῆ,, generous, as <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a> also uses the word — Come hither, you are generous (γενναῖος); or, perhaps, he means ἐπιγεγενημένα; that is to say, grafted. For <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> speaks of grafted pears, and calls them ἐπεμβολάδες. And <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, in his speech in defence of <a href=/people/231 target=_blank>Ctesiphon</a>, has the sentence, gathering figs, and grapes (βότρυς), and olives. And <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, in his (Economics, says, that grapes (τὰς σταφυλὰς) are ripened by the sun. And our ancestors also have been acquainted with the practice of steeping grapes in wine. Accordingly <a href=/people/12468 target=_blank>Eubulus</a>, in his Catacollomenos, says — But take these grapes (βότρυς), and in neat wine pound them. And pour upon them many cups of water. Then make him eat them when well steep'd in wine. And the poet, who is the author of the <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Chiron</a>, which is generally attributed to <a href=/people/749 target=_blank>Pherecrates</a>, says — Almonds and apples, and the arbutus first, And myrtle-berries, pastry, too, and grapes Well steep'd in wine; and marrow.

Now the word περιστέριον (pigeon), may be found used by <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> in his Concubine, where he says — He waits a little while, and then runs up And says — I've bought some pigeons (περιστέρια) for you. And so <a href=/people/474 target=_blank>Nicostratus</a>, in his Delicate Woman, says — These are the things I want, — a little bird, And then a pigeon (περιστέριον) and a paunch.

And <a href=/people/456 target=_blank>Phrynichus</a>, in his Tragedians, says — Bring him a pigeon (περιστέριον) for a threepenny piece. Now with respect to the pheasant, <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> the king, in the twelfth book of his Memorabilia, speaking of the palace which there is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, and of the animals which are kept in it, says, They have also pheasants, which they call τέταροι, which they not only used to send for from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a>, but they also used to put the eggs under broody hens, by which means they raised a number, so as to have enough for food; for they call it very excellent eating. Now this is the expression of a most magnificent monarch, who confesses that he himself has never tasted a pheasant, but who used to keep these birds as a sort of treasure. But if he had ever seen such a sight as this, when, in addition to all those which have been already eaten, a pheasant is also placed before each individual, he would have added another book to the existing twenty-four of that celebrated history, which he calls his Memorabilia. And <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> or <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, in his Commentaries, says, In pheasants, the male is not only as much superior to the female as is usually the case, but he is so in an infinitely greater degree. </p>                        </div>

And the ground where they are bred is marshy. And this bird is very devoid of affection towards its young, and wholly disregards its offspring, so that the priests are forced to take care of them. And it is about the size of a very fine fowl of the common poultry, its head is small in proportion to its body, having but few feathers, but on the top it has a fleshy crest, hard and round, sticking up above the head like a peg, and of a wooden colour. And over the jaws, instead of a beard, they have a long piece of flesh, beginning at the mouth, redder than that of the common poultry; but of that which exists in the common poultry on the top of the beak, which some people call the beard, they are wholly destitute; so that their beak is mutilated in this respect. But its beak is sharper and larger than that of the common fowl; its neck is black, thicker and shorter than that of common poultry. And its whole body is spotted all over, the general colour being black, studded in every part with thick white spots something larger than lentil seeds. And these spots are ring-shaped, in the middle of patches of a darker hue than the rest of the plumage: so that these patches present a variegated kind of appearance, the black part having a sort of white tinge, and the white seeming a good deal darkened. And their wings are all over variegated with white, in serrated, wavy lines, parallel to each other. And their legs are destitute of spurs like those of the common hen. And the females are very like the males, on which account the sex of the guinea-fowls is hard to distinguish.

For they argue that roasting is a kind of cookery which does less good to the meat, while boiling not only removes all its crudities, but has the power also of softening the hard parts, and of making all the rest digestible. And it makes the food more tender and wholesome, on which account they say also, that when meat has been once boiled, it ought not to be warmed up again by either roasting or boiling it; for ally second process removes the good done by the first dressing, as <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> tells us.

And when some one asked him the reason of his doing so, he said — In order that both the liberality of <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hiero</a> and my economy may be visible to every one.

For these men used to perform the duties of cooks and also of sacrificers of victims, as <a href=/people/5565 target=_blank>Clidemus</a> tells us, in the first book of his Protogony; and <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> uses the verb ῥέζω, as we use θύω; but he uses θύω as we do θυμιάω, for burning cakes and incense after supper.

And among the Romans, the Censors, — and that was the highest office in the whole state, — clad in a purple robe, and wearing crowns, used to strike down the victims with an axe. Nor is it a random assertion of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, when he represents the heralds as bringing in the victims, and whatever else had any bearing on the ratification of oaths, as this was a very ancient duty of theirs, and one which was especially a part of their office — Two heralds now, despatch'd to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, invite The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> monarch to the peaceful rite; and again — <a href=/people/5995 target=_blank>Talthybius</a> hastens to the fleet, to bring The <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a> for <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>, th' inviolable king.

Let the bird be killed by thrusting a knife into the head at the mouth; then let it be kept till the next day, like a partridge. And if you choose, you can leave it as it is, the wings on and with its body plucked. Then, having explained the way in which it is to be seasoned and boiled, he proceeds to say — Boil a fat hen of the common poultry kind, and some young cocks just beginning to crow, if you wish to make a dish fit to be eaten with your wine. Then taking some vegetables, put them in a dish, and place upon them some of the meat of the fowl, and serve it up. But in summer, instead of vinegar, put some unripe grapes into the sauce, just as they are picked from the vine; and when it is all boiled, then take it out before the stones fall from the grapes, and shred in some vegetables. And this is the most delicious ματτύης that there is. Now, that ματτύη, or ματτύης, really is a common name for all costly dishes is plain; and that the same name was also given to a banquet composed of dishes of this sort, we gather from what <a href=/people/638 target=_blank>Philemon</a> says in his Man carried off: — Put now a guard on me, while naked, and Amid my cups the ματτύης shall delight me. And in his Homicide he says — Let some one pour us now some wine to drink, And make some ματτύη quick. But <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, in his Pyraunus, has used the word in an obscure sense: — But when I found them all immersed in business, I cried, — Will no one give us now a ματτύη̣ as if he meant a feast here, though you might fairly refer the word merely to a single dish.

On which account, <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> the grammarian, when he was a very young man, was very anxious to be much with him.

Now by the term ἀποκοτταβίζοντες, one of the physicians who were present thought those people were meant, who, after the bath, for the sake of purging their stomach, drink a full draught of wine and then throw it up again; and he said that this was not an ancient custom, and that he was not aware of any ancient author who had alluded to this mode of purging. On which account <a href=/people/763 target=_blank>Erasistratus</a> of <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a>, in his treatise on Universal Medicine, reproves those who act in this way, pointing out that it is a practice very injurious to the eyes, and having a very astringent effect on the stomach. And <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> addressed him thus — Arise, <a href=/people/1010 target=_blank>Machaon</a>, great Charoneus calls.

But λατάγη means the drops which are left in the bottom after the cup is drained, and which the players used to throw with inverted hand into the κοτταβεῖον.

And <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a>, in his <a href=/people/623 target=_blank>Nemesis</a>, says — Now in the cottabus I challenge you, (As is my country's mode,) to aim your blows At the empty cruets; and he who sinks the most Shall, in my judgment, bear the palm of victory. And <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>, in his Feasters, says — I mean to erect a brazen figure, That is, a cottabeum, and myrtle-berries. And <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a>, in his <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a>, says — Now soft cloaks are thrown away, Every one clasps on his breastplate, And binds his greaves around his legs, No one for snow-white slippers cares; Now you may see the cottabus staff Thrown carelessly among the chaff; The manes hears no falling drops; And you the πλάστιγξ sad may see Thrown on the dunghill at the garden door. And <a href=/people/431 target=_blank>Achaeus</a>, in his <a href=/people/696 target=_blank>Linus</a>, speaking of the <a href=/people/185 target=_blank>Satyrs</a>, says — Throwing, and dropping, breaking, too, and naming (λέγοντες), O <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, the well-thrown drop of wine! And the poet uses λέγοντες here, because they used to utter the names of their sweethearts as they threw the cottabi on the saucers. On which account <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>, in his <a href=/people/684 target=_blank>Inachus</a>, called the drops which were thrown, sacred to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> — The golden-colour'd drop of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> Descends on all the houses. And <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, in his <a href=/people/3114 target=_blank>Pleisthenes</a>, says — And the loud noise o' the frequent cottabus Awakens melodies akin to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> In every house. And <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a> says — Many hard drinkers, lovers of <a href=/people/7156 target=_blank>Acontius</a>, Throw on the ground the wine-drops (λατάγας) from their cups. </p>                        </div>

You ask, then, why, if the garlands of men who have been crowned are pulled to pieces, they are said to be in love. Is it, since love takes away the strict regularity of manners in the case of lovers, that on this account they think the loss of a conspicuous ornament, a sort of beacon (as <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> says, in the first book of his Art of <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a>) and signal, that they to whom this has happened have lost the strict decorum of their manners? Or do men interpret this circumstance also by divination, as they do many other things? For the ornament of a crown, as there is nothing lasting in it, is a sort of emblem of a passion which does not endure, but assumes a specious appearance for a while: and such a passion is love. For no people are more careful to study appearance than those who are in love. Unless, perhaps, nature, as a sort of god, administering everything with justice and equity, thinks that lovers ought not to be crowned till they have subdued their love; that is to say, till, having prevailed upon the object of their love, they are released from their desire. And accordingly, the loss of their crown we make the token of their being still occupied in the fields of love. </p>                        </div>

Or is it because that cannot be loosed which has never been bound, but love is the chain of some who wear crowns, (for no one else who is bound is more anxious about being crowned than a lover,) that men consider that the loosing of the garland is a sign of love, and therefore say that these men are in love? Or is it because very often lovers, when they have been crowned, often out of agitation as it should seem, allow their crowns to fall to pieces, and so we argue backwards, and attribute this passion to all whom we see in this predicament; thinking that their crown never would have come to pieces, if they had not been in love? Or is it because these loosings happen only in the case of men bound or men in love; and so, men thinking that the loosing of the garland is the loosing also of those who are bound, consider that such men are in love?

For thinking the beloved object the statue, as it were, of <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a>, and his house the temple of <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a>, they, under this idea, adorn with crowns the vestibules of those whom they love. And for the same reason some people even sacrifice at the doors of those whom they love. Or shall we rather say that people who fancy that they are deprived, or who really have been deprived of the ornament of their soul, consecrate to those who have deprived them of it, the ornament also of their body, being bewildered by their passion, and despoiling themselves in order to do so?

Then when a third comes in they divide the whole sixty, so that each of them may have twenty. Again, they divide them again in like manner at the entrance of a fourth guest, so that each has fifteen; and when a fifth comes in they all have twelve a-piece.

But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a> hearing of this, and being indignant at it, persuaded the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenians</a> by a promise of money, to employ <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>piratical</a> force and to carry off the statue, — the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a> believing that if this were done <a href=/people/4030 target=_blank>Admete</a> would be treated with every possible severity by the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>. Accordingly the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenians</a> came to the Heran anchorage, and having disembarked, immediately applied themselves to the performance of their undertaking. And as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269SHer class=place long=26.8857 lat=37.6718>temple</a> was at that time without any doors, they quickly carried off the statue, and bore it down to the seaside, and put it on board their vessel. And when they had loosed their cables and weighed anchor, they rowed as fast as they could, but were unable to make any progress. And then, thinking that this was owing to divine interposition, they took the statue out of the ship again and put it on the shore; and having made some sacrificial cakes, and offered them to it, they departed in great fear. But when, the first thing in the morning, <a href=/people/4030 target=_blank>Admete</a> gave notice that the statue had disappeared, and a search was made for it, those who were seeking it found it on the shore. And they, like <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=demonym long=28.7 lat=37.01>Carian</a> barbarians, as they were, thinking that the statue had run away of its own accord, bound it to a fence made of osiers, and took all the longest branches on each side and twined them round the body of the statue, so as to envelop it all round. But <a href=/people/4030 target=_blank>Admete</a> released the statue from these bonds, and purified it, and placed it again on its pedestal, as it had stood before. And on this account once every year, since that time, the statue is carried down to the shore and hidden, and cakes are offered to it: and the festival is called τονεὺς, because it happened that the statue was bound tightly (συντόνως) by those who made the first search for it. </p>                        </div>

And he ordered them also to abandon the use of every other kind of garland except that made of the bay-tree: and that tree he said he gave as a gift to those alone who are employed in the service of the goddess.

And this poet was a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>, and a man who in numberless passages shows his fondness for mentioning points connected with the history of his country. And these are his words: — I am not oft, O Philotherus, fond Of feasting in the city, but prefer The country, where the open breeze of zephyr Freshens my heart; a simple bed Beneath my body is enough for me, Made of the branches of the native willow (πρόμαλος), And osier (λύγος), ancient garland of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=ethnic long=28.7 lat=37.01>Carians</a>, — But let good wine be brought, and the sweet lyre, Chief ornament of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402225RPie class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.2>Pierian</a> sisters, That we may drink our fill, and sing the praise Of the all-glorious bride of mighty <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>, The great protecting queen of this our isle. But in these lines <a href=/people/4230 target=_blank>Nicaenetus</a> speaks ambiguously, for it is not quite plain whether he means that the osier is to make his bed or his garland; though afterwards, when he calls it the ancient garland of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=ethnic long=28.7 lat=37.01>Carians</a>, he alludes clearly enough to what we are now discussing.

But <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>, who is always charging every one else with thefts, took this solution of mine, and claimed it as his own, and published an essay, to which he gave this title, Concerning the Osier Garland mentioned by <a href=/people/543 target=_blank>Anacreon</a>. And a copy of this essay we lately found at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> in the possession of the antiquary <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>. And this compiler <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a> behaved in the same way to our excellent friend Adrantus. For after he had published a treatise in five books, Concerning those Matters in <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> in his books on Manners, which are open to any Dispute, either as to their Facts, or the Style in which they are mentioned; and had added a sixth book Concerning the Disputable Points in the Nicomachean Ethics of <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>; and in these books had entered into a long dissertation on the mention of <a href=/people/3498 target=_blank>Plexippus</a> by <a href=/people/4852 target=_blank>Antipho</a> the tragic poet, and had also said a good deal about <a href=/people/4852 target=_blank>Antipho</a> himself; <a href=/people/355 target=_blank>Hephaestion</a>, I say, appropriated all these books to himself, and wrote another book, Concerning the Mention of <a href=/people/4852 target=_blank>Antipho</a> in the Memorabilia of <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, not having added a single discovery or original observation of his own, any more than he had in the discussion on the Osier Garland. For the only thing he said that was new, was that <a href=/people/724 target=_blank>Phylarchus</a>, in the seventh book of his Histories, mentioned this story about the osier, and knew nothing of the passage of <a href=/people/4230 target=_blank>Nicaenetus</a>, nor of that of <a href=/people/543 target=_blank>Anacreon</a>; and he showed that he differed in some respects from the account that had been given by <a href=/people/2897 target=_blank>Menodotus</a>. But one may explain this fact of the osier garlands more simply, by saying that Megisthes wore a garland of osier because there was a great quantity of those trees in the place where he was feasting; and therefore he used it to bind his temples. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> at the festival of the Promachia, wear garlands of reeds, as <a href=/people/889 target=_blank>Sosibius</a> tells us in his treatise on the Sacrificial Festivals at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemon</a>, where he writes thus: On this festival the natives of the country all wear garlands of reeds, or tiaras, but the boys who have been brought up in the public school follow without any garland at all. </p>                        </div>

But men in later times added also some ornaments to their temples, which had a kind of reference to their employment of drinking, and so they invented garlands in the present fashion. But it is more reasonable to suppose that it was because the head is the seat of all sensation that men wore crowns upon it, than that they did so because it was desirable to have their temples shaded and bound as a remedy against the headaches produced by wine. They also wore garlands over their foreheads, as the sweet <a href=/people/543 target=_blank>Anacreon</a> says — And placing on our brows fresh parsley crowns, Let's honour <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a> with a jovial feast. They also wore garlands on their breasts, and anointed them with perfume, because that is the seat of the heart. And they call the garlands which they put round their necks ὑποθυμιάδες, as <a href=/people/529 target=_blank>Alcaeus</a> does in these lines — Let every one twine round his neck Wreathed ὑποθυμιάδες of anise. And <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a> says — And wreathed ὑποθυμιάδες In numbers round their tender throats. And <a href=/people/543 target=_blank>Anacreon</a> says — They placed upon their bosoms lotus flowers Entwined in fragrant ὑποθυμιάδες. <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a> also, in his <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a> Unbound, says distinctly — And therefore we, in honour of <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a>, Place garlands on our heads, a poor atonement For the sad chains with which his limbs were bound. And again, in the play entitled the <a href=/people/974 target=_blank>Sphinx</a>, he says- Give the stranger a στέφανος (garland), the ancient στέφος, — This is the best of chains, as we may judge From great <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a>. But <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a> gives a more simple reason for our wearing garlands, speaking as follows — But place those garlands on thy lovely hair, Twining the tender sprouts of anise green With skilful hand; for offerings of flowers Are pleasing to the gods, who hate all those Who come before them with uncrowned heads. In which lines she enjoins all who offer sacrifice to wear garlands on their heads, as they are beautiful things, and acceptable to the Gods. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> also, in his Banquet, says, We never offer any mutilated gift to the Gods, but only such as are perfect and entire; and what is full is entire, and crowning anything indicates filling it in some sort. So <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> says — The slaves the goblets crown'd with rosy wine. And in another place he says — But God plain forms with eloquence does crown. That is to say, eloquence in speaking makes up in the case of some men for their personal ugliness. Now this is what the στέφανος seems intended to do, on which account, in times of mourning, we do exactly the contrary. For wishing to testify our sympathy for the dead, we mutilate ourselves by cutting our hair, and by putting aside our garlands. </p>                        </div>

And once, when some men were drinking on the sea-shore, a violent shower came on, and broke up the party, and filled the goblet, which had a little wine left in it, with water. But when it became fine again, the men returned to the same spot, and tasting the new mixture, found that their enjoyment was now not only exquisite, but free from any subsequent pain. And on this account, the Greeks invoke the good Deity at the cup of unmixed wine, which is served round to them at dinner, paying honour to the Deity who invented wine; and that was <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a>. But when the first cup of mixed wine is handed round after dinner, they then invoke <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the <a href=/people/1517 target=_blank>Saviour</a>, thinking him the cause of this mixture of wine which is so unattended with pain, as being the author of rain. Now, those who suffered in their heads after drinking, certainly stood in need of some remedy; and so the binding their heads was what most readily occurred to them, as Nature herself led them to this remedy. For a certain man having a headache, as <a href=/people/2091 target=_blank>Andreas</a> says, pressed his head, and found relief, and so invented a ligature as a remedy for headache. Accordingly, men using these ligatures as assistants in drinking, used to bind their heads with whatever came in their way. And first of all, they took garlands of ivy, which offered itself, as it were, of its own accord, and was very plentiful, and grew everywhere, and was pleasant to look upon, shading the forehead with its green leaves and bunches of berries, and bearing a good deal of tension, so as to admit of being bound tight across the brow, and imparting also a certain degree of coolness without any stupefying smell accompanying it. And it seems to me that this is the reason why men have agreed to consider the garland of ivy sacred to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a>, implying by this that the inventor of wine is also the defender of men from all the inconveniences which arise from the use of it. And from thence, regarding chiefly pleasure, and considering utility and the comfort of the relief from the effects of drunkenness of less importance, they were influenced chiefly by what was agreeable to the sight or to the smell. And therefore they adopted crowns of myrtle, which has exciting properties, and which also represses any rising of the fumes of wine; and garlands of roses, which to a certain extent relieve headache, and also impart some degree of coolness; and garlands also of bay leaves, which they think are not wholly unconnected with drinking parties. But garlands of white lilies, which have an effect on, the head, and wreaths of amaracus, or of any other flower or herb which has any tendency to produce heaviness or torpid feelings in the head, must be avoided. And <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a>, in his treatise on Perfumes and Garlands, has said the same thing in the very same words. And this, my friends, is enough to say on this subject. </p>                        </div>

And having sacrificed to the goddess, and having consecrated the image to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>, and invited all his relations and most intimate friends to a banquet in the temple, he gave every one of them a garland of these branches of myrtle, to which garlands he then gave the name of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/309306UNau class=demonym long=30.5925 lat=30.8972>Naucratite</a>.

But I do not know what pleasure or advantage there could be in having a crown made of biblus with roses, unless people who are enamoured of such a wreath as this should also take a fancy to wear crowns of garlic and roses together. But I know that a great many people say that the garland made of the sampsychon or amaracus is the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/309306UNau class=demonym long=30.5925 lat=30.8972>Naucratite</a> garland; and this plant is very plentiful in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, but the myrtle in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> is superior in sweetness to that which is found in any other country, as <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> relates in another place. </p>                        </div>

For who'd not wish to kiss the maid who bears it? And then in the subsequent lines he says — A. Perhaps you want some garlands. Will you have them Of ground thyme, or of myrtle, or of flowers Such as I show you here in bloom. B. I'll have These myrtle ones. You may sell all the others, But always keep the myrtle wreaths for me. </p>                        </div>

But he says the earliest blooming flower is the white violet; and about the same time that which is called the wild wallflower appears, and after them the narcissus and the lily; and of mountain flowers, that kind of anemone which is called the mountain anemone, and the head of the bulb-plant. For some people twine these flowers into garlands. And next to these there comes the oenanthe and the purple violet. And of wild flowers, there are the helichryse, and that species of anemone called the meadow anemone, and the gladiolus, and the hyacinth.

And in his ninth book the same <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> says, if any one wears a garland made of the flower of the helichryse, he is praised if he sprinkle it with ointment.

And no man is ever anointed with perfume for the sake of men; and as to women, especially when they are brides, — as, for instance, the bride of this <a href=/people/1333 target=_blank>Niceratus</a> here, and the bride of <a href=/people/1472 target=_blank>Critobulus</a>, — how can they want perfumes in their husbands, when they themselves are redolent of it But the smell of the oil in the gymnasia, when it is present, is sweeter than perfume to women; and when it is absent, they long more for it. For if a slave and a freeman be anointed with perfume, they both smell alike in a moment; but those smells which are derived from free labours, require both virtuous habits and a good deal of time if they are to be agreeable and in character with a freeman.' And that admirable writer <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> says that perfumes (μύρα) derive their name from being prepared with great toil (μόρος) and useless labour.

And do you think that effeminacy without virtue has anything desirable in it? But even <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a>, a thorough woman, and a poetess into the bargain, was ashamed to separate honour from elegance; and speaks thus — But elegance I truly love; And this my love of life has brilliancy, And honour, too, attached to it: making it evident to everybody that the desire of life that she confessed had respectability and honour in it; and these things especially belong to virtue. But <a href=/people/1481 target=_blank>Parrhasius</a> the painter, although he was a man beyond all measure arrogant about his art, and though he got the credit of a liberal profession by some mere pencils and pallets, still in words set up a claim to virtue, and put this inscription on all his works that are at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361281PLin class=place long=28.0882 lat=36.0913>Lindus</a>: — This is <a href=/people/1481 target=_blank>Parrhasius</a>' the painter's work, A most luxurious (ἁβροδίαιτος) and virtuous man. And a wit being indignant at this, because, I suppose, he seemed to be a disgrace to the delicacy and beauty of virtue, having perverted the gifts which fortune had bestowed upon him to luxury, proposed to change the inscription into ῥαβδοδίαιτος ἀνήρ: Still, said he, the man must be endured, since he says that he honours virtue.

And that most valiant, and indeed warlike poet, <a href=/people/529 target=_blank>Alcaeus</a>, says — He shed a sweet perfume all o'er my breast. And the wise <a href=/people/543 target=_blank>Anacreon</a> says somewhere — Why fly away, now that you've well anointed Your breast, more hollow than a flute, with unguents? for he recommends anointing the breast with unguent, as being the seat of the heart, and considering it an admitted point that that is soothed with fragrant smells. And the ancients used to act thus, not only because scents do of their own nature ascend upwards from the breast to the seat of smelling, but also because they thought that the soul had its abode in the heart; as <a href=/people/2925 target=_blank>Praxagoras</a>, and <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> the physician taught; and <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, too, says — He struck his breast, and thus reproved his heart. And again he says — His heart within his breast did rage. And in the <a href=/people/12111 target=_blank>Iliad</a> he says — But <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>'s heart within his bosom shook. Hom. Iliad, vii. 216. And this they consider a proof that the most important portion of the soul is situated in the heart; for it is as evident as possible that the heart quivers when under the agitation of fear. And <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, says — Scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain, And scarce my heart support its load of pain; With fears distracted, with no fix'd design, And all my people's miseries are mine. Iliad, x. 96. And <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> has represented women released from fear as saying — Now Fear's dark daughter does no more exult Within my heart. This is not from any extant play. But <a href=/people/796 target=_blank>Anaxandrides</a> makes a man who is struggling with fear say — O my wretched heart! How you alone of all my limbs or senses Rejoice in evil; for you leap and dance The moment that you see your lord alarm'd. And <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> says, that the great Architect of the universe has placed the lungs close to the heart, by nature soft and destitute of blood, and having cavities penetrable like sponge, that so the heart, when it quivers, from fear of adversity or disaster, may vibrate against a soft and yielding substance. But the garlands with which men bind their bosoms are called ὑποθυμιάδες by the poets, from the exhalations (ἀναθυμίασις of the flowers, and not because the soul (ψυχὴ) is called θυμὸς, as some people think. </p>                        </div>

For <a href=/people/1710 target=_blank>Myronides</a> says, in his treatise on Unguents and Garlands, that the fashion of anointing the head at banquets arose from this: — that those men whose heads are naturally dry, find the humours which are engendered by what they eat, rise up into their heads; and on this account, as their bodies are inflamed by fevers, they bedew their heads with lotions, so as to prevent the neighbouring humours from rising into a part which is dry, and which also has a considerable vacuum in it. And so at their banquets, having consideration for this fact, and being afraid of the strength of the wine rising into their heads, men have introduced the fashion of anointing their heads, and by these means the wine, they think, will have less effect upon then, if they make their head thoroughly wet first. And as men are never content with what is merely useful, but are always desirous to add to that whatever tends to pleasure and enjoyment; in that way they have been led to adopt the use of unguents. We ought, therefore, my good cynic <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a>, to use at banquets those unguents which have the least tendency to produce heaviness, and to employ those which have astringent or cooling properties very sparingly. But <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, that man of most varied learning, raises the question, Why men who use unguents are more grey than others? Is it because unguents have drying properties by reason of the spices used in their composition, so that they who use them become dry, and the dryness produces greyness? For whether greyness arises from a drying of the hair, or from a want of natural heat, at all events dryness has a withering effect. And it is on this account too that the use of hats makes men grey more quickly; for by them the moisture which ought to nourish the hair is taken away. </p>                        </div>

And since the discussion has brought us to this point, I will add A verse to <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a>, as the bard of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363230PKyt class=place long=23.0291 lat=36.2295>Cythera</a> says, telling you that <a href=/people/983 target=_blank>Janus</a>, who is worshipped as a great god by us, and whom we call <a href=/people/983 target=_blank>Janus</a> Pater, was the original inventor of garlands.

And <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philochorus</a>, in the second book of his <a href=/people/940 target=_blank>Atthis</a>, says — And a law was made at that time, that after the solid food is removed, a taste of the unmixed wine should be served round as a sort of sample of the power of the <a href=/people/2402 target=_blank>Good Deity</a>, but that all the rest of the wine should be previously mixed; on which account the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> had the name given them of Nurses of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a>. And that when the pledge-cup to the <a href=/people/2402 target=_blank>Good Deity</a> was handed round, it was customary to remove the tables, is made plain by the wicked action of <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> the tyrant of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. For there was a table of gold placed before the statue of <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Aesculapius</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a>; and so <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, standing before it, and drinking a pledge-cup to the <a href=/people/2402 target=_blank>Good Deity</a>, ordered the table to be removed. But among the Greeks, those who sacrifice to the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, as <a href=/people/724 target=_blank>Phylarchus</a> tells us in the twelfth book of his History, make their libations of honey, as they never bring wine to the altars of the gods; saying that it is proper that the god who keeps the whole universe in order, and regulates everything, and is always going round and superintending the whole, should in no respect be connected with drunkenness. </p>                        </div>

Now they are called scolia, not because of the character of the verse in which they are written, as if it were σκολιὸς (crooked); for men call also those poems written in a laxer kind of metre σκολιά. But, as there are three kinds of songs (as <a href=/people/2210 target=_blank>Artemo</a> of <a href=/people/631 target=_blank>Cassandra</a> says in the second book of his treatise on the Use of Books), one or other of which comprehends everything which is sung at banquets; the first kind is that which it was usual for the whole party to sing; the second is that which the whole party indeed sang, not, however, together, but going round according to some kind of succession; the third is that which is ranked lowest of all, which was not sung by all the guests, but only by those who seemed to understand what was to be done, wherever they might happen to be sitting; on which account, as having some irregularity in it beyond what the other kinds had, in not being sung by all the guests, either together or in any definite kind of succession, but just as it might happen, it was called σκολιόν. And songs of this kind were sung when the ordinary songs, and those in which every one was bound to join, had come to an end. For then they invited all the more intelligent of the guests to sing some song worth listening to. And what they thought worth listening to were such songs as contained some exhortations and sentiments which seemed useful for the purposes of life. </p>                        </div>

And, in the second edition of the Niobus, having already used the word λυχνοῦχος, he writes — Alas, unhappy man! my λύχνιον's lost; after which, he adds — And, in his play called The Dramas, he calls the same thing λυχνίδιον, in the following lines — But you all lie Fast as a candle in a candlestick (λυχνίδιον). <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> also, in his Long Night, says — The undertakers sure will have λυχνοῦχοι. And <a href=/people/749 target=_blank>Pherecrates</a>, in his Slave Teacher, writes — Make haste and go, for now the night descends, And bring a lantern (λυχνοῦχον) with a candle furnish'd. <a href=/people/12515 target=_blank>Alexis</a> too, in his Forbidden Thing, says — So taking out the candle from the lantern (λύχνιον), He very nearly set himself on fire, Carrying the light beneath his arm much nearer His clothes than any need at all required. And <a href=/people/1093 target=_blank>Eumelus</a>, in his Murdered Man. . . . having said first — A. Take now a pitchfork and a lantern (λυχνοῦχον), adds — B.

And when the <a href=/people/826 target=_blank>Python</a> attacked them, <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a>, holding one of her children in her arms, got upon the stone which even now lies at the foot of the brazen statue of <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a>, which is dedicated as a representation of what then took place near the Plane-tree at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, and cried out ῞ιε, παῖ; (and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> happened to have his bow in hand;) and this is the same as if she had said ῎αφιε, ῞ιε, παῖ, or βάλε, παῖ, Shoot, boy. And from this day ῞ιε, παῖ and ῞ιε, παιὼν arose. But some people, slightly altering the word, use it as a sort of proverbial exclamation to avert evils, and say ἰὴ παιών, instead of ῞ιε, παῖ. And many also, when they have completed any undertaking, say, as a sort of proverb, ἰὴπαιὼν; but since it is an expression that is familiar to us it is forgotten that it is a proverb, and they who use it are not aware that they are uttering a proverb. But as for what <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=person long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> says, that is clearly a mistake, That the god himself, while offering a libation, thrice cried out ἵη παιὰν, ἵη παιών. From a belief in which statement he refers the trimeter verse, as it is called to the god, saying that each of these metres belongs to the god; because when the first two syllables are made long, ἵη παιὰν, it becomes a heroic verse, but when they are pronounced short it is an iambic, and thus it is plain that we must attribute the iambic to him. And as the rest are short, if any one makes the last two syllables of the verse long, that makes a <a href=/people/9518 target=_blank>Hipponactean</a> iambic. </p>                        </div>
