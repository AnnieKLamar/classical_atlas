I was filled with contempt for them, realized that to care for them was to lose all chance of what deserved care, and determined to grovel no more, but fix my gaze upon the great All. Here I found my first problem in what wise men call the universal order; I could not tell how it came into being, who made it, what was its beginning, or what its end. But my next step, which was the examination of details, landed me in yet worse perplexity. I found the stars dotted quite casually about the sky, and I wanted to know what the sun was. Especially the phenomena of the moon struck me as extraordinary, and quite passed my comprehension; there must be some mystery to account for those many phases, I conjectured. Nor could I feel any greater certainty about such things as the passage of lightning, the roll of thunder, the descent of rain and snow and hail. </p>                        </div>

So I selected the best of them, if solemnity of visage, pallor of complexion and length of beard are any criterion — for there could not be a moment's doubt of their soaring words and heaven-high thoughts — and in their hands I placed myself. For a considerable sum down, and more to be paid when they should have perfected me in wisdom, I was to be made an airy metaphysician and instructed in the order of the universe. Unfortunately, so far from dispelling my previous ignorance, they perplexed me more and more, with their daily drenches of beginnings and ends, atoms and voids, matters and forms. My greatest difficulty was that, though they differed among themselves, and all they said was full of inconsistency and contradiction, they expected me to believe them, each pulling me in his own direction. <br />FR: How absurd that wise men should quarrel about facts, and hold different opinions on the same things! </p>                        </div>

Yet again, some regard the divine nature as unsubstantial and without form, while others conceive it as a substance. Then they were not all disposed to recognize a Providence; some relieve the Gods of all care, as we relieve the superannuated of their civic duties; in fact, they treat them exactly like supernumeraries on the stage.

But I knew not where to turn for a theory that was not open to exception, nor combated by one as soon as propounded by another. I found myself in the state <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> has described; many a time I would vigorously start believing one of these gentlemen; But then came second thoughts. So in my distress I began to despair of ever getting any knowledge about these things on earth; the only possible escape from perplexity would be to take to myself wings and go up to Heaven. Partly the wish was father to the thought; but it was confirmed by <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>'s Fables, from which it appears that Heaven is accessible to <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a>, beetles, and sometimes <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a>. It was pretty clear that I could not possibly develop feathers of my own. But if I were to wear vulture's or <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>'s wings — the only kinds equal to a man's weight — I might perhaps succeed. I caught the birds, and effectually amputated the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>'s right, and the vulture's left wing. These I fastened together, attached them to my shoulders with broad thick straps, and provided grips for my hands near the end of the quill-feathers. Then I made experiments, first jumping up and helping the jump by flapping my hands, or imitating the way a goose raises itself without leaving the ground and combines running with flight.

But I have long intended to take counsel with you regarding the philosophers, and now, urged by <a href=/people/339 target=_blank>Selene</a> and her complaints, I have determined to defer the consideration of the question no longer. There is a class which has recently become conspicuous among men; they are idle, quarrelsome, vain, irritable, lickerish, silly, puffed up, arrogant, and, in Homeric phrase, vain cumberers of the earth. These men have divided themselves into bands, each dwelling in a separate word-maze of its own construction, and call themselves <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoics</a>, <a href=/people/10981 target=_blank>Epicureans</a>, <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetics</a>, and more farcical names yet. Then they take to themselves the holy name of <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a>, and with uplifted brows and flowing beards exhibit the deceitful semblance that hides immoral lives; their model is the tragic actor, from whom if you strip off the mask and the gold-spangled robe, there is nothing left but a paltry fellow hired for a few shillings to play a part.

But the head and front of their offending is this: they neither work themselves nor help others' work; they are useless drones, Of no avail in council nor in war; which notwithstanding, they censure others; they store up poisoned words, they con invectives, they heap their neighbours with reproaches; their highest honours are for him who shall be loudest and most overbearing and boldest in abuse. </p>                        </div>
