Accordingly I went into the palaistra of <a href=/people/2941 target=_blank>Taureas</a>, opposite the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SKNB class=place long=23.7293 lat=37.9676>shrine</a> of Basile, and there I came upon quite a number of people, some of whom were unknown to me, but most of whom I knew. And as soon as they saw me appear thus unexpectedly, they hailed me from a distance on every side; but <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a>, like the mad creature that he is, jumped up from their midst and ran to me, and grasping me by the hand — <br /><a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, he said, how did you survive the battle? (Shortly before we came away there had been a battle at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402233UPot class=place long=23.3278 lat=40.1937>Potidaea</a>, of which the people here had only just had news.) <br />In the state in which you see me, I replied. <br />It has been reported here, you know, said he, that the battle was very severe, and that many of our acquaintance have lost their lives in it. <br />Then the report, I replied, is pretty near the truth. <br />You were present, he asked, at the fighting? <br />I was present. <br />Then sit down here, he said, and give us a full account; for as yet we have had no clear report of it all. And with that he led me to a seat by <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a>, son of <a href=/people/2503 target=_blank>Callaeschrus</a>. So I sat down there and greeted <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a> and the rest, and gave them all the news from the battlefield, in answer to their various questions; each had his inquiry to make.</p>                        </div>

And just as he spoke these words, <a href=/people/1821 target=_blank>Charmides</a> entered. <br />Now I, my good friend, am no measurer: I am a mere “white line” in measuring beautiful people, for almost everyone who has just grown up appears beautiful to me. Nay and this time, moreover, the young man appeared to me [154c] a marvel of stature and beauty; and all the rest, to my thinking, were in love with him, such was their astonishment and confusion when he came in, and a number of other lovers were following in his train. On the part of men like us it was not so surprising; but when I came to observe the boys I noticed that none of them, not even the smallest, had eyes for anything else, but that [154d] they all gazed at him as if he were a statue. Then <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a> called me and said — How does the youth strike you, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>? Has he not a fine face? <br />Immensely so, I replied. <br />Yet if he would consent to strip, he said, you would think he had no face, he has such perfect beauty of form. <br />And these words of <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a> were repeated by the rest. Then, — By <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>! I said, what an irresistible person you make him out to be, if he has but one more thing — a little thing — besides. <br />What? said <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a>.</p>                        </div>

For it is of such a nature, <a href=/people/1821 target=_blank>Charmides</a>, that it cannot cure the head alone; I daresay you have yourself sometimes heard good doctors say, you know, when a patient comes to them with a pain in his eyes, that it is not possible for them to attempt a cure of his eyes alone, but that it is necessary to treat his head too at the same time, [156c] if he is to have his eyes in good order; and so again, that to expect ever to treat the head by itself, apart from the body as a whole, is utter folly. And on this principle they apply their regimen to the whole body, and attempt to treat and heal the part along with the whole; or have you not observed that this is what they say, and is done in fact? <br />Certainly I have, he said. <br />And you consider it well said, and accept the principle? <br />Most assuredly, he said.</p>                        </div>

I remembered just now what I once heard someone say, that temperance might be doing one's own business. I ask you, then, do you think he is right in saying this? <br />You rascal, I said, you have heard it from <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a> here, [161c] or some other of our wise men! <br />Seemingly, said <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a>, from some other; for indeed he did not from me. <br />But what does it matter, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, said <a href=/people/1821 target=_blank>Charmides</a>, from whom I heard it? <br />Not at all, I replied; for in any case we have not to consider who said it, but whether it is a true saying or no. <br />Now you speak rightly, he said. <br />Yes, on my word, I said: but I shall be surprised if we can find out how it stands; for it looks like a kind of riddle. <br />Why so? he asked. <br />Because, I replied, presumably the speaker of the words</p>                        </div>

For in its nature it is not like the other sciences, any more than any of them is like any other; whereas you are making your inquiry as though they were alike.

And so this is being temperate, or temperance, and knowing oneself — that one should know what one knows and what one does not know. Is that what you mean? <br />It is, he replied. <br />Once more then, I said, as the third to the <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a>, [167b] let us consider afresh, in the first place, whether such a thing as this is possible or not — to know that one knows, and does not know, what one knows and what one does not know; and secondly, if this is perfectly possible, what benefit we get by knowing it. <br />We must indeed consider, he said. <br />Come then, I said, <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a>, consider if you can show yourself any more resourceful than I am; for I am at a loss. Shall I explain to you in what way? <br />By all means, he replied. <br />Well, I said, what all this comes to, if your last statement was correct, is merely that there is one science which [167c] is precisely a science of itself and of the other sciences, and moreover is a science of the lack of science at the same time. <br />Certainly. <br />Then mark what a strange statement it is that we are attempting to make, my friend: for if you will consider it as applied to other cases, you will surely see — so I believe — its impossibility. <br />How so? In what cases? <br />In the following: ask yourself if you think there is a sort of vision which is not the vision of things that we see in the ordinary way, but a vision of itself and of the other sorts of vision, [167d] and of the lack of vision likewise; which, while being vision, sees no color, but only itself and the other sorts of vision. Do you think there is any such? <br />Upon my word, I do not. <br />And what do you say to a sort of hearing which hears not a single sound, but hears itself and the other sorts of hearing and lack of hearing? <br />I reject that also. <br />Then take all the senses together as a whole, and consider if you think there is any sense of the senses and of itself, but insensible of any of the things of which the other senses are sensible. <br />I do not.</p>                        </div>

So what we want, my friend, is some great man who will determine to our satisfaction in every respect whether there is nothing in nature so constituted as to have its own faculty applicable to itself, and not only some other object, or whether there are some such, and others not such; and whether, again, if there are things that have such relation to themselves, they include a science which we assert to be temperance. For my part, I distrust my own competence to determine these questions, and hence I am neither able to affirm whether it is possible [169b] that there should be a science of science, nor willing, let it be ever so true, to acknowledge this to be temperance until I have made out whether such a thing as this would benefit us or not. For, you see, I have a presentiment that temperance is something beneficial and good; and you, therefore, son of <a href=/people/2503 target=_blank>Callaeschrus</a> — since you lay it down that temperance is this very science of science, and moreover of the lack of science — shall first indicate the possibility, as I put it just now, and then the benefit added to the possibility, of such a thing; [169c] and perhaps you will then satisfy me that your definition of temperance is correct. <br />Now when <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a> heard this and saw me in a difficulty, he seemed to me — just as the sight of someone yawning opposite causes people to be affected in the same way — to be compelled by the sense of my difficulty to be caught in a difficulty himself. And so, since he usually contrived to distinguish himself, he was too ashamed to bring himself to admit to me before the company that he was unable to determine the questions [169d] with which I challenged him, and he made a very indistinct reply in order to conceal his difficulty. Then I, to forward the discussion, remarked: Well, if you prefer, <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a>, let us concede for the moment that there may possibly be a science of science : some other time we shall consider whether such is the fact or not. Come then; suppose it is perfectly possible: how is one helped thereby to know what one knows and does not know? For this, you are aware, we said was the meaning of self-knowledge and temperance, did we not? <br />Certainly, he said; and it must surely follow, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>; [169e] for if a man has a science which knows itself, he will be similar himself to that which he has. For instance, he who has swiftness will be swift, he who has beauty will be beautiful, and he who has knowledge will know; and when he has knowledge that is of itself, he will then, surely, be in the position of knowing himself. <br />I do not dispute, I said, that when a man has that which knows itself he will know himself; but having that, how is he bound to know what he knows and what he does not know?</p>                        </div>

And this I conclude, because I observe certain strange facts about temperance, if it is anything like that. For suppose, if you please, we concede that there may possibly be a science of science, and let us grant, and not withdraw, our original proposition that temperance is the knowledge of what one knows and does not know; [172d] granting all this, let us still more thoroughly inquire whether on these terms it will be of any profit to us. For our suggestion just now, that temperance of that sort, as our guide in ordering house or state, must be a great boon, was not, to my thinking, <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a>, a proper admission. <br />How so? he asked. <br />Because, I replied, we too tightly admitted that it would be a great boon to mankind if each of us should do what he knows, but should place what he did not know in the hands of others who had the knowledge.</p>                        </div>

And if you liked, we might concede that prophecy, as the knowledge of what is to be, and temperance directing her, will deter the charlatans, and establish the true prophets as our prognosticators. Thus equipped, the human race would indeed act and live [173d] according to knowledge, I grant you (for temperance, on the watch, would not suffer ignorance to foist herself in and take a hand in our labors), but that by acting according to knowledge we should do well and be happy — this is a point which as yet we are unable to make out, my dear <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a>. <br />But still, he replied, you will have some difficulty in finding any other fulfillment of welfare if you reject the rule of knowledge. <br />Then inform me further, I said, on one more little matter.

For, <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a>, if you choose to take away this science from the whole number of them, will medicine any the less give us health, or shoemaking give us shoes, or weaving provide clothes, or will the pilot's art any the less prevent the loss of life at sea, or the general's in war? <br />None the less, he replied. <br />But, my dear <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a>, to have any of these things well [174d] and beneficially done will be out of our reach if that science is lacking. <br />That is true. <br />And that science, it seems, is not temperance, but one whose business is to benefit us; for it is not a science of sciences and lack of sciences, but of good and evil: so that if this is beneficial, temperance must be something else to us. <br />But why, he asked, should not it be beneficial? For if temperance is above all a science of the sciences, [174e] and presides too over the other sciences, surely she will govern this science of the good, and so benefit us. <br />And give us health also? I asked: will she, and not medicine, do this? And will the several works of the other arts be hers, and not the particular works of each art?

For I cannot think that what is admitted to be the noblest thing in the world [175b] would have appeared to us useless if I had been of any use for making a good search. But now, you see, we are worsted every way, and cannot discover what thing it can possibly be to which the lawgiver gave this name, temperance. And yet we have conceded many points which were not deducible from our argument. For you know we conceded that there was a science of science, when the argument was against it and would not agree; and we further conceded that [175c] this science could know the works also of the other sciences, when the argument was against this too, in order to make out that the temperate man had a knowledge of what he knew and did not know, so as to know that he knew the one and did not know the other. And we made this concession in a really magnificent manner, without considering the impossibility of a man knowing, in some sort of way, things that he does not know at all; for our admission says that he knows that he does not know them; and yet, in my opinion, there can be nothing more irrational than this. Nevertheless, although it has found us so simple-minded [175d] and tractable, the inquiry remains quite incapable of discovering the truth, but has utterly flouted it by most impudently showing us the inutility of that which we had been ever so long assuming, by our joint admissions and fictions, to be the meaning of temperance. Now, so far as I am concerned, I am not particularly distressed: but for your sake, I said, <a href=/people/1821 target=_blank>Charmides</a>, I am seriously distressed to think that you, with your goodly form and [175e] most temperate soul besides, are to have no profit or advantage from the presence of that temperance in all your life. And I am still more distressed about the charm which I learnt from the Thracian, that I should have spent so much pains on a lesson which has had such a worthless effect. Now I really do not think that this can be the case, but rather that I am a poor hand at inquiring; for temperance I hold to be a great good, and you to be highly blessed,</p>                        </div>
