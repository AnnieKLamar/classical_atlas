[<i>possibly Polykritos of Kallion, strategos of the Aitolian league ca. 262 BCE?</i>] While in office he took a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384222ROzo class=person long=22.2 lat=38.4>Lokrian</a> woman as wife, lived with her for three nights, and departed from life on the fourth night. The woman remained at home as a widow. When the time for childbirth came she delivered a child with two sets of genitals, male and female, which differed amazingly in their nature. The upper portion of the genitals was hard and manly, whereas the part around the thighs was womanish and softer. Struck with astonishment the child's relatives took it to the agora where they called an assembly, summoned sacrificers and diviners and deliberated about the child. Of these, some declared that a breach would come about between the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=ethnic long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aitolians</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384222ROzo class=ethnic long=22.2 lat=38.4>Lokrians</a>, for the infant had been separated from its mother, who was a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384222ROzo class=person long=22.2 lat=38.4>Lokrian</a>, and its father, an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=person long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aitolian</a>. Others thought that they should take the child and the mother away to the countryside beyond the frontiers and burn them. <br />As they were deliberating, Polykritos, the man who had previously died, appeared in the assembly near the child and wearing black clothing. </p>                        </div>

I am here with you now for your benefit, having appealed to those who are master of things beneath the earth. And so I call on you now, since you are fellow citizens, not to be frightened or repulsed by the unexpected presence of a ghost. I beg all of you, praying by the salvation of each one of you, to hand over to me the child I begot, in order that no violence take place as a result of your reaching some other decision and that your hostility towards me not be the beginning of difficult and harsh troubles. For it is not permitted me to let the child be burnt by you, just because of the madness of the seers who have made proclamations to you. <br />'Now, I excuse you because as you behold so strange a sight you are at a loss as to what is the right course of action for you to take. If, moreover, you will obey me without fear, you will be released from your present fear as well as the impending catastrophe. But if you come to some other opinion, I fear that because of your distrust of me you will fall into an irremedial calamity. Now because of the goodwill I had when I was alive, I have also now in this my present unexpected appearance foretold what is beneficial to you. So I ask you not to put me off any longer but to deliberate correctly and, obeying what I have said, to give me the child in an auspicious manner. For it is not permitted me to linger long on account of those who rule beneath the earth.' </p>                        </div>

Now, some thought they should hand over the child and make atonement for both the prodigy and the supernatural being that was standing by, but most disagreed, saying that they ought not to deliberate rashly, since the matter was of great importance and the problem was not an ordinary one. <br />Seeing that they were not heeding him but instead were hindering his desire, he spoke again: 'At all events, citizens, if trouble befalls you on account of your irresolution, blame not me but the fate that thus leads you down the wrong path, a fate that, opposing me also, forces me to act unlawfully against my own child.' <br />The people had clustered together and were arguing about the portent when the ghost took hold of the child, forced back most of the men, hastily tore the child limb 10 from limb, and began to devour him.</p>                        </div>

It was not just a foot long but even greater than this measurement. The delegates showed it to <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> and asked him if he wished the hero to be brought to him. <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> devised a shrewd plan such that, while not depriving himself of a knowledge of its size, he avoided the sacrilege of the robbing of the dead. He summoned a certain geometer, <a href=/people/11027 target=_blank>Pulcher</a> by name, a man of some renown whom he respected for the man's skill, and bade him fashion a face in proportion to the size of the tooth. The geometer estimated how large the entire body as well as the face would be by means of the weight of the tooth, hastily made a construction, and brought it to the emperor. <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, saying that the sight of this was sufficient for him, sent the tooth back to where it had come from. </p>                        </div>
