Next, let us consider his sayings, seeing that the souls of other kings and potentates betray their conditions and inclinations by their expressions. <a href=/people/12218 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> the Aged, having heard a certain poet sing before him a short treatise concerning justice, said, Thou art a fool to mention justice to me, when thou seest me thundering down the cities belonging to other people about their ears. <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> the Tyrant was wont to say that children were to be cheated with dice, but men with oaths. Upon the monument of <a href=/people/630 target=_blank>Sardanapalus</a> this inscription is to be seen: All I did eat and drink, and all that lust To me vouchsafed, I have; all else is gone.

For we omit the swelling hyperboles of flattery which poets have inscribed under his images and statues, studying rather to extol the power of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> than his moderation and temperance; as, for example: The statue seems to look to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and say, Take thou <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a>; me let <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> obey! and that other: This is <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the son of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. But these, as I said, were only the flashes of poetic adulation magnifying his good success. Let us therefore come to such sentences as were really uttered by <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> himself, beginning first with the early blossoms of his childhood. It is well known that for swiftness in running he exceeded all that were of his years; for which reason some of his most familiar play-fellows would have persuaded him to show himself at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> games. He asked them whether there were any kings to contend with him.

We admire the abstinency of <a href=/people/365 target=_blank>Xenocrates</a> for refusing the gift of fifty talents which <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> sent him; but do we take no notice of the munificence of the giver? Or is the bountiful person not to be thought as much a contemner of money as he that refuses it? <a href=/people/365 target=_blank>Xenocrates</a> needed not riches, by reason of his philosophy; but <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> wanted wealth, by reason of the same philosophy, that he might be more liberal to such persons. . . . How often has <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> borne witness to this in the midst of a thousand dangers? It is true, we believe that it is in the power of all men to judge rightly of things; for nature guides us of herself to virtue and bravery. But herein philosophers excel all others, that they have by education acquired a fixed and solid judgment to encounter whatever dangers they meet with. </p>                        </div>
