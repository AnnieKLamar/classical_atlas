And the god declared that to such as these it is not allowed to have a part either in the ceremonial cup or in the cordial libation; his father's wrath, though unseen, bars him from the altar; no one receives him or lodges with him; and at last, despised by all, friendless, he perishes, shrivelled pitifully by a death that wastes him utterly away. </p>                        </div>

Likewise between heaven and earth lights hung high in the air draw near; and winged things and things that walk the earth can also tell of the stormy wrath of whirlwinds. <br />But who can tell of man's overweening spirit, and of the reckless passions of women hardened of soul, partners of the woes of mortals? Inordinate passion, overmastering the female, gains a fatal victory over the wedded unions of beasts and humans alike. <br />Let whoever is not flighty in his wits know this, when he has learned of the device of a lit brand contrived by <a href=/people/994 target=_blank>Thestius</a>' heartless daughter: she destroyed her own child by burning the charred brand of the same age as he when, coming from his mother's womb, he cried out, and it aged in pace with him through his life to the day decreed by fate. <br />And there is in legend another murderous virgin to be loathed, who ruined a loved one at the bidding of his foes, when, lured by <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a>' gift, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> necklace forged of gold, she with her <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>'s heart despoiled <a href=/people/563 target=_blank>Nisus</a> of his immortal lock as he drew breath in unsuspecting sleep. And <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> overtook him. <br />But since I have recalled tales of pitiless afflictions, it is the right time to tell of a marriage void of love, an abomination to the house, and the plots devised by a wife's cunning against her warrior lord, against her lord revered with reason by his foes. But I honor the hearths of homes not heated by passion's fires, and in woman a spirit that shrinks from audacious deeds. <br />Indeed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=demonym long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnian</a> holds first place among evils in story: it has long been told with groans as an abominable calamity. Men compare each new horror to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=demonym long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnian</a> troubles; and because of a woeful deed abhorred by the gods a race has disappeared, cast out in infamy from among mortals.

May aged Murder cease begetting offspring in our house! <br />And you who occupy the mighty, gorgeously built cavern, grant that the man's house may lift up its eyes again in joy, and that with glad eyes it may behold from under its veil of gloom the radiant light of freedom. <br />May <a href=/people/525 target=_blank>Maia</a>'s son, as he rightfully should, lend his aid, for no one can better sail a deed on a favoring course, when he would do so. But by his mysterious utterance he brings darkness over men's eyes by night, and by day he is no more clear at all. <br />And then at last with a loud voice we shall sing a song of the deliverance of our house, the song that women raise when the wind sits fair, and not the shrill strain of those who mourn: The ship goes well. This grows to profit for me, for me, and calamity holds off from those I love. <br />But may you with good courage, when the part of action comes, cry out loud the name Father when she exclaims Son, and accomplish the baneful but irreproachable deed. <br />Raise up <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a>' spirit within my breast. And for those dear to you below the earth, and for those above, exact satisfaction for their dire wrath by working bloody ruin in our house and obliterating the guilt of murder.

To lay this too upon our house would be a fearful burden when it is still festering and galled by the wound inflicted by an earlier murder. How can I believe this tale is the living truth?

The certainty of a messenger's report is nothing compared with one's own interrogation of the man himself. <br />AEGISTHUS: I wish to see the messenger and put him to the test again — whether he himself was present at the death or merely repeats from vague reports what he has heard.

My victory is an unenviable pollution. <br />CHORUS: No mortal being shall pass his life unscathed, free from all suffering to the end. Alas! Alas! One tribulation comes today, another tomorrow. <br />ORESTES: But since I would have you know, for I do not know how it will end: I think I am a charioteer driving my team far beyond the course. For my ungoverned wits are whirling me away overmastered, and at my heart fear wishes to sing and dance to a tune of wrath. But while I am still in my senses, I proclaim to those who hold me dear and declare that not without justice did I slay my mother, the unclean murderess of my father, and a thing loathed by the gods. <br />And for the spells that gave me the courage for this deed I count <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Loxias</a>, the prophet of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pytho</a>, my chief source. It was he who declared that, if I did this thing, I would be acquitted of wrongdoing. But if I refrained — I will not name the penalty; for no bowshot could reach such a height of anguish. </p>                        </div>
