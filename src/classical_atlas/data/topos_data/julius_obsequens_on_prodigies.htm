As he was entering <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> surrounded by a huge crowd, at the third hour under a clear calm sky the sun encircled him with the end of a rainbow such as it usually arches under clouds. At the games of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> Genetrix, which he offered on behalf of his colleague, all eyes were drawn at the 11th hour to a comet streaming in the north; because it appeared at the games of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>, it seemed best to dedicate it as an sign of the head of the deified <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a>. Although <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> suffered much because of the monstrous malice of the consul <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> he showed a noble persistence in resisting him. There were earthquakes in rapid succession. The docks and many other places were struck by lightning. A violent whirlwind broke the limbs and threw down a statue which M. Cicero had placed in front of the cella of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>, on the day before he went into exile in accordance with the plebiscite; with its shoulders, arms and head broken it portended dreadful things for Cicero himself. The bronze tablets from the temple of <a href=/people/7692 target=_blank>Fides</a> were torn off by a whirlwind. The doors of the temple of <a href=/people/243 target=_blank>Ops</a> were broken. Trees were uprooted and many roofs torn off. A torch in the sky seemed to move to the east. A star burned bright for seven days. Three suns shone, and around the lowest sun a crown similar to ears of grain in a circle gleamed out and afterwards when the sun had been reduced to one orb the light was dim for months. In the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCas class=place long=12.48563 lat=41.89172>temple</a> of <a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a> some letters from the names of the consuls <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> and <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> were shaken out, which indicated that both of them would be exiled from their homeland. The baying of a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> was heard during the night in front of his home, from these things especially as the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> was mutilated by the others it portended shameful infamy to <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>. At <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Hostia</a> a school of fish was left on dry land by the flow of the sea.

Prosperous events followed it. An equestrian statue of <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a> the consul fell down at the house of (<a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>?). A decorated <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, galloping, fell down in his sight. One of the people who had slipped in the blood of the victims gave him a palm spattered with gore as he was starting out. These were the dire portents that as soon as he began fighting against <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> he was mortally wounded. An appearance of arms and missiles seemed to be borne with a loud noise from the land to the sky. Legionary standards left by <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a> at the City praesidium were seen wrapped in <a href=/people/10968 target=_blank>spider</a> webs as if they had long sat there unused. Several things were hit by lightning. In the camp of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> at first light an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> sat on the peak of the praetorium above the lintel; whence, aroused by smaller circling birds it flew out of sight. A voice was heard at the oracle of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> saying madness of <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a> in winter, in summer no grain harvested. When <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s veterans demanded his consulate there was a terrible uproar in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. When <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was leading his army into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCMa class=place long=12.481 lat=41.905>Campus Martius</a> six vultures appeared. And when he was ascending the rostrum as consul again six vultures were seen as if they were giving a sign to <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> with the auspices for founding a new city. After the reconciliation between <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, and <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> there was a harsh proscription of leading citizens. </p>                        </div>

The dead <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> of a temple attendant was dragged away by a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>.

While these things were being expiated with sacrifices, three suns were seen in a circle at the third hour, and suddenly shrank into one sphere. When on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127LAlb class=place long=12.709 lat=41.7514>Alban</a> Mount they were sacrificing in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> rites, gore dripped from the upper arm and thumb of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>. The war was waged by <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> and <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> in the provinces by plundering the allies. It is noted as a prodigy that P. <a href=/people/1275 target=_blank>Titius</a> the praetor abrogated his colleague in office because of dissensions; and he died before the year was over. It was noted that no one who had withdrawn his colleague in office survived the year. They were the following: Lucius <a href=/people/514 target=_blank>Junius</a> <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> consul by <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> <a href=/people/7531 target=_blank>Collatinus</a>, Tib. <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a> by M. <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, Cn. <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a> by L. <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a>, C. <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a> the tribune of the plebs by C. <a href=/people/3883 target=_blank>Marullus</a>, <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>...

By order of the haruspices, the place was closed off by a wall. A huge flock of vultures and other birds whose food is slaughtered corpses flew over the army. A boy being carried in the procession of Victoria fell from the litter. At the lustration the lictor put the laurel on with the fasces reversed. While the soldiers of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> were going out to battle they encountered an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=demonym long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopian</a> at the gate, and he was killed by the soldiers. <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> and <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> died. </p>                        </div>
