We must now endeavour to show that each wind is accompanied by forces and other conditions in due and fixed relation to itself; and that such conditions in fact differentiate the winds one from another. <br />Now, the differences that exist involve, and consist of, such conditions as the following: — for instance, greater or less volume, cold, heat, or (in more general terms) storm or calm, wet weather or clear weather; and, again, their frequency or infrequency; their occurrence season by season, or not at all seasons; and whether they are continuous and uniform, or intermittent and variable. In a word, they involve every condition that arises in the heavens, the air, the earth, and the sea by reason of the blowing of the wind. Our enquiries in fact follow the same lines and concern the same matters as do the studies of animals and plants.</p>                        </div>

Take, for instance, the N. wind and the S. wind. They both are strong winds, and blow longer than any others; and this is because the greatest amount of air is compressed towards the North, and towards the South; those parts being to the right and the left of the path of the sun, from its rising to its setting; for here the air is expelled by the power of the sun; and so the air [there] has the greatest density, and the greatest amount of cloud. A great quantity of air being thus collected at each point, a greater and more continuous flow of air thence occurs with greater frequency; and from these causes, these winds derive volume, continuance and duration, and other such conditions.</p>                        </div>

Now, the less open the surrounding district is, so in proportion is the current less diffuse; while that which is borne through a narrow space and with more violence is colder; but that which is poured abroad into the wider space beyond becomes more moderate in its rate of motion. For which reason also the S. wind is colder there than it is with us; and even, as some say, colder than the N. wind. <br />But the change [in its temperature] makes itself more appreciable as the place is warm to begin with.</p>                        </div>

Whether the wind from either [of two opposite quarters] produces wet or clear weather, whether it is squally or steady, recurrent or continuous, uneven or even, or again its intensity in one case at its commencement, in another as it ceases, are matters which are more directly referable to the distance apart of the places [of origin and of observation]. For wherever any particular wind blows from, there it is accompanied by clear weather; but to whatever place it impels the air there it is accompanied by clouds and rain. This is the reason why the N. wind, and even more so the <a href=/people/12230 target=_blank>Etesians</a>, bring rain to those who live towards the South and the sunrising; while the S. wind, and generally speaking all winds which blow from that quarter, bring rain to those who live towards the North.</p>                        </div>

Wherever the clouds strike and take up a position, there also is a source of rainfall. For which reason, of several places close together, some are wet in the presence of some winds; others in the presence of others; rain however has been elsewhere spoken of at greater length. <br />It is from the same cause that the N. wind is strong immediately it begins to blow; while the S. wind is strong as it is leaving off; on which facts is founded the proverbial advice about sailing. For the former immediately as it were attacks those who dwell in the North; but the latter stands far aloof; but when volume has been gathered, then comes the rush from afar, although after a longer delay.

And the cause of this is, that by reason of its force it sets in motion a great quantity of air; but the congelation produced by it takes place before it can effect the propulsion of the air so set in motion, and the clouds remain fixed by reason of their weight; and so the force of the wind, rather than its low temperature, is passed on to the parts beyond, and further in advance; and produces the result we have mentioned. The S. wind on the other hand having substance to a less degree, and not congealing it, but propelling it, brings clear weather to those near its place of origin; but it is always more rainy beyond, and blows with force rather when ceasing, than when commencing, because it propels before it only little air at the beginning, but more as it advances; and the air, by being gathered together, becomes cloudy, and by condensation becomes moist. <br />Moreover, it makes a difference whether the active principle at the beginning be greater or less; for when that is small, the wind is accompanied by clear weather; and when it is great, it produces cloudy and wet weather; because [in the latter case] it compresses together a greater volume of air.</p>                        </div>

For the alternating wind is a sort of reflux of the wind, like the reflux of the water in tidal straits. For when it is gathered up and has acquired volume, it changes again to the contrary direction. These winds occur mostly in valleys, and where “off-shore” breezes blow. There is good reason for both these facts. For in valleys the air as it pours in will be collected; but in open places it is dispersed. Winds too from the land are naturally weak; so that they cannot force their way far. And the reflex action is in proportion to the duration and force with which the winds off the land blow; and it corresponds with them also as to the time of its occurrence, according as these winds blow later or earlier.</p>                        </div>

But that winds blow in Winter and in the morning from the East, and in Summer and in the afternoon from the West is to be explained on the following ground. When the sun attract-, ing the air can no longer control it, then the air is released and flows along; and so, as it sets, it leaves clouds behind, whence flow the W. winds; and whatever air it draws with it, becomes, to those whose live in the lower hemisphere, a morning wind; and conversely when it sets in the lower hemisphere, it causes W. winds there; but to those here, a morning wind from the air which follows on with it.</p>                        </div>

These results in fact happen under similar conditions to the inhabitants of each hemisphere, and the wind-current, just as the rain and other phenomena at the extremities of each area, arises according to circumstances; not indeed by any absolute law, but as a general rule. <br />The S. wind is accustomed to blow at the rising of Sirius, just like any other periodic event. And the reason is that the lower part of the atmosphere is heated by the presence of the sun; so that much vapour is produced. And these periodic S. winds would blow considerably, if they were not prevented by the <a href=/people/12230 target=_blank>Etesians</a> from so doing; but, as it is, the <a href=/people/12230 target=_blank>Etesians</a> prevent them.</p>                        </div>

And in the same way the S. wind is wont to saturate, and make rainy, any other wind that it conflicts with. <br />In some places also the S. wind seems to cause snow storms; as is the case in the neighbourhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>, whenever the N. wind has been so cold that it continues freezing the moisture brought up by the S. wind; at least it more frequently freezes than thaws.</p>                        </div>

Now, <a href=/people/297 target=_blank>Orion</a> rises at the beginning of Autumn and sets at the beginning of winter; so that as there is 110 established season for the time being, one in fact commencing and the other ending, the winds are of necessity uncertain and confused, because they stand on, as it were, debatable ground between the two seasons. And so it is that this constellation has acquired the reputation of being fierce, both when setting and when rising, by reason of the indefiniteness of the season; for it needs be that it should be disturbed and irregular.</p>                        </div>

For instance, with Southerly winds men find themselves more weary and incapable; and the reason is that, instead of a little, a great deal of moisture is produced, being melted out by the heat; and so instead of a light air, there is a heavy damp. Again power and strength reside in the joints; and these are relaxed by Southerly winds. For the lubricating matter in the joints when congealed prevents our moving ourselves; but when too fluid prevents our exerting ourselves. Northerly winds will produce a certain balance, so that we are stronger and can exert ourselves more.</p>                        </div>

But when these winds are accompanied by rain, the rain cools the system. <br />In the same way, whatever else affects the habits of our bodies depends on one or other of these conditions; and such things are very numerous, and are observed in numerous persons; but the causes of all are the same, or very nearly so.</p>                        </div>

For instance, in the manufacture of iron they say that they can heat it out further with a Southerly wind than with a Northerly; and the reason is that Northerly winds dry up and make hard, but Southerly winds moisten and soften; and everything is easier to work when it is softened, than when it has become somewhat hardened.

For otherwise it would have been dissolved by the air by reason of the warmth of its situation; while in Summer the sea is cold and so are the winds from the sea; and the land is warm; so that if a cloud is borne from the land seawards its formation must be due to some active principle more powerful than usual; for the cloud would have been dissolved, if the active principles had been weak.</p>                        </div>
