He was born in the city of Arca and he was the son of <a href=/people/2267 target=_blank>Varius</a>, the grandson of Varia, and the cousin of <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> himself. The name of Caesar had been bestowed on him by the senate previously, that is, after the death of <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>; 3 now he was given the name of Augustus, and it was further granted him by the senate that on the same day he should take the title of Father of his Country, the proconsular command, the tribunician power, and the privilege of making five proposals to the House. <br />4 Now lest this quick succession of honours may seem precipitate, I will set forth the reasons which moved the senate to grant and the Emperor to accept them. 5 For it befitted neither the senate's dignity to bestow all of them together, nor yet a good prince to seize upon so many honours at one time. 6 But the soldiers had now grown accustomed to appoint their own emperors, often in a disorderly fashion, and also to change them at will, sometimes alleging in their own defence that they had taken action only because they did not know that the senate had named a ruler. 7 For they had chosen as emperors <a href=/people/11051 target=_blank>Pescennius</a> <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a>, <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>, Avidius <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, and, in earlier years, Lucius <a href=/people/1489 target=_blank>Vindex</a> and Lucius <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a>; and they had chosen even <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a> too, after the senate had already named <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> as prince. And thus were sown the seeds of civil wars, in which it necessarily happened that soldiers enlisted to fight against a foreign foe fell at the hands of their brothers. </p>                        </div>

He had won great favour, too, from the fact that <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> had tried to slay him, but without success because of the resistance of the soldiers and the opposition of the senate. 5 All these considerations, however, would have availed him little, had he not shown himself worthy that the senate should honour him, that the soldiers should be eager for his preservation, and the voice of all good citizens name him their prince. </p>                        </div>

Not a single day, indeed, did he allow to pass in which he did not train himself for literature and for military service. 2 His teachers were: during his early childhood, <a href=/people/141 target=_blank>Valerius</a> <a href=/people/6382 target=_blank>Cordus</a>, Titus <a href=/people/1519 target=_blank>Veturius</a>, and <a href=/people/11042 target=_blank>Aurelius</a> <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a> (his father's freedman who afterwards wrote his life); 3 while he lived in his native town, the Greek grammarian, Nehon, the rhetorician <a href=/people/1678 target=_blank>Serapion</a>, and the philosopher Stilio; and when he was at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, the grammarian Scaurinus (the son of Scaurinus and a most famous teacher), and the rhetoricians <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> <a href=/people/12103 target=_blank>Frontinus</a>, <a href=/people/836 target=_blank>Baebius</a> <a href=/people/3204 target=_blank>Macrianus</a>, and <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> Granianus, whose exercises in rhetoric are in use today. In Latin literature, however, he was not very proficient, as is shown by the orations which he delivered in the senate, and also by the speeches which he made before the soldiers or the people. 4 And indeed he did not greatly value the power to speak in Latin, although he was very fond of men of letters, fearing them at the same time, lest they might write something harsh about him. 5 Indeed, it was his wish that those whom he found worthy of the privilege should be informed of all that he did, both officially and in his private life, and he even gave them information himself if they chanced to be absent at the time, begging them that if it were true, they should include it in their books. </p>                        </div>

But before I quote it, I will insert the acclamations of the senate, by which these names were decreed. 2 Extract from the City Gazette; On the day before the Nones of March, when the senate met in full session in the Senate-Chamber (that is, in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCon class=place long=12.48428 lat=41.89294>Temple of Concord</a>, a formally consecrated sanctuary), and when <a href=/people/11042 target=_blank>Aurelius</a> <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar Augustus</a> had been requested to proceed thither and, after at first refusing for the reason that he knew that action was to be taken with regard to his titles, had finally appeared before the senate, 3 the following acclamations were uttered: Augustus, free from all guilt, may the gods keep you! <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, our Emperor, may the gods keep you! The gods have given you to us, may the gods preserve you! The gods have rescued you from the hands of the foul man, may the gods preserve you forever! 4 You too have endured the foul tyrant, you too had reason to grieve that the filthy and foul one lived. The gods have cast him forth root and branch, and you have they saved. The infamous emperor has been duly condemned. 5 Happy are we in your rule, happy to is the state.

He was very often able to read thoughts and he had an exceptional memory for facts — though Acholius used to maintain that he was aided by a mnemonic device. 7 After he succeeded to the imperial power, while still a boy, he used to do everything in conjunction with his mother, so that she seemed to have an equal share in the rule, a woman greatly revered, but covetous and greedy for gold and silver. </p>                        </div>

Thereupon <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ordered him to be indicted, and when all the charges had been proved by witnesses, of whom some were present and saw what Turinus had received and others heard what he had promised, he issued instructions to bind him to a stake in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFNe class=place long=12.4874 lat=41.8937>Forum Transitorium</a>.

In short, lest it be too tedious to give an account of all that he ate, which has been done in great detail by Gargilius, a contemporary writer, everything was served to him in due measure and according to reason. 10 But he was inordinately fond of fruit and usually had it served to him as dessert; hence arose the witticism that <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had, not a second course, but a second meal. 11 He himself would consume the greatest amount of food and he would drink wine neither too sparingly nor yet in large quantities, but nevertheless in fair amounts. 12 He always drank pure cold water as well, but in summer he would add wine flavoured with essence of roses — the only one of <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a>'s various kinds of flavourings that he retained. </p>                        </div>

Then were listed in order all the halting-places, next the camping-stations, and next the places where provisions were to be found, for the whole length of the march as far as the boundaries of the barbarians' country. 3 From here on everything was kept secret and all took every precaution to keep the barbarians in ignorance of the plans of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. 4 It is certain, moreover, that he never practised any deception in anything that he announced publicly, for he declared that he would not allow the palace-officials to sell his plans, as had been done under <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a>, when everything was sold by the eunuchs — 5 a class of men who desire that all the palace-affairs should be kept secret, solely in order that they alone may seem to have knowledge of them and thus possess the means of obtaining influence or money. <br />6 Now since we happen to have made mention of his practice of announcing his plans publicly — whenever <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> desired to name any man governor of a province, or make him an officer in the army, or appoint him a procurator, that is to say, a revenue-officer, he always announced his name publicly and charged the people, in case anyone wished to bring an accusation against him, to prove it by irrefutable evidence, declaring that anyone who failed to prove his charge should suffer capital punishment. 7 For, he used to say, it was unjust that, when <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> and <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> observed this custom in announcing the names of those who were to be ordained priests, it should not be similarly observed in the case of governors of provinces, to whose keeping were committed the fortunes and lives of men. </p>                        </div>

But on his arrival he found that there also the legions were ready to mutiny, and accordingly he ordered them to be disbanded. 5 The Gallic temper, however, which is rough and surly and frequently a source of danger to emperors, would not brook his excessive strictness, which seemed all the greater after <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a>. 6 And finally, while he was in quarters with a few men in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>, or, according to some, in Gaul, in a village named Sicilia, some soldiers murdered him.

These writers, however, are wholly ignorant of the truth; and they say, besides, that he was not the cousin of <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a>. 5 But in order to follow my version they need only to read the historians of that time, particularly Acholius, who also wrote about <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s journeys. </p>                        </div>

And since they are nothing but purchased chattels and slaves, how, pray, can they have knowledge of the right? 4 And indeed, this was <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s own opinion too; for he used to say, I will not permit slaves purchased with money to sit in judgment on the lives of prefects and consuls and senators. </p>                        </div>
