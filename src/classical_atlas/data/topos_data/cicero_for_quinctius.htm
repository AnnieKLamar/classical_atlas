                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi001:1'><b>&sect; 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The two things which have the greatest influence in a state, — namely, the greatest interest, and eloquence, are both making against us at the present moment; and while I am awed by the one, O Caius <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a>, I am in fear of the other: — I am somewhat awed, apprehending that the eloquence of <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> may embarrass me in speaking; but I am in no slight fear lest the interest of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> may injure Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>. [2] And yet it would not seem so disastrous for us that these things should exist in the highest degree in the other party, if they existed also to a moderate extent in us; but the fact is, that I, who have neither sufficient experience nor much ability, am brought into comparison with a most eloquent advocate; and that Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, who has but small influence, no riches, and few friends, is contending with a most influential adversary. [3] And, moreover, we have this additional disadvantage, that Marcus <a href=/people/514 target=_blank>Junius</a>, who has several times pleaded this cause before you, O <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a>, a man practised in the conduct of other causes also, and much and frequently concerned in this particular one, is at this moment absent, being engaged on his new commission; and so they have had recourse to me, who, even if I had all other requisite qualifications in ever so high a degree, have certainly scarcely had time enough to be able to understand so important a business, having so many points of dispute involved in it [4] so that also, which has been used to be an assistance to me in other causes, is wanting to me in this one; for in proportion to my want of ability, have I endeavoured to make amends for that want by industry, and unless time and space be given to one, it cannot be seen how great his industry is. But the greater our disadvantages, O Caius <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a>, are, with so much the more favourable a disposition ought you, and those who are your colleagues in this trial, to listen to our words, that the truth, though weakened by many disadvantages, may be at last reestablished by the equity of such men as you. [5] But if you, being the judge, shall appear to be no protection to a desolate and helpless condition against power and influence; if before this tribunal the cause is found to depend on interest, not on truth; then indeed there is nothing any longer holy and uncontaminated in the state — no hope that the firmness and virtue of the judge may counterbalance the lowly condition of any one. But undoubtedly before you and your colleagues truth will prevail, or else, if it be driven from this place by power and influence, it will not be able to find any place where it can stand. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi001:2'><b>&sect; 2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not say this, O Caius <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a>, because I have any doubt of your own good faith and constancy, or because Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> ought not to have the greatest hopes from those whom you have called in as your assessors, being, as they are, among the most eminent men in the state. [6] What then? In the first place, the magnitude of the danger causes a man the greatest fear, because he is staking all his fortunes on one trial; and while he is thinking of this, the recollection of your power does not occur to his mind less frequently than that of your justice; because all men whose lives are in another's hand more frequently think of what he, in whose power and under whose dominion they are, can do, than of what he ought to do, — [7] Secondly, Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> has for his adversary, in name indeed, <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>, but in reality, the most eloquent, the most gallant, the most accomplished men of our state, who are defending <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> with one common zeal, and with all their power: if, indeed, defending means so to comply with the desire of another, that he may the more easily be able to overwhelm whomsoever he chooses by an unjust trial; [8] for what, O Caius <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a>, can be mentioned or spoken of more unjust or more unworthy than this, that I who am defending the liberties, the fame, and fortunes of another should be compelled to open the cause, especially when Quintus <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>, who in this trial fills the part of the accuser, is to speak against me; a man to whom nature has given the greatest possible fluency and energy in speaking? Matters are so managed, that I, who ought rather to ward off the darts of our adversary and to heal the wounds he has inflicted, am compelled to do so now, even when the adversary has cast no dart; and that that time is given to them to attack us when the power of avoiding their attacks is to be taken from us; and if in any particular they should (as they are well prepared to do) cast any false accusation like a poisoned arrow at us, there will be no opportunity for applying a remedy. [9] That has happened through the injustice and wrong-doing of the praetor; first, because, contrary to universal custom, he has chosen that the trial as to honour or infamy should take place before the one concerning the fact; secondly, because he has so arranged this very trial, that the defendant is compelled to plead his cause before he has heard a word of the accuser's; and this has been done because of the influence and power of those men who indulge the violence and covetousness of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> as eagerly as if their own property or honour were at stake, and who make experiment of their influence in such matters as this, in which the more weight they have through their virtue and nobility, the less they ought to make a parade of what influence they have. [10] Since Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, involved in and overwhelmed by such numerous and great difficulties, has taken refuge, O Caius <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a>, in your good faith, in your truth, in your compassion; when, up to this time , owing to the might of his adversaries, no equal law could be found for him, no equal liberty of pleading, no just magistrate, when, through the greatest injustice, everything was unfavourable and hostile to him; he now prays and entreats you, O Caius <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a>, and all of you who are present as assessors, to allow justice, which has been tossed about and agitated by many injuries, at length to find rest and a firm footing in this place. </p>                        </div>
                        <div class="text-right bottommargin-sm">

Caius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> was the brother of this Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>; in other respects a sufficiently prudent and attentive head of a family, but in one matter a little less wise, inasmuch as he formed a partnership with <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>, a respectable man, but one who had not been brought up so as to be acquainted with the rights of partnership, or with the duties of a head of an established family. Not that he was wanting in abilities; for <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> as a buffoon was never considered without wit, nor as a crier was he reckoned unmannerly. What followed? As nature had given him nothing better than a voice, and his father had left him nothing besides his freedom, he made gain of his voice, and used his freedom for the object of being loquacious with impunity. [12] So there was no reason in the world for your taking him as a partner, except that he might learn with your money what a harvest money can produce. Nevertheless, induced by acquaintance and intimacy with the man, <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, as I have said, entered into a partnership with him as to those articles which were procured in Gaul. He had considerable property in <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, and a well-cultivated and productive farm. <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> is carried off from the halls of <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a>, and from the gang of criers, into Gaul and across the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a>; there is a great change in his situation, none in his disposition; for he who from his boyhood had been proposing to himself gain without any outlay, as soon as he spent anything himself and brought it to the common stock, could not be content with a moderate profit. [13] Nor is it any wonder if he, who had his voice for sale, thought that those things which he had acquired by his voice would be a great profit to him; so that without much moderation, he carried off whatever he could from the common stock to his private house for himself. And in this he was as industrious as if all who behaved in a partnership with exact good faith, were usually condemned in a trial before an arbitrator. But concerning these matters I do not consider it necessary to say what Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> wishes me to mention; although the cause calls for it: yet as it only calls for it, and does not absolutely require it, I will pass it over. </p>                        </div>
                        <div class="text-right bottommargin-sm">

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi001:4'><b>&sect; 4</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;[14] When this partnership had now subsisted many years, and when <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> had often been suspected by <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, and was not able conveniently to give an account of the transactions which he had carried on according to his caprice, and not on any system, <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> dies in Gaul, when <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> was there too, and dies suddenly. By his will he left this Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> his heir, in order that, as great grief would come to him by his death, great honour should also accrue to him. [15] When he was dead, Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> soon after goes into Gaul. There he lives on terms of intimacy with that fellow <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>. There they are together nearly a year, during which they had many communications with one another about their partnership, and about the whole of their accounts and their estate in Gaul; nor during that time did <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> utter one single word about either the partnership owing him anything, or about <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> having owed him anything on his private account. As there was some little debt left behind, the payment of which was to be provided for at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, this Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> issues notices that he shall put up to auction in Gaul, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/432030UNar class=place long=3.004 lat=43.181>Narbonne</a>, those things which were his own private property. [16] On this, this excellent man, <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>, dissuades the man by many speeches from putting the things up to auction, saying that he would not be able at that time to sell so conveniently what he had advertised. That he had a sum of money at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, which if <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> were wise he would consider their common property, from their brotherly intimacy, and also from his relationship with himself; for <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> has married the cousin of Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, and has children by her. Because <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> was saying just what a good man ought, <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> believed that he who imitated the language of good men, would imitate also their actions. He gives up the idea of having an auction; he goes to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; at the same time <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> also leaves Gaul for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. [17] As Caius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> had owed money to Publius Scapula, Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> referred it to you, O Caius <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a>, to decide what he should pay his children. He preferred submitting to your decision in this matter, because, on account of the difference in the exchange, it was not sufficient to look in his books and see how much was owed, unless he had inquired at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCas class=place long=12.48563 lat=41.89172>temple of Castor</a> how much was to be paid in Roman money.

For not only had he promised it in Gaul, but every day he kept on saying at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> that he would pay the money as soon as he gave him a hint to do so. <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> moreover saw that he was able to do so. He knew that he ought; he did not think that he was telling lies, because there was no reason why he should tell lies. He arranged, therefore, that he would pay the Scapulae as if he had the money at home. He gives <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> notice of it, and asks him to provide for the payment as he had said he would. [19] Then that worthy man — I hope he will not think I am laughing at him if I call him again a most worthy man — as he thought that he was brought into a great strait, hoping to pin him down to his own terms at the very nick of time, says that he will not pay a penny, unless a decision is first come to about all the affairs and accounts of the partnership, and unless he knew that there would be no dispute between him and <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>. We will look into these matters at a future time, says <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, but at present I wish you to provide, if you please, what you said you would. He says that he will not do so on any other condition; and that what he had promised no more concerned him, than it would if when he was holding a sale by auction, he had made any bidding at the command of the owner. [20] <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> being perplexed at this desertion, obtains a few days' delay from the Scapulae; he sends into Gaul to have those things sold which he had advertised; being absent, he sells them at a less favourable time than before; he pays the Scapulae with more disadvantage to himself than he would have done. Then of his own accord he calls <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> to account, in order, since he suspected that there would be a dispute about something, to provide for the termination of the business as soon as possible, and with the smallest possible trouble. [21] He appoints as his umpire his friend Marcus <a href=/people/3093 target=_blank>Trebellius</a>; we name a common friend, a relation of our own, <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> Alphenus, who had been brought up in his house, and with whom he was exceedingly intimate. No agreement could be come to; because the one was willing to put up with a slight loss, but the other was not content with a moderate booty. [22] So from that time the matter was referred to legal decision. After many delays, and when much time had been wasted in that business, and nothing had been done, <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> appeared before the judge. </p>                        </div>

[23] He says that he had had a sale by auction in Gaul; that he had sold what he thought fit; that he had taken care that the partnership should owe him nothing; that he would have no more to do with summoning any one, or with giving security; if <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> had any business to transact with him, he had no objection. He, as he was desirous to revisit his farm in Gaul, does not summon the man at present; so he departs without giving security. After that, <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> remains at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> about thirty days. He gets any securities which he had given other people respited, so as to be able to go without hindrance into Gaul. [24] He goes; he leaves <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the twenty-ninth of January, in the Consulship of <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> and <a href=/people/1374 target=_blank>Norbanus</a>; — I beg of you to remember the day. Lucius <a href=/people/3526 target=_blank>Albius</a> the son of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> of the <a href=/people/10164 target=_blank>Quirine</a> tribe, a good man and of the highest reputation for honour, set out with him. When they had come to the place called the fords of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/434109UVol class=place long=10.86 lat=43.4035>Volaterra</a>, they see a great friend of <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>, who was bringing him some slaves from Gaul to be sold, Lucius <a href=/people/3950 target=_blank>Publicius</a> by name, who when he arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> told <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> in what place he had seen <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>; and unless this had been told <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> by <a href=/people/3950 target=_blank>Publicius</a>, the matter would not so soon have come to trial. [25] Then <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> sends his slaves round to his friends; he summons himself all his associates from the halls of <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> and from the jaws of the shambles, and entreats them to come to the booth of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> by the second hour of the next day. They come in crowds; he makes oath that Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> has not appeared to his bail, and that he has appeared to his. A long protest to this effect is sealed with the <a href=/people/10989 target=_blank>seals</a> of noble men. They depart: <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> demands of Burrienus the praetor, that by his edict he may take possession of <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>'s goods. He urged the confiscation of the property of that man with whom he had had intimacy, with whom he actually was in partnership, between whom and himself there was a relationship, which while his children lived could not possibly be annulled. [26] From which act it could easily be perceived that there is no bond so holy and solemn, that avarice is not in the habit of weakening and violating it. In truth, if friendship is kept up by truth, society by good faith, relationship by affection, it is inevitable that he who has endeavoured to despoil his friend, his partner, and his relation of fame and fortune, should confess himself worthless and perfidious and impious. [27] <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> Alphenus, the agent of Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, the intimate friend and relation of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>, tears down the bills; carries off one little slave whom <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> had laid hold of; gives notice that he is the agent, and that it is only fair that that fellow should consult the fame and fortunes of Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, and await his arrival. But if he would not do so, and believed that by such methods he could bring him into the conditions which he proposed, then he asked nothing as a favour, and if <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> chose to go to law, he would defend him at the trial. [28] While this is being done at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, meantime <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, contrary to law and to custom, and to the edicts of the praetors, is driven by force by the slaves which belonged to both him and <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>, as partners, from their common lands and estates. </p>                        </div>

How strongly he was of opinion that that action called for punishment you will be able to learn from his decrees.

The tribunes are appealed to, and as a positive decision was demanded from them, the matter is terminated on the footing of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> Alphenus undertaking that Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> should answer to his bail by the thirteenth of September. </p>                        </div>

He makes the order; how just a one I do not say — this alone I do say, it was unprecedented: and I would rather not have said even this, since any one could have understood both its characters.

[31] Moreover, <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> himself cried out that he was unwilling to give security, lest by so doing he should seem to admit that his goods had been taken possession of in accordance with the edict: besides, if he gave a bond in that manner, he should be forced (as has now happened) to speak first in a trial affecting himself capitally. <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> (as high-born men are wont to do, who, whether they have begun to act rightly or wrongly, carry either conduct to such a height that no one born in our rank of life can overtake them) perseveres most bravely in committing injustice: he bids him either give security or give a bond; and meantime he orders our advocates, who objected to this, to be removed with great roughness. </p>                        </div>

As in the one case there was no reason why he should pass an unfavourable sentence on himself (for sentence passed by oneself is the hardest sentence of all), but in the other case there was hope of coming before such a man as a judge, as would show him the more favour the more without interest he was, he preferred to give a bond.

His heir, Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, comes into Gaul to you, to your joint estate — comes to that place where not only the property was, but also all the accounts and all the books.

Is it not so? that which the best men do, those who wish their relations and friends to be affectionate towards them and honourable, would <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> not do that, he who so burns, who is so hurried away by avarice, that he is unwilling to give up any part of his own property, lest he should leave some fraction to be any credit or advantage to this his near relation. [39] And would he not demand the money, if any were owing, who , because that was not paid which was never owed, seeks to take away not the money only, but even the life of his relation? You were unwilling, I suppose, to be troublesome to him whom you will not allow even to live as a free man! You were unwilling at that time modestly to ask that man for money, whom you now will nefariously to murder! I suppose so. You were unwilling, or you did not dare, to ask a man who was your relation, who had a regard for you, a good man, a temperate man, a man older than yourself. Often (as sometimes happens with men), when you had fortified yourself, when you had determined to mention the money, when you had come ready prepared and having considered the matter, you being a nervous man, of virgin modesty, on a sudden checked yourself, your voice failed you, you did not dare to ask him for money whom you wished to ask, lest he should be unwilling to hear you.

If he had owed you money, O <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a>, you would have asked for it at once; if not at once, at all events soon after; if not soon after, at least after a time; in six months I should think; beyond all doubt at the close of the year: but for a year and a half, when you had every day an opportunity of reminding the man of the debt, you say not one word about it; but now, when nearly two years have passed, you ask for the money. What profligate and extravagant spendthrift, even before his property is diminished, but while it is still abundant, would have been so reckless as <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> was? When I name the man, I seem to myself to have said enough. [41] Caius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> owed you money; you never asked for it: he died; his property came to his heir; though you saw him every day, you did not ask for it for two years; will any one doubt which is the more probable, that <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> would instantly have asked for what was owed to him, or that be would not have asked for two years? Had he no opportunity of asking? Why, he lived with you more than a year: could no measures be taken in Gaul?

The only alternative remaining is, either extreme carelessness prevented you, or extraordinary liberality. If you call it carelessness, we shall wonder; if you call it kindness, we shall laugh; and what else you can call it I know not; it is proof enough that nothing was owing to <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>, that for such a length of time he asked for nothing. </p>                        </div>

What are we doing, <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>? what are we to say of this condition? Can we, some time or other, laying aside our weapons, discuss the money matter without hazard of any one's fortunes? Can we so prosecute our business, as to leave the life of our relation in safety? Can we adopt the character of a plaintiff, and lay aside that of an accuser? Yes, says he, I will take security from you, but I will not give you security. </p>                        </div>

The goods of <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, says he, were taken possession of in accordance with the edict of the praetor. You demand then, that I should admit that; that we should establish by our own sentence, as having taken place, that which we go to trial expressly to prove never did take place. [46] Can no means be found, O Caius <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a>, for a man's arriving at his rights as expeditiously as maybe without the disgrace and infamy and ruin of any one else? Forsooth, if anything were owed, he would ask for it: he would not prefer that all sorts of trials should take place, rather than that one from which all these arise. He, who for so many years never even asked <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> for the money, when he had an opportunity of transacting business with him every day; he who, from the time when he first began to behave ill, has wasted all the time in adjournments and respiting the recognizances; he who, after he had withdrawn his recognizance drove <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> by treachery and violence from their joint estate; who, when he had ample opportunity, without any one's making objection, to try a civil action, chose rather a charge that involved infamy; who, when he is brought back to this tribunal, whence all these proceedings arise, repudiates the most reasonable proposals; confesses that he is aiming, not at the money, but at the life and heart's blood of his adversary; — does he not openly say, “if anything were owing to me, I should demand it, and I should long ago have obtained it; [47] I would not employ so much trouble, so unpopular a course of legal proceeding, and such a band of favourers of my cause, if I had to make a just demand; I have got to extort money from one unwilling, and in spite of him; I have got to tear and squeeze out of a man what he does not owe; Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> is to be cast down from all his fortune; every one who is powerful, or eloquent, or noble, must be brought into court with me; a force must be put upon truth, threats must be bandied about, dangers must be threatened; terrors must be brandished before his eyes, that being cowed and overcome by these things, he may at last yield of his own accord.” And, in truth, all these things, when I see who are striving against us, and when I consider the party sitting opposite to me, seem to be impending over, and to be present to us, and to be impossible to be avoided by any means. But when, O Caius <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a>, I bring my eyes and my mind back to you, the greater the labour and zeal with which all these things are done, the more trifling and powerless do I think them. <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> then owed nothing, as you prove yourself. [48] But what if he had owed you anything? would that have at once been a reason for your requiring leave from the praetor to take possession of his goods? I think that was neither according to law, nor expedient for any one. What then does he prove? He says that he had forfeited his recognizances. </p>                        </div>

He, as you say, had not appeared to his recognizances; he with whom you were connected by relationship, by partnership, by every sort of bond and ancient intimacy. Was it decent for you to go at once to the praetor? was it fair for you at once to demand to be allowed to take possession of his goods according to the edict? Did you betake yourself to these extreme measures and to these most hostile laws with such eagerness as to leave yourself nothing behind which you might be able to do still more bitter and cruel? [49] For, what could happen more shameful to any human being, what more miserable or more bitter to a man; what disgrace could happen so heavy, what disaster can be imagined so intolerable? If fortune deprived any one of money, or if the injustice of another took it from him, still while his reputation is unimpeached, honour easily makes amends for poverty. And some men, though stained with ignominy, or convicted in discreditable trials, still enjoy their wealth; are not forced to dance attendance (which is the most wretched of all states) on the power of another; and in their distresses they are relieved by this support and comfort; but he whose goods have been sold, who has seen not merely his ample estates, but even his necessary food and clothing put up under the hammer, with great disgrace to himself; he is not only erased from the list of men, but he is removed out of sight, if possible, even beneath the dead. An honourable death forsooth often sets off even a base life, but a dishonoured life leaves no room to hope for even an honourable death. [50] Therefore, in truth, when a man's goods are taken possession of according to the praetor's edict, all his fame and reputation is seized at the same time with his goods. A man about whom placards are posted in the most frequented places, is not allowed even to perish in silence and obscurity; a man who has assignees and trustees appointed to pronounce to him on what terms and conditions he is to be ruined; a man about whom the voice of the crier makes proclamation and proclaims his price, — he has a most bitter funeral procession while he is alive, if that may be considered a funeral in which men meet not as friends to do honour to his obsequies, but purchasers of his goods as executioners, to tear to pieces and divide the relics of his existence. </p>                        </div>

For they consider how serious a matter it is to confiscate the property of another. A good man is unwilling to slay another, even according to law; for he would rather say that he had saved when he might have destroyed, than that he had destroyed when he could have saved. Good men behave so to the most perfect strangers, aye, even to their greatest enemies, for the sake both of their reputation among men, and of the common rights of humanity; in order that, as they have not knowingly caused inconvenience to another, no inconvenience may lawfully befall them.

Let good men, says he, look to these duties, but let them think of me thus; let them ask not what I have, but by what means I have acquired it, and in what rank I was born, and in what manner I was brought up. I remember, there is an old proverb about a buffoon; “that it is a much easier thing for him to become rich than to become the head of a family.” [56] This is what he says openly by his actions, if he does not dare to say it in words. If in truth he wishes to live according to the practices of good men, he has many things to learn and to unlearn, both which things are difficult to a man of his age. </p>                        </div>

[61] What was the first opportunity, then, which was given to the agent of defending this absent man? When you were putting up the placards. Then <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> Alphenus was present: he did not permit it; he tore down the notices. That which was the first step of duty was observed by the agent with the greatest diligence. Let us see what followed on this. You arrest the servant of Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> in public: you attempt to take him away. Alphenus does not permit it; he takes him from you by force; he takes care that he is led home to <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>. Here too is seen in a high degree the attention of an illustrious agent. You say that <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> is in your debt; his agent denies it. You wish security to he given; he promises it. You call him into court; he follows you. You demand a trial; he does not object. What other could be the conduct of one defending a man in his absence I do not understand. [62] But who was the agent? I suppose it was some insignificant man, poor, litigious, worthless, who might be able to endure the daily abuse of a wealthy buffoon. Nothing of the sort: he was a wealthy Roman knight; a man managing his own affairs well: he was, in short, the man whom <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> himself as often as he went into Gaul, left as his agent at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. </p>                        </div>

Do you attempt to say that there was no one who defended <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> at the trial? [63] “I demanded,” says he, “that security should be given.” You demanded it unjustly. “The order was made.” Alphenus objected. “He did, but the praetor made the decree.” Therefore the tribunes were appealed to. “Here,” said he, “I have you: that is not allowing a trial, nor defending a man at a trial, when you ask assistance from the tribunes.” When I consider how prudent <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> is, I do not think that he will say this; but when I hear that he has said so before, and when I consider the cause itself I do not see what else he can say; for he admits that Alphenus tore down the bills, undertook to give security, did not object to go to trial in the very terms which <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> proposed; but on this condition, that according to custom and prescription, it should be before that magistrate who was appointed in order to give assistance. [64] You must either say that these things are not so; or that Caius <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a>, being such a man as he is, on his oath, is to establish this law in the state: that he whose agent does not object to every trial which any one demands against him, whose agent dares to appeal from the praetor to the tribunes, is not defended at all, and may rightly have his goods taken possession of; may properly, while miserable, absent, and ignorant of it, have all the embellishments of his fortunes, all the ornaments of his life, taken from him with the greatest disgrace and ignominy. And this seems reasonable to no one. [65] This certainly must be proved to the satisfaction of every one, that <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> while absent was defended at the trial. And as that is the ease, his goods were not taken possession of in accordance with the edict. But then, the tribunes of the people did not even hear his cause. I admit, if that be the case, that the agent ought to have obeyed the decree of the praetor. What; if Marcus <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> openly said that he would intercede unless some agreement was come to between Alphenus himself and <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>; does not the appeal to the tribunes seem to have been interposed not for the sake of delay but of assistance? </p>                        </div>

Alphenus, in order that all men might see that <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> was defended at the trial, that no suspicion might exist unfavourable either to his own duty, or to his principal's character, summons many excellent men, And, in the hearing of that fellow, calls them to witness that he begs this of him, in the first place, out of regard to their common intimacy, that he would not attempt to take any severe steps against <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> in his absence without cause; but if lie persevered in carrying on the contest in a most spiteful and hostile manner, that he is prepared by every upright and honourable method to defend him, and to prove that what he demanded was not owed, and that he accepted the trial which <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> proposed. [67] Many excellent men signed the document setting forth this fact and these conditions. While all matters are still unaltered, while the goods are neither advertised nor taken possession of, Alphenus promises <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> that <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> should appear to his recognizances. <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> does appear to his recognizances. The matter lies in dispute while that fellow is spreading his calumnies for two years, until he could find out by what means the affair might be diverted out of the common course of proceeding, and the whole cause he confined to this single point to which it is now limited. [68] What duty of an agent can possibly be mentioned, O Caius <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a>, which seems to have been overlooked by Alphenus? What reason is alleged why it should be denied that Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> was defended in his absence? Is it that which I suppose <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> will allege, because he has lately mentioned it, and because <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> is always harping on it, that <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> was not contending on equal terms with Alphenus, at such a time, and with such magistrates? And if I were willing to admit that, they will, I suppose, grant this, that it is not the case that no one was the agent of Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, but that he had one who was popular. But it is quite sufficient for me to prove that there was an agent, with whom he could have tried the matter. What sort of man he was, as long as he defended the man in his absence, according to law and before the proper magistrate, I think has nothing to do with the matter. [69] “For he was,” says he, “a man of the opposite party.” No doubt; a man who had been brought up in your house, whom you from a youth had so trained up as not to favour any one of eminence, not even a gladiator. If Alphenus had the same wish as you always especially entertained, was not the contest between you on equal terms in that matter? “Oh,” says he, “he was an intimate friend of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, and therefore he interposed.” You on the other hand were an intimate friend of Burrienus, who gave an unjust decision; and, in short, of all those men who at that time were both very powerful with violence and wickedness, and who dared do all that they could. Did you wish to overcome those men, who now are labouring with such zeal that you may be victorious? Dare to say that, not openly, but to these very men whom you have brought with you. [70] Although I am unwilling to bring that matter up again by mentioning it, every recollection of which I think ought to be entirely effaced and destroyed. </p>                        </div>

Nor was there, as I think, any difference between your zeal. In ability, in experience, in cunning, you easily surpassed him. To say nothing of other things, this is sufficient: Alphenus was ruined with those men, and for the sake of those men to whom he was attached; you, after those men who were your friends could not get the better, took care that those who did get the better should be your friends. [71] But if you think you had not then the same justice as Alphenus, because it was in his power to appeal to some one against you; because a magistrate was found before whom the cause of Alphenus could be fairly heard; what is <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> to determine on at this time I — a man who has not as yet found any just magistrate, nor been able to procure the customary trial; in whose case no condition, no security, no petition has been interposed, — I do not say a just one, but none at all that had ever been heard of before that time. I wish to try an action about money. You cannot. But that is the point in dispute. It does not concern me; you must plead to a capital charges. Accuse me then, if it must be so. No says be, not unless you, in an unprecedented manner, first make your defence. You must plead; the time must be fixed at our pleasure; the judge himself shall be removed. [72] What then? Shall you be able to find any advocate, a man of such ancient principles of duty as to despise our splendour and influence? Lucius <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a> will be my advocate; in eloquence, in dignity, and in honour, the most flourishing man in the states. <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> will speak for me; a man eminent for his genius, and nobility, and reputation; and other most noble and powerful men will accompany me into court, the number and appearance of whom may alarm not only Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, who is defending himself on a capital charge, but even any one who is out of danger. [73] This really is what an unequal contest is; not that one in which you were skirmishing against Alphenus. You did not leave him any place where he could make a stand against you. You must therefore either prove that Alphenus denied he was his agent, did not tear down the bills, and refused to go to trial; or, if all this was done, you must admit that you did not take possession of the goods of Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> in accordance with the edict. </p>                        </div>

Was there no one to whom <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> owed money? There were some, there were many such; because Caius, his brother, had left some amount of debt behind him. What then was the reason? They were all men entirely strangers to him, and he owed them money, and yet not one was found so notoriously infamous as to dare to attack the character of Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> in his absences. [74] There was one man, his relation, his partner, his intimate friend, <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>, who, though he himself was in reality in debt to him, as if some extraordinary prize of wickedness was proposed to him, strove with the greatest eagerness to deprive his own relation, oppressed and ruined by his means, not only of property which he had honestly acquired, but even of that light which is common to all men. Where were the rest of the creditors? Even now at this very time where are they? Who is there who says he kept out of the way for the sake of fraud? Who is there who denies that <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> was defended in his absence? [75] Not one is found But, on the other hand, all men who either have or have had any transactions with him are present on his behalf and are defending him; they are labouring that his good faith, known in many places, may not now be disparaged by the perfidy of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>. In a trial of this nature <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> ought to have brought some witnesses out of that body, who could say; “He forfeited his recognizances in my case; he cheated me, he begged a day of me for the payment of a debt which he had denied; could not get him to trial; he kept out of the way; he left no agent:” none of all these things is said. Witnesses are being got ready to say it But we shall examine into that, I suppose, when they have said it: but let them consider this one thing, that they are of weight only so far, that they can preserve that weight, if they also preserve the truth; if they neglect that, they are so insignificant that all men may see that influence is of avail not to support a lie, but only to prove the truth. </p>                        </div>

What if you yourself, O <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>, decided that the goods of Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> had not been taken possession of according to the edict? I conceive that your evidence, which in a matter which did not concern yourself would be very worthless, ought to be of the greatest weight in an affair of your own when it makes against you. You bought the goods of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> Alphenus when Lucius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, the dictator, sold them. You entered <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> in your books as the partner in the purchase of these goods. I say no more. Did you enter into a voluntary partnership with that man who had cheated in a partnership to which he had succeeded by inheritance; [77] and did you by your own sentence approve of the man who you thought was stripped of his character and of all his fortunes? I had fears indeed, O Caius <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a>, that I could not stand my ground in this cause with a mind sufficiently fortified and resolute. I thought thus, that, as <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> was going to speak against me, and as <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> was going to listen to me carefully, I should through fear stumble in many particulars. I said to Quintus <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> here, whose sister is the wife of Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, when he asked of me, and, with the greatest earnestness, entreated me to defend his relation, that it was very difficult for me, not only to sum up a cause against such orators, but even to attempt to speak at all. When he pressed it more eagerly, I said to the man very familiarly, as our friendship justified, that a man appeared to me to have a very brazen face, who, while he was present, could attempt to use action in speaking, but those who contended with him himself, even though before that they seemed to have any skill or elegance, lost it, and that I was afraid lest something of the same sort would happen to me when I was going to speak against so great an artist. </p>                        </div>

In truth, as he is an artist of that sort that he alone seems worthy of being looked at when he is on the stage, so he is also a man of such a sort that he alone seems to deserve never to go thither. “But what,” says he, “if you have such a cause as this, that you have only to make this plain, that there is no one in two or three days at most can walk seven hundred miles? Will you still fear that you will not be able to argue this point against <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>?” [79] “No,” said I. “But what is that to the purpose?” “In truth,” said he, “that is what the cause turns upon.” “How so?” He then explains to me an affair of that sort, and at the same time an action of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>, which, if that alone were alleged, ought to be sufficient.

Two days afterwards, or, even if any one had set off and run the moment he left the court, in under three days, he accomplishes seven hundred miles. [80] O incredible thing!

For everything does not depend, as you two think it does, on eloquence. There is still some truth so manifest that nothing can weaken it. [81] Did you, before you made the demand to be allowed to take possession of his goods, send any one to take care that the master should be driven by force off the estate by his own slaves? Choose whichever you like; the one is incredible; the other abominable; and both are unheard-of before this time. Do you mean that any one ran over seven hundred miles in two days? Tell me. Do you deny it? Then you sent some one beforehand. I had rather you did. For if you were to say that, you would be seen to tell an impudent lie: when you confess this, you admit that you did a thing which you cannot conceal even by a lies. Will such a design, so covetous, so audacious, so precipitate, be approved of by <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a> and by such men as he is? [82] What does this madness, what does this baste, what does this precipitation intimate? Does it not prove violence? does it not prove wickedness? does it not prove robbery? does it not, in short, prove everything rather than right, than duty, or than modesty? You send some one without the command of the praetor. With what intention? You knew he would order it. What then? When he had ordered it, could you not have sent then? You were about to ask him. When? Thirty days after. Yes, if nothing hindered you; if the same intention existed; if you were well; in short, if you were alive. The praetor would have made the order, I suppose, if he chose, if he was well, if he was in court, if no one objected, by giving security according to his decree, and by being willing to stand a trial. [83] For, by the immortal gods, if Alphenus, the agent of Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, were then willing to give security and to stand a trial, and in short to do everything which you chose, what would you do? Would you recall him whom you had sent into Gaul? But this man would have been already expelled from his farm, already driven headlong from his home, already (the most unworthy thing of all) assaulted by the hands of his own slaves, in obedience to your messenger and command. You would, forsooth, make amends for these things afterwards. Do you dare to speak of the life of any man, you who must admit this, — that you were so blinded by covetousness and avarice, that, though you did not know what would happen afterwards, but many things might happen, you placed your hope from a present crime in the uncertain event of the future? And I say this, just as if, at that very time when the praetor had ordered you to take possession according to his edict, you had sent any one to take possession, you either ought to, or could have ejected Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> from possession. </p>                        </div>

How did the praetor order you to take possession? I suppose, in accordance with his edict. In what words was the recognizance drawn up? “If the goods of Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> have been taken possession of in accordance with the praetor's edict.” Let us return to the edict. How does that enjoin you to take possession? Is there any pretence, O Caius <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a>, if he took possession in quite a different way from that which the praetor enjoined, for denying that then he did not take possession according to the edict, but that I have beaten him in the trial? None, I imagine. Let us refer to the edict. — “They who in accordance with my edict have come into possession.” He is speaking of you, <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>, as you think; for you say that you came into possession according to the edict. He defines for you what you are to do; he instructs you; he gives you precepts. “It seems that those ought to be in possession.” How? “That which they can rightly secure in the place where they now are, let them secure there; that which they cannot, they may carry or lead away.” What then? “It is not right,” says he, “to drive away the owner against his will.” The very man who with the object of cheating is keeping out of the way, the very man who deals dishonestly with all his creditors, he forbids to be driven off his farm against his will. [85] As you are on your way to take possession, O <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>, the praetor himself openly says to you — “Take possession in such manner that <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> may have possession at the same time with you; take possession in such a manner that no violence may be offered to <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>.” What? how do you observe that? I say nothing of his not having been a man who was keeping out of the way, of his being a man who had a house, a wife, children, and an agent at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; I say nothing of all this: I say this, that the owner was expelled from his farm; that hands were laid on their master by his own slaves, before his own household gods; I say <br /> ***** </p>                        </div>

On which occasion I offered a condition, if he was determined to demand the money, that Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> should give security to submit to the decision, if he also, if <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> had any demands upon him, would submit to the like conditions. [86] I showed how many things ought to be done before a demand was made that the goods of a relation should be taken possession of; especially when he had at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> his house, his wife, his children, and an agent who was equally an intimate friend of both. I proved that when he said the recognizances were forfeited, there were actually no recognizances at all; that on the day on which he says he gave him the promise, he was not even at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. I promised that I would make that plain by witnesses, who both must know the truth, and who had no reason for speaking falsely. I proved also that it was not possible that the goods should have been taken possession of according to the edict; because he was neither said to have kept out of the way for the purpose of fraud, nor to have left the country in banishment. [87] The charge remains, that no one defended him at the trial. In opposition to which I argued that he was most abundantly defended, and that not by a man unconnected with him, nor by any slanderous or worthless person, but by a Roman knight, his own relation and intimate friend, whom <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> himself had been accustomed previously to leave as his own agent. And that even if he did appeal to the tribunes, he was not on that account the less prepared to submit to a trial; and that <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> had not had his rights wrested from him by the powerful interest of the agent; that on the other hand he was so much superior to us in interest that he now scarcely gives us the liberty of breathing. </p>                        </div>

Secondly, I asked this also, on what account not one of so many creditors either did the same thing then, why not one speaks against him now, but why they are all striving for Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>? Especially when in such a trial the testimonies of creditors are thought exceedingly material. After that, I employed the testimony of the adversary, who lately entered as his partner the man who, according to the language of his present claim, he demonstrates was at that time not even in the number of living men. Then I mentioned that incredible rapidity, or rather audacity of his. I showed that it was inevitable, either that seven hundred miles had been run over in two days, or that <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> had sent men to take possession many days before he demanded leave so to seize his goods. [89] After that I recited the edict, which expressly forbade the owner to be driven off his by which it was plain that <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> had not taken possession according to the edict, as he confessed that <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> had been driven off his farm by force. But I thoroughly proved that the goods had actually not been taken possession of, because such a seizure of goods is looked at not as to part but with respect to everything which can be seized or taken possession of. I said that he had a house at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> which that fellow never even made an attempt on; that he had many slaves, of which he neither took possession of any, and did not even touch any; that there was one whom he attempted to touch; that he was forbidden to, and that he remained quiet. [90] You know also that <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> never came on to the private farms of <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> even in Gaul. Lastly I proved that the private servants of <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> were not all driven away from that very estate which he took possession of, having expelled his partner by force. From which, and from all the other sayings, and actions, and thoughts of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>, any one can understand that that fellow did nothing else, and is now doing nothing, but endeavouring by violence, by injustice, and by unfair means at this trial, to make the whole farm his own which belongs to both partners in common. </p>                        </div>

[92] From the self same day when we came before you as judges, we began to disregard all the threats of those men which before we were alarmed at. If cause was to contend with cause we are sure that we could easily prove ours to any one but as the course of life of the one was to be contested with the course of life of the other, we thought we had on that account even more need of you as our judge. For this is the very point now in question, whether the rustic and unpolished economy of my client can defend itself against the luxury and licentiousness of the other or whether, homely as it is, and stripped of all ornaments, it is to lie handed over naked to covetousness and wantonness. [93] Publius <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> does not compare himself with you, O <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>, he does not vie with you in riches or power. He gives up to you all the arts by which you are great; he confesses that he does not speak elegantly; that he is not able to say pleasant things to people; that he does not abandon a friendship when his friend is in distress, and fly off to another which is in flourishing circumstances; that he does not give magnificent and splendid banquets; that he has not a house closed against modesty and holiness, but open and as it were exposed to cupidity and debauchery; on the other hand he says that duty, good faith, industry and a life which has been always austere and void of pleasure has been his choice; he knows that the opposite course is more fashionable, and that by such habits people have more influence. What then shall be done? [94] They have not so much more influence, that those who, having abandoned the strict discipline of virtuous men, have chosen rather to follow the gains and extravagance of Gallonius, and have even spent their liven in audacity and perfidy which were no part of his character, should have absolute dominion over the lives and fortunes of honourable men. If he may be allowed to live where <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> does not wish to, if there is room in the city for an honest man against the will of <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>; if Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> may be allowed to breathe in opposition to the nod and sovereign power of <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>; if under your protection, he can preserve in opposition to the insolence of his enemy the ornaments which he has acquired by virtue, there is hope that this unfortunate and wretched man may at last be able to rest in peace. But if <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> is to have power to do everything he chooses, and if he chooses what is unlawful, what is to be done? What God is to be appealed to? The faith of what man can we invoke? What complaints, what lamentations can be devised adequate to so great a calamity. </p>                        </div>

It is a bitter thing to be circumvented by any one, more bitter still to be so by a relation. It is a calamitous thing to be stripped of one's goods, more calamitous still if accompanied by disgrace. It is an intolerable injury to be slain by a brave and honourable man, more intolerable still to be slain by one whose voice has been prostituted to the trade of a crier. It is an unworthy thing to be conquered by one's equal or one's superior, more unworthy still by one's inferior, by one lower than oneself. It is a grievous thing to be handed over with one's goods to another, more grievous still to be handed over to an enemy. It is a horrible thing to have to plead to a capital charge, more horrible still to have to speak in one's own defence before one's accuser speaks. [96] <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> has looked round on all sides, has encountered every danger. He was not only unable to find a praetor from whom he could obtain a trial, much less one from whom he could obtain one on his own terms, but he could not even move the friends of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>, at whose feet he often lay, and that for a long time, entreating them by the immortal Gods either to contest the point with him according to law, or at least, if they must do him injustice, to do it without ignominy. [97] Last of all he approached the haughty countenance of his very enemy; weeping he took the hand of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a>, well practised in advertising the goods of his relations. He entreated him by the ashes of his dead brother by the name of their relationship, by his own wife and children to whom no one is a nearer relation than Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, at length to take pity on him, to have some regard, if not for their relationship, at least for his age, if not for a man, at least for humanity, to terminate the matter on any conditions as long as they were only endurable, leaving his character unimpeached. [98] Being rejected by him, getting no assistance from his friends being passed and frightened by every magistrate he has no one but you whom he can appeal to you he commends himself to you he commends all his property and fortunes to you he commends his character and his hopes for the remainder of his life. Harassed by much contumely suffered in under many injuries he flies to you not unworthy but unfortunate; driven out of a beautiful farm with his enemies attempting to fix every possible mark of ignominy on him, seeing his adversary the owner of his paternal property, while he himself is unable to make up a dowry for his marriageable daughter, he has still done nothing inconsistent with his former life. [99] Therefore be begs this of you, O Caius <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a>, that he may be allowed to carry with him out of this place the character and the probity which, now that his life is nearly come to an end, he brought with him before your tribunal. That he, of whose virtue no one ever doubted, may not in his sixtieth year be branded with disgrace, with stigma, and with the most shameful ignominy; that <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1332 target=_blank>Naevius</a> may not array himself in all his ornaments as spoils of victory; that it may not be owing to you that the character, which has accompanied Publius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> to his old age, does not attend him to the tomb. </p>                        </div>
