God prevent such madness! 6 And yet, if I am not mistaken, we possess the written journal of that great man and also his wars recorded in detail in the manner of a history, and these I should like you to procure and set forth in order, adding thereto all that pertains to his life. 7 All these things you may learn in your zeal for research from the linen books, for he gave instructions that in these all that he did each day should be written down. I will arrange, moreover, that the <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> Library shall provide you with the linen books themselves. 8 It would be my wish that you write a work on <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a>, representing him, to the best of your ability, just as he really was. 9 I have carried out these instructions, my dear <a href=/people/5305 target=_blank>Ulpianus</a>, I have procured the Greek books and laid my hands on all that I needed, and from these sources I have gathered together into one little book all that was worthy of mention. 10 You I should wish to think kindly of my work, and, if you are not content therewith, to study the Greeks and even to demand the linen books themselves, which the <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> Library will furnish you whenever you desire. </p>                        </div>

From which it is clear that the woman knew something of fate. 4 The same writer says also that there were the following omens of the rule of <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a>: First of all, when he was a child, a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> wound itself many times around his wash-basin, and no one was able to kill it; finally, his mother, who had seen the occurrence, refused to have the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> killed, saying that it was a member of the household. 5 Furthermore, it is said, the priestess made swaddling-clothes for her son from a purple cloak, which the emperor of the time had dedicated to the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>-god. 6 This, too, is related, that <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a>, while wrapped in his swaddling-clothes, was lifted out of his cradle by an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>, but without suffering harm, and was laid on an altar in a neighbouring shrine which happened to have no fire upon it. 7 The same writer asserts that on his mother's land a calf was born of marvellous size, white but with purple spots, which formed on one side the word hail, on the other a crown. </p>                        </div>

But when he discovered to whom it belonged, he changed to one of his own. 5 Furthermore, when he had gone as envoy to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, he was presented with a sacrificial saucer, of the kind that the king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> is wont to present to the emperor, on which was engraved the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>-god in the same attire in which he was worshipped in the very temple where the mother of <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> had been a priestess. 6 He was also presented with an elephant of unusual size, which he then gave to the emperor, and <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> was the only commoner of them all who ever owned an elephant. </p>                        </div>

He spoke as follows: 2 As for myself, my lord <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>, Emperor and Augustus, it was with this end in view that I have done all that I did, have suffered wounds with patience, and have exhausted my <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and my sworn comrades, namely, that I might win the approval of the commonwealth and of my own conscience. 3 You, however, have done more. Therefore, I am grateful for your kindness and I will accept the consulship which you offer me. May a god, and a god in whom we can put our trust, now grant that the senate shall form a like judgement concerning me. 4 And so, when all who stood about expressed their thanks, Ulpius <a href=/people/11063 target=_blank>Crinitus</a> arose and delivered the following speech: 5 According to the custom of our ancestors, <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> Augustus, — a custom which my own family has held particularly dear, — men of the highest birth have always chosen the most courageous to be their sons, in order that those families which either were dying out or had lost their offspring by marriage might gain lustre from the fertility of a borrowed stock. 6 This custom, then, which was followed by <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> in adopting <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>, by <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> in adopting <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>, by <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> in adopting <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, and by the others after them according to the precedent thus established, I have thought I should now bring back by adopting <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a>, whom you, by the authority of your approval, have given to me as my deputy. 7 Do you, therefore, give the order that it may be sanctioned by law and that <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> may become the heir to the sacred duties, the name, the goods, and the legal rights of Ulpius <a href=/people/11063 target=_blank>Crinitus</a>, already a man of consular rank, even as through your decision he is straightway to become a consular. </p>                        </div>

Now let this most courageous man receive our assistance. 6 Therefore come, ye pontiffs, and do ye, pure and cleansed and holy, attired as is meet and with spirits sanctified, ascend to the temple, deck the benches with laurel, and with veiled hands unroll the volumes, and inquire into the fate of the commonwealth, that fate which is unchanging. And finally, do ye also enjoin a sacred song upon those boys who may lawfully aid in the ceremonies.

Though at other times a most excellent man, he did, in fact, employ his power too much like a tyrant, for in slaying the leaders of the revolts he used too bloody a method of checking what should have been cured by milder means. 6 For he even killed some senators of noble birth, though the charges against them were trivial and could have been held in disdain by a more lenient prince, and they were attested either by a single witness or by one who was himself trivial or held in but little esteem. 7 Why say more? By the blow of a graver ill-repute he then marred that rule which had previously been great and of which high hopes were cherished, and not without reason. 8 Then men ceased to love and began to fear an excellent prince, some asserting that such an emperor should be hated and not desired, others that he was a good physician indeed, but the methods he used for healing were bad. 9 Then, since all that happened made it seem possible that some such thing might occur again, as had happened under <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, after asking advice from the senate, he extended the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FWAu class=place long=12.5006 lat=41.8731>walls</a> of the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>.

He brought the dead back to life, he said and did many things beyond the power of man. If any one should wish to learn these, let him read the Greek books which have been composed concerning his life. 9 I myself, moreover, if the length of my life shall permit and the plan shall continue to meet with his favour, will put into writing the deeds of this great man, even though it be briefly, not because his achievements need the tribute of my discourse, but in order that these wondrous things may be proclaimed by the voice of every man. </p>                        </div>

This list he read to the various persons whose names were contained therein, adding that <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> had made arrangements to have them all put to death, and that, if they were really men, they should save their lives. 6 Thereupon all were aroused, those who had deserved his anger being moved by fear, and those who were innocent by sorrow, since <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> seemed ungrateful for their services and their fidelity, and so they suddenly attacked the Emperor while on the march in the aforesaid place, and put him to death. </p>                        </div>

For none of those who have erred or committed crime will we suffer to be our emperor. <br />3 To this a reply was made by decree of the senate.

With regard to the choice of an emperor, indeed, you should refer it, I think, to this army. 14 For in a proposal of this kind, unless that which is urged be done, there is both danger for those who are chosen and odium for those who choose. 15 The proposal of <a href=/people/3256 target=_blank>Tacitus</a> found favour; but after the matter had been referred back again and again, by decree of the senate <a href=/people/3256 target=_blank>Tacitus</a>, as we shall relate in his Life, was chosen as emperor. </p>                        </div>

Among the various ways in which, with the aid of the gods, we have benefited the Roman commonwealth, there is nothing in which I take greater pride than that by adding an ounce I have increased every kind of grain for the city. 3 And to the end that this may be lasting, I have appointed additional boatmen on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and on the river in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, I have built up the banks of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, I have dug out the shallow places in its rising bed, I have taken vows to the god and the Goddess of Perpetual Harvests, and I have consecrated a statue of fostering <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a>. 4 It is now your task, my dearest Arabianus, to make every effort that my arrangements may not be in vain.

He planned, therefore, to pay their price to the owners of these uncultivated lands, provided they wished to sell, and to settle thereon families of slaves captured in war, and then to plant the hills with vines, and by this means to produce wine, which was to yield no profit to the privy-purse but to be given entirely to the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. He had also made provision for the vats, the casks, the ships, and the labour. 3 Many, however, say that <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> was cut off before he carried this out, others that he was restrained by his prefect of the guard, who is said to have remarked: If we give wine to the Roman people, it only remains for us to give them also chickens and geese. 4 There is, indeed, proof that <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> really considered this measure, or, rather, made arrangements for carrying it out and even did so to some extent; for wine belonging to the privy-purse is stored in the porticos of the Temple of the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, which the people could obtain, not free of cost but at a price. 5 It should be known, however, that he thrice distributed largess among them, and that he gave to the Roman people white tunics with long sleeves, brought from the various provinces, and pure linen ones from Africa and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and that he was the first to give handkerchiefs to the Roman people, to be waved in showing approval. </p>                        </div>

He permitted the senators to have runners dressed like his own. 8 He forbade the keeping of free-born women as concubines, and limited the possession of eunuchs to those who had a senator's rating, for the reason that they had reached inordinate prices. 9 His silver vessels never went beyond thirty pounds in weight, and his banquets consisted mostly of roasted meats.
