At the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> feast <a href=/people/5040 target=_blank>Hermochares</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> saw her dancing round the altar of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376243PKar class=place long=24.33 lat=37.56>Carthaea</a> and fell in love with her. He wrote on an apple and threw it inside the sanctuary of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>. <a href=/people/4130 target=_blank>Ctesylla</a> picked it up and read out what was on it. Written on it was an oath: 'Yes, by <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, 1 will marry <a href=/people/5040 target=_blank>Hermochares</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>.' <a href=/people/4130 target=_blank>Ctesylla</a> then hurled away the apple, blushing, badly upset at being tricked as <a href=/people/7156 target=_blank>Acontius</a> had tricked <a href=/people/2679 target=_blank>Cydippe</a>. <a href=/people/5040 target=_blank>Hermochares</a> went to her father for her hand and received approval for the marriage. Her father swore an oath to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> about this, grasping a laurel tree. But after the period of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> feast was over, <a href=/people/2585 target=_blank>Alcidamas</a> forgot the oath he had sworn and betrothed his daughter to someone else. The girl was already taking part in prenuptial sacrifices in the sanctuary of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>. Angry at being thwarted of his marriage, <a href=/people/5040 target=_blank>Hermochares</a> raced to the Artemisium. Seeing him, the girl fell in love with him, as was divinely intended. With the help of her nurse she came to an understanding with him and, evading her father, sailed off by night to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> where she married <a href=/people/5040 target=_blank>Hermochares</a>. When <a href=/people/4130 target=_blank>Ctesylla</a> gave birth to a child, she badly miscarried — by divine will — and died because her father had been false to his oath about her. They took her body and carried it away to prepare it for burial. But a dove flew up from the bier and the body of <a href=/people/4130 target=_blank>Ctesylla</a> disappeared. <a href=/people/5040 target=_blank>Hermochares</a> went to consult the oracle and the god declared that he should set up at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376243PIou class=place long=24.341 lat=37.642>Iulis</a> a sanctuary of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> <a href=/people/4130 target=_blank>Ctesylla</a>. He also enjoined the same to the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376243IKeo class=place long=24.3333 lat=37.6167>Ceos</a>. To this day they offer sacrifices, the<a about=https://topostext.org/place/376243PIou class=place long=24.341 lat=37.642>Iulitans</a> addressing her as <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> <a href=/people/4130 target=_blank>Ctesylla</a>, the rest calling her <a href=/people/4130 target=_blank>Ctesylla</a> <a href=/people/4551 target=_blank>Hecaerge</a> (working from afar). </p>                        </div>

His wife <a href=/people/1122 target=_blank>Althaea</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/994 target=_blank>Thestius</a>, gave him as sons <a href=/people/315 target=_blank>Meleager</a>, Phereus, Ageleos, <a href=/people/3733 target=_blank>Toxeus</a>, <a href=/people/1302 target=_blank>Clymenus</a> and <a href=/people/2023 target=_blank>Periphas</a>, and as daughters, <a href=/people/2818 target=_blank>Gorge</a>, <a href=/people/8642 target=_blank>Eurymede</a>, <a href=/people/728 target=_blank>Deianira</a> and <a href=/people/1684 target=_blank>Melanippe</a>. Once, when he was sacrificing first-fruits on behalf of his country, he forgot about <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>. In her anger she set on them a savage <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> that ravaged the land, slaying many. Then <a href=/people/315 target=_blank>Meleager</a> and the sons of <a href=/people/994 target=_blank>Thestius</a> assembled the flower of Greece against the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>. They arrived and slew the beast. <a href=/people/315 target=_blank>Meleager</a> assigned the flesh of the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> to the heroes, keeping the head and the hide as his privilege. Because they had slain a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> sacred to her, <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> was even more angry and inflicted discord among them. So the sons of <a href=/people/994 target=_blank>Thestius</a> and the other <a href=/people/414 target=_blank>Curetes</a> seized the hide declaring that it was the half-share of the perquisites due to them. <a href=/people/315 target=_blank>Meleager</a> took it away from them forcibly and killed the sons of <a href=/people/994 target=_blank>Thestius</a>. Because of this war arose between the <a href=/people/414 target=_blank>Curetes</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384215UKal class=ethnic long=21.533 lat=38.372>Calydonians</a>. But <a href=/people/315 target=_blank>Meleager</a> did not go out to war, full of reproaches because his mother had put a curse on him for the killing of her brothers. By this time the <a href=/people/414 target=_blank>Curetes</a> were just on the point of capturing the city when <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, his wife, persuaded <a href=/people/315 target=_blank>Meleager</a> to defend the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384215UKal class=ethnic long=21.533 lat=38.372>Calydonians</a>. He rose up against the army of the <a href=/people/414 target=_blank>Curetes</a> and himself died because his mother had burnt the brand which had been given to her by the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a>. For they had assigned him a stretch of life to last only as long as the brand. The other sons of <a href=/people/490 target=_blank>Oineus</a> also died in battle. A great sorrow came upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384215UKal class=ethnic long=21.533 lat=38.372>Calydonians</a> because of <a href=/people/315 target=_blank>Meleager</a>. His sisters mourned continually at his tomb until <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> touched them with her wand and changed them into birds which she settled on the isle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372269PLer class=place long=26.8547 lat=37.158>Leros</a>, calling them <a href=/people/7955 target=_blank>Meleagrides</a>. It is said that up to now they make mourning for <a href=/people/315 target=_blank>Meleager</a> when the due season of the year comes. Two of the daughters of <a href=/people/1122 target=_blank>Althaea</a>, <a href=/people/2818 target=_blank>Gorge</a> and <a href=/people/728 target=_blank>Deianira</a>, were not changed, it is said, by the good will of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> because <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> granted this favour. </p>                        </div>

But when the Teucrians omitted neglectfully to make sacrifices to <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> at the due season, the god became angry and destroyed the crops of the goddess. And he set on them a prodigious monster that came out of the sea. Unable to endure the monster and the famine, the Teucrians sent a message to <a href=/people/2052 target=_blank>Hierax</a> begging him to save them from the famine. He sent them barley as well as wheat and other foods. <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, infuriated with <a href=/people/2052 target=_blank>Hierax</a> for doing away with his prerogatives, turned him into a bird which to this day is called the hierax [hawk].

While he was pasturing his <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> and <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> introduced themselves to him since they wanted a decision about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392210PAmb class=place long=20.9899 lat=39.155>Ambracia</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>. <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> said that the city belonged to him because <a href=/people/2127 target=_blank>Melaneus</a> — his son — had become king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383243RDry class=ethnic long=24.2 lat=38.2>Dryopes</a> having taken in war the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>. <a href=/people/2127 target=_blank>Melaneus</a> had as sons <a href=/people/1156 target=_blank>Eurytus</a> and Ambracias, after whom the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392210PAmb class=place long=20.9899 lat=39.155>Ambracia</a> is named. <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> himself had shown great favour to this city. At his behest the Sisyphides had arrived to help the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392210PAmb class=ethnic long=20.9899 lat=39.155>Ambracians</a> win the war they had started against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=ethnic long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirotes</a>. It was because of his oracular answers that <a href=/people/1265 target=_blank>Gorgus</a>, brother of <a href=/people/744 target=_blank>Cypselus</a>, led a settlement of colonists from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392210PAmb class=place long=20.9899 lat=39.155>Ambracia</a>. Also, because of his oracles the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392210PAmb class=ethnic long=20.9899 lat=39.155>Ambraciotes</a> arose against <a href=/people/1755 target=_blank>Phalaecus</a>, tyrant of the city. And as a result of this, <a href=/people/1755 target=_blank>Phalaecus</a> lost many of his men. On the whole, though <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> had many a time stirred up intestinal war, discord and factions in the city, he had also, in contrast, created order, law and justice, for which to this day he was lauded by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392210PAmb class=ethnic long=20.9899 lat=39.155>Ambracians</a> as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=person long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> <a href=/people/1517 target=_blank>Saviour</a> in feasts and ceremonies. <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> on her part was for keeping her dispute with <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> within bounds, but claimed that she had acquired <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392210PAmb class=place long=20.9899 lat=39.155>Ambracia</a> with his consent. She wanted to have the city on the following argument. When <a href=/people/1755 target=_blank>Phalaecus</a> had ruled as tyrant over the city, no one could kill him because they feared him. But it was she who one day made a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> cub appear before <a href=/people/1755 target=_blank>Phalaecus</a> when he was hunting. The moment he took it up into his hands, its mother raced out of the forest, fell on him and ripped open his chest. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392210PAmb class=ethnic long=20.9899 lat=39.155>Ambraciotes</a>, having escaped his enslavement, made expiatory offerings to her as <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> the Queen and set up an image of the Huntress by which they placed a bronze statue of the animal. <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> in his turn put forward the argument that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392210PAmb class=place long=20.9899 lat=39.155>Ambracia</a> and the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> belonged to him. All the peoples that had made war with him, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403197RCha class=ethnic long=19.7 lat=40.3>Chaonians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394204RThp class=ethnic long=20.4 lat=39.4>Thesprotians</a> and all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=ethnic long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirotes</a>, had been defeated by him after they had formed an alliance to steal the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> of <a href=/people/894 target=_blank>Geryon</a>. Some time after, a settlement of colonists from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a> had expelled the original settlers and founded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392210PAmb class=place long=20.9899 lat=39.155>Ambracia</a>.

The gods loved him for his piety and mortals because he was generous and just. When he saw <a href=/people/6022 target=_blank>Timandre</a> he fell in love with her. Learning that she was a widow with no man in her life, he won her over with money and visited her house regularly to make love. <a href=/people/4622 target=_blank>Neophron</a>, son of <a href=/people/6022 target=_blank>Timandre</a>, disapproved of this affair — he was the same age as <a href=/people/3751 target=_blank>Aegypius</a> — and devised a trap for him. Offering many presents to <a href=/people/4458 target=_blank>Bulis</a> the mother of <a href=/people/3751 target=_blank>Aegypius</a>, he seduced her and took her home to sleep with him. He had learned in advance at what hour <a href=/people/3751 target=_blank>Aegypius</a> was accustomed to visit <a href=/people/6022 target=_blank>Timandre</a> and found a pretext for keeping his own mother away from her house. In her place he brought into the house the mother of <a href=/people/3751 target=_blank>Aegypius</a>, saying that he would return to her later, deceiving both. <a href=/people/3751 target=_blank>Aegypius</a>, having no inkling of what <a href=/people/4622 target=_blank>Neophron</a> was plotting against him, had intercourse with his mother, thinking she was <a href=/people/6022 target=_blank>Timandre</a>. When sleep overcame him, <a href=/people/4458 target=_blank>Bulis</a> recognized her own son. She picked up a sword and was about to put out his eyes and then to kill herself when, by the will of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, sleep let go its hold on <a href=/people/3751 target=_blank>Aegypius</a>. Realizing what <a href=/people/4622 target=_blank>Neophron</a> had plotted against him, he looked up to heaven and prayed that he should vanish — and all with him. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> turned them into birds. <a href=/people/3751 target=_blank>Aegypius</a> and <a href=/people/4622 target=_blank>Neophron</a> became vultures, each under the same name but different in size and colour. <a href=/people/4622 target=_blank>Neophron</a> became the smaller kind of vulture. <a href=/people/4458 target=_blank>Bulis</a> became a heron and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> ordained that she was to eat nothing that grew out the ground and instead to feed on the eyes of fishes, birds and <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a>, since she had been about to put out the eyes of her son <a href=/people/3751 target=_blank>Aegypius</a>. <a href=/people/6022 target=_blank>Timandre</a> he turned into a tit.

Because of the pre-eminence of his good works, men took away honours due to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and decided that they belonged to <a href=/people/2023 target=_blank>Periphas</a>.

Autonous, son of <a href=/people/2127 target=_blank>Melaneus</a> and <a href=/people/1389 target=_blank>Hippodamia</a>, had as sons <a href=/people/5641 target=_blank>Erodius</a>, Anthus, <a href=/people/1865 target=_blank>Schoeneus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404239PAka class=place long=23.888 lat=40.392>Acanthus</a>, with a daughter Acanthis to whom the gods granted great beauty. Autonous acquired many herds of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> which were pastured by his wife <a href=/people/1389 target=_blank>Hippodamia</a> and their children. Now because he neglected husbandry, no crops were produced by the extensive lands of Autonous which bore only rushes and thistles. For this reason he named his children after such plants: <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404239PAka class=place long=23.888 lat=40.392>Acanthus</a>, <a href=/people/1865 target=_blank>Schoeneus</a> and Acanthis, and his oldest son <a href=/people/5641 target=_blank>Erodius</a>, because his lands had been eroded. <a href=/people/5641 target=_blank>Erodius</a> was extremely fond of these herds of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> which he pastured in the meadows. When Anthus, son of Autonous, drove the mares out of the meadows, keeping them out from their pastures, they were infuriated and set upon Anthus. They began to devour him as he uttered many a cry to the gods to save him. Now his father, panic-stricken through distress, faltered — as did the servant of the youth — and failed to drive off the mares. The mother went on battling with the mares, but because of weakness of body was unable to do anything to avert the slaughter. While these people were bewailing Anthus who was hardly dead, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> felt pity for them and turned them all into birds. Autonous was made a quail because, though father of Anthus, he had quailed at driving off the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. The mother was turned into a lark with a crested head because she had headed for the mares to fight for her son against them. They turned Anthus himself, as well as <a href=/people/5641 target=_blank>Erodius</a>, <a href=/people/1865 target=_blank>Schoeneus</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404239PAka class=place long=23.888 lat=40.392>Acanthus</a> and Acanthyllis into birds called by the same names as they had before they were metamorphosed. They turned the servant who had attended Anthus into a heron [erodios] — the same as happened to <a href=/people/5641 target=_blank>Erodius</a> the brother of the lad, Anthus — but not the same sort of heron. For it is distinguishably smaller than the dark variety. Now this heron does not associate with the anthus bird just as the anthus bird does not associate with <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, because Anthus had suffered so much from <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>.

By the foothills of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385226LPar class=place long=22.6219 lat=38.5354>Parnassus</a>, towards the south, there is a mountain called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225LKir class=place long=22.499 lat=38.462>Cirphis</a>, lying near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384225UKri class=place long=22.469 lat=38.4712>Crisa</a>. Inside it there is to this day a huge cave in which lived a great and prodigious beast. Some called it <a href=/people/694 target=_blank>Lamia</a>, though others called it Sybaris. Every day this monster would issue forth, snatching flocks in the fields, as well as people. The inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> had for some time been considering emigration and they asked the oracle to what land they should emigrate. The god told them that they would be delivered from this menace if they remained and were willing to abandon by the cave a youth chosen from the citizens. They did as the god told them. By lot <a href=/people/2369 target=_blank>Alcyoneus</a>, son of <a href=/people/9273 target=_blank>Diomus</a> and Meganira, was chosen. Only son of his father, he possessed beauty in both appearance and the nature of his character. The priests crowned <a href=/people/2369 target=_blank>Alcyoneus</a> and led him towards the cave of Sybaris. By divine inspiration, Eurybarus son of <a href=/people/1508 target=_blank>Euphemus</a>, a descendant of the River <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411225WAxi class=place long=22.6611 lat=40.7223>Axius</a>, a young man but brave, happened to be coming from <a href=/people/4950 target=_blank>Curetis</a> and encountered the youth as he was being led forward. Stricken by love for him, and asking why they were so proceeding, he thought it dreadful not to defend him to the utmost and just allow the youth to perish wretchedly. Tearing off the chaplets from <a href=/people/2369 target=_blank>Alcyoneus</a>, he placed them on his own head and gave orders that he himself should be led forward instead of the youth. As soon as the priests had led him up to the cavern, he ran in and hauled out Sybaris from her lair, carrying her into the open and hurling her from the crags. Tumbling down, she struck her head against the footings of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384225UKri class=place long=22.469 lat=38.4712>Crisa</a>. Because of this wound she faded from sight.

The daughters of <a href=/people/1921 target=_blank>Minyas</a>, son of <a href=/people/3289 target=_blank>Orchomenus</a>, were <a href=/people/2075 target=_blank>Leucippe</a>, Arsippe and Alcathoe.

To him <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a> did grant the gift of never feeling full in the stomach after eating, whatever quantity he might take in. <a href=/people/2129 target=_blank>Pandareos</a> had a daughter called <a href=/people/2696 target=_blank>Aedon</a>. <a href=/people/3941 target=_blank>Polytechnus</a> the carpenter, who lived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=place long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophon</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a>, married her. For a long time their life together was a delight for them. They had an only child, <a href=/people/1861 target=_blank>Itys</a>. While they honoured the gods they were happy, but one day they blurted out the needless remark that they loved each other more than did <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> found what was said to be insupportable and sent Discord between them to create strife in their activities. <a href=/people/3941 target=_blank>Polytechnus</a> was on the point of finishing off a standing board for a chariot and <a href=/people/2696 target=_blank>Aedon</a> of completing the web she was weaving. They agreed that whoever of the two would finish the task more quickly would hand over a female servant to the other. <a href=/people/2696 target=_blank>Aedon</a> was the quicker in finishing off her web (<a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> had helped her in the task). <a href=/people/3941 target=_blank>Polytechnus</a> was infuriated by the victory of <a href=/people/2696 target=_blank>Aedon</a> and went to <a href=/people/2129 target=_blank>Pandareos</a> pretending that he had been sent by <a href=/people/2696 target=_blank>Aedon</a> to fetch her sister, <a href=/people/2040 target=_blank>Chelidon</a>, <a href=/people/2129 target=_blank>Pandareos</a>, suspecting nothing sinister, handed her over to take back with him. <a href=/people/3941 target=_blank>Polytechnus</a>, when he had got hold of the girl, used her shamefully in a copse. He then gave her different clothes and cut the hair on her head short, threatening her with death if she should ever mention the incident to <a href=/people/2696 target=_blank>Aedon</a>. Returning to his house he handed over her sister to <a href=/people/2696 target=_blank>Aedon</a> as a servant, according to the agreement. <a href=/people/2696 target=_blank>Aedon</a> ground her down with work until one day Chelidonis, holding her pitcher, made many lamentations at a spring and <a href=/people/2696 target=_blank>Aedon</a> overheard what she was saying. After they had recognized each other and embraced, they plotted vengeance against <a href=/people/3941 target=_blank>Polytechnus</a>. They chopped up the son of <a href=/people/2696 target=_blank>Aedon</a>, put his flesh in a cauldron and cooked it. Then <a href=/people/2696 target=_blank>Aedon</a> called on a neighbour of hers to bid <a href=/people/3941 target=_blank>Polytechnus</a> feast on the meat. She then went off with her sister to her father <a href=/people/2129 target=_blank>Pandareos</a> and described the sorrows they had undergone. When <a href=/people/3941 target=_blank>Polytechnus</a> realized that he had eaten the flesh of his son he set off in pursuit of them, to their father's. The servants of <a href=/people/2129 target=_blank>Pandareos</a> took hold of him and tied him with inescapable bonds because he had committed such an outrage on the house of <a href=/people/2129 target=_blank>Pandareos</a>. They smeared his body with honey and hurled him into a sheepfold. Flies descended and began to do their worst with him. <a href=/people/2696 target=_blank>Aedon</a> took pity on him because of their former love and kept the flies off <a href=/people/3941 target=_blank>Polytechnus</a>. When her parents and her brother observed what she was doing, they were overcome by a hatred for her and set about killing her. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, before a greater evil should befall the house of <a href=/people/2129 target=_blank>Pandareos</a>, took pity on them and turned them all into birds. Some took wing for the sea while others took wing for the sky. <a href=/people/2129 target=_blank>Pandareos</a> became a sea <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> and the mother of <a href=/people/2696 target=_blank>Aedon</a> a halcyon (kingfisher). They immediately wanted to hurl themselves into the sea, but <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> prevented this. These birds became propitious for those who sailed the sea. <a href=/people/3941 target=_blank>Polytechnus</a>, when he changed, became a woodpecker because <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a> had given him an axe for his work as a carpenter. This bird is of good omen for carpenters. The brother of <a href=/people/2696 target=_blank>Aedon</a> became a hoopoe, a bird of good omen when it appears, both for sailors as well as for landfarers, especially when in company with the sea <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> and more so if with the halcyon. As to <a href=/people/2696 target=_blank>Aedon</a> and Chelidonis, the former mourns her son <a href=/people/1861 target=_blank>Itys</a> by streams and in copses while the latter has become by the will of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> a sharer of the dwelling places of mankind. For she had forcibly lost her virginity and had made many cries to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> for help. </p>                        </div>

He was of fine appearance, but graceless and boorish in character. He was extraordinarily devoted to hunting. He lived in the country between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384214PPle class=place long=21.417 lat=38.402>Pleuron</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384215UKal class=place long=21.533 lat=38.372>Calydon</a>. There were many who became his lovers because of his beauty. Because of his disdainfulness <a href=/people/853 target=_blank>Cycnus</a> attained understanding with no one. Very soon he came to be thoroughly disliked by his admirers and abandoned by them. <a href=/people/3664 target=_blank>Phylius</a> alone stood by him. But <a href=/people/853 target=_blank>Cycnus</a> treated him with immoderate arrogance. At that time there appeared among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=ethnic long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aitolians</a> a great monster of a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> that savaged the inhabitants and their flocks. <a href=/people/853 target=_blank>Cycnus</a> ordered <a href=/people/3664 target=_blank>Phylius</a> to kill the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> without using a weapon. He promised to do so and made away with the animal by the following trick. Knowing at what hour the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> was going to go prowling, he filled his stomach with a great deal of food and wine. When the beast came up, <a href=/people/3664 target=_blank>Phylius</a> sicked up the food. The <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>, hungry, availed himself of this food and was spiked down by the wine. <a href=/people/3664 target=_blank>Phylius</a>, throwing his arm round the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>, blocked his maw with the clothing he wore. Having killed the beast, he put it on his shoulders and carried it to <a href=/people/853 target=_blank>Cycnus</a>. He gained wide renown for this achievement. <a href=/people/853 target=_blank>Cycnus</a> then demanded an even stranger feat. There had appeared in this land some vultures, monstrous and enormous. They killed many people. <a href=/people/853 target=_blank>Cycnus</a> ordered him to catch them alive and to bring them to him, by whatever method. <a href=/people/3664 target=_blank>Phylius</a> was wondering how he was to achieve this task when, by divine intervention, an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> that had snatched up a hare let it fall half-dead before it could take it to its eyrie. <a href=/people/3664 target=_blank>Phylius</a> tore open the hare, besmeared himself with the blood and lay on the ground. The birds swooped on him as a cadaver. <a href=/people/3664 target=_blank>Phylius</a> caught hold of two birds by their legs and, getting a good hold, carried them off to <a href=/people/853 target=_blank>Cycnus</a>. <a href=/people/853 target=_blank>Cycnus</a> then imposed on him an even more difficult feat. He ordered him to carry a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> away from its herd, using only his hands, and to haul it off all the way to the altar of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. <a href=/people/3664 target=_blank>Phylius</a>, not knowing how he was to accomplish the task, prayed to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> to assist him in this. In answer to this prayer there came into view two <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>, both in rut for a <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>; they butted with their horns hurling each other to the ground. When he saw the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> sprawling helplessly, <a href=/people/3664 target=_blank>Phylius</a> caught one by the leg and dragged it off to the altar. <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> desired him to pay no more attention to the orders of that youth. <a href=/people/853 target=_blank>Cycnus</a> felt fearsomely and unexpectedly disgraced. In his depression he flung himself into the lake called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386213UKon class=place long=21.299 lat=38.572>Conope</a> and was seen no more. After his death, his mother, <a href=/people/10405 target=_blank>Thyrie</a>, threw herself into the same lake. By the will of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> they both became lake birds. After their disappearance, the lake's name was changed and became the Swan Lake. Many swans appear there at ploughing time. The tomb of <a href=/people/3664 target=_blank>Phylius</a> stands nearby. </p>                        </div>

In fear of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> because of her own intercourse with <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, his mother exposed the child in a wood. By the will of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the child was not lost to sight but was fed by <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> and began to grow. As he was pasturing his <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, Phagrus, son of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> and <a href=/people/8077 target=_blank>Othreis</a> the nymph (the same as the mother of this babe in the wood), chanced to come across him. Marvelling at how well-fed the child was, and even more at the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>, he gathered him up and took him home. He brought him up with great care and gave him the name <a href=/people/9780 target=_blank>Meliteus</a> because he had been nourished by <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>. He also recalled the oracle in which the god had once told him that he was the one to save someone of the same kin that had been reared by <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>. The lad, as soon as he had become of age, grew into a man of nobility and came to rule over many people of the region and founded a city in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393223RPht class=place long=22.5 lat=39.2>Phthia</a> which he called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390225UMel class=place long=22.457 lat=39.037>Melite</a>. But there arose in this same <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390225UMel class=place long=22.457 lat=39.037>Melite</a> a violent and arrogant tyrant whom the inhabitants could not bring themselves to name. By foreigners he was called <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a>. Whenever any maiden from the neighbourhood began to be famed for her beauty, he would lead her off and have forcible intercourse with her before her marriage. Thus it was that one day he bade his men fetch <a href=/people/5480 target=_blank>Aspalis</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/12140 target=_blank>Argaeus</a>, one of the notables. When the girl heard about this order, she hanged herself before the arrival of those who were to fetch her away. This deed had not yet got about when her brother, <a href=/people/8911 target=_blank>Astygites</a>, swore to slay the tyrant before his sister's body was cut down. He swiftly put on garments of <a href=/people/5480 target=_blank>Aspalis</a> and hid a sword on his left side and escaped scrutiny, being still a youngster. Entering the house, he killed the tyrant who was unarmed and unguarded. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390225UMel class=ethnic long=22.457 lat=39.037>Meliteans</a> put a festal crown on <a href=/people/8911 target=_blank>Astygites</a> and led him in procession with paeans. The body of the tyrant was thrown into a river and pushed under. From that time the river has been called <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a>. They made every effort to find the body of <a href=/people/5480 target=_blank>Aspalis</a> in order to offer it splendid obsequies, but they could not find it. For it had disappeared by divine will. Instead of the body, there appeared her statue standing by that of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, This statue is called by local people <a href=/people/5480 target=_blank>Aspalis</a> Ameilete <a href=/people/4551 target=_blank>Hecaerge</a>.

They were all good and just and the gods loved them. When one night they were in the fields some raiders came up and tried to capture them. The family shot at them from towers (not being able to equal them in fight) but the robbers sent fiery arrows into the buildings. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, because of their piety, could not overlook that their lives were ending in a pitiable death. He changed them all into birds. <a href=/people/6112 target=_blank>Hyperippe</a>, who had fled the flames by diving into water, was turned into a shearwater.

Their land furnished them with plentiful crops because they worshipped its goddess alone and cultivated her soil diligently. They had nothing to do with people and did not go to town for solemn banquets and festivals of the gods, instead, if someone about to sacrifice to <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> invited the girls, their brother would decline the invitation. He said he had no affection for a goddess with grey eyes because these girls had black eyes — and he utterly disliked the <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a> as a bird. If there were invitations to a feast of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, he said that he hated a goddess who wandered about at night. If asked to go to pour libations to <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, he said he did not respect a god who was a thief. They frequently went in for this this sort of insult. <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> and <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> and <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> were infuriated and one night made their way to their house. <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> and <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> were in the shape of girls while <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> wore the smock of a shepherd.

When <a href=/people/1498 target=_blank>Galatea</a> became pregnant, <a href=/people/3033 target=_blank>Lamprus</a> prayed to have a son and said plainly to his wife that she was to expose her child if it was a daughter. When <a href=/people/3033 target=_blank>Lamprus</a> had gone off to tend his flocks, <a href=/people/1498 target=_blank>Galatea</a> gave birth to a daughter. Feeling pity for her babe, she counted on the remoteness of their house and — backed by dreams and seers telling her to bring up the girl as a boy - deceived <a href=/people/3033 target=_blank>Lamprus</a> by saying she had given birth to a son and brought the child up as a boy, giving it the name <a href=/people/935 target=_blank>Leucippus</a>. As the girl grew up she became unutterably beautiful. Because it was no longer possible to hide this, <a href=/people/1498 target=_blank>Galatea</a>, fearing <a href=/people/3033 target=_blank>Lamprus</a>, fled to the sanctuary of <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a> and made many a prayer to her that the child might become a boy instead of a girl, just as had happened to <a href=/people/3281 target=_blank>Caenis</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/8614 target=_blank>Atrax</a>, who by the will of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> became <a href=/people/1256 target=_blank>Caeneus</a> the <a href=/people/721 target=_blank>Lapith</a>. So also <a href=/people/468 target=_blank>Tiresias</a> changed from man to woman because he had encountered and killed two <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> that had been mating at a crossroads. He changed again from woman back to man by killing another <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>. <a href=/people/1980 target=_blank>Hypermestra</a> had frequently sold her body in the form of a woman for a fee, becoming a man to bring food for her father, <a href=/people/2490 target=_blank>Aethon</a>. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a>, Siproites, had also been turned into a woman for having seen <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> bathing when out hunting. <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a> took pity on <a href=/people/1498 target=_blank>Galatea</a> because of her unremitting and distressed prayers and changed the sex of the child into a boy's.

For this sacrifice of <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> was a source of pleasure for the god only if carried out by the <a href=/people/801 target=_blank>Hyperboreans</a>. Terrified by this threat, <a href=/people/4933 target=_blank>Clinis</a> sent the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> away from the altar and passed on to his children the words he had heard.

She scorned the activities of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> and went to the mountains as a companion and sharer of sports with <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>. <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, whose activities <a href=/people/5918 target=_blank>Polyphonte</a> had failed to honour, made her fail in love with a bear and drove her mad. By demonic urge she went on heat and coupled with this bear. <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> seeing her was utterly disgusted with her and turned all beasts against her. <a href=/people/5918 target=_blank>Polyphonte</a>, fearing that the beasts would make an end of her, fled and reached her father's house. She brought forth two children, <a href=/people/2084 target=_blank>Agrius</a> and <a href=/people/5851 target=_blank>Orius</a>, huge and of immense strength. They honoured neither god nor man but scorned them all. If they met a stranger they would haul him home to eat, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> loathed them and sent <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> to punish them in whatever way he chose. <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> decided to chop off their hands and feet. But <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>, since the family of <a href=/people/5918 target=_blank>Polyphonte</a> descended from him, snatched her sons from this fate. With the help of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> he changed them into birds. <a href=/people/5918 target=_blank>Polyphonte</a> became a small <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a> whose voice is heard at night. She does not eat or drink and keeps her head turned down and the tips of her feet turned up. She is a portent of war and sedition for mankind. <a href=/people/5851 target=_blank>Orius</a> became an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a>, a bird that presages little good to anyone when it appears. <a href=/people/2084 target=_blank>Agrius</a> was changed into a vulture, the bird most detested by gods and men. These gods gave him an utter craving for human flesh and blood. Their female servant was changed into a woodpecker. As she was changing her shape she prayed to the gods not to become a bird evil for mankind. <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> and <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> heard her prayer because she had by necessity done what her masters had ordered. This is a bird of good omen for someone going hunting or to feasts. </p>                        </div>

He had numerous flocks and herded them himself. <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> would help him since he delighted them as he sang among the mountains. He is said to have been the best singer of those days and was famous for his rural songs. In those hills he devised the shepherd's pipes and was the first of mankind to play the lyre, composing many beautiful songs. It is said that because of this the nymphs one day became visible to <a href=/people/9099 target=_blank>Cerambus</a> as they danced to the strumming of his lyre. <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a>, in good will, gave him this advice: to leave <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390227LOth class=place long=22.7097 lat=39.0169>Othrys</a> and pasture his flocks on the plain, for the coming winter was going to be exceptionally and unbelievably severe. <a href=/people/9099 target=_blank>Cerambus</a>, with the arrogance of youth, decided — as though smitten by some god — not to drive his beasts from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390227LOth class=place long=22.7097 lat=39.0169>Othrys</a> to the plain. He also uttered graceless and mindless things to the nymphs, saying they were not descended from <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, but that <a href=/people/8627 target=_blank>Deino</a> had given birth to them, with the River <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389225WSpe class=place long=22.467 lat=38.856>Spercheius</a> as the father. He also said that <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, for lust of one of them, Diopatra, had made her sisters put down roots and turned them into poplars until, satiated with his desires, he had returned them to their original shapes. Thus did <a href=/people/9099 target=_blank>Cerambus</a> taunt the nymphs. After a short while there came a sudden frost and the streams froze. Much snow fell on the flocks of <a href=/people/9099 target=_blank>Cerambus</a> and they were lost to sight as well as were the trees and paths. The nymphs, in anger against <a href=/people/9099 target=_blank>Cerambus</a> because of his slanders, changed him into a wood-gnawing <a href=/people/9099 target=_blank>Cerambyx</a> beetle. He can be seen on trunks and has hook-teeth, ever moving his jaws together. He is black, long and has hard wings like a great dung beetle.

Because of this <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> plotted to get the herd of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> belonging to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> that pastured with those of <a href=/people/996 target=_blank>Admetus</a>.

Then he returned to <a href=/people/586 target=_blank>Battus</a> in disguise, testing him to see if he would abide by his oath.

Their manner of dancing, being that of shepherds, was without art, while that of the nymphs was entirety dedicated to beauty.

So, you foolish fellows, now that you have been beaten, you will be punished. The youths, as they stood by the sanctuary of the nymphs, were changed into trees.

She herself herded the flocks of her father. Now, the <a href=/people/11032 target=_blank>Hamadryad</a> <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> were very much attached to her and made her their playmate, teaching her to sing to the gods and to dance. <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, seeing her dancing, felt an urge to couple with her. He first changed himself into a tortoise. <a href=/people/2820 target=_blank>Dryope</a>, with the other nymphs, was amused by it and they made a toy of the tortoise. She placed it in her bosom. He changed from a tortoise to a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>. The frightened nymphs abandoned <a href=/people/2820 target=_blank>Dryope</a>. <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> coupled with her and she ran full of fear to her father's house, saying nothing to her parents. When <a href=/people/10668 target=_blank>Andraemon</a>, son of <a href=/people/1604 target=_blank>Oxylus</a>, later married her, she gave birth to <a href=/people/10662 target=_blank>Amphissus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>.

She devised numerous tricks to deceive her parents and to put off the day of decision, because a dreadful lust, for her father, had driven her mad. At first she hid this fever through shame. But as her passion spurred her on, she told the whole story to her nurse <a href=/people/1735 target=_blank>Hippolyte</a> who promised to find her a remedy for this inordinate passion. She went to <a href=/people/5280 target=_blank>Thias</a> with the message that a girl of exalted parentage desired to lie with him, but secretly. <a href=/people/5280 target=_blank>Thias</a>, who had no idea what was being devised against him, welcomed the proposal. In the dark of the night he waited on his bed for the girl. Then the nurse led in Smyrna with her clothes swathed over her. For a long time this disgraceful and unlawful activity was carried on undiscovered. When Smyrna became pregnant, <a href=/people/5280 target=_blank>Thias</a> felt an urge to learn who the mother of his child was. He hid a light in his quarters and, when Smyrna came to him, she was revealed as the light was suddenly brought out, Smyrna gave birth prematurely to her child and she raised up her arms and prayed that she might no more be seen among the living, nor among the dead. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> changed her into a tree which was called the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> after her name.

When he saw the daughter of <a href=/people/2118 target=_blank>Nicocreon</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=place long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salamis</a>, he fell in love with her. The family of <a href=/people/2118 target=_blank>Nicocreon</a> were descended from <a href=/people/361 target=_blank>Teucer</a> who had helped <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> take <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. Because of this <a href=/people/4864 target=_blank>Arceophon</a> desired a marriage with the girl all the more and he promised to bring many gifts, more than all the other suitors. <a href=/people/2118 target=_blank>Nicocreon</a> refused the proposal because the family of <a href=/people/4864 target=_blank>Arceophon</a> was shamefully ignoble, since his ancestors were <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a>. <a href=/people/4864 target=_blank>Arceophon</a>, failing to win this marriage, went into a greater turmoil of love and every evening frequented the house of <a href=/people/509 target=_blank>Arsinoe</a> and made a night-serenade in company with young men of his own age. Since this activity achieved nothing, he cajoled the girl's nurse to help him with an attempt to seduce her, sending many gifts. He wanted somehow to make love to her without her parents knowing. After the nurse had delivered this proposition, the girl denounced her to her parents. They cut off the tip of the nurse's tongue and her nose as well as her fingers. After this mutilation they pitilessly drove her out of the palace. This act enraged the goddess. <a href=/people/4864 target=_blank>Arceophon</a>, because of his utter distress at the way his marriage had been scorned, died voluntarily of starvation. His fellow citizens felt pity for his death and mourned him. On the third day his relatives brought out his body uncovered. While they were about to carry out the last rites, <a href=/people/509 target=_blank>Arsinoe</a> felt an arrogant urge to lean her body out of the window to view the corpse of <a href=/people/4864 target=_blank>Arceophon</a> being cremated. As she cast glances at him, <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, loathing her character, changed her from her human form into a stone with her feet rooted into the ground. </p>                        </div>

She kidnapped him, keeping him at home as a lover. ... And then <a href=/people/4337 target=_blank>Cephalus</a> put <a href=/people/1460 target=_blank>Procris</a> to a test to see if she was inclined to remain faithful to him. He pretended that he was going out hunting and sent in to <a href=/people/1460 target=_blank>Procris</a> one of his servants who was not known to her, with a great deal of gold. He was instructed to say that a foreign gentleman had fallen in love with her and offered her this gold if she would have intercourse with him. At first <a href=/people/1460 target=_blank>Procris</a> refused the gold but when the man sent double the quantity, she agreed and accepted the proposition. When <a href=/people/4337 target=_blank>Cephalus</a> saw her approaching the house in order to lie with the foreigner, he brought out a flaming torch and discovered her. In her shame <a href=/people/1460 target=_blank>Procris</a> forsook <a href=/people/4337 target=_blank>Cephalus</a> and went off as a fugitive to <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>. She found on arrival that he was afflicted by childlessness and promised a cure, showing him how to beget children. Now <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> would ejaculate <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a>, scorpions and millipedes, killing the women with whom he had intercourse. But his wife <a href=/people/930 target=_blank>Pasiphae</a>, daughter of the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, was immortal. <a href=/people/1460 target=_blank>Procris</a> accordingly devised the following to make <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> fertile. She inserted the bladder of a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> into a woman and <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> first emitted the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> into the bladder; then he went over to <a href=/people/930 target=_blank>Pasiphae</a> and entered her. And when children were born to them, <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> gave <a href=/people/1460 target=_blank>Procris</a> his spear and his <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>. No animal could escape these two and they always reached their target. Accepting them, <a href=/people/1460 target=_blank>Procris</a> went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377241DTho class=place long=24.0516 lat=37.7392>Thoricus</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, where <a href=/people/4337 target=_blank>Cephalus</a> lived, and became a hunter with him. She had altered her clothes and had cut her hair as a man; no one who saw her recognized her. When <a href=/people/4337 target=_blank>Cephalus</a> saw that he never caught anything when hunting, while everything went the way of <a href=/people/1460 target=_blank>Procris</a>, he yearned to have that spear for himself. <a href=/people/1460 target=_blank>Procris</a> promised to give him the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> as well, if he would agree to enjoy her youthful charms. <a href=/people/4337 target=_blank>Cephalus</a> accepted the proposition and when they lay down together, <a href=/people/1460 target=_blank>Procris</a> revealed who she was and reproached him for having committed something far more disgraceful. But <a href=/people/4337 target=_blank>Cephalus</a> acquired the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> and the spear. <a href=/people/495 target=_blank>Amphitryon</a>, who needed the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, went to <a href=/people/4337 target=_blank>Cephalus</a> and asked him if he would be willing to join him, with the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, in going after the <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>Fox</a>. He promised to hand over to him a share of the booty which he would take from the <a href=/people/6003 target=_blank>Teleboeans</a>. For at that time there had appeared in the land of the people of <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a>, a <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>fox</a> that was a monstrous creature. It would regularly issue out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384234UTeu class=place long=23.393 lat=38.3633>Teumessus</a> snatching up <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Cadmeans</a>. Every thirty days they would put out a child for it and the <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>Fox</a> would take it and eat it up. <a href=/people/495 target=_blank>Amphitryon</a> had asked <a href=/people/282 target=_blank>Creon</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Cadmeans</a> to help in making war against the <a href=/people/6003 target=_blank>Teleboeans</a>.

But it had been ordained that the <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>Fox</a> could not be taken by any hunter, and that nothing should escape that <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> when it went hunting. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> saw them when they reached the Plain of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a> and turned them both into stones. </p>                        </div>
