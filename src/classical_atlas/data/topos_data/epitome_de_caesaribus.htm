                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0044.stoa003:i'><b>&sect; i</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE <br />Some twenty years ago, in the course of research on Eunapius of Sardis, two studies of Timothy Barnes drew me to the Epitome de Caesaribus [[1]] My belief that there then existed no published translation in any modern language convinced me that, should the opportunity arise, the production of such a translation, together with a commentary, would be a worthwhile project.[[2]] A 1988 summer research grant from Canisius College allowed me to complete a rough version based on the Teubner text of Franz Pichlmayr and Roland Gruendel.[[3]] Kristin Ennis, my student assistant checked my translation and supervised the collection of scholarship on the Epitome that was to figure in the projected commentary. But resumption of teaching duties and Ms. Ennis' graduation forced a suspension of work on both translation and commentary, and these factors, plus commitments to other research projects and administrative duties, made it impossible to devote any extended period of time to the Epitome. In light of this, I was happy to learn of Harry Bird's plan to do a translation of and commentary on the Epitome for the series Translated Texts for Historians, in which his volumes on Eutropius and Aurelius Victor have already appeared.[[4]] <br />My recent association with the electronic encyclopedia De Imperatoribus Romanis has sent me back to the Epitome in the belief that it might be worthwhile to make my translation, equipped with suitable links to De Imperatoribus Romanis, available in electronic from. These links, I thought, would give to those interested access to some of what would have been included in my commentary, while Professor Bird's forthcoming commentary would doubtless fill any remaining void. Michael DiMaio, of De Imperatoribus Romanis, agreed with my view and oversaw the creation of the necessary connections between encyclopedia and translation. <br />The translation as it stands now is a thorough revision of the draft completed in 1988. It retains the Teubner textual divisions and also includes in boldface type within boldface brackets -- [ ] -- the pagination of that edition. In addition, it reproduces in boldface the Teubner sigla for various textual difficulties: * for a suspected lacuna, † for a suspected corruption, and < > to enclose editorial additions. Greek works employed in the Epitome have been retained, followed by translations within plain brackets, as, for example, at Epitome 16.5: a disorder which the Greeks call [apoplexy]. Likewise, plain brackets enclose translations of cognomina. A few Latin words -- deus, dominatio, dominus, imperator, imperium, paterfamilias, potestas, princeps, procurator, and rex -- have been left untranslated, most because, to my mind, they seemed to convey some important nuance too easily lost in translation. For those uninterested in nuance, their English meanings should appear evident. Proper names of individuals and peoples appear in their latinate form except in very few instances - for example, Constantine rather than Constantinus (which is retained for Constantine's father and for Constantine's son of the same name) and Alans rather than Alani. Valentinian is the emperor from 364-375; Valentinianus, his son, emperor from 375-392. My goal has not been to be consistent, but merely consistent enough. Because Professor Bird's work will contain a full bibliography, none is offered here. Thomas M.

Accordingly, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavian</a>, whose father was <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, a senator, and who was descended in his mother's line through the <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a> family from <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> (but called Gaius Caesar, his grandmother's brother) was then given the cognomen <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> on account of his victory. 3. Placed in control, he, per se, exercised tribunician potestas. 4. The region of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, difficult to enter because of the inundation of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> and impassable because of swamps, he made into a form of province. 5. By the labor of soldiers, he opened canals, which through neglect had been clogged with the slime of ages, to make <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> a bountiful supplier of the city's ration. 6. In his time, two hundred million allotments of grain were imported annually from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> to the city. 7. He joined to the number of provinces for the Roman people the Cantabri and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450010RAqu class=ethnic long=1 lat=45>Aquitani</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469105RRae class=ethnic long=10.47 lat=46.85>Raeti</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/484109UAug class=ethnic long=10.8965 lat=48.3727>Vindelici</a>, Dalmatae.

And he used to say that to be of a boastful and most capricious mind through the ardor of a triumph and on account of a laurel crown -- that is barren, fruitless foliage -- plunged the security of citizens into danger by the uncertain outcomes of battles; 11. and that nothing whatever was more appropriate to a good imperator than temerity: whatever was being done properly, happened quickly enough; 12. and that arms must never be taken up except in the hope of a very significant benefit, lest, because of heavy loss for a trifling reward, the sought-after victory be like a golden hook for fishermen, the damage of which, through its having been broken off or lost, no gain of the catch is able to compensate. 13. In his time, a Roman army and tribunes and propraetor were destroyed beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>. So much did he mourn what had transpired that, made unsightly by his dress, hair, and the remaining symbols of mourning, he struck his head with a powerful blow. 14. He used to censure an innovation of his uncle, too, who, calling the soldiers comrades in novel and charming fashion, while he affected to ingratiate himself, had weakened the auctoritas of the princeps. 15. Indeed, toward citizens he was most clemently disposed. 16. He appeared faithful toward his friends, the most eminent of whom were <a href=/people/1293 target=_blank>Maecenas</a> on account of his taciturnity, <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> on account of his endurance and the self-effacedness of his labor. Moreover, he used to delight in <a href=/people/118 target=_blank>Virgil</a>. He was a rare one, indeed, for making friendships; most steadfast toward retaining them. 17. He was so devoted to liberal studies, especially to eloquence, that no day slipped by, not even on campaign, without him reading, writing, and declaiming. 18. He introduced laws, some new, others revised, [135] in his own name. 19. He added to and ornamented <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> with many structures, glorying in the remark: I found a city of bricks, I left her a city of marble. 20. He was gentle, pleasant, urbane, and of charming disposition, handsome in his entire physique, but with large eyes, rapidly moving the pupils of which, in the fashion of the brightest stars, he used to explain with a smile that men turned from his gaze as from the intense rays of the sun. When a certain soldier averted his eyes from his face and was asked by him why he so behaved, he answered: Because I am unable to bear the lightning of your eyes. </p>                        </div>

For he was somewhat impatient, a bit irascible, secretly envious, openly fatuous; furthermore, moreover, he was most desirous of holding dominion -- more than it is possible to imagine -- , an avid player at dice. 22. And though he was much at table or drink, to a certain degree, in fact, abstaining from sleep, he nevertheless used to gratify his lust to the extent of the dishonor of his public reputation. For he was accustomed to lie among twelve catamites and an equal number of girls. 23. Also, possessed by the love of the wife of another, when his wife <a href=/people/3468 target=_blank>Scribonia</a> had been set aside, he joined <a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a> to himself as if with her husband's consent. Of this <a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a> there were already two sons, <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> and <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>. 24. And while he was a servant of luxury, he was nevertheless a most severe castigator of the same vice, in the manner of men who are relentless in correcting the vices in which they themselves avidly indulge. For he damned to exile the poet <a href=/people/2769 target=_blank>Ovid</a>, also called <a href=/people/3213 target=_blank>Naso</a>, because he wrote for him the three booklets of the Art of <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a>. 25.

Yet some write that he was killed by a deception of <a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a>, who, since she had gained information that <a href=/people/7188 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> (the son of her stepdaughter, [136] whom, as a result of his mother-in-law's hatred, he had relegated to an island) was to be recalled, feared that, when he had obtained control of affairs, she would be punished. 28. Thereupon, the senate resolved that the dead or murdered man should be decorated with numerous and novel honors. For in addition to the title Father of his Country, which it had proclaimed, it dedicated temples to him at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and throughout the most celebrated cities, with all proclaiming openly: Would that he either had not been born or had not died! 29. The first alternative said of a most base beginning, the second of a splendid outcome. For in pursuing the principate he was held an oppressor of liberty and in ruling he so loved the citizens that once, when a three-days' supply of grain was discerned in the storehouses, he would have chosen to die by poison if fleets from the provinces were not arriving in the interim. 30. When these fleets had arrived, the safety of the fatherland was attributed to his felicity. He ruled fifty-six years, twelve with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, but forty-six alone. 31. Certainly he never would have drawn the power of the state to himself or retained it so long if he had not possessed in abundance great gifts of nature and of conscious efforts. </p>                        </div>

Since he used to be called Claudius <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> Nero, he was, because of his drinking, aptly referred to in jests as Caldius Biberius <a href=/people/5787 target=_blank>Mero</a> [Imbiber of Hot, Straight Wine]. 3. Before imperium was assumed, he was, under <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, sagacious enough and fortunate enough in war that not undeservedly was control of the state entrusted to him. 4. He possessed much knowledge of literature. He was quite renowned for eloquence, but in character most base, grim, greedy, insidious, pretending that he wished what he did not; he seemed hostile to those in whose counsel he was taking pleasure, but well-disposed to those whom he despised. 5. He was better in spur-of-the-moment responses and deliberations than in those planned in advance. 6. Indeed, he fictitiously rejected the principate offered him by the senators (which he certainly did with cunning), [137] darkly exploring what each was saying or thinking: an affair which brought ruin to each who was good. 7. For when men who reckoned that he was sincerely declining the immensity of the imperial burden expressed sentiments in favor of his choice in a long speech, they unexpectedly met their final fates. 8. With <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>, their king, removed, he restored <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a> to a province. He suppressed the banditries of the Gaetulii. Marobodus, King of the <a href=/people/11067 target=_blank>Suevi</a>, he shrewdly encompassed. 9.

Before his principate he was accepted by and dear to all, but in his principate he was such that it was commonly said with justification that there had never been a dominus more terrible than he. 4. In fact, he stained his own three sisters with defilement. 5. He went about in the dress of his personal gods; he used to claim that he was <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> on account of his incest, and <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Liber</a>, moreover, from his bacchanalian chorus. 6. I am uncertain whether it will have been proper to write about this for posterity, except perhaps since it helps to know everything about the principes, so that the unfit at least may shun such enormities through fear of their reputation. 7. In his palace, he subjected noble matrons to public wantonness. 8. He first, crowned with a diadem, ordered himself to be called dominus. 9.

When the senate had thought that the family of the Caesars had been exterminated, he was discovered by the soldiers in a hiding place that ill became him, and, since he was simpleminded, he seemed quite harmless to those ignorant men and was made imperator. 3. He was obedient to his stomach, wine, vile lust; simpleminded and almost doltish; lazy and tremulous; subject to the dictates of his freedmen and wife. 4. In his time, <a href=/people/1792 target=_blank>Scribonius</a> <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a> was created imperator in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a> and killed forthwith. The <a href=/people/5772 target=_blank>Mauri</a> set the provinces ablaze; a force of Musulamii was cut to pieces. The Claudian Aqueduct was opened at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. 5. <a href=/people/2634 target=_blank>Messalina</a>, his wife, was from the first indulging indiscriminately in extramarital affairs as if it were her legal prerogative: as a result of what she did, many men who abstained through fear were killed. Then, more violently aroused, she had certain of the more noble wives and maidens put up for sale with herself in the fashion of prostitutes, and males were compelled to attend. But if someone ever bristled at such enormities, he was savaged by means of a contrived charge against himself and his entire family, so that he seemed to be more in the power of the ruling man rather than the ruling wife. 6. In the same way, his freedmen, having attained the highest power, were defiling everything with debaucheries, exile, murder, and proscriptions. 7. From among these men, he made <a href=/people/652 target=_blank>Felix</a> prefect of the legions in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judaea</a>. After the Britannic triumph, to <a href=/people/457 target=_blank>Posidonius</a> the eunuch, [139] along with the bravest of the soldiers, he gave arms and medals for a gift, as if to one who had taken part in the victory. He allowed <a href=/people/160 target=_blank>Polybius</a> to walk between the consuls. <a href=/people/10943 target=_blank>Narcissus</a>, the secretary, used to surpass them all, deporting himself as dominus of the Dominus himself; and <a href=/people/10899 target=_blank>Pallas</a> was exalted by the praetorian insignia. They were so rich that, with him debating about the bankruptcy of the fisc, it was most humorously noised about in a famous elegy that there would be wealth in great profusion for him, if, by the two freedmen, he were admitted into a partnership. 9. In his times, the <a href=/people/1543 target=_blank>Phoenix</a> was seen in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, a bird which they say flies every five hundred years from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a> to remembered locations; and in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381253WAeg class=place long=25.3 lat=38.1>Aegean</a> Sea an island suddenly sank. 10. He married <a href=/people/720 target=_blank>Agrippina</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/2619 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>, his own brother, who, procuring the empire for her own son, first killed her stepchildren in multiform intrigues, then, by poison, her husband himself. 11. He lived sixty-four years; his death was kept secret a long while, as once before in the case of <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> <a href=/people/1008 target=_blank>Priscus</a>. 12.

For indeed he passed the remainder of his life shamelessly, so that it is embarrassing to commemorate any of this. He went so far that, sparing neither his own decency nor that of others, at last, veiled in the manner of a bride-to-be, [140] with dowry paid, with everyone crowding together in festive fashion, he was married in the presence of the senate. Covered with the skin of a wild animal, he used to forage the sexual organs of either sex with his face. He even contaminated with defilement his own mother, whom he afterward killed. After their husbands were slain, he married <a href=/people/722 target=_blank>Octavia</a> and the Sabina with the cognomen <a href=/people/3075 target=_blank>Poppaea</a>. 6. Then <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>, proconsul of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390000RIbe class=place long=-4 lat=39>Hispania</a>, and Gaius <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> usurped imperium. 7. When <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> learned that <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a> approached and that the senate had resolved that, according to ancestral custom, when his neck had been thrust into a yoke, he was to be beaten to death with rods, he, completely deserted, left the city in the middle of the night with <a href=/people/11023 target=_blank>Phaon</a>, <a href=/people/2406 target=_blank>Epaphroditus</a> and Neophytus, and the eunuch <a href=/people/2938 target=_blank>Sporus</a>, whom once, after he had been castrated, he had tried to transform into a woman; and he pierced himself with a blow of his sword, with the impure eunuch about whom we spoke aiding his trembling hand while, since no one had been found earlier by whom he might be struck, he soberly exclaimed: So, do I have neither friend nor foe? I lived shamelessly, let me die shamefully. 8. He perished in the thirty-second year of his life. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> had been so delighted with him that they sent legations furnishing materials for constructing a monument. 9.

He used to bear patiently the agitation of his friends, as he was very witty, responding to their jibes with jests. For he wittily softened <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> <a href=/people/1246 target=_blank>Mucianus</a>, with whom as an aide he had reached imperium, insolent by reason of his merits, saying, when another man, a common acquaintance, had been summoned, this alone: I know that I am a man. 4.

Briefly put, he restored the orb of the earth, long faint and feeble. For, first of all, unless they had conducted themselves far too violently, he preferred to mollify followers of the tyrant rather than to destroy them after they had been tortured, having reckoned most prudently that nefarious works are carried out by the majority of the men through fear. 6. Moreover, by laws most equitable and by instruction, and what is stronger, by the example of his own life, he had abolished the majority of vices. 7. He was, nevertheless, weak, as some people wrongly think, with regard to money, since it is sufficiently agreed that through a shortage in the treasury and through the ruin of the cities he had sought new (nor afterward continued) payments of taxes. 8. If owners were lacking, he repaired, by means of resources granted to those willing, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> disfigured by fires and by aged ruins, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitolium</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SPax class=place long=12.4875 lat=41.8929>Temple of Peace</a>, the monuments of the <a href=/people/4932 target=_blank>Claudii</a>, and erected many new structures. 9. Through all lands, as is Roman custom, cities were renovated with surprising care; roads were fortified with the greatest labors. 10. Then the hills along the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPFl class=place long=12.4759 lat=41.9115>Flaminian Way</a> were cut through for easy passage -- what is commonly called the Pertunsa Petra (Punctured Peak). 11. A thousand clans were composed, since he had with great difficulty found two hundred, the majority having been exterminated by the savageness of the tyrants. 12. By fear alone, <a href=/people/2358 target=_blank>Vologeses</a>, King of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a>, was compelled to peace. 13. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> for which <a about=https://topostext.org/place/320350RPal class=place long=35.0001 lat=32.0206>Palestina</a> is the name, [143] and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, and Trachia and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380387RCom class=place long=38.74 lat=37.98>Commagene</a>, which today we call Augustophratensis, were added to the provinces. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judaea</a>, too, was added. 14. When friends warned him to beware of Mettius Pomposianus, about whom a rumor had been spread that he would rule, he made him a consul, joking in the following cavil: When will there ever be a memory of a gift so great? 15. Indeed, he maintained a uniform mode of life during his whole reign. He stayed awake at night and, when public affairs were finished, he admitted his intimates, putting on his shoes and royal vesture while being saluted. Then, after whatever business that had come up was heard, he exercised with a ride, then rested; finally, when he had washed, he, in a quite convivial frame of mind, used to attend dinner. 16. Affection compels one to say more about a good imperator, whom, after fifty-six years from <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>' death, the Roman state, bled by the savageness of the tyrants, chanced upon, as if by some divine destiny, lest it go completely to ruin. 17. And so, passing the sixty-ninth year of his life, he died, mingling with serious matters the jests in which he always took pleasure. 18. Indeed, first, when a comet had appeared, he said, That concerns the King of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> (whose hair is rather long). Then, exhausted by an effusion of the bowels, he rose up and said, It becomes an imperator to depart the earth standing. </p>                        </div>

Most earnestly devoted from boyhood to the admirable pursuits of probity, soldiery, and letters, he displayed gifts of mind and body in whatever he attempted. 3. When he accepted the care of the fatherland, it is incredible how much he surpassed the man whom he was replacing, especially in clemency, liberality, honor, and contempt of wealth, things which were quite dear to him because, as a result of some things done while he was yet a private citizen, he was believed to have been a particularly passionate lover of luxury [144] and of vice. 4. For, during his father's rule, he obtained the praetorian prefecture and, by means of agents who, spreading insidious things through the theaters and camps, demanded punishment, he oppressed as if convicted of a crime whoever was suspect or opposed to him. Among them, he ordered Caecena, a consular, who had been summoned to dinner and who had scarcely yet left his place at the table, to be slaughtered on account of suspicion of the debauched <a href=/people/6293 target=_blank>Bernice</a>, his own wife. 5. Moreover, under his father, verdicts in legal disputes were put up for sale * him desirous of plunder, from which all in general, envisioning and invoking <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, gravely accepted that he had reached the height of affairs. 6. But these things, having been turned to the better, brought him immortal glory to such a degree that he was called Treasure and Lover of the Human Race. 7. Then, as he submitted to regal constancy, he ordered <a href=/people/6293 target=_blank>Bernice</a>, spurning her marriage with him, to return home, and the flocks of the effeminate to depart -- an act by which he offered, as it were, a sign of intemperance altered. Henceforth, while successors were accustomed to confirm awards and concessions from earlier principes, once he took control by means of an edict he spontaneously decreed such things for those who possessed them. 9. Also, on a certain day, recollecting in the evening that he had not awarded anything to anyone, he said in a laudable and lofty remark, Friends, we have wasted a day (because he was of great liberality). </p>                        </div>

In tears he often supplicated his brother <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>, too, who was hatching plots and agitating friends among the soldiers, not to desire to attain by parricide what by his own volition was going to fall to him and what, since he was a co-holder of potestas, he now possessed. 12.

Pestilence, too, there was, as much as scarcely ever before. 14. These evils, nevertheless, he relieved with no one being burdened, by means of all sorts of remedies, now renewing the sick through his very own person, now consoling the afflicted with the deaths of his own family members. 15. He lived forty-one years and died among the <a href=/people/11083 target=_blank>Sabines</a>, on the same estate as his father. 16. His death was scarcely able to be believed, so much lamentation excited the city and provinces that, calling him a Public Treasure, as we have said, they mourned the orb of the earth as if it had been deprived of a perpetual guardian. </p>                        </div>

At <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> he constructed many buildings, whether already begun or from the foundations. 4.

When he had been joyfully received by the senate in the senate house, , alone from all <a href=/people/3343 target=_blank>Arrius</a> <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> - a shrewd man and a very close friend of his -, wisely describing the lot of rulers, [147] embraced him and said that he congratulated the senate, people, and provinces, however, in no way <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> himself, for whom to escape ever-evil principes had been better than, enduring the force of so great a burden, subjections not only to troubles and risks, but also to the assessment of enemies and, equally, of friends, who, since they presume they deserve everything, are bitterer than even enemies themselves, if they do not obtain something. 4. He exempted whatever had previously accrued to the taxes (called the burdens); he relieved afflicted cities; girls and boys born to indigent parents he ordered fed at public expense through the towns of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. 5. Lest he be alarmed by the approach of the malevolent, he was admonished in the following fashion in a comment of <a href=/people/514 target=_blank>Junius</a> <a href=/people/5771 target=_blank>Mauricus</a>, a steadfast man: invited to a social gathering, when he had observed that Veiento, who had, indeed, enjoyed consular honor under <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>, yet who had persecuted many with secret accusations, was present, when among the conversations mention was made of <a href=/people/1881 target=_blank>Catullus</a>, a principle calumniator, and <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> was saying, What would he be doing now, if he had survived <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>?, <a href=/people/5771 target=_blank>Mauricus</a> said, He would be dining with us. He was a most learned man and a frequent arbitrator of disputes. 6. <a href=/people/1017 target=_blank>Calpurnius</a> <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>, who was tempting the minds of the troops with grand promises, having been discovered and having confessed, he removed, along with his wife, to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>, while the senate chided his leniency. 7. And when <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>'s murderers were being called to execution, he was so consternated that he was unable to keep from vomiting or from a paroxysm of the bowels, but nevertheless he vehemently objected, saying that it was more fitting to die than to befoul the authority of imperium as a result of the authors of the power that he was to acquire having been betrayed. 8. But the soldiers, with the princeps ignored, slaughtered those they sought, <a href=/people/908 target=_blank>Petronius</a> with a single blow, but Parthenius after his genitals had been torn out and shoved into his mouth †, with Casperius bought off by means of huge payoffs, who, more insolent than the savage crime, compelled <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> to give thanks among the people to the soldiers, since they had killed the most base and wicked of all [148] mortals. 9. He admitted <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> to the position of son and to a share of imperium; with him he lived three months. 10. It was he who, with his voice rising in anger as he shouted out very many things against someone by the name <a href=/people/512 target=_blank>Regulus</a>, was seized by a sweat. 11. When it abated, the excessive shivering of his body revealed the beginnings of a fever, nor much later did he end his life in his sixty-third year of age. 12. His body, as formerly that of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, was conveyed with honor by the senate and buried in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125GMAu class=place long=12.476654 lat=41.9061>tomb</a> of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>.

He showed himself to be the sort of man of state that the awestruck abilities of consummate writers have scarcely and with difficulty been able to express. 3. He accepted imperium at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/509070UCol class=place long=6.9582 lat=50.9413>Agrippina</a>, the noble colony in Gallia, possessing diligence in military matters, mildness in civil, and largess in supporting citizens. 4. And since there are two things expected of egregious principes -- integrity at home, bravery in arms, and prudence in both -- so great was the quantity of what is best in him that, as if in some due proportion, he seemed to have combined the virtues, except that he was somewhat given to food and drink. 5. He was liberal toward friends and, as much as befit his style of life, thoroughly enjoyed associations. 6. He established <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BTTr class=place long=12.4979 lat=41.8927>baths</a> in honor of Sura, with whose zeal he had secured imperium. 7. With regard to this, he appeared over and above what was necessary to wish to dedicate everything in his name, when it was enough to have said that he improved or repaired. 8. He was certainly tolerant of labor, a devotee of whatever was best and [149] warlike. He highly esteemed very straightforward characters or men most erudite, although he himself was of slight theoretical knowledge and moderately eloquent. 9. But of justice and human and divine law he was as much a deviser of the new as a guardian of the traditional. 10. All of these things were viewed the greater, because, with the Roman state destroyed and prostrated through many and fearsome tyrants, a divinity was thought to have been opportunely bestowed toward the remedy of evils so great to the extent that quite numerous and wondrous things proclaimed his coming. Among these, the main cornice proclaimed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> speech from the pediment of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>: καλῶς ἔσται [It will be well]. 11. The ashes of his cremated body were borne back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and interred in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BMTr class=place long=12.4862 lat=41.8954>Forum of Trajan</a> under his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125ACTr class=place long=12.4843 lat=41.8958>column</a>, and an image was placed above it, just as triumphators are accustomed to do, entering the city, with the senate preceding and the army. 12. At that time, more destructively by far than under <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> flooded with great devastation of close-by buildings; and there occurred a serious earthquake through many provinces and a dreadful plague and famines and fires. 13. To all these things <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> brought relief through remedies usually excellent, decreeing that the height of houses not exceed sixty feet on account of proneness to collapse and deadly expenses if ever things such as this should come to pass. 14. From this he was deservedly called Father of his Country. He lived sixty-four years. </p>                        </div>

He was quite considerably learned in literature and was called by many Greekling. He devoured the pursuits and customs of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, having mastered not merely rhetoric, but other disciplines, too, the science of singing, of playing the harp, and of medicine, a musician, geometrician, painter, [150] and a sculptor from bronze or marble who approximated <a href=/people/2437 target=_blank>Polycletus</a> and Euphranoras. Indeed, like those things in a way, he, too, was refined, so that human affairs hardly ever seem to have experienced anything finer. 3. With a power of memory beyond that which is believable for anyone, he was able to review by their names places, affairs, troops, and even those absent. 4. He was of immense industry, inasmuch as he made a circuit of all the provinces on foot, outstripping the accompanying retinue, while he revived all towns and increased the orders. 5. For indeed, on the example of the military legions, he had mustered into cohorts workmen, stone-masons, architects, and, of men for the building and beautifying of walls, every sort. 6. He was diverse, manifold, and multiform; as if a born arbiter with respect to vices and virtues, by some artifice he controlled intellectual impulse. He adroitly concealed a mind envious, melancholy, hedonistic, and excessive with respect to his own ostentation; he simulated restraint, affability, clemency, and conversely disguised the ardor for fame with which he burned. 7. With respect to questioning and likewise to answering in earnest, in jest, or in invective, he was very skillful; he returned verse to verse, speech to the speaker, so you might actually believe that he had given advance thought to everything. 8. His wife, Sabina, while she was nearly being incapacitated by servile affronts, was driven to a voluntary death. She used to say openly that, because she had judged his character inhuman, she had taken pains lest, to the bane of the human race, she become pregnant by him. 9. Overcome by a subcutaneous disease which he had long endured placidly, burning and impatient with pain, he destroyed many from the senate. 10. Since peace was procured from many kings by means of tributes, he used to say that he had obtained more by leisure than others had by arms. 11. Certainly he organized the public and palatine offices, though not those of the military, in the [151] form which, with a few things changed by <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a>, persists today. 12. He lived sixty-two years; then he was consumed by a miserable death, weakened by the torment of nearly all his limbs to such a degree that, beseeching his most faithful ministers, he frequently averred that he must be killed and, lest he vent his madness on himself, that a guard of those dearest to him be maintained. </p>                        </div>

Adopted as a son by <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>, whose son-in-law he had been, he was of such great goodness in the principate that he doubtless lived without a model, although his own age will have compared him to <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a>, since by his authority alone, with no war, he ruled the orb of the earth for twenty-three years, with all legions, nations, and peoples together fearing and loving him so much that they regarded him as a parent or patron more than a dominus or imperator, and all, wishing in the fashion of the propitious heavenly ones judgment about controversies among themselves, called upon him. 4. Indeed, even <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=ethnic long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrians</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370546RHyr class=ethnic long=54.6 lat=37>Hyrcanians</a> sent legations when the justness of so great an imperator became known, a justness which he adorned with a serious, handsome countenance, long of limb, suitably robust. 5. Before he emerged to be saluted, he partook of a little bread, lest, with his strength consumed as a result of the blood around his heart being cold, he be interrupted and too little meet the needs of the business of state, which he used to pursue with, to outward appearance, the unbelievable diligence of the best paterfamilias. 6. He lacked an appetite for glory and ostentation, and was so mild that he commented to the senate, which was pursuing men who had plotted against him, that men desirous of evil must not be [152] investigated in his actual presence, lest, if many should be discovered, the extent to which he was in odium become apparent. 7. Accordingly, it was at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419123ULor class=place long=12.3008 lat=41.8885>Lorii</a>, his country-estate, twelve thousand paces from the city, that he was consumed by a fever a few days after twenty-three years of imperium. 8. In his honor were decreed temples, priests, and countless other things. 9. Moreover, he was so gentle that when, through suspicion of a shortage of grain, he was being pelted with stones by the Roman commons, after the supply had been exposed to view, he preferred to placate rather than punish the sedition. </p>                        </div>

He showed himself to be of all virtues and of celestial character, and was thrust before public calamities like a defender. For indeed, if he had not been born to those times, surely, as if with one fall, all of the Roman state would have collapsed. 3.

I believe that it has been bestowed by divine providence that, when the law of the universe or nature produces † or something else unknown to men, they are appeased by the counsels of honest men as by the remedies of medicine. 5. With a new kind of benevolence, he admitted his own kinsmen, Lucius <a href=/people/1125 target=_blank>Annius</a> <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a>, to a share of imperium. This is the <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> who, while journeying between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455124UAlt class=place long=12.3994 lat=45.5462>Altinum</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458128UIul class=place long=12.8454 lat=45.7559>Concordia</a>, died, in the eleventh year of imperium, as a result of a surge of blood, a disorder which the Greeks call αποπληξιν [apoplexy]. 6. He was a poet, mostly of tragedies, studious, of a rugged and lascivious character. [153] 7. After his demise, <a href=/people/809 target=_blank>Marcus Antoninus</a> controlled the state alone. From the beginning of his life, he was extremely placid, so much so that from infancy he changed his expression neither from joy nor sorrow. Of philosophy and Greek literature he was a student {most expert}. 8. He allowed more illustrious men and his ministers alike to host banquets in the same splendor as did he himself. 9. When, with the treasury exhausted, he did not have the funds which he applied to the soldiers and did not wish to inflict anything on the provincials or senate, he removed by a confiscation made in the Forum of <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> material of regal splendor, golden vases, crystalline and murrine goblets, and his own wife's silken and golden apparel, numerous ornaments of gems, and through two continuous months an auction was held and much gold was collected. 10. After a victory, however, he refunded the purchase prices to buyers who wished to return what had been bought. 11. In his time, <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, seizing a tyranny, was killed. 12. He himself was consumed by disease at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/482164UVin class=place long=16.3911 lat=48.1931>Bendobona</a> in the fifty-ninth year of his life. 13. When the announcement about his death reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, with the city convulsed with public lamentation, the senate gathered in the senate house, wrapped in mourning garb, weeping. 14. And what is scarcely believable about <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, all in common consent presumed that <a href=/people/809 target=_blank>Marcus</a> had been received into heaven. In his honor temples, columns, and many other things were decreed. </p>                        </div>

By this death, there perished a man who is an example of human vicissitude, who, through all types of labor, reached the heights, to such a degree that he was called the Pillar of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>. 4.

And borne back to his tent and having emerged once again to encourage his men, gradually drained of blood, he died at just about midnight, having said beforehand, when consulted about imperium, that he recommended no one, lest, as is customary in a multitude with discrepant inclinations, † he produce danger for a friend from envy and for the state as a result of the discord of the army. 5. There had been in him immense knowledge of literature and of affairs, he had equaled the philosophers and the wisest of the Greeks. 6. He was very disposed toward exercise of the body, in which he was strong indeed, but he was short. 7. A disregard of due measure in certain matters diminished these things. His desire of praise was excessive; his worship of the gods superstitious; he was more daring than befits an imperator, by whom personal safety always must be maintained for the security of all, {but} in war most of all. 8.

Moreover, this <a href=/people/1668 target=_blank>Gratian</a> was not of modest learning in literature: he composed [174] poetry; he spoke elegantly; he explicated debates in the fashion of rhetors; both night and day he did nothing but practice archery, and he thought that to hit the mark was a thing of supreme pleasure and divine skill. 5. He was sparing of food and sleep, and a conqueror of wine and sexual desire; and he would have been fitted with all good qualities, if he had attended to comprehending the science of ruling the state, from which he was almost a stranger not only by inclination but also by practice. 6. For he aroused the hatred of the troops against himself when he neglected the army and preferred to the venerable Roman soldier a few from the Alans whom he had arrogated to himself by an immense payment of gold, and with the retinue of barbarians he had almost even begun to have friendship * to the degree that he sometimes made a journey in the same attire. 7.

But his intellect was certainly similar, to such a degree that there is nothing able to be said which does not seem to be transferred to that man from books. He was merciful, compassionate, open, thinking to distinguish himself from others by dress alone; he was respectful toward all men, but more profusely toward the good; he prized simple characters equally, accomplished but harmless he admired; he bestowed great things with great spirit; he loved to reward citizens or those whom he knew through private companionship with honors, wealth, and other favors; he had especially esteemed the services of those toward himself and his father in hopeless adversity. 10. Nevertheless, he so detested those things by which <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> was bespattered -- intoxication, to be sure, and desire of the triumph -- that he did not initiate wars, but found them in existence, and forbade by law lascivious occupations and that female lutists be employed in revelries, attributing so much to propriety and continence that he barred marriages of first cousins just as if they were those of sisters. 11. If we should compare him to the exceedingly polished, he was moderately learned; he was obviously intelligent and very keen with regard to becoming acquainted with the deeds of our ancestors. 12. From these he never ceased to censure the acts of which he read that were haughty, cruel, and inimical to liberty, as <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a>, <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, [176] and <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, and everyone holding dominatio, but especially the treacherous and ungrateful. 13. He was, of course, enraged by unbecoming acts, but was quickly placated, because of which harsh measures were sometimes mollified as the result of a slight delay. 14. And he possessed by nature what Augustus possessed from a teacher of philosophy. 15. He it was who, when he had seen that he was easily disturbed, advised him, lest he order something harsh, to recite by memory the twenty-four Greek letters when he became angry, so that passion, which is momentary, would, with the mind turned to something else, lessen with the interposition of a little time. </p>                        </div>

For he was very solicitous both to attend to the care of the grain supply and to return to many from his own the great mass of gold and silver borne off and expended by the tyrant, while the benign of the principes were, in fact, almost accustomed to concede denuded farms and devastated estates. 18. Now it is those less important and, as is said, intra-palace matters, which, indeed, because they are secret, greatly attract to themselves the eyes and ears of men of inquisitive nature: he nurtured his paternal uncle like a parent; he held the children of his deceased brother and sister as his own, having embraced cognates and affines in the spirit of a parent; he presented elegant and delightful, nevertheless inexpensive, entertainment; he mixed his conversations according to persons, his endeavors according to their ranks, light speech with weighty; he was a pleasing father, an agreeable husband. 19.
