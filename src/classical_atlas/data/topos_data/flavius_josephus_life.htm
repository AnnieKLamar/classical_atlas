Now, I am not only sprung from a sacerdotal family in general, but from the first of the twenty-four courses; and as among us there is not only a considerable difference between one family of each course and another, I am of the chief family of that first course also; nay, further, by my mother I am of the royal blood; for the children of <a href=/people/4439 target=_blank>Asamoneus</a>, from whom that family was derived, had both the office of the high priesthood, and the dignity of a king, for a long time together. I will accordingly set down my progenitors in order. My grandfather's father was named <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a>, with the addition of Psellus: he lived at the same time with that son of <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a> the high priest, who first of all the high priests was named <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>. This <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a> Psellus had nine sons, one of whom was <a href=/people/1950 target=_blank>Matthias</a>, called Ephlias: he married the daughter of <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> the high priest, which <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> was the first of the sons of <a href=/people/4439 target=_blank>Asamoneus</a>, who was high priest, and was the brother of <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a> the high priest also. This <a href=/people/1950 target=_blank>Matthias</a> had a son called <a href=/people/1950 target=_blank>Matthias</a> Curtus, and that in the first year of the government of <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>: his son's name was Joseph, born in the ninth year of the reign of <a href=/people/1106 target=_blank>Alexandra</a>: his son <a href=/people/1950 target=_blank>Matthias</a> was born in the tenth year of the reign of <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>; as was I born to <a href=/people/1950 target=_blank>Matthias</a> in the first year of the reign of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> Caesar. I have three sons: <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>, the eldest, was born in the fourth year of the reign of <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, as was <a href=/people/1511 target=_blank>Justus</a> born in the seventh, and <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> in the ninth. Thus have I set down the genealogy of my family as I have found it described in the public records, and so bid adieu to those who calumniate me [as of lesser origin]. </p>                        </div>

I was myself brought up with my brother, whose name was <a href=/people/1950 target=_blank>Matthias</a>, for he was my own brother, by both father and mother; and I made mighty proficiency in the improvements of my learning, and appeared to have both a great memory and understanding. Moreover, when I was a child, and about fourteen years of age, I was commended by all for the love I had to learning; on which account the high priests and principal men of the city came then frequently to me together, in order to know my opinion about the accurate understanding of points of the law. And when I was about sixteen years old, I had a mind to make trim of the several sects that were among us. These sects are three: — The first is that of the Pharisees, the second that Sadducees, and the third that of the Essenes, as we have frequently told you; for I thought that by this means I might choose the best, if I were once acquainted with them all; so I contented myself with hard fare, and underwent great difficulties, and went through them all. Nor did I content myself with these trials only; but when I was informed that one, whose name was Banus, lived in the desert, and used no other clothing than grew upon trees, and had no other food than what grew of its own accord, and bathed himself in cold water frequently, both by night and by day, in order to preserve his chastity, I imitated him in those things, and continued with him three years. So when I had accomplished my desires, I returned back to the city, being now nineteen years old, and began to conduct myself according to the rules of the sect of the Pharisees, which is of kin to the sect of the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoics</a>, as the Greeks call them. </p>                        </div>

At the time when <a href=/people/652 target=_blank>Felix</a> was procurator of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a> there were certain priests of my acquaintance, and very excellent persons they were, whom on a small and trifling occasion he had put into bonds, and sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to plead their cause before <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. These I was desirous to procure deliverance for, and that especially because I was informed that they were not unmindful of piety towards God, even under their afflictions, but supported themselves with figs and nuts. Accordingly I came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, though it were through a great number of hazards by sea; for as our ship was drowned in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421170WAdr class=place long=16.95 lat=42.09>Adriatic</a> Sea, we that were in it, being about six hundred in number, swam for our lives all the night; when, upon the first appearance of the day, and upon our sight of a ship of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a>, I and some others, eighty in all, by God's providence, prevented the rest, and were taken up into the other ship.

And when, besides this favor, I had obtained many presents from <a href=/people/6845 target=_blank>Poppea</a>, I returned home again. </p>                        </div>

But what was done by the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325355UScy class=place long=35.5019 lat=32.502>Scythopolis</a> was the most impious and most highly criminal of all; for when the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> their enemies came upon them from without, they forced the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> that were among them to bear arms against their own countrymen, which it is unlawful for us to do; and when, by their assistance, they had joined battle with those who attacked them, and had beaten them, after that victory they forgot the assurances they had given these their fellow citizens and confederates, and slew them all, being in number many ten thousands [13,000]. The like miseries were undergone by those <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> that were the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335363UDam class=place long=36.311 lat=33.509>Damascus</a>. But we have given a more accurate account of these things in the books of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> war. I only mention them now, because I would demonstrate to my readers, that the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>' war with the Romans was not voluntary, but that, for the main, they were forced by necessity to enter into it. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/5191 target=_blank>Pistus</a>, who was guided by his son <a href=/people/1511 target=_blank>Justus</a>, did not acquiesce in that resolution; otherwise he was himself naturally of a good and virtuous character.

But as for <a href=/people/1511 target=_blank>Justus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/5191 target=_blank>Pistus</a>, who was the head of the third faction, although he pretended to be doubtful about going to war, yet was he really desirous of innovation, as supposing that he should gain power to himself by the change of affairs. He therefore came into the midst of them, and endeavored to inform the multitude that the city <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> had ever been a city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>, and that in the days of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> the tetrarch, who had built it, it had obtained the principal place, and that he had ordered that the city <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327352USep class=place long=35.281 lat=32.752>Sepphoris</a> should be subordinate to the city <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a>; that they had not lost this preeminence even under <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> the father, but had retained it until <a href=/people/652 target=_blank>Felix</a> was procurator of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>. But he told them, that now they had been so unfortunate as to be made a present by <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> to <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, junior; and that, upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327352USep class=place long=35.281 lat=32.752>Sepphoris</a>'s submission of itself to the Romans, that was become the capital city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>, and that the royal library and the archives were now removed from them. When he had spoken these things, and a great many more, against king <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, in order to provoke the people to a revolt, he added that this was the time for them to take arms, and join with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=ethnic long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galileans</a> as their confederates (whom they might command, and who would now willingly assist them, out of the hatred they bare to the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327352USep class=place long=35.281 lat=32.752>Sepphoris</a>; because they preserved their fidelity to the Romans), and to gather a great number of forces, in order to punish them. And as he said this, he exhorted the multitude, [to go to war;] for his abilities lay in making harangues to the people, and in being too hard in his speeches for such as opposed him, though they advised what was more to their advantage, and this by his craftiness and his fallacies, for he was not unskilful in the learning of the Greeks; and in dependence on that skill it was, that he undertook to write a history of these affairs, as aiming, by this way of haranguing, to disguise the truth.

So <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> staid there four days, and fled away on the fifth, having disguised himself with fictitious hair, that he might not be discovered; and when he was come to one of the villages to him belonging, but one that was situated at the borders of the citadel of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329357UGam class=place long=35.7373 lat=32.9012>Gamala</a>, he sent to some of those that were under him, and commanded them to come to him. But God himself hindered that his intention, and this for his own advantage also; for had it not so happened, he had certainly perished. For a fever having seized upon him immediately, he wrote to <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> and <a href=/people/743 target=_blank>Berenice</a>, and gave them to one of his freed-men to carry them to <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a>, who at this time was procurator of the kingdom, which the king and his sister had intrusted him withal, while they were gone to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/339355UBer class=place long=35.5056 lat=33.896>Berytus</a> with an intention of meeting <a href=/people/2231 target=_blank>Gessius</a>. When <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> had received these letters of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, and had learned that he was preserved, he was very uneasy at it, as supposing that he should appear useless to the king and his sister, now <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> was come. He therefore produced the carrier of the letters before the multitude, and accused him of forging the same; and said that he spake falsely when he related that <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> was at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, fighting among the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> against the Romans. So he slew him. And when this freed-man of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> did not return again, <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> was doubtful what should be the occasion of his stay, and sent a second messenger with letters, that he might, upon his return, inform him what had befallen the other that had been sent before, and why he tarried so long. <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> accused this messenger also, when he came, of telling a falsehood, and slew him. For he was puffed up by the Syrians that were at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a>, and had great expectations; for they said that <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> would be slain by the Romans for the crimes which the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> had committed, and that he should himself take the government, as derived from their kings; for <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> was, by the confession of all, of the royal family, as being a descendant of <a href=/people/3695 target=_blank>Sohemus</a>, who had enjoyed a tetrarchy about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/339358LLib class=place long=35.765 lat=33.925>Libanus</a>; for which reason it was that he was puffed up, and kept the letters to himself. He contrived, also, that the king should not meet with those writings, by guarding all the passes, lest any one should escape, and inform the king what had been done. He moreover slew many of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, in order to gratify the Syrians of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a>. He had a mind also to join with the Trachonites in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/330361RBat class=place long=36.1 lat=33>Batanea</a>, and to take up arms and make an assault upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=person long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonian</a> <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> that were at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348485UEcb class=place long=48.5166 lat=34.8054>Ecbatana</a>; for that was the name they went by. He therefore called to him twelve of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a>, of the best character, and ordered them to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348485UEcb class=place long=48.5166 lat=34.8054>Ecbatana</a>, and inform their countrymen who dwelt there, That <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> hath heard that you intend to march against the king; but, not believing that report, he hath sent us to persuade you to lay down your arms, and that this compliance will be a sign that he did well not to give credit to those that raised the report concerning you. He also enjoined them to send seventy of their principal men to make a defense for them as to the accusation laid against them. So when the twelve messengers came to their countrymen at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348485UEcb class=place long=48.5166 lat=34.8054>Ecbatana</a>, and found that they had no designs of innovation at all, they persuaded them to send the seventy men also; who, not at all suspecting what would come, sent them accordingly. So these seventy went down to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a>, together with the twelve ambassadors; where <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> met them with the king's forces, and slew them all, together with the [twelve] ambassadors, and made an expedition against the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348485UEcb class=place long=48.5166 lat=34.8054>Ecbatana</a>. But one there was of the seventy who escaped, and made haste to inform the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> of their coming; upon which they took their arms, with their wives and children, and retired to the citadel at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329357UGam class=place long=35.7373 lat=32.9012>Gamala</a>, leaving their own villages full of all sorts of good things, and having many ten thousands of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> therein. When <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> was informed of these things, he also came to the citadel of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329357UGam class=place long=35.7373 lat=32.9012>Gamala</a>; and when he was come, the multitude cried aloud, and desired him to resume the government, and to make an expedition against <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a>, and the Syrians of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a>; for it was reported that they had slain the king. But <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> restrained their zeal, and put them in mind of the benefits the king had bestowed upon them; and told them how powerful the Romans were, and said it was not for their advantage to make war with them; and at length he prevailed with them.

Their direction was, that I should continue there, and that, if my fellow legates were willing, I should join with them in the care of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>. But those my fellow legates, having gotten great riches from those tithes which as priests were their dues, and were given to them, determined to return to their own country. Yet when I desired them to stay so long, that we might first settle the public affairs, they complied with me. So I removed, together with them, from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327352USep class=place long=35.281 lat=32.752>Sepphoris</a>, and came to a certain village called <a href=/people/8991 target=_blank>Bethmaus</a>, four furlongs distant from <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>; and thence I sent messengers to the senate of <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, and desired that the principal men of the city would come to me: and when they were come, <a href=/people/1511 target=_blank>Justus</a> himself being also with them, I told them that I was sent to them by the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> as a legate, together with these other priests, in order to persuade them to demolish that house which <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> the tetrarch had built there, and which had the figures of living creatures in it, although our laws have forbidden us to make any such figures; and I desired that they would give us leave so to do immediately. But for a good while <a href=/people/5536 target=_blank>Capellus</a> and the principal men belonging to the city would not give us leave, but were at length entirely overcome by us, and were induced to be of our opinion. So Jesus the son of Sapphias, one of those whom we have already mentioned as the leader of a seditious tumult of mariners and poor people, prevented us, and took with him certain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=ethnic long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galileans</a>, and set the entire palace on fire, and thought he should get a great deal of money thereby, because he saw some of the roofs gilt with gold. They also plundered a great deal of the furniture, which was done without our approbation; for after we had discoursed with <a href=/people/5536 target=_blank>Capellus</a> and the principal men of the city, we departed from <a href=/people/8991 target=_blank>Bethmaus</a>, and went into the Upper <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>.

They consisted of candlesticks made of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a> brass, and of royal tables, and of a great quantity of uncoined silver; and I resolved to preserve whatsoever came to my hand for the king. So I sent for ten of the principal men of the senate, and for <a href=/people/5536 target=_blank>Capellus</a> the son of <a href=/people/2713 target=_blank>Antyllus</a>, and committed the furniture to them, with this charge, That they should part with it to nobody else but to myself. From thence I and my fellow legates went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/330354UGis class=place long=35.4496 lat=33.0253>Gischala</a>, to John, as desirous to know his intentions, and soon saw that he was for innovations, and had a mind to the principality; for he desired me to give him authority to carry off that corn which belonged to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and lay in the villages of Upper <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>; and he pretended that he would expend what it came to in building the walls of his own city. But when I perceived what he endeavored at, and what he had in his mind, I said I would not permit him so to do; for that I thought either to keep it for the Romans or for myself, now I was intrusted with the public affairs there by the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>. But, when he was not able to prevail with me, he betook himself to my fellow legates; for they had no sagacity in providing for futurity, and were very ready to take bribes. So he corrupted them with money to decree, That all that corn which was within his province should be delivered to him; while I, who was but one, was outvoted by two, and held my tongue. Then did John introduce another cunning contrivance of his; for he said that those <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> who inhabited <a about=https://topostext.org/place/332356UPan class=place long=35.6931 lat=33.2479>Caesarea Philippi</a>, and were shut up by the order of the king's deputy there, had sent to him to desire him, that, since they had no oil that was pure for their use, he would provide a sufficient quantity of such oil for them, lest they should be forced to make use of oil that came from the Greeks, and thereby transgress their own laws. Now this was said by John, not out of his regard to religion, but out of his most flagrant desire of gain; for he knew that two sextaries were sold with them of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/332356UPan class=place long=35.6931 lat=33.2479>Caesarea</a> for one drachma, but that at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/330354UGis class=place long=35.4496 lat=33.0253>Gischala</a> fourscore sextaxies were sold for four sextaries. So he gave order that all the oil which was there should be carried away, as having my permission for so doing; which yet I did not grant him voluntarily, but only out of fear of the multitude, since, if I had forbidden him, I should have been stoned by them. When I had therefore permitted this to be done by John, he gained vast sums of money by this his knavery. </p>                        </div>

And when I had obliged them to take an oath not to come into that country, unless they were invited to come, or else when they had not their pay given them, I dismissed them, and charged them neither to make an expedition against the Romans, nor against those their neighbors that lay round about them; for my first care was to keep <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a> in peace.

Accordingly, those that had received such a charge did as they were bidden, and Jesus came in with a few others; and when I had ordered him to throw down his arms immediately, and told him, that if he refused so to do, he was a dead man, he seeing armed men standing all round about him, was terrified, and complied; and as for those of his followers that were excluded, when they were informed that he was seized, they ran away.

Upon my saying this, the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328355UTar class=place long=35.515 lat=32.826>Taricheae</a> and the strangers cried out, that they gave me thanks, and desired me to be of good courage, although the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=ethnic long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galileans</a> and the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a> continued in their wrath against me, insomuch that there arose a tumult among them, while some threatened to kill me, and some bade me not to regard them; but when I promised them that I would build them walls at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a>, and at other cities that wanted them, they gave credit to what I promised, and returned every one to his own home.

So the multitude was soon deluded by such plausible pretenses as were agreeable to their own inclinations, and were prevailed on by them. But when I was informed of this, I instructed the multitude again, that those who fled to them for refuge ought not to be persecuted: I also laughed at the allegation about witchcraft, and told them that the Romans would not maintain so many ten thousand soldiers, if they could overcome their enemies by wizards. Upon my saying this, the people assented for a while; but they returned again afterwards, as irritated by some ill people against the great men; nay, they once made an assault upon the house in which they dwelt at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328355UTar class=place long=35.515 lat=32.826>Taricheae</a>, in order to kill them; which, when I was informed of, I was afraid lest so horrid a crime should take effect, and nobody else would make that city their refuge any more.

I agreed to their proposal accordingly; and when I had made preparation for the entire building, I gave order to the architects to go to work; but on the third day, when I was gone to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328355UTar class=place long=35.515 lat=32.826>Taricheae</a>, which was thirty furlongs distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a>, it so fell out, that some Roman horsemen were discovered on their march, not far from the city, which made it to be supposed that the forces were come from the king; upon which they shouted, and lifted up their voices in commendations of the king, and in reproaches against me. Hereupon one came running to me, and told me what their dispositions were, and that they had resolved to revolt from me: upon hearing which news I was very much alarmed; for I had already sent away my armed men from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328355UTar class=place long=35.515 lat=32.826>Taricheae</a>, to their own homes, because the next day was our sabbath; for I would not have the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328355UTar class=place long=35.515 lat=32.826>Taricheae</a> disturbed [on that day] by a multitude of soldiers; and indeed, whenever I sojourned at that city, I never took any particular care for a guard about my own body, because I had had frequent instances of the fidelity its inhabitants bore to me. I had now about me no more than seven armed men, besides some friends, and was doubtful what to do; for to send to recall my own forces I did not think proper, because the present day was almost over; and had those forces been with me, I could not take up arms on the next day, because our laws forbade us so to do, even though our necessity should be very great; and if I should permit the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328355UTar class=place long=35.515 lat=32.826>Taricheae</a>, and the strangers with them, to guard the city, I saw that they would not be sufficient for that purpose, and I perceived that I should be obliged to delay my assistance a great while; for I thought with myself that the forces that came from the king would prevent me, and that I should be driven out of the city. I considered, therefore, how to get clear of these forces by a stratagem; so I immediately placed those my friends of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328355UTar class=place long=35.515 lat=32.826>Tarichee</a>, on whom I could best confide, at the gates, to watch those very carefully who went out at those gates: I also called to me the heads of families, and bade every one of them to seize upon a ship to go on board it, and to take a master with them, and follow him to the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a>.

He was a man of great wisdom and reason, and capable of restoring public affairs by his prudence, when they were in an ill posture. He was also an old friend and companion of John; but at that time he had a difference with me. When therefore he had received such an exhortation, he persuaded the high priests, <a href=/people/2089 target=_blank>Ananus</a>, and Jesus the son of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329357UGam class=place long=35.7373 lat=32.9012>Gamala</a>, and some others of the same seditious faction, to cut me down, now I was growing so great, and not to overlook me while I was aggrandizing myself to the height of glory; and he said that it would be for the advantage of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=ethnic long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galileans</a>, if I were deprived of my government there. <a href=/people/2089 target=_blank>Ananus</a> also, and his friends, desired them to make no delay about the matter, lest I should get the knowledge of what was doing too soon, and should come and make an assault upon the city with a great army. This was the counsel of <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a>; but Artanus the high priest demonstrated to them that this was not an easy thing to be done, because many of the high priests and of the rulers of the people bore witness that I had acted like an excellent general, and that it was the work of ill men to accuse one against whom they had nothing to say. </p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> contrived how he might catch me by treachery; for he durst not make any attempt upon me openly. So he wrote me the following letter: <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> and those that are with him, and are sent by the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, to <a href=/people/1222 target=_blank>Josephus</a>, send greeting.

We are also desirous to consult with thee about our common concerns, and what is fit to be done. We therefore desire thee to come to us quickly, and to bring only a few men with thee; for this village will not contain a great number of soldiers. Thus it was that they wrote, as expecting one of these two things; either that I should come without armed men, and then they should have me wholly in their power; or, if I came with a great number, they should judge me to be a public enemy. Now it was a horseman who brought the letter, a man at other times bold, and one that had served in the army under the king. It was the second hour of the night that he came, when I was feasting with my friends, and the principal of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=ethnic long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galileans</a>. This man, upon my servant's telling me that a certain horseman of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> nation was come, was called in at my command, but did not so much as salute me at all, but held out a letter, and said, This letter is sent thee by those that are come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>; do thou write an answer to it quickly; for I am obliged to return to them very soon. Now my guests could not but wonder at the boldness of the soldier. But I desired him to sit down and sup with us; but when he refused so to do, I held the letter in my hands as I received it, and fell a talking with my guests about other matters. But a few hours afterwards, I got up, and when I had dismissed the rest to go to their beds, I bid only four of my intimate friends to stay, and ordered my servant to get some wine ready. I also opened the letter so, that nobody could perceive it; and understanding thereby presently the purport of the writing, I sealed it up again, and appeared as if I had not yet read it, but only held it in my hands. I ordered twenty drachmae should be given the soldier for the charges of his journey; and when he took the money, and said that he thanked me for it, I perceived that he loved money, and that he was to be caught chiefly by that means; and I said to him, If thou wilt but drink with us, thou shalt have a drachma for every glass thou drinkest. So he gladly embraced this proposal, and drank a great deal of wine, in order to get the more money, and was so drunk, that at last he could not keep the secrets he was intrusted with, but discovered them without my putting questions to him, viz. That a treacherous design was contrived against me, and that I was doomed to die by those that sent him. When I heard this, I wrote back this answer: <a href=/people/1222 target=_blank>Josephus</a> to <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a>, and those that are with him, sendeth greeting.

But when <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> and his partners had failed in this their first attempt, they sent me another letter, the contents whereof were as follows: <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a>, and those with him, to <a href=/people/1222 target=_blank>Josephus</a>, send greeting. We require thee to come to us to the village <a href=/people/9413 target=_blank>Gabaroth</a>, on the third day, without any armed men, that we may hear what thou hast to lay to the charge of John [of Gischala]. When they had written this letter, they saluted the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=ethnic long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galileans</a> whom I sent, and came to <a href=/people/6569 target=_blank>Japha</a>, which was the largest village of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>, and encompassed with very strong walls, and had a great number of inhabitants in it. There the multitude of men, with their wives and children, met them, and exclaimed loudly against them; and desired them to be gone, and not to envy them the advantage of an excellent commander. With these clamors <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> and his partners were greatly provoked, although they durst not show their anger openly; so they made them no answer, but went to other villages. But still the same clamors met them from all the people, who said, Nobody should persuade them to have any other commander besides <a href=/people/1222 target=_blank>Josephus</a>. So <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> and his partners went away from them without success, and came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327352USep class=place long=35.281 lat=32.752>Sepphoris</a>, the greatest city of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>. Now the men of that city, who inclined to the Romans in their sentiments, met them indeed, but neither praised nor reproached me and when they were gone down from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327352USep class=place long=35.281 lat=32.752>Sepphoris</a> to <a href=/people/6253 target=_blank>Asochis</a>, the people of that place made a clamor against them, as those of <a href=/people/6569 target=_blank>Japha</a> had done; whereupon they were able to contain themselves no longer, but ordered the armed men that were with them to beat those that made the clamor with their clubs. And when they came to <a href=/people/4154 target=_blank>Gabara</a>, John met them with three thousand armed men; but, as I understood by their letter that they had resolved to fight against me, I arose from <a href=/people/7466 target=_blank>Chabolo</a>, with three thousand armed men also; but left in my camp one of my fastest friends, and came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328352UIot class=place long=35.2775 lat=32.8322>Jotapata</a>, as desirous to be near them, the distance being no more than forty furlongs. Whence I wrote thus to them: If you are very desirous that I should come to you, you know there are two hundred and forty cities and villages in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>; I will come to any of them which you please, excepting <a href=/people/4154 target=_blank>Gabara</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/330354UGis class=place long=35.4496 lat=33.0253>Gischala</a>; the one of which is John's native city, and the other in confederacy and friendship with him. </p>                        </div>

John's opinion was, that they should write to all the cities and villages that were in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>; for that there must be certainly one or two persons in every one of them that were at variance with me, and that they should be invited to come to oppose me as an enemy. He would also have them send this resolution of theirs to the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, that its citizens, upon the knowledge of my being adjudged to be an enemy by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=ethnic long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galileans</a>, might themselves I also confirm that determination.

I was also made acquainted with these affairs about the third hour of the night, by the means of one Saccheus, who had belonged to them, but now deserted them and came over to me, and told me what they were about; so I perceived that no time was to be lost. Accordingly, I gave command to <a href=/people/947 target=_blank>Jacob</a>, an armed man of my guard, whom I esteemed faithful to me, to take two hundred men, and to guard the passages that led from <a href=/people/4154 target=_blank>Gabara</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>, and to seize upon the passengers, and send them to me, especially such as were caught with letters about them: I also sent Jeremias himself, one of my friends, with six hundred armed men, to the borders of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>, in order to watch the roads that led from this country to the city <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and gave him charge to lay hold of such as traveled with letters about them, to keep the men in bonds upon the place, but to send me the letters. </p>                        </div>

I also set over them centurions, and commanded them to take care that not a soldier which they did not know should mingle himself among them. Now, on the fifth day following, when I was at <a href=/people/9413 target=_blank>Gabaroth</a>, I found the entire plain that was before the village full of armed men, who were come out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a> to assist me: many others of the multitude, also, out of the village, ran along with me.

Now it came to pass, that on the very same day those who were sent by John with letters, fell among the guards whom I had appointed to watch the roads; so the men were themselves kept upon the place, as my orders were, but I got the letters, which were full of reproaches and lies; and I intended to fall upon these men, without saying a word of these matters to any body. </p>                        </div>

And indeed they had given orders to the armed men, that when I came they should let nobody besides me come in, but should exclude others; as supposing that, by this means, they should easily get me under their power: but they were deceived in their expectation; for I perceived what snares they had laid for me. Now, as soon as I was got off my journey, I took up my lodgings over against them, and pretended to be asleep; so <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> and his party, thinking that I was really asleep and at rest, made haste to go down into the plain, to persuade the people that I was an ill governor.

However, they desired me to lodge some where else, because the next day was the sabbath, and that it was not fit the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a> should be disturbed [on that day]. </p>                        </div>

On the next day, therefore, they all came into the Proseucha; it was a large edifice, and capable of receiving a great number of people; thither <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> went in, and though he durst not openly speak of a revolt, yet did he say that their city stood in need of a better governor than it then had. But Jesus, who was the ruler, made no scruple to speak out, and said openly, O fellow citizens! it is better for you to be in subjection to four than to one; and those such as are of high birth, and not without reputation for their wisdom; and pointed to <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> and his colleagues. Upon his saying this, <a href=/people/1511 target=_blank>Justus</a> came in and commended him for what he had said, and persuaded some of the people to be of his mind also. But the multitude were not pleased with what was said, and had certainly gone into a tumult, unless the sixth hour, which was now come, had dissolved the assembly, at which hour our laws require us to go to dinner on sabbath days; so <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> and his colleagues put off their council till the next day, and went off without success. When I was informed of these affairs, I determined to go to the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a> in the morning. Accordingly, on the next day, about the first hour of the day, I came from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328355UTar class=place long=35.515 lat=32.826>Taricheae</a>, and found the multitude already assembled in the Proseucha; but on what account they were gotten together, those that were assembled did not know. But when <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> and his colleagues saw me there unexpectedly, they were in disorder; after which they raised a report of their own contrivance, that Roman horsemen were seen at a place called Union, in the borders of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>, thirty furlongs distant from the city. Upon which report, <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> and his colleagues cunningly exhorted me not to neglect this matter, nor to suffer the land to be spoiled by the enemy. And this they said with a design to remove me out of the city, under the pretense of the want of extraordinary assistance, while they might dispose the city to be my enemy. </p>                        </div>

I therefore went out; but, when I was at the place, I found not the least footsteps of any enemy, so I returned as fast as ever I could, and found the whole council assembled, and the body of the people gotten together, and <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> and his colleagues bringing vehement accusations against me, as one who had no concern to ease them of the burdens of war, and as one that lived luxuriously. And as they were discoursing thus, they produced four letters, as written to them from some people that lived at the borders of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>, imploring that they would come to their assistance, for that there was an army of Romans, both horsemen and footmen, who would come and lay waste the country on the third day; they desired them also to make haste, and not to overlook them.

Hereupon I said (for I understood the meaning of <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> and his colleagues) that I was ready to comply with what they proposed, and without delay to march to the war which they spake of, yet did I advise them, at the same time, that since these letters declared that the Romans would make their assault in four several places, they should part their forces into five bodies, and make <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> and his colleagues generals of each body of them, because it was fit for brave men, not only to give counsel, but to take the place of leaders, and assist their countrymen when such a necessity pressed them; for, said I, it is not possible for me to lead more than one party. This advice of mine greatly pleased the multitude; so they compelled them to go forth to the war. But their designs were put into very much disorder, because they had not done what they had designed to do, on account of my stratagem, which was opposite to their undertakings. </p>                        </div>

This he said, not out of piety, but that they might catch me and my friends unarmed. Now, I was hereupon forced to comply, lest I should appear to despise a proposal that tended to piety. As soon, therefore, as we were gone home, <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> and his colleagues wrote to John to come to them in the morning, and desiring him to come with as many soldiers as he possibly could, for that they should then be able easily to get me into their hands, and to do all they desired to do.

Now John was at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/330354UGis class=place long=35.4496 lat=33.0253>Gischala</a>. <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a>, therefore, and those that were with him, when they were departed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a>, and as soon as they were come to <a href=/people/9231 target=_blank>Dabaritta</a>, a village that lay in the utmost parts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>, in the great plain, they, about midnight, fell among the guards I had set, who both commanded them to lay aside their weapons, and kept them in bonds upon the place, as I had charged them to do. This news was written to me by <a href=/people/3415 target=_blank>Levi</a>, who had the command of that guard committed to him by me. Hereupon I said nothing of it for two days; and, pretending to know nothing about it, I sent a message to the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a>, and advised them to lay their arms aside, and to dismiss their men, that they might go home. But, supposing that <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a>, and those that were with him, were already arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, they made reproachful answers to me; yet was I not terrified thereby, but contrived another stratagem against them, for I did not think it agreeable with piety to kindle the fire of war against the citizens. As I was desirous to draw those men away from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a>, I chose out ten thousand of the best of my armed men, and divided them into three bodies, and ordered them to go privately, and lie still as an ambush, in the villages. I also led a thousand into another village, which lay indeed in the mountains, as did the others, but only four furlongs distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a>; and gave orders, that when they saw my signal, they should come down immediately, while I myself lay with my soldiers in the sight of every body. Hereupon the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a>, at the sight of me, came running out of the city perpetually, and abused me greatly. Nay, their madness was come to that height, that they made a decent bier for me, and, standing about it, they mourned over me in the way of jest and sport; and I could not but be myself in a pleasant humor upon the sight of this madness of theirs. </p>                        </div>

So when <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a> was come out, and his friends with him, for his guard, I met him, and saluted him with great civility, and professed that I was obliged to him for his coming up to me; but a little while afterward I walked along with him as though I would say something to him by myself; and when I had drawn him a good way from his friends, I took him about the middle, and gave him to my friends that were with me, to carry him into a village; and, commanding my armed men to come down, I with them made an assault upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a>.

So I was over-persuaded by their entreaties, and restrained the soldiers from the vehemency with which they pursued them; while I myself, upon the coming on of the evening, returned back with my soldiers, and went to refresh myself. I also invited <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a> to sup with me, and comforted him on occasion of what had happened; and I promised that I would send him safe and secure to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and withal would give him provisions for his journey thither. </p>                        </div>

These men do like those who compose forged deeds and conveyances; and because they are not brought to the like punishment with them, they have no regard to truth. When, therefore, <a href=/people/1511 target=_blank>Justus</a> undertook to write about these facts, and about the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> war, that he might appear to have been an industrious man, he falsified in what he related about me, and could not speak truth even about his own country; whence it is that, being belied by him, I am under a necessity to make my defense; and so I shall say what I have concealed till now. And let no one wonder that I have not told the world these things a great while ago. For although it be necessary for an historian to write the truth, yet is such a one not bound severely to animadvert on the wickedness of certain men; not out of any favor to them, but out of an author's own moderation. How then comes it to pass, O <a href=/people/1511 target=_blank>Justus</a>! thou most sagacious of writers, (that I may address myself to him as if he were here present,) for so thou boastest of thyself, that I and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=ethnic long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galileans</a> have been the authors of that sedition which thy country engaged in, both against the Romans and against the king [<a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, junior] For before ever I was appointed governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a> by the community of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, both thou and all the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a> had not only taken up arms, but had made war with Decapolis of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>. Accordingly, thou hadst ordered their villages to be burnt, and a domestic servant of thine fell in the battle. Nor is it I only who say this; but so it is written in the Commentaries of <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, the emperor; as also how the inhabitants of Decapolis came clamoring to <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329351UPto class=place long=35.0817 lat=32.9278>Ptolemais</a>, and desired that thou, who wast the author [of that war], mightest be brought to punishment. And thou hadst certainly been punished at the command of <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, had not king <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, who had power given him to have thee put to death, at the earnest entreaty of his sister <a href=/people/743 target=_blank>Berenice</a>, changed the punishment from death into a long imprisonment. Thy political administration of affairs afterward doth also clearly discover both thy other behavior in life, and that thou wast the occasion of thy country's revolt from the Romans; plain signs of which I shall produce presently. I have also a mind to say a few things to the rest of the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a> on thy account, and to demonstrate to those that light upon this history, that you bare no good-will, neither to the Romans, nor to the king. To be sure, the greatest cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>, O <a href=/people/1511 target=_blank>Justus</a>! were <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327352USep class=place long=35.281 lat=32.752>Sepphoris</a>, and thy country <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a>. But <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327352USep class=place long=35.281 lat=32.752>Sepphoris</a>, situated in the very midst of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>, and having many villages about it, and able with ease to have been bold and troublesome to the Romans, if they had so pleased, yet did it resolve to continue faithful to those their masters, and at the same time excluded me out of their city, and prohibited all their citizens from joining with the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> in the war; and, that they might be out of danger from me, they, by a wile, got leave of me to fortify their city with walls: they also, of their own accord, admitted of a garrison of Roman legions, sent them by Cestlus <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a>, who was then president of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, and so had me in contempt, though I was then very powerful, and all were greatly afraid of me; and at the same time that the greatest of our cities, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, was besieged, and that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> of ours, which belonged to us all, was in danger of falling under the enemy's power, they sent no assistance thither, as not willing to have it thought they would bear arms against the Romans. But as for thy country, O <a href=/people/1511 target=_blank>Justus</a>: situated upon the lake of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328356WGal class=place long=35.6 lat=32.81>Gennesareth</a>, and distance from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328357UHip class=place long=35.66 lat=32.7789>Hippos</a> thirty furlongs, from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/326356UGad class=place long=35.6781 lat=32.6559>Gadara</a> sixty, and from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325355UScy class=place long=35.5019 lat=32.502>Scythopolis</a>, which was under the king's jurisdiction, a hundred and twenty; when there was no <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> city near, it might easily have preserved its fidelity [to the Romans,] if it had so pleased them to do, for the city and its people had plenty of weapons. But, as thou sayest, I was then the author [of their revolts]. And pray, O <a href=/people/1511 target=_blank>Justus</a>! who was that author afterwards? For thou knowest that I was in the power of the Romans before <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> was besieged, and before the same time <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328352UIot class=place long=35.2775 lat=32.8322>Jotapata</a> was taker by force, as well as many other fortresses, and a great many of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=ethnic long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galileans</a> fell in the war. It was therefore then a proper time, when you were certainly freed from any fear on my account, to throw away your weapons, and to demonstrate to the king and to the Romans, that it was not of choice, but as forced by necessity, that you fell into the war against them; but you staid till <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> came himself as far as your walls, with his whole army; and then you did indeed lay aside your weapons out of fear, and your city had for certain been taken by force, unless <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> had complied with the king's supplication for you, and had excused your madness. It was not I, therefore, who was the author of this, but your own inclinations to war. Do not you remember how often I got you under my power, and yet put none of you to death? Nay, you once fell into a tumult one against another, and slew one hundred and eighty-five of your citizens, not on account of your good-will to the king and to the Romans, but on account of your own wickedness, and this while I was besieged by the Romans in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328352UIot class=place long=35.2775 lat=32.8322>Jotapata</a>. Nay, indeed, were there not reckoned up two thousand of the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a> during the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, some of whom were slain, and the rest caught and carried captives? But thou wilt pretend that thou didst not engage in the war, since thou didst flee to the king. Yes, indeed, thou didst flee to him; but I say it was out of fear of me. Thou sayest, indeed, that it is I who am a wicked man. But then, for what reason was it that king <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, who procured thee thy life when thou wast condemned to die by <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, and who bestowed so much riches upon thee, did twice afterward put thee in bonds, and as often obliged thee to run away from thy country, and, when he had once ordered thee to be put to death, he granted thee a pardon at the earnest desire of <a href=/people/743 target=_blank>Berenice</a>? And when (after so many of thy wicked pranks) he made thee his secretary, he caught thee falsifying his letters, and drove thee away from his sight. But I shall not inquire accurately into these matters of scandal against thee. Yet cannot I but wonder at thy impudence, when thou hast the assurance to say, that thou hast better related these affairs [of the war] than have all the others that have written about them, whilst thou didst not know what was done in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>; for thou wast then at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/339355UBer class=place long=35.5056 lat=33.896>Berytus</a> with the king; nor didst thou know how much the Romans suffered at the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328352UIot class=place long=35.2775 lat=32.8322>Jotapata</a>, or what miseries they brought upon us; nor couldst thou learn by inquiry what I did during that siege myself; for all those that might afford such information were quite destroyed in that siege. But perhaps thou wilt say, thou hast written of what was done against the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> exactly. But how should that be? for neither wast thou concerned in that war, nor hast thou read the commentaries of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; of which we have evident proof, because thou hast contradicted those commentaries of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> in thy history. But if thou art so hardy as to affirm, that thou hast written that history better than all the rest, why didst thou not publish thy history while the emperors <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> and <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a>, the generals in that war, as well as king <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> and his family, who were men very well skilled in the learning of the Greeks, were all alive? for thou hast had it written these twenty years, and then mightest thou have had the testimony of thy accuracy. But now when these men are no longer with us, and thou thinkest thou canst not be contradicted, thou venturest to publish it. But then I was not in like manner afraid of my own writing, but I offered my books to the emperors themselves, when the facts were almost under men's eyes; for I was conscious to myself, that I had observed the truth of the facts; and as I expected to have their attestation to them, so I was not deceived in such expectation. Moreover, I immediately presented my history to many other persons, some of whom were concerned in the war, as was king <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> and some of his kindred. Now the emperor <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a> was so desirous that the knowledge of these affairs should be taken from these books alone, that he subscribed his own hand to them, and ordered that they should be published; and for king <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, he wrote me sixty-two letters, and attested to the truth of what I had therein delivered; two of which letters I have here subjoined, and thou mayst thereby know their contents: — King <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> to <a href=/people/1222 target=_blank>Josephus</a>, however, when thou comest to me, I will inform thee of a great many things which thou dost not know. So when this history was perfected, <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, neither by way of flattery, which was not agreeable to him, nor by way of irony, as thou wilt say, (for he was entirely a stranger to such an evil disposition of mind,) but he wrote this by way of attestation to what was true, as all that read histories may do. And so much shall be said concerning <a href=/people/1511 target=_blank>Justus</a> which I am obliged to add by way of digression. </p>                        </div>

Yet was not I pleased with their determination; as purposing to compose these troubles without bloodshed. Upon this I exhorted them to use the utmost care to learn the names of all that were under John; which when they had done, and I thereby was apprized who the men were, I published an edict, wherein I offered security and my right hand to such of John's party as had a mind to repent; and I allowed twenty days' time to such as would take this most advantageous course for themselves. I also threatened, that unless they threw down their arms, I would burn their houses, and expose their goods to public sale. When the men heard of this, they were in no small disorder, and deserted John; and to the number of four thousand threw down their arms, and came to me.

So they sent to <a href=/people/2506 target=_blank>Cestius</a> <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a>, who was president of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, and desired that he would either come quickly to them, and take their city under his protection, or send them a garrison. Accordingly, <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a> promised them to come, but did not send word when he would come: and when I had learned so much, I took the soldiers that were with me, and made an assault upon the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327352USep class=place long=35.281 lat=32.752>Sepphoris</a>, and took the city by force. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=ethnic long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galileans</a> took this opportunity, as thinking they had now a proper time for showing their hatred to them, since they bore ill-will to that city also. They then exerted themselves, as if they would destroy them all utterly, with those that sojourned there also. So they ran upon them, and set their houses on fire, as finding them without inhabitants; for the men, out of fear, ran together to the citadel. So the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=ethnic long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galileans</a> carried off every thing, and omitted no kind of desolation which they could bring upon their countrymen. When I saw this, I was exceedingly troubled at it, and commanded them to leave off, and put them in mind that it was not agreeable to piety to do such things to their countrymen: but since they neither would hearken to what I exhorted, nor to what I commanded them to do, (for the hatred they bore to the people there was too hard for my exhortations to them,) I bade those my friends, who were most faithful to me, and were about me, to give on reports, as if the Romans were falling upon the other part of the city with a great army; and this I did, that, by such a report being spread abroad, I might restrain the violence of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=ethnic long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galileans</a>, and preserve the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327352USep class=place long=35.281 lat=32.752>Sepphoris</a>. And at length this stratagem had its effect; for, upon hearing this report, they were in fear for themselves, and so they left off plundering and ran away; and this more especially, because they saw me, their general, do the same also; for, that I might cause this report to be believed, I pretended to be in fear as well as they.

I myself also, who had been intrusted by the community of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> with the government of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>, did frequently come to that degree of rage at <a href=/people/1511 target=_blank>Justus</a>, that I had almost resolved to kill him, as not able to bear his mischievous disposition.

But the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327352USep class=place long=35.281 lat=32.752>Sepphoris</a> met <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, and saluted him, and had forces sent him, with <a href=/people/5909 target=_blank>Placidus</a> their commander: he also went up with them, as I also followed them, till <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> came into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>. As to which coming of his, and after what manner it was ordered, and how he fought his first battle with me near the village <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328355UTar class=place long=35.515 lat=32.826>Taricheae</a>, and how from thence they went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328352UIot class=place long=35.2775 lat=32.8322>Jotapata</a>, and how I was taken alive, and bound, and how I was afterward loosed, with all that was done by me in the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> war, and during the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, I have accurately related them in the books concerning the War of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>. However, it will, I think, he fit for me to add now an account of those actions of my life which I have not related in that book of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> war. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg002:75'><b>&sect; 75</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;For when the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328352UIot class=place long=35.2775 lat=32.8322>Jotapata</a> was over, and I was among the Romans, I was kept with much care, by means of the great respect that <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> showed me. Moreover, at his command, I married a virgin, who was from among the captives of that country yet did she not live with me long, but was divorced, upon my being freed from my bonds, and my going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>. However, I married another wife at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, and was thence sent, together with <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a>, to the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and was frequently in danger of being put to death; while both the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> were very desirous to get me under their power, in order to have me punished. And the Romans also, whenever they were beaten, supposed that it was occasioned by my treachery, and made continual clamors to the emperors, and desired that they would bring me to punishment, as a traitor to them: but <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a> Caesar was well acquainted with the uncertain fortune of war, and returned no answer to the soldiers' vehement solicitations against me. Moreover, when the city <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> was taken by force, <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a> Caesar persuaded me frequently to take whatsoever I would of the ruins of my country; and did that he gave me leave so to do. But when my country was destroyed, I thought nothing else to be of any value, which I could take and keep as a comfort under my calamities; so I made this request to <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a>, that my family might have their liberty: I had also the holy books by <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a>'s concession. Nor was it long after that I asked of him the life of my brother, and of fifty friends with him, and was not denied. When I also went once to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, by the permission of <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a>, where there were a great multitude of captive women and children, I got all those that I remembered as among my own friends and acquaintances to be set free, being in number about one hundred and ninety; and so I delivered them without their paying any price of redemption, and restored them to their former fortune. And when I was sent by <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a> Caesar with Cerealius, and a thousand horsemen, to a certain village called Thecoa, in order to know whether it were a place fit for a camp, as I came back, I saw many captives crucified, and remembered three of them as my former acquaintance. I was very sorry at this in my mind, and went with tears in my eyes to <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a>, and told him of them; so he immediately commanded them to be taken down, and to have the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet two of them died under the physician's hands, while the third recovered. </p>                        </div>

And when he was going away to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, he made choice of me to sail along with him, and paid me great respect: and when we were come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, I had great care taken of me by <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>; for he gave me an apartment in his own house, which he lived in before he came to the empire. He also honored me with the privilege of a Roman citizen, and gave me an annual pension; and continued to respect me to the end of his life, without any abatement of his kindness to me; which very thing made me envied, and brought me into danger; for a certain <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jew</a>, whose name was <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a>, who had raised a tumult in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a>, and had persuaded two thousand men of that country to join with him, was the occasion of their ruin. But when he was bound by the governor of that country, and sent to the emperor, he told him that I had sent him both weapons and money. However, he could not conceal his being a liar from <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, who condemned him to die; according to which sentence he was put to death. Nay, after that, when those that envied my good fortune did frequently bring accusations against me, by God's providence I escaped them all. I also received from <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> no small quantity of land, as a free gift, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>; about which time I divorced my wife also, as not pleased with her behavior, though not till she had been the mother of three children, two of whom are dead, and one whom I named <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>, is alive. After this I married a wife who had lived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>, but a <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewess</a> by birth: a woman she was of eminent parents, and such as were the most illustrious in all the country, and whose character was beyond that of most other women, as her future life did demonstrate. By her I had two sons; the elder's name was <a href=/people/1511 target=_blank>Justus</a>, and the next <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>, who was also named <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>. And these were the circumstances of my domestic affairs. However, the kindness of the emperor to me continued still the same; for when <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> was dead, <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a>, who succeeded him in the government, kept up the same respect for me which I had from his father; and when I had frequent accusations laid against me, he would not believe them. And <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>, who succeeded, still augmented his respects to me; for he punished those <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> that were my accusers, and gave command that a servant of mine, who was a eunuch, and my accuser, should be punished. He also made that country I had in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a> tax free, which is a mark of the greatest honor to him who hath it; nay, <a href=/people/3584 target=_blank>Domitia</a>, the wife of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, continued to do me kindnesses. And this is the account of the actions of my whole life; and let others judge of my character by them as they please. But to thee, O <a href=/people/2406 target=_blank>Epaphroditus</a>, thou most excellent of men! do I dedicate all this treatise of our Antiquities; and so, for the present, I here conclude the whole. </p>                        </div>
