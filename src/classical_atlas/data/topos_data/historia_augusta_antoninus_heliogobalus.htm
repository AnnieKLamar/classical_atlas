The name <a href=/people/2267 target=_blank>Varius</a>, some say, was given him by his school-fellows because he seemed to be sprung from the seed of various men, as would be the case with the son of a harlot. 3 And then, when his reputed father <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> was slain by <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>' treachery, he sought refuge in the temple of <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> the god, as in a sanctuary, for fear that <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> would kill him; for <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> and his wasteful and brutal son were wielding the imperial power with the greatest cruelty. 4 But enough concerning his name — though he defiled this venerated name of the Antonines, which you, Most Sacred <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a>, so revere that you have had portrayed in gold both Marcus and <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a> together with the Constantii and the <a href=/people/4932 target=_blank>Claudii</a>, as though they too were your ancestors, just as you have adopted the virtues of the ancients which are naturally suited to your own character, and pleasing and dear to you as well. </p>                        </div>

Such are the pious hopes of men, who are quick to believe when they wish the thing to come true which their hearts desire. <br />4 As soon as he entered the city, however, neglecting all the affairs of the provinces, he established <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> as a god on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LPal class=place long=12.4884 lat=41.8896>Palatine</a> Hill close to the imperial palace; and he built him a temple, to which he desired to transfer the emblem of the <a href=/people/2057 target=_blank>Great Mother</a>, the fire of <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BPal class=place long=23.69 lat=37.94>Palladium</a>, the shields of the Salii, and all that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> held sacred, purposing that no god might be worshipped at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> save only <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a>. 5 He declared, furthermore, that the religions of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=ethnic long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaritans</a> and the rites of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> must also be transferred to this place, in order that the priesthood of <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> might include the mysteries of every form of worship. </p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> was the only one of all the emperors under whom a woman attended the senate like a man, just as though she belonged to the senatorial order. <br />3 He also established a senaculum, or women's senate, on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LQui class=place long=12.4871 lat=41.9011>Quirinal</a> Hill.

Such was the lack at that time in the state of any who could remove him from the government of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>'s majesty, whereas a deliverer from the tyrant had not been wanting in the case of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>, <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a>, and other such emperors. 2 But first of all I ask for pardon for having set down in writing what I have found in various authors, even though I have passed over in silence many vile details and those things which may not even be spoken of without the greatest shame. 3 But whatever I have told, I have covered up as best I could by the use of veiled terms. 4 Then too I have always believed that we must remember what Your Clemency is wont to say: It is <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> that makes a man emperor. There have indeed been unrighteous rulers and even very base ones. 5 But, as Your <a href=/people/1591 target=_blank>Piety</a> is wont to declare, men must look to it that those be worthy of the imperial office whom the power of <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a> has called to the destiny of being emperor. 6 Furthermore, since this man was the last of the Antonines and never again did one of this name appear in public life as emperor, the following fact must also be mentioned, in order that no confusion may arise when I shall begin to tell of the two Gordians, father and son, who desired to be called after the family of the Antonines: in the first place, they had not the surname but only the praenomen of the Antonines; 7 in the second, as I find in my books, their name was <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, and not <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. </p>                        </div>

Of these the most righteous and the most worthy of careful narration was <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> (who was emperor for thirteen years, whereas the others ruled but for six months or at most for one or two years), the most distinguished was <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a>, but the glory of them all was <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, the founder of your family. 3 About this man I fear to tell the truth in writing to Your Clemency, lest I may seem to the malicious to be a flatterer; but yet I shall be delivered from the envy of evil men, inasmuch as I have seen that in the eyes of others also he was the most illustrious. 4 To these rulers must be joined <a href=/people/1446 target=_blank>Diocletian</a>, father of the golden age, and <a href=/people/3044 target=_blank>Maximian</a>, father of the iron, as they commonly say, and all the others down to the time of Your <a href=/people/1591 target=_blank>Piety</a>. But as for you, 5 O revered Augustus, you shall receive honour in the many and more eloquent pages of those to whom a more kindly nature has granted this boon. 6 To these emperors we must add <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> and <a href=/people/2896 target=_blank>Maxentius</a>, all whose power has been made subject to your sway, writing of them, however, in such a way that full justice shall be done to their prowess. 7 For I will not, as is the wont of many writers, detract from the greatness of those who have been vanquished, since I perceive that if, in writing of them, I shall tell the whole truth concerning the noble qualities which they possessed, it will but enhance your glory. </p>                        </div>
