Tell me that. <br />At this question he blushed; so I said: Ah, Hippothales, son of <a href=/people/478 target=_blank>Hieronymus</a>, you need not trouble to tell me whether you are in love with somebody or not: for I know you are not only in love, but also far advanced already in your passion.

For I presume nothing could be found friendly to the bad. True. Nor, however, can like be friendly to like: this we stated just now, did we not? Yes.

For instance, we have only to consider a body in health to see that it has no need of doctoring or assistance: it is well enough as it is, and so no one in health is friend to a doctor, on account of his health. You agree? Yes. But the sick man is, I imagine, on account of his disease. Certainly. Now disease is a bad thing, and medicine is beneficial and good. Yes.

Thus what is neither bad nor good becomes a friend of the good because of the presence of evil. So it seems.
