[2] As I had been quaestor in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, O judges, and had departed for that province so as to leave among all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a> a pleasing and lasting recollection of my quaestorship and of my name, it happened, that while they thought their chief protection lay in many of their ancient patrons, they thought there was also some support for their fortunes secured in me, who, being now plundered and harassed, have all frequently come to me by the public authority, entreating me to undertake the cause and the defence of all their fortunes. They say that I repeatedly promised and repeatedly assured them, that, if any time should arrive when they wanted anything of me, I would not be wanting to their service. [3] They said that the time had come for me to defend not only the advantages they enjoyed, but even the life and safety of the whole province, that they had now not even any gods in their cities to whom they could flee, because Caius <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a> had carried off their most sacred images from the very holiest temples. That whatever luxury could accomplish in the way of vice, cruelty in the way of punishment, avarice in the way of plunder, or arrogance in the way of insult, had all been borne by them for the last three years, while this one man was praetor. That they begged and entreated that I would not reject them as suppliants, who, while I was in safety, ought to be suppliants to no one. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi004:2'><b>&sect; 2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I was vexed and distressed, O judges, at being brought into such a strait, as to be forced either to let those men's hopes deceive them who had entreated succour and assistance of me, or else, when I had from my very earliest youth devoted myself entirely to defending men, to be now, under the compulsion of the occasion and of my duty, transferred to the part of an accuser. I told them that they had an advocate in Quintus <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>, who had been quaestor in the same province after I was quaestor there. But the very thing which I thought would have been an assistance to me in getting rid of this difficulty, was above all things a hindrance to me; for they would have much more easily excused me if they had not known him, or if he had never been among them as quaestor. [5] I was induced, O judges, by the considerations of duty, good faith, and pity; by the example of many good men; by the ancient customs and habits of our ancestors, to think that I ought to take upon myself this burden of labour and duty, not for any purpose of my own, but in the time of need to my friends. In which business, however, this fact consoles me, O judges, that this pleading of mine which seems to be an accusation is not to be considered an accusation, but rather a defence. For I am defending many men, many cities, the whole province of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. So that, if one person is to be accused by me, I still almost appear to remain firm in my original purpose, and not entirely to have given up defending and assisting men. [6] But if I had this cause so deserving, so illustrious, and so important; if either the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a> had not demanded this of me, or I had not had such an intimate connection with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a>; and if I were to profess that what I am doing I am doing for the sake of the republic, in order that a man endowed with unprecedented covetousness, audacity, and wickedness, — whose thefts and crimes we have known to be most enormous and most infamous, not in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> alone, but in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=place long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaia</a>, in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=place long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylia</a>, and even at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, before the eyes of all men, — should be brought to trial by my instrumentality, still, who would there be who could find fault with my act or my intention? </p>                        </div>

What is there which either ought to be more pleasing to the Roman people, or which can be more desirable in the eves of the allies and of foreign nations, or more adapted to secure the safety and fortunes of all men? The provinces depopulated, harassed, and utterly overturned; the allies and tributaries of the Roman people afflicted and miserable, are seeking now not for any hope of safety, but for comfort in their destruction. [8] They who wish the administration of justice still to remain in the hands of the senatorial body, complain that they cannot procure proper accusers; those who are able to act as accusers, complain of the want of impartiality in the decisions. In the meantime the Roman people, although it suffers under many disadvantages and difficulties, yet desires nothing in the republic so much as the restoration of the ancient authority and importance to the courts of law. It is from a regret at the state of our courts of law that the restoration of the power of the tribunes is so eagerly demanded again. It is in consequence of the uncertainty of the courts of law, that another class is demanded to determine law-suits; owing to the crimes and infamy of the judges, even the office of censor, which formerly was used to be accounted too severe by the people, is now again demanded, and has become popular and praiseworthy. [9] In a time of such licentiousness on the part of the wicked, of daily complaint on the part of the Roman people, of dishonour in the courts of law, of unpopularity of the whole senate, as I thought that this was the only remedy for these numerous evils, for men who were both capable and upright to undertake the cause of the republic and the laws, I confess that I, for the sake of promoting the universal safety, devoted myself to upholding that part of the republic which was in the greatest danger. [10] Now that I have shown the motives by which I was influenced to undertake the cause, I must necessarily speak of our contention, that, in appointing an accuser, you may have some certain line of conduct to follow. I understand the matter thus, O judges: — when any man is accused of extortion, if there be a contest between any parties as to who may best be entrusted with the prosecution, these two points ought to be regarded most especially; first, whom they, to whom the injury is said to have been done, wish most to be their counsel; and secondly, whom he, who is accused of having done those injuries, would least wish to be so. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi004:4'><b>&sect; 4</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;[11] In this cause, O judges, although I think both these points plain, yet I will dilate upon each, and first on that which ought to have the greatest influence with you, that is to say, on the inclination of those to whom the injuries have been done; of those for whose sake this trial for extortion has been instituted. Caius <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a> is said for three years to have depopulated the province of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, to have desolated the cities of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a>, to have made the houses empty, to have plundered the temples. The whole nation of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a> is present, and complains of this. They fly for protection to my good faith, which they have proved and long known; they entreat assistance for themselves from you and from the laws of the Roman people through my instrumentality; they desire me to be their defender in these their calamities; they desire me to be the avenger of their injuries, the advocate of their rights, and the pleader of their whole cause. [12] Will you, O Quintus <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>, say this, that I have not approached the cause at the request of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a>? or that the desire of those most excellent and most faithful allies ought not to be of great influence with these judges? If you dare to say that which Caius <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>, whose enemy you are pretending to be, wishes especially to be believed, — that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a> did not make this request to me, — you will in the first place be supporting the cause of your enemy, against whom it is considered that no vague presumption, but that an actual decision has been come to, in the fact that has become notorious, that all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a> have begged for me as their advocate against his injuries. [13] If you, his enemy, deny that this is the case, which he himself to whom the fact is most injurious does not dare to deny, take care lest you seem to carry on your enmity in too friendly a manner. In the second place, there are witnesses, the most illustrious men of our state, all of whom it is not necessary that I should name, those who are present I will appeal to; while, if I were speaking falsely, they are the men whom I should least wish to be witnesses of my impudence. He, who is one of the assessors on this bid, Caius <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>, knows it; he, whom I see here present, Cnaeus <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> <a href=/people/1706 target=_blank>Marcellinus</a>, knows it; on whose good faith and protection the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a> principally depend, because the whole of that province is inalienably connected with the name of the <a href=/people/2425 target=_blank>Marcelli</a>. [14] These men know that this request was not only made to me, but that it was made so frequently and with such earnestness, that I had no alternative except either to undertake the cause, or to repudiate the duty of friendship. But why do I cite these men as witnesses, as if the matter were doubtful or unknown? Most noble men are present here from the whole province, who being present, beg and entreat you, O judges, not to let your judgment differ from their judgment in selecting an advocate for their cause. Deputations from every city in the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, except two, are present; and if deputations from those two were present also, two of the very most serious of the crimes would be lessened in which these cities are implicated with Caius <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>. [15] But why have they entreated this protection from me above all men? If it were doubtful whether they had entreated it from me or not, I could tell why they had entreated it; but now, when it is so evident that you can see it with your eyes, I know not why it should be any injury to me to have it imputed to me that I was selected above all men. [16] But I do not arrogate any such thing to myself, and I not only do not say it, but I do not wish even to leave any one to believe that I have been preferred to every possible advocate. That is not the fact but a consideration of the opportunities of each individual and of his health, and of his aptitude for conducting this cause, has been taken into account. My desire and sentiments on this matter have always been these, that I would rather that any one of those who are fit for it should undertake it than I; but I had rather that I should undertake it myself than that no one should. </p>                        </div>

And why need I say much on such a point as this? as if there were any doubt that the whole law about extortion was established for the sake of the allies. [18] For when citizens have been robbed of their money, it is usually sought to be recovered by civil action and by a private suit. This is a law affecting the allies, — this is a right of foreign nations. They have this fortress somewhat less strongly fortified now than it was formerly, but still if there be any hope left which can console the minds of the allies, it is all placed in this law. And strict guardians of this law have long since been required, not only by the Roman people, but by the most distant nations. [19] Who then is there who can deny that it is right that the trial should be conducted according to the wish of those men for whose sake the law has been established? All <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, if it could speak with one voice, would say this: — “All the gold, all the silver, all the ornaments which were in my cities, in my private houses, or in my temples, — all the rights which I had in any single thing by the kindness of the senate and Roman people, — all that you, O Caius <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>, have taken away and robbed me of, on which account I demand of you a hundred million of sesterces according to the law.” If the whole province, as I have said, could speak, it would say this, and as it could not speak, it has of its own accord chosen an advocate to urge these points, whom it has thought suitable. [20] In a matter of this sort, will any one be found so impudent as to dare to approach or to aspire to the conduct of the cause of others against the will of those very people whose affairs are involved in it? </p>                        </div>

Did any one ever strive so openly for any honour, or so earnestly for his own safety, as that man and his friends have striven to prevent this prosecution from being entrusted to me? There are many qualities which <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a> believes to be in me, and which he knows, O Quintus <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>, do not exist in you: and what qualities each of us have I will mention presently; [23] at this moment I will only say this, which you must silently agree to, that there is no quality in me which he can despise, and none in you which he can fear. Therefore, that great defender and friend of his votes for you and opposes me; he openly solicits the judges to have you preferred to me; and he says that he does this honestly, without any envy of me, and without any dislike to me. “For,” says he, “I am now asking for that which I usually obtain when I strive for it earnestly. I am not asking to have the defendant acquitted; but I am asking this, that he may be accused by the one man rather than by the other. Grant me this; grant that which is easy to grant, and honourable, and by no means invidious; and when you have granted that, you will, without any risk to yourself, and without any discredit, have granted that he shall be acquitted in whose cause I am labouring.” [24] He says also, in order that some alarm may be mingled with the exertion of his influence, that there are certain men on the bench to whom he wishes their tablets to be shown, and that that is very easy, for that they do not give their votes separately, but that all vote together; and that a tablet, covered with the proper wax, and not with that illegal wax which has given so much scandal, is given to every one. And he does not give himself all this trouble so much for the sake of <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>, as because he disapproves of the whole affair. For he sees that, if the power of prosecuting is taken away from the high-born boys whom he has hitherto played with, and from the public informers, whom he has always despised and thought insignificant (not without good reason), and to be transferred to fearless men of well-proved constancy, he will no longer be able to domineer over the courts of law as he pleases. </p>                        </div>

First of all, he must have a singular integrity and innocence. For there is nothing which is less tolerable than for him to demand an account of his life from another who cannot give an account of his own. Here I will not say any more of yourself. [28] This one thing, I think, all may observe, that up to this time you had no opportunity of becoming known to any people except to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a>; and that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a> say this, that even though they are exasperated against the same man, whose enemy you say that you are, still, if you are the advocate, they will not appear on the trial. Why they refuse to, you will not hear from me. Allow these judges to suspect what it is inevitable that they must. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a>, indeed, being a race of men over-acute, and too much inclined to suspiciousness, suspect that you do not wish to bring documents from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> against <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>; but, as both his praetorship and your quaestorship are recorded in the same documents, they suspect that you wish to remove them out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. [29] In the second place, an accuser must be trustworthy and veracious. Even if I were to think that you were desirous of being so, I easily see that you are not able to be so. Nor do I speak of these things, which, if I were to mention, you would not be able to invalidate, namely that you, before you departed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, had become reconciled to <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>; that <a href=/people/3945 target=_blank>Potamo</a>, your secretary and intimate friend, was retained by <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a> in the province when you left it; that Marcus <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>, your brother, a most exemplary and accomplished young man, is not only not present here and does not stand by you while prosecuting your alleged injuries, but that he is with <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>, and is living on terms of the closest friendship and intimacy with him. These, and other things belonging to you, are many signs of a false accuser; but these I do not now avail myself of. I say this, that you, if you were to wish it ever so much, still cannot be a faithful accuser. [30] For I see that there are many charges in which you are so implicated with <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>, that in accusing him, you would not dare to touch upon them. </p>                        </div>

It was a great crime, an immense sum, an impudent theft, an intolerable injustice. I must inevitably convict him of this charge; what will you do, O <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>? [31] Will you pass over this serious accusation, or will you bring it forward? If you bring it forward, will you charge that as a crime against another, which you did yourself at the same time in the same province? Will you dare so to accuse another, that you cannot avoid at the same time condemning yourself? If you omit the charge, what sort of a prosecution will yours be, which from fear of danger to yourself, is afraid not only to create a suspicion of a most certain and enormous crime, but even to make the least mention of it? Corn was bought, on the authority of a decree of the senate, of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a> while <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a> was praetor; [32] for which corn all the money was not paid. This is a grave charge against <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>; a grave one if I plead the cause, but, if you are the prosecutor, no charge at all. For you were the quaestor, you had the handling of the public money; and, even if the praetor desired it ever so much, yet it was to a great extent in your power to prevent anything being taken from it. Of this crime, therefore, if you are the prosecutor, no mention will be made. And so during the whole trial nothing will be said of his most enormous and most notorious thefts and injuries. Believe me, O <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>, he who is connected with the criminal in a partnership of iniquity, cannot really defend his associates while accusing him. [33] The contractors exacted money from the cities instead of corn. Well! was this never done except in the praetorship of <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>? I do not say that, but it was done while <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a> was quaestor. What then will you do? Will you urge against this man as a charge, what you both could and ought to have prevented from being done? or will you leave out the whole of it? <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>, then, at his trial will absolutely never hear at all of those things, which, when he was doing them, he did not know how he should be able to defend. </p>                        </div>

There are other acts of plunder more secret, which he, in order, I suppose, to check the courage and delay the attack of <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>, has very kindly participated in with his quaestor. [34] You know that information of these matters has been given to me; and if I were to choose to mention them, all men would easily perceive that there was not only a perfect harmony of will subsisting between you both, but that you did not pursue even your plunder separately. So that if you demand to be allowed to give information of the crimes which <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a> has committed in conjunction with you, I have no objection, if it is allowed by the law. But if we are speaking of conducting the prosecution, that you must yield ta those who are hindered by no crimes of their own from being able to prove the offences of another.

What shall I say of these other points, O <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>?

Have you paid any attention or acquired any acquaintance with the forum, the courts, and the laws?

On which account I say nothing of my own abilities; for I have none worth speaking of, and if I had I would not speak of them.

Do you think that, when you have taken upon yourself the cause of the allies, and the fortunes of the province, and the rights of the Roman people, and the dignity of the judgment-seat and of the law, in a discussion of the most important and serious matters, you are able to support so many affairs and those so weighty and so various with your voice, your memory, your counsel, and your ability? [38] Do you think that you are able to distinguish in separate charges, and in a well-arranged speech, all that Caius <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a> has done in his quaestorship, and in his lieutenancy, and in his praetorship, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, or in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, or in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=place long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaia</a>, or in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> Minor, or in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=place long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylia</a>, as the actions themselves are divided by place and time? Do you think that you are able (and this is especially necessary against a defendant of this sort) to cause the things which he has done licentiously, or wickedly, or tyrannically, to appear just as bitter and scandalous to those who hear of them, as they did appear to those who felt them? [39] Those things which I am speaking of are very important, believe me. Do not you despise this either; everything must be related, and demonstrated, and explained; the cause must be not merely stated, but it must also be gravely and copiously dilated on. You must cause, if you wish really to do and to effect anything, men not only to hear you, but also to hear you willingly and eagerly. And if nature kind been bountiful to you in such qualities, and if from your childhood you had studied the best arts and systems, and worked hard at them; — if you had learnt Greek literature at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, not at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378124ULil class=place long=12.4342 lat=37.7991>Lilybaeum</a>, and Latin literature at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and not in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>; still it would be a great undertaking to approach so important a cause, and one about which there is such great expectation, and having approached it, to follow it up with the requisite diligence; to have all the particulars always fresh in your memory; to discuss it properly in your speech, and to support it adequately with your voice and your faculties.

Are you then endowed with all these qualifications? — I wish indeed that I were; but at all events I have laboured with great industry from my very childhood to attain them. And if I, on account of the importance and difficulty of such a study have not been able to attain them, who have done nothing else all my life, how far do you think that you must be distant from these qualities, which you have not only never thought of before, but which even now, when you are entering on a stage that requires them all, you can form no proper idea of, either as for their nature or as to their importance? </p>                        </div>

[42] Even now I am surveying in my mind and thoughts what party spirit will be shown by men; what throngs of men will meet; how great an expectation the importance of the trial will excite; how greet a multitude of hearers the infamy of Caius <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a> will collect; how great an audience for my speech his wickedness will draw together And when I think of these things, even now I am afraid as to what I shall be able to say suitable to the hatred men bear him who are inimical and hostile to him, and worthy of the expectation which all men will form, and of the importance of the case. [43] Do you fear nothing, do you think of nothing are you anxious about nothing of all this? Or if from some old speech you have been able to learn, “I entreat the mighty and beneficent <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>,” or, “I wish it were possible, O judges,” or something of the sort, do you think that you shall come before the court in an admirable state of preparation? [44] And, even if no one were to answer you, yet you would not, as I think, be able to state and prove even the cause itself. Do you now never give it a thought, that you will have a contest with a most eloquent man, and one in a perfect state of preparation for speaking, with whom you will at one time have to argue, and at another time to strive and contend against him with all your might? Whose abilities indeed I praise greatly, but not so as to be afraid of them, and think highly of, thinking however at the same time that I am more easily to be pleased by them than cajoled by them. </p>                        </div>

I know all the modes of attack and every system of speaking the man has. We have often been employed on the same, often on opposite sides. Ingenious as he is, he will plead against me as if he were aware that his own ability is to same extent put on its trial. [45] But as for you, O <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>, I think that I see already how he will play with you, how he will bandy you about; how often he will give you power and option of choosing which alternative you please, — whether a thing were done or not, whether a thing be true or false; and whichever side you take will be contrary to your interest. What a heat you will be in, what bewilderment! what darkness, O ye immortal gods! will overwhelm the man, free from malice as he is. What will you do when he begins to divide the different counts of your accusation, and to arrange on his fingers each separate division of the cause? What will you do when he begins to deal with each argument, to disentangle it, to get rid of it? You yourself in truth will begin to be afraid lest you have brought an innocent man into danger. [46] What will you do when he begins to pity his client, to complain, and to take off some of his unpopularity from him and transfer it to you? to speak of the close connection necessarily subsisting between the quaestor and the praetor? of the custom of the ancients? of the holy nature of the connection between those to whom the same province was by lot appointed? Will you be able to encounter the odium such a speech will excite against you? Think a moment; consider again and again. For there seems to me to be danger of his overwhelming you not with words only, but of his blunting the edge of your genius by the mere gestures and motions of his body, and so distracting you and leading you away from every previous thought and purpose. [47] And I see that the trial of this will be immediate; for if you are able today to answer me and these things which I am saying; if you even depart one word from that book which some elocution-master or other has given you, made up of other men's speeches; I shall think that you are able to speak, and that you are not unequal to that trial also, and that you will be able to do justice to the cause and to the duty you undertake.

And this too is something, though it is not enough; for in all things he who is the chief person to act, ought to be the most accomplished and the best prepared. But I see that Lucius <a href=/people/2716 target=_blank>Appuleius</a> is the next counsel on the list, a mere beginner, not as to his age indeed, but as to his practice and training in forensic contests. [48] Next to him he has, as I think, <a href=/people/4402 target=_blank>Allienus</a>; he indeed does belong to the bar, but however, I never took any particular notice of what he could do in speaking; in raising an outcry, indeed, I see that he is very vigorous and practiced. In this man all your hopes are placed; he, if you are appointed prosecutor, will sustain the whole trial. But even he will not put forth his whole strength in speaking, but will consult your credit and reputation; and will abstain from putting forth the whole power of eloquence which he himself possesses, in order that you may still appear of some importance As we see is done by the Greek pleaders; that he to whom the second or third part belongs, though he may be able to speak somewhat better than his leader, often restrains himself a good deal, in order that the chief may appear to the greatest possible advantage, so will <a href=/people/4402 target=_blank>Allienus</a> act; he will be subservient to you, he will pander to your interest, he will put forth somewhat less strength than he might. [49] Now consider this, O judges, what sort of accusers we shall have in this most important trial; when <a href=/people/4402 target=_blank>Allienus</a> himself will somewhat abstain from displaying all his abilities, if he has any, and <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a> will only be able to think himself of any use, because <a href=/people/4402 target=_blank>Allienus</a> is not so vigorous as he might be, and voluntarily allows him the chief share in the display. What fourth counsel he is to have with him I do not know, unless it be one of that crowd of losers of time who have entreated to be allowed an inferior part in this prosecution, whoever he might be to whom you gave the lead.

And are you suffering under such a dearth of defendants, that you endeavour to filch this cause from me rather than look for some defendants of your own class at the pillar of <a href=/people/3625 target=_blank>Maenius</a>? [51] Appoint me, says he, to watch <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Tullius</a>. What? How many watchers shall I have need of, if I once allow you to meddle with my bag? as you will have to be watched not only to prevent your betraying anything, but to prevent your removing anything. But for the whole matter of that watchman I will answer you thus in the briefest manner possible; that these honest judges will never permit any assistant to force himself against my consent into so important a cause, when it has been undertaken by me, and is entrusted to me. [52] In truth, my integrity rejects an overlooker; my diligence is afraid of a spy. But to return to you, O <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>, you see how many qualities are wanting to you; how many belong to you which a guilty defendant would wish to belong to his prosecutor, you are well aware. What can be said to this? For I do not ask what you will say yourself, I see that it is not you who will answer me, but this book which your prompter has in his hand; who, if he be inclined to prompt you rightly, will advise you to depart from this place and not to answer me one word. For what can you say? That which you are constantly repeating, that <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a> has done you an injury? I have no doubt he has, for it would not be probable, when he was doing injuries to all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a>, that you alone should be so important in his eyes that he should take care of your interests. [53] But the rest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a> have found an avenger of their injuries; you, while you are endeavouring to exact vengeance for your injuries by your own means, (which you will not be able to effect,) are acting in a way to leave the injuries of all the rest unpunished and unavenged. And you do not see that it ought not alone to be considered who is a proper person to exact vengeance, but also who is a person capable of doing so, — that if there be a man in whom both these qualifications exist, he is the best man. [54] But if a man has only one of them, then the question usually asked is, not what he is inclined to do, but what he is able to do. And if you think that the office of prosecutor ought to be entrusted to him above all other men, to whom Caius <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a> has done the greatest injury, which do you think the judges ought to be most indignant at, — at your having been injured by him, or at the whole province of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> having been harassed and ruined by him? I think you must grant that this both is the worst thing of the two, and that it ought to be considered the worst by every one. A flow, therefore, that the province ought to be preferred to you as the prosecutor. For the province is prosecuting when he is pleading the cause whom the province has adopted as the defender of her rights, the avenger of her injuries, and the pleader of the whole cause. </p>                        </div>

Nothing of the sort. For I think it is material also to this argument to consider what sort of injury is alleged and brought forward as the cause of your enmity. Allow me to relate it. For he indeed, unless he is wholly destitute of sense, will never say what it is. There is a woman of the name of Agonis, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378124ULil class=person long=12.4342 lat=37.7991>Lilybaean</a>, a freedwoman of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380126UEry class=place long=12.588 lat=38.04>Erycina</a>; a woman who before this man was quaestor was notoriously well off and rich. From her some prefect of <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a>'s carried off some musical slaves whom he said he wished to use in his fleet. Then she, as is the custom in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> for all the slaves of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>, and all those who have procured their emancipation from her, in order to hinder the designs of the prefect, by the scruples which the name of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> would raise, said that she and all her property belonged to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>. [56] When this was reported to <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>, that most excellent and upright man, he ordered Agonis to be summoned before him; he immediately orders a trial to ascertain “if it appeared that she had said that she and all her property belonged to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>.” The recuperators decide all that was necessary, and indeed there was no doubt at all that she had said so. He sends men to take possession of the woman's property. He adjudges her herself to be again a slave of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>; then he sells her property and confiscates the money. So while Agonis wishes to keep a few slaves under the name and religious protection of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>, she loses all her fortunes and her own liberty by the wrong doing of that man. After that, <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a> comes to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378124ULil class=place long=12.4342 lat=37.7991>Lilybaeum</a>; he takes cognisance of the affair; he disapproves of the act; he compels his quaestor to pay back and restore to its owner all the money which he had confiscated, having been received for the property of Agonis. [57] He is here, and you may well admire it, no longer <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>, but Quintus <a href=/people/1024 target=_blank>Mucius</a>. For what could he do more delicate to obtain a high character among men? what more just to relieve the distress of the women? what more severe to repress the licentiousness of his quaestor? All this appears to me most exceedingly praiseworthy. But at the very next step, in a moment, as if he had drank of some Circaean cup, having been a man, he becomes <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a> again; he returns to himself and to his old habits. For of that money he appropriated a great share to himself, and restored to the woman only as much as he chose. </p>                        </div>

Secondly, I say that of the injury which was done to you no one of us ought to be a more severe avenger than you yourself, to whom it is said to have been done. If you afterwards became reconciled to him, if you were often at his house, if he after that supped with you, do you prefer to be considered as acting with treachery or by collusion with him? I see that one of these alternatives is inevitable, but in this matter I will have no contention with you to prevent your adopting which you please. [59] What shall I say if even the pretext of that injury which was done to you by him no longer remains? What have you then to say why you should be preferred, I will not say to me, but to any one? except that which I hear you intend to say, that you were his quaestor: which indeed would be an important allegation if you were contending with me as to which of us ought to be the most friendly to him; but in a contention as to which is to take up a quarrel against him, it is ridiculous to suppose that an intimate connection with him can be a just reason for bringing him into danger. [60] In truth, if you had received ever so many injuries from your praetor, still you would deserve greater credit by bearing them than by revenging them; but when nothing in his life was ever done more rightly than that which you call an injury, shall these judges determine that this cause, which they would not even tolerate in any one else, shall appear in your case to be a reasonable one to justify the violation of your ancient connection? When even if you had received the greatest injury from him, still, since you have been his quaestor, you cannot accuse him and remain blameless yourself. But if no injury has been done you at all, you cannot accuse him without wickedness; and as it is very uncertain whether any injury has been done you, do you think that there is any one of these men who would not prefer that you should depart without incurring blame rather than after having committed wickedness? </p>                        </div>

You, though you are in every respect inferior to me, still think that you ought to be preferred to me for this one reason, because you were his quaestor. I think, that if you were my superior in every other qualification, still that for this one cause alone you ought to be rejected as the prosecutor. For this is the principle which has been handed down to us from our ancestors, that a praetor ought to be in the place of a parent to his quaestor; that no more reasonable nor more important cause of intimate friendship can be imagined than a connection arising from drawing the same lot, having the same province, and being associated in the discharge of the same public duty and office. [62] Wherefore, even if you could accuse him without violating strict right, still, as he had been in the place of a parent to you, you could not do so without violating every principle of piety. But as you have not received any injury, and would yet be creating danger for your praetor, you must admit that you are endeavouring to wage an unjust and impious war against him. In truth, your quaestorship is an argument of so strong a nature, that you would have to take a great deal of pains to find an excuse for accusing him to whom you had acted as quaestor, and can never be a reason why you should claim on that account to have the office of prosecuting him entrusted to you above all men. Nor indeed, did any one who had acted as quaestor to another, ever contest the point of being allowed to accuse him without being rejected. [63] And therefore, neither was permission given to Lucius <a href=/people/486 target=_blank>Philo</a> to bring forward an accusation against Caius <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a>, nor to Marcus <a href=/people/11042 target=_blank>Aurelius</a> <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> to prosecute Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, nor to Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> to accuse Titus Albucius; not one of whom was refused this, permission because of any personal unworthiness, but in order that the desire to violate such an intimate connection might not be sanctioned by the authority of the judges. And that great man Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> contended about that matter with Caius <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a>, just as you are contending with me. For he had been the quaestor of Albucius, just as you were of <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>: <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> had on his side this reason for conducting the prosecution, that, just as we have now been entreated by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a>, so he had then been entreated by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=ethnic long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinians</a>, to espouse their cause. And this argument has always had the greatest influence; this has always been the most honourable cause for acting as accuser, that by so doing one is bringing enmity on oneself in behalf of allies, for the sake of the safety of a province, for the advantage of foreign nations — that one is for their sakes incurring danger, and spending much care and anxiety and labour. </p>                        </div>

When lately that most brave and upright man Lucius <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> demanded to be allowed to prefer an accusation against Publius <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>, and when Quintus <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a> claimed the same permission in opposition to <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, and said that in so doing he was following up an old quarrel which he had long had with <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>; it was not only the authority and dignity of <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> which had great weight, but also the superior justice of his cause, because the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a> had adopted him as their patron. [65] In truth, when the very law itself about extortion is the protectress of the allies and friends of the Roman people, it is an iniquitous thing that he should not, above all others, he thought the fittest advocate of the law and conductor of the trial, whom the allies wish, above all men, to be the pleader of their cause, and the defender of their fortunes. Or ought not that which is the more honourable to mention, to appear also far the most reasonable to approve of? Which then is the more splendid, which is the more honourable allegation — “I have prosecuted this man to whom I had acted as quaestor, with whom the lot cast for the provinces, and the custom of our ancestors, and the judgment of gods and men had connected me,” or, “I have prosecuted this man at the request of the allies and friends of the Roman people, I have been selected by the whole province to defend its rights and fortunes?” Can any one doubt that it is more honourable to act as prosecutor in behalf of those men among whom you have been quaestor, than as prosecutor of him whose quaestor you have been? [66] The most illustrious men of our state, in the best of times, used to think this most honourable and glorious for them to ward off injuries from their hereditary friends, and from their clients, and from foreign nations which were either friends or subjects of the Roman people, and to defend their fortunes. We learn from tradition that Marcus <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, that wise man, that most illustrious and most prudent man, brought upon himself great enmity from many men, on account of the injuries of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390000RIbe class=ethnic long=-4 lat=39>Spaniards</a> among whom he had been when consul. We know that lately Cnaeus <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> prosecuted Marcus <a href=/people/816 target=_blank>Silanus</a> on account of the injuries of one man, Egritomarus, his father's friend and comrade. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi004:21'><b>&sect; 21</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor indeed has anything ever had more influence over the minds of guilty men than this principle of our ancestors, now re-adopted and brought back among us after a long interval, namely, that the complaints of the allies should be brought to a man who is not very inactive, and their advocacy undertaken by him who appeared able to defend their fortunes with integrity and diligence. [68] Men are afraid of this; they endeavour to prevent this; they are disquieted at such a principle having ever been adopted, and after it has been adopted at its now being resuscitated and brought into play again. They think that, if this custom begins gradually to creep on and advance, the laws will be put in execution, and actions will be conducted by honourable and fearless men, and not by unskillful youths, or informers of this sort. [69] Of which custom and principle our fathers and ancestors did not repent when Publius <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, he who was chief of the Senate, prosecuted Marcus <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a>, having Caius <a href=/people/1250 target=_blank>Rutilius</a> <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a> backing the accusation; or when Publius <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a>, a man most eminent for valour, for good fortune, for renown, and for exploits, after he had been twice consul and had been censor brought Lucius <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a> to trial Then the name of the Roman people was rightly held in high honour; rightly was the authority of this empire and the majesty of the state considered illustrious. Nobody marveled in the case of that great man <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a>, as they now pretend to marvel with respect to me, a man endowed with but moderate influence and moderate talents, just because they are annoyed at me; [70] “What can he be meaning? does he want to be considered a prosecutor who hitherto has been accustomed to defend people? and especially now at the age when he is seeking the aedileship?” But I think it becomes not my age only, but even a much greater age, and I think it an action consistent with the highest dignity to accuse the wicked, and to defend the miserable and distressed. And in truth, either this is a remedy for a republic diseased and in an almost desperate condition, and for tribunals corrupted and contaminated by the vices and baseness of a few, for men of the greatest possible honour and uprightness and modesty to undertake to uphold the stability of the laws, and the authority of the courts of justice; or else, if this is of no advantage, no medicine whatever will ever be found for such terrible and numerous evils as these. [71] There is no greater safety for a republic, than for those who accuse another to be no less alarmed for their own credit, and honour, and reputation, than they who are accused are for their lives and fortunes. And therefore, those men have always conducted prosecutions with the greatest care and with the greatest pains, who have considered that they themselves had their reputations at stake. </p>                        </div>

For he has nothing which he can lose by disappointing public expectation; even if he were to come off ever so shamefully, or ever so infamously, he will lose no credit which he at present enjoys. [72] From us the Roman people has many hostages which we must labour with all our might and by every possible means to preserve uninjured, to defend, to keep in safety, and to redeem; it has honour which we are desirous of; it has hope, which we constantly keep before our eyes; it has reputation, acquired with much sweat and labour day and night; so that if we prove our duty and industry in this cause, we may be able to preserve all those things which I have mentioned safe and unimpaired by the favour of the Roman people; but if we trip and stumble ever so little, we may at one moment lose the whole of those things which have been collected one by one and by slow degrees. [73] On which account it is your business, O judges, to select him who you think can most easily sustain this great cause and trial with integrity, with diligence, with wisdom, and with authority. If you prefer Quintus <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a> to me, I shall not think that I am surpassed in dignity; but take you care that the Roman people do not think that a prosecution as honest, as severe, as diligent as this would have been in my hands, was neither pleasing to yourselves nor to your body. </p>                        </div>
