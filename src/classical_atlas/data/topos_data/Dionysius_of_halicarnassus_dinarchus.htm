                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0081.tlg009:1'><b>&sect; 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;IN MY WRITINGS on the ancient orators, I said nothing about the orator <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a>, since the man was neither the inventor of a unique style, as <a href=/people/142 target=_blank>Lysias</a>, <a href=/people/222 target=_blank>Isocrates</a> and <a href=/people/357 target=_blank>Isaeus</a> were, nor a perfecter of styles invented by others, as <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, <a href=/people/96 target=_blank>Aeschines</a> and <a href=/people/731 target=_blank>Hyperides</a> were. But since I see that this man has been acclaimed by many for the skill of his speeches and has left not a few public and private speeches of merit, I believed it incumbent upon me not to ignore him but to examine his life and style; and I think it absolutely, or at least very necessary, for those who are not dilettantes in the study of rhetoric, to distinguish between the genuine and spurious speeches. At the same time, I see, too, that neither <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a> nor the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=demonym long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamene</a> scholars wrote anything precise about him, but, in their failure to inquire about him, committed errors in the more precise details, with the result that they not only have falsified much but also assign speeches to him which are not his at all, while those written by him they say are the works of others. <br />And <a href=/people/12268 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397227RMag class=person long=22.9 lat=39.4>Magnesia</a>, who was reputed a polymath, in mentioning this man, too, in his treatise On Homonyms, and giving an evaluation with the intention of saying something precise about him, was cheated of his expectation. There is no reason not to quote his words. The following was written by him: We have come across four men named <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a>: one is one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> orators; one collected the legends about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>; one, earlier than both these men, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=demonym long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delian</a> in birth, wrote both poetry and history; the fourth composed a work on <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>. I want to examine each in turn, and first the orator. Now this man, at least in my opinion, is not inferior to <a href=/people/731 target=_blank>Hyperides</a> in charm and, so to speak, 'even now might have driven past him'. For his use of enthymeme is plausible, and he employs a variety of figures of speech; he has such power of persuasion as to convince his audience that the situation was as he himself describes it. And one might consider naive those who assume that the speech against <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> is his; for it is very different in style. Yet so much obscurity has covered the truth that the result has been an ignorance of his other speeches, roughly 160 of them, while the one not written by him is alone considered his. The diction of <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a> is properly in character, arousing emotion, inferior to the Demosthenic style almost solely in acerbity and forcefulness, but not at all deficient in persuasiveness and propriety. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0081.tlg009:2'><b>&sect; 2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;From these words nothing either precise or true can be discovered: for he has shown neither the man's origins, nor when he lived, nor where he spent his life, but has busied himself only with common and fashionable words; and he has stated a number for the speeches consonant with no other account. But the opposite [i.e. method] was necessary. What, therefore, I myself have found out through my own effort is as follows: <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a>, the orator, was the son of <a href=/people/988 target=_blank>Sostratus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a> in family. Arriving in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> at the time when the schools of the philosophers and the rhetoricians were flourishing, he associated with <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> and <a href=/people/876 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379237DPha class=person long=23.7062 lat=37.9373>Phalerum</a>. Since he had a gift for civil oratory, he began to write speeches while the party of <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> was still at its peak, and gradually came into repute. He was at his peak right after the death of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, when <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> and the other orators had met with permanent exile or death, and no one worth mentioning was left along with him. And he spent fifteen years writing speeches for those who wanted them, while <a href=/people/146 target=_blank>Cassander</a> held the city. <br />But during the archonship of <a href=/people/2710 target=_blank>Anaxicrates</a> [307/6 B.C.], when the supporters of the kings <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> and <a href=/people/234 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> [i.e. Poliorcetes] put down the garrison in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379237HMou class=place long=23.658 lat=37.938>Munychia</a> which had been established by <a href=/people/146 target=_blank>Cassander</a>, he incurred the charge, even though an alien, together with the most distinguished citizens, of subverting the government. Since he saw that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> were aroused and especially that they were jealously suspicious of his wealth, in order not to suffer some harm because of this he did not await trial but left the city and went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236PCha class=place long=23.6153 lat=38.4597>Chalcis</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a>. There he lived from the archonship of <a href=/people/2710 target=_blank>Anaxicrates</a> until that of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a>, a period of fifteen years, waiting for some avenue of return through <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> and his other friends. </p>                        </div>
                        <div class="text-right bottommargin-sm">

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0081.tlg009:3'><b>&sect; 3</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the king [i.e. <a href=/people/234 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> Poliorcetes] had consented to his return also along with the other exiles, he came back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, and during his stay with <a href=/people/640 target=_blank>Proxenus</a>, a friend of his, he lost his money, an old man now with failing eyesight. Since <a href=/people/640 target=_blank>Proxenus</a> was lax in the search, he brought suit against him about his property, never before having personally appeared in court. This is the life of the man. Each of these facts is seen from the history of <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philochorus</a> and from what he himself wrote about himself in the speech against <a href=/people/640 target=_blank>Proxenus</a>, which was delivered after his exile and has this indictment attached to it: I, <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a>, son of <a href=/people/988 target=_blank>Sostratus</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a>, bring suit against <a href=/people/640 target=_blank>Proxenus</a>, with whom I live, for damages to the sum of two talents. <a href=/people/640 target=_blank>Proxenus</a> did damage to me, by receiving into his house in the country, when after my exile from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> I returned from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236PCha class=place long=23.6153 lat=38.4597>Chalcis</a>, 285 gold staters which I brought back from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236PCha class=place long=23.6153 lat=38.4597>Chalcis</a>, as <a href=/people/640 target=_blank>Proxenus</a> knew, and which I had when I entered his house, and silver articles valued at not less than 20 minas, and by having designs on this property. Not only that but in the speech itself, right at the beginning, he has indicated his lack of involvement in any previous lawsuit; and in the section immediately after this, in the prooemium, he has indicated the damage done him by <a href=/people/640 target=_blank>Proxenus</a>, while in the following part he gives the details of his exile and all the other incidents. From these remarks, what was said before is evident. And in addition to this, that he remained an alien and was already an old man when he delivered his speech is evident from what he has said at the end of the speech. <br />This information <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a> himself gives about himself. <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philochorus</a>, moreover, in his Attic History speaks about the exile and return of those who had subverted the government in this way: For right at the beginning of <a href=/people/2710 target=_blank>Anaxicrates</a>' archonship [307 BCE], the city of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a> was captured; then <a href=/people/234 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> [Poliorcetes] upon returning from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=place long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megara</a> began military preparations against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379237HMou class=place long=23.658 lat=37.938>Munychia</a> and, having razed the walls, restored it to the government. But later, many of the citizens were impeached, <a href=/people/876 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379237DPha class=person long=23.7062 lat=37.9373>Phalerum</a> also among them. And of the impeached, those who did not await the verdict of a trial they condemned to death by decree, but those who submitted they acquitted. This is in the eighth book. And in the ninth he says: At the end of this year and the beginning of the next, the following portent occurred on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAkr class=place long=23.7257 lat=37.9717>Acropolis</a>. A <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> went into the temple of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> <a href=/people/2067 target=_blank>Polias</a>, entered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SEre class=place long=23.72641 lat=37.97209>Pandrosium</a>, mounted the altar of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> <a href=/people/3608 target=_blank>Herkeios</a>, which was beneath the olive tree, and lay down. It is an ancestral custom of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> that no <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> go up to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAkr class=place long=23.7257 lat=37.9717>Acropolis</a>. About the same time, in the heavens, in broad daylight with the sun shining and the sky clear, a bright star was visible for some time. And we, when questioned about the meaning of the portent and supernatural sign, said that both prophesied the return of the exiles and that this would occur not from revolution but under the existing government; and it came to pass that the interpretation was fulfilled. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly we hold that he returned from exile in his seventieth year, as he also says, calling himself an old man; from this time on we are especially inclined to call those in this period of life old. Assuming the correctness of this rough calculation (for we have nothing precise), he would have been born during the archonship of <a href=/people/2535 target=_blank>Nicophemus</a> [361/0 B.C.]. And if anyone says that he is older or younger than the stated times, besides speaking unsoundly he will deny him many speeches, or rather all except five or six, by saying that he is too old for some but too young for others. Moreover we would not be mistaken in saying that he began to write speeches in his twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth year, especially since the party of <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> was at its peak at that time. <a href=/people/8234 target=_blank>Pythodemus</a> is the twenty-sixth archon after <a href=/people/2535 target=_blank>Nicophemus</a>. Thus, as many speeches as we find assigned to him before the year of this archon we might reasonably reject from the genuine speeches; and, again, the speeches composed from the time of <a href=/people/2710 target=_blank>Anaxicrates</a> to that of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a> we might similarly place among the spurious; for no one would sail to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236PCha class=place long=23.6153 lat=38.4597>Chalcis</a> for the sake of speeches, whether private or public; for they were not so completely destitute of speech-writers. </p>                        </div>

This is difficult to define.

There are many examples to support this. Of the Lysianic style examples can be found in the speech concerning <a href=/people/2763 target=_blank>Mnesicles</a>, in the speech against <a href=/people/5097 target=_blank>Lysicrates</a> in behalf of <a href=/people/562 target=_blank>Nicomachus</a> and in many others; of the Hyperidean style, which is more precise in arrangement and somehow better in artistic treatment than that of <a href=/people/142 target=_blank>Lysias</a>, examples can be found in more than thirty speeches of <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a>, and not least of all in the obstructive plea in behalf of <a href=/people/484 target=_blank>Agathon</a>. And indeed of the Demosthenic style which he imitated most of all, one could name many more examples but in particular in the speech against <a href=/people/825 target=_blank>Polyeuctus</a>. For he begins as <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> does and throughout the whole speech has stayed close to the Demosthenic style. </p>                        </div>

First, if he knew the styles of the others; then, if he assigned to this orator the speeches which resemble those of <a href=/people/142 target=_blank>Lysias</a>; and if he counted as the work of <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a> those speeches which some believe belong to <a href=/people/731 target=_blank>Hyperides</a> and declared his complete indifference to the labels of the papyrus rolls; and if he confidently affirmed as the work of this man those speeches which approximate the Demosthenic style. For with respect to the other orators whom he imitates, the uniformity of their speeches provides the surest means of identification. <a href=/people/142 target=_blank>Lysias</a>, for example, in both his public and private speeches shows his consistency ... and, as regards his style of expression, in the clarity of his vocabulary and in its composition, which seems to be natural and artless but at the same time is in every speech remarkable in its gracefulness. <br /><a href=/people/731 target=_blank>Hyperides</a>, on the other hand, although inferior to <a href=/people/142 target=_blank>Lysias</a> in his choice of vocabulary, is superior in his treatment of subject-matter. He describes in a variety of ways, proceeding now in natural sequence, now from end to beginning; and he convinces by amplifying not only with enthymeme but also with epicheireme. But <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, who surpasses these and all the others, who imitates everything and selects the most beautiful of everything, is uniquely outstanding in language, and outstanding in the propriety of every single speech and in composition as well and in the intricacy of his patterns and in arrangement and in emotion and, most of all, in intensity. In contrast, <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a> is neither consistent throughout his speeches nor the inventor of anything unique by which one will identify him with precision, except in this way; for he reveals to a great extent his imitations and difference from the models of his speeches, even as is the case of <a href=/people/222 target=_blank>Isocrates</a>' disciples and of <a href=/people/222 target=_blank>Isocrates</a> himself. </p>                        </div>

But if he does not find a similar charm or persuasiveness and precision of vocabulary or impression of sincerity, let him keep them among the speeches of <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a>. Similarly with the speeches of <a href=/people/731 target=_blank>Hyperides</a>; if there is vigor of diction, simplicity of composition, appropriateness of topics and the absence of bombastic and turgid treatment (for these are the chief characteristics of that man), let him count them as the work of <a href=/people/731 target=_blank>Hyperides</a>. But if they are rather deficient in these particular respects, even if in all others they are not written badly, again let him enter them among the speeches of <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a>.

In general, two different kinds of imitation of the ancient styles might be found: one is natural and acquired by considerable study and familiarity, but the alternate to this, by the rules of the art. Now concerning the former, what else is there to say? But concerning the latter, what could one say except that in all the models a certain natural charm and grace are conspicuous, whereas in the copies, even if they are almost perfect imitations, still a certain artificial and unnatural tone is evident. And by this rule not only do orators judge orators, but painters the works of <a href=/people/460 target=_blank>Apelles</a> and his imitators, sculptors in stone the works of <a href=/people/3073 target=_blank>Polyclitus</a> and sculptors in soft materials the works of <a href=/people/402 target=_blank>Phidias</a>. </p>                        </div>

On the other hand, those who say they emulate <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a>, in their faulty grasp of the forcefulness, the hardness, the intensity and other similar characteristics, come up with solecistic expressions and vagueness and may be caught quite easily by this rule. In the same way, too, with the orators, those imitating <a href=/people/731 target=_blank>Hyperides</a>, in their failure to achieve that charm and the rest of his talent, tended to become dry, as were the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=demonym long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodian</a> orators of the school of <a href=/people/8892 target=_blank>Artamenes</a>, <a href=/people/657 target=_blank>Aristocles</a>, <a href=/people/5892 target=_blank>Philagrius</a> and <a href=/people/949 target=_blank>Molon</a>.

But his choice of vocabulary is inferior to the Demosthenic in intensity; his composition, in the variety of the figures of speech and in diversity; his invention of epicheiremes, in his use not of the fresh and unexpected but of obvious arguments of the middle kind; his arrangement, in the disposition and in the treatment of the epicheiremes and in the preliminary statements of argument and in the exordia and in the other artistic rules concerned with this literary form; but he is especially inferior to <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> in sense of proportion, in timing and in propriety. I do not say these things in an absolute way, as if he never achieved them, but in a looser way, as generally true.

This speech was delivered in the archonship of <a href=/people/392 target=_blank>Eubulus</a> or <a href=/people/1372 target=_blank>Lyciscus</a>, who succeeded <a href=/people/392 target=_blank>Eubulus</a>, when <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a> was not yet twenty years old ... For the speech concerning a certain man who had been disfranchised occurred in the time of <a href=/people/437 target=_blank>Archias</a>, who succeeded <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a>. And each of these statements is clear from the speech itself. <br />Against <a href=/people/1890 target=_blank>Moschion</a>, on his enrollment of himself as the son of <a href=/people/8028 target=_blank>Nicodicus</a>: 'With the disfranchisement, gentlemen, of this <a href=/people/1890 target=_blank>Moschion</a> by the Sybalettians [Sphendalians'?] This speech was delivered at the same time as the previous speech. The beginning itself and the subsequent sections of the speech make this clear. <br />Against <a href=/people/2113 target=_blank>Menecles</a>, on the occasion of his arrest: Gentlemen of the jury, even with the laws according to which. This speech also was delivered while <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a> was still a child. For the defendant is <a href=/people/2113 target=_blank>Menecles</a>, who obtained a conviction against the priestess <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a>, while the prosecutor is the son of <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a>. These events are earlier than <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a>' prime. For the speech of <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, On the Name, in which he recalls these events, was composed during the archonship of <a href=/people/8391 target=_blank>Theelus</a> or <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a>, as we have shown in our work on <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>. And if <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> recalls <a href=/people/2113 target=_blank>Menecles</a> there as already dead in saying [Dem. 39.13]: For you all know of his intimacy with <a href=/people/2113 target=_blank>Menecles</a> while <a href=/people/2113 target=_blank>Menecles</a> lived the speech is an old one. And that this <a href=/people/2113 target=_blank>Menecles</a> is meant, the prosecutor has shown in the speech itself. <br />A claim suit for the Athmoneis, concerning the myrtle and the smilax: I pray, by <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a> and <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Kore</a>. It is earlier than <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a>' prime. For it was delivered during the archonship of <a href=/people/562 target=_blank>Nicomachus</a>, as is clear from the speech itself, when the orator was twenty-one years old. These, then, are the spurious speeches current before his prime. The following were composed after his departure from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236PCha class=place long=23.6153 lat=38.4597>Chalcis</a>. <br />A claim suit for the priestess of <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a> against the hierophant: With many unexpected things, gentlemen of the jury This speech was delivered while he was already in exile, as is obvious from the speech. For in it the speaker recalls the overthrown oligarchy. <br />Against <a href=/people/250 target=_blank>Timocrates</a>, a speech for impeachment on a charge of subverting the democracy: You commit acts Even the title itself clearly indicates the speech as spurious. <br />Against <a href=/people/2259 target=_blank>Spudias</a>: And in the assembly I promised I would accuse. This was delivered after the overthrow of the oligarchy, with <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a> already in exile, as is quite obvious from the speech itself. <br />A claim suit of the Heudanemoi against the <a href=/people/2626 target=_blank>Kerykes</a>, concerning the basket: Such matters in no way And this was delivered at the same time, with the orator already in exile, as is again clear from the speech itself. <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> speech: Of all were they similarly This also was delivered in those times, as is obvious from the speech itself. <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=demonym long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aetolian</a> speech: We ambassadors also, men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> This speech was delivered, after the establishment of the oligarchy, by the exiles from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> in their request for aid from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=ethnic long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aetolians</a>, since <a href=/people/146 target=_blank>Cassander</a> was also attempting an attack upon them who were free men, as is clear from the speech itself. Therefore, it is not likely that <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a>, a friend of those who had established the oligarchy, assisted those attempting to overthrow it, nor is it probable that they obtained speeches from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. <br />A deliberative speech for <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> in his request for privileges: Because of the difficulty. I am convinced that this speech was written by <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, since <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> drafted the proposed privileges for him, as <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a> has shown in his speech against <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, and since at the end of the speech <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> summons <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> to deliver a supporting speech. I find it unlikely that <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, out of friendship for <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>, drafted the proposed honors but allowed <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> to obtain the speech from <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a>. <br />Defence for <a href=/people/580 target=_blank>Hermias</a>, supervisor of the trade-exchange, concerning the charges against him: I ask of you, gentlemen The style itself reveals that it is not the speech of <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a> (for it is insipid, weak and frigid), but it might with more probability be assigned to Democlides or <a href=/people/3207 target=_blank>Menesaechmus</a> or some other such orator. <br />I also deny him both speeches in behalf of <a href=/people/3207 target=_blank>Menesaechmus</a>, of which one is Concerning the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253SSan class=demonym long=25.2666 lat=37.4004>Delian</a> sacrifice which begins We beseech you and, and the other is Against <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a> and <a href=/people/2156 target=_blank>Democrates</a> which begins We believe, gentlemen, on account of the style (for it is insipid, diffuse and frigid). A second reason is that the speaker of these speeches, since he was well known and succeeded <a href=/people/12419 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a> as treasurer of public finances and himself appeared frequently both in private and in public suits, all of which he discloses in the speeches, would not have been so incompetent as to have used <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a> as his speech-writer. <br />On the refusal to surrender <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a> to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>: It is not fitting to admire This speech does not reveal the style of <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a>. For even if nothing else, much nonsense and sophistry occur in it, characteristics especially alien to <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a>' style. <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=demonym long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delian</a> speech: Of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> and <a href=/people/4772 target=_blank>Rhoeo</a>, the daughter of <a href=/people/1232 target=_blank>Staphylus</a> This is not the work of the orator but of some other writer. The tenor and style clearly show that it is old and covers the local history of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372269PLer class=place long=26.8547 lat=37.158>Leros</a>. <br />Against <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, for illegal proposals: You are accustomed, gentlemen In the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=demonym long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamene</a> indices this is entered as the work of <a href=/people/710 target=_blank>Callicrates</a>. For my part I do not know if it is the work of that man (for I have not come across a single speech by <a href=/people/710 target=_blank>Callicrates</a>), but I am convinced that it is completely different from the speeches of <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a>, since it is worthless, empty, and marked by an amateurish babbling. </p>                        </div>

This speech was delivered during the archonship of <a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemus</a>, as is clear from the speech itself. For the clerouchs who had gone to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a> went in the time of this archon, as <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philochorus</a> [FGrHist 328 F 154] states in his history. At that time <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a> was not yet ten years old. <br />Against <a href=/people/6661 target=_blank>Melesander</a>, concerning the trierarchy: Just as the laws bid. Whose speech this might be, I cannot say, but the speaker implies that the wrong was committed during the archonship of <a href=/people/949 target=_blank>Molon</a>. And he states that he went to court in the following year during the archonship of <a href=/people/2535 target=_blank>Nicophemus</a>, when, by our findings, <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a> was born. <br />Against <a href=/people/885 target=_blank>Boeotus</a>, concerning the name: Not from love of being a nuisance. Even if those who deny this speech to <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> and assign it to <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a> were not refuted in other points, with regard to time, at least, they would be proven wrong. For he recalls the expedition which was made to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388225FThe class=place long=22.536 lat=38.795>Pylae</a> as recent, and the expedition of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388225FThe class=place long=22.536 lat=38.795>Pylae</a> was made during the archonship of <a href=/people/8420 target=_blank>Thudemus</a> [353 BC], when <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a> was eight years old. <br />Against <a href=/people/1841 target=_blank>Mantitheus</a>, concerning a dowry: Most painful of all is. This follows the previous speech and has many such stylistic characteristics as would indicate the same orator, outside the time of <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a>' speeches. For it was not many years later, but only two or three, that the plaintiff contended the case, all of which we have shown more precisely in our work on <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>. <br />For Athenades, a supporting speech against Amyntichus, concerning the raft: Being a good friend of mine. <br />The second speech: I think that you, gentlemen. The speech [i.e. Or. 84 and Or. 85] was delivered while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> general <a href=/people/4138 target=_blank>Diopithes</a> was still busy in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>, as is obvious from the speech itself. The time is in the archonship of <a href=/people/5217 target=_blank>Pythodotus</a>, as <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philochorus</a> [.FGrHist 328 F 158] shows with the other ... in the time of this archon not yet twenty years old. <br />Against Mecythus, concerning a mine: Having leased a mine, gentlemen This speech was delivered during the archonship of <a href=/people/562 target=_blank>Nicomachus</a>. For the speaker declares that he had leased the mine during the archonship of <a href=/people/392 target=_blank>Eubulus</a> and, having worked it for three years before being driven out by the lessee of neighboring mines, brought suit against him in the archonship of <a href=/people/562 target=_blank>Nicomachus</a>, when <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a> was twenty-one years old. <br />Defence for <a href=/people/397 target=_blank>Satyrus</a> against <a href=/people/472 target=_blank>Charidemus</a>, in a guardianship suit: Let not, in the face of great danger This, too, was delivered during the archonship of <a href=/people/562 target=_blank>Nicomachus</a>. <br />Concerning an exchange of property, against <a href=/people/4605 target=_blank>Megaclides</a>: If it were necessary, gentlemen, with regard to three or four. The speaker is <a href=/people/1467 target=_blank>Aphareus</a>, and the speech lies outside the time of <a href=/people/354 target=_blank>Dinarchus</a>. For it was delivered while the general <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a> was still alive, about the time of his command with <a href=/people/865 target=_blank>Menestheus</a>, when he was convicted during his audit. And <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a> underwent his audit in the time of <a href=/people/1200 target=_blank>Diotimus</a>, who succeeded <a href=/people/659 target=_blank>Callistratus</a>, when also . . .n [At this point the manuscript shows an abrupt break in the text.] </p>                        </div>
