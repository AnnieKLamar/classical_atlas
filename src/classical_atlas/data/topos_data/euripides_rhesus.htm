Now I with thoughtful mind awoke from my slumber, and with ungrudging hand did measure out the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>' feed, expecting to harness them at dawn unto the fray; when lo! through the thick gloom two men I see roaming around our army. But when I roused myself they fled away, and were gone once more; and I called out to them to keep away from our army, for I thought they might be thieves from our allies.

Yet from henceforth will he be to me as one dead that seeth not the light; for never again will he meet me or see his mother's face, but will lurk hidden in a cavern of the land with veins of silver, restored to life, no longer man but god, even as the prophet of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a> did dwell in a grotto 'neath <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409241LPan class=place long=24.0828 lat=40.9169>Pangaeus</a>, a god whom his votaries honoured. Lightly now shall I feel the grief of the sea-goddess, for her son too must die. First then for thee we sisters must chaunt our dirge, and then for <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> when <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a> mourns some day. Him shall not <a href=/people/429 target=_blank>Pallas</a>, thy slayer, save; so true the shaft <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Loxias</a> keeps in his quiver for him. Ah me! the sorrows that a mother feels! the troubles of mortals! whoso fairly reckons you up will live and die a childless man and will have no children to bury.
