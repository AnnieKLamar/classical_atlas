However, fortune aided his purpose. 7 For after <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> had returned from his province, and had finished composing, either by his own efforts or with the help of imperial secretaries or the rhetoricians, a very pretty speech, still read nowadays, wherein he intended to convey his thanks to his father <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> on the Kalends of January, he swallowed a potion which he believed would benefit him and died on that very day of January. 8 All public lamentation for him was forbidden by <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> because it was the time for assuming the vows for the state. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi2331.phi002:5'><b>&sect; 5</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> was a man of joyous life and well versed in letters, and he was endeared to <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>, as the malicious say, rather by his beauty than by his character. 2 In the palace his stay was but a short one; in his private life, though there was little to be commended, yet there was little to be blamed. Furthermore, he was considerate of his family, well-dressed, elegant in appearance, a man of regal beauty, with a countenance that commanded respect, a speaker of unusual eloquence, deft at writing verse, and, moreover, not altogether a failure in public life. 3 His pleasures, many of which are recorded by his biographers, were not indeed discreditable but somewhat luxurious. 4 For it is <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> who is said to have been the inventor of the tetrapharmacum, or rather pentapharmacum, of which <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> was thereafter always fond, namely, a mixture of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sows</a>' udders, pheasant, <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>peacock</a>, ham in pastry and wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>. 5 Of this article of food <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> gives a different account, for he calls it, not pentapharmacum, but tetrapharmacum, as we have ourselves described it in our biography of <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>. 6 There was also another kind of pleasure, it is said, of which <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> was the inventor. 7 He constructed, namely, a bed provided with four high cushions and all inclosed with a fine net; this he filled with rose-leaves, from which the white parts had been removed, and then reclined on it with his mistresses, burying himself under a coverlet made of lilies, himself anointed with perfumes from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>. 8 Some even relate that he made couches and tables of roses and lilies, these flowers all carefully cleansed, a practice, which, if not creditable, at least did not make for the destruction of the state. 9 Furthermore, he always kept the Recipes of <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a> <a href=/people/2714 target=_blank>Apicius</a> and also <a href=/people/2769 target=_blank>Ovid</a>'s Amores at his bedside, and declared that Martial, the writer of Epigrams, was his <a href=/people/118 target=_blank>Vergil</a>. 10 Still more trivial was his custom of fastening wings on many of his messengers after the fashion of Cupids, and often giving them the names of the winds, calling one <a href=/people/208 target=_blank>Boreas</a>, another <a href=/people/2367 target=_blank>Notus</a>, others Aquilo, or Circius, or some other like name, and forcing them to bear messages without respite or mercy. 11 And when his wife complained about his amours with others, he said to her, it is reported: Let me indulge my desires with others; for wife is a term of honour, not of pleasure. <br />12 His son was <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a>, who was adopted by Marcus, or rather, with Marcus, and received an equal share with him in the imperial power. 13 For these are the men who first received the name of Augustus conjointly, and whose names are inscribed in the lists of the consuls, not as two Antonini but as two Augusti. 14 And such was the impression created by the novelty and the dignity of this fact that in some of the lists the order of the consuls begins with the names of these emperors. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi2331.phi002:6'><b>&sect; 6</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the occasion of the adoption of <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a>, <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> bestowed a vast sum of money on the populace and the soldiery. 2 But being a rather sagacious man, when he saw that <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> was in such utterly wretched health that he could not brandish a shield of any considerable weight, he remarked, it is said: 3 We have lost the three hundred million sesterces which we paid out to the army and to the people, for we have indeed leaned against a tottering wall, and one which can hardly bear even our weight, much less that of the Empire. 4 This remark, indeed, <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> made to his prefect, 5 but the man repeated it, and as a result <a href=/people/499 target=_blank>Aelius</a> Caesar grew worse every day from anxiety, as a man does who had lost hope. Thereupon <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> appointed a successor for the prefect who had divulged the remark, wishing to give the impression that he had qualified his harsh words. 6 But it profited him nothing, for Lucius Ceionius <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> <a href=/people/499 target=_blank>Aelius</a> Caesar (for he was called by all these names)30 died and was accorded an emperor's funeral, nor did he derive any benefit from his imperial position save honour at his death. 7 <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>, then, mourned his death as might a good father, not a good emperor. For when his friends anxiously asked who could now be adopted, <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> is said to have replied to them: I decided that even when <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> was still alive, 8 thereby showing either his good judgment or his knowledge of the future. 9 After <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a>' death <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> was in doubt for a time as to what he should do, but finally he adopted <a href=/people/12361 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, who had received the surname <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a>. And he imposed on <a href=/people/12361 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> the condition that he in turn should adopt Marcus and <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a>, and should give his daughter in marriage to <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a>, rather than to Marcus. 10 Nor did <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> live long thereafter, but succumbed to weakness and illnesses of various kinds, all the while declaring that a prince ought to die, not in an enfeebled condition, but in full vigour. </p>                        </div>
