But let us open the door a bit ajar without his seeing it. Has he done eating? Come, pluck up courage, cram yourself till you burst! The cursed creature! It wallows in its food! It grips it between its claws like a wrestler clutching his opponent, and with head and feet together rolls up its paste like a ropemaker twisting a hawser. What an indecent, stinking, gluttonous beast! I know not what angry god let this monster loose upon us, but of a certainty it was neither <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> nor the <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a>. <br />FIRST SERVANT: Who was it then? <br />SECOND SERVANT: No doubt the Thunderer, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. <br />FIRST SERVANT: But perhaps some spectator, some beardless youth, who thinks himself a sage, will say, What is this? What does the beetle mean? And then an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=person long=27.3 lat=38>Ionian</a>, sitting next him, will add, I think 'tis an allusion to <a href=/people/285 target=_blank>Cleon</a>, who so shamelessly feeds on filth all by himself. — But now I'm going indoors to fetch the beetle a drink. </p>                        </div>

My master is mad, not as you are, but with another sort of madness, quite a new kind. The livelong day he looks open-mouthed towards heaven and never stops addressing <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. Ah! <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, he cries, what are thy intentions? Lay aside thy besom; do not sweep Greece away! <br />TRYGAEUS: Ah! ah! ah! <br />FIRST SERVANT: Hush, hush! Methinks I hear his voice! <br />TRYGAEUS: Oh! <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, what art thou going to do for our people? Dost thou not see this, that our cities will soon be but empty husks? <br />FIRST SLAVE: As I told you, that is his form of madness. There you have a sample of his follies. When his trouble first began to seize him, he said to himself, By what means could I go straight to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>? Then he made himself very slender little ladders and so clambered up towards heaven; but he soon came hurtling down again and broke his head. Yesterday, to our misfortune, he went out and brought us back this thoroughbred, but from where I know not, this great beetle, whose groom he has forced me to become. He himself caresses it as though it were a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, saying, Oh! my little <a href=/people/1116 target=_blank>Pegasus</a>, my noble aerial steed, may your wings soon bear me straight to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>! But what is my master doing? I must stoop down to look through this hole. Oh! great gods! Here! neighbours, run here quick! here is my master flying off mounted on his beetle as if on horseback. <br />TRYGAEUS: Gently, gently, go easy, beetle; don't start off so proudly, or trust at first too greatly to your powers; wait till you have sweated, till the beating of your wings shall make your limb joints supple. Above all things, don't let off some foul smell, I adjure you; else I would rather have you stop in the stable altogether. <br />SECOND SERVANT: Poor master! Is he crazy? <br />TRYGAEUS: Silence! silence! <br />SECOND SERVANT (to <a href=/people/3986 target=_blank>Trygaeus</a>). But why start up into the air on chance? <br />TRYGAEUS: 'Tis for the weal of all the Greeks; I am attempting a daring and novel feat. </p>                        </div>

This accounts for her beauty, if she is related to him. There are so many things that escape us. <br />HERMES: Then, when the towns subject to you saw that you were angered one against the other and were showing each other your teeth like <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>, they hatched a thousand plots to pay you no more dues and gained over the chief citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> at the price of gold.

Not having even a grape-stone to munch and longing after their figs, they looked towards the orators. These well knew that the poor were driven to extremity and lacked even bread; but they nevertheless drove away the Goddess each time she reappeared in answer to the wish of the country with their loud shrieks, that were as sharp as pitchforks; furthermore, they attacked the well-filled purses of the richest among our allies on the pretence that they belonged to <a href=/people/293 target=_blank>Brasidas</a>' party. And then you would tear the poor accused wretch to pieces with your teeth; for the city, all pale with hunger and cowed with terror, gladly snapped up any calumny that was thrown it to devour. So the strangers, seeing what terrible blows the informers dealt, sealed their lips with gold. They grew rich, while you, alas! you could only see that Greece was going to ruin.

That he was a cheat, a braggart, a calumniator when alive, why, nothing could be truer; but anything you might say now would be an insult to one of your own folk. Oh! venerated Goddess! why art thou silent? <br />HERMES: And how could she speak to the spectators? She is too angry at all that they have made her suffer. <br />TRYGAEUS: At least let her speak a little to you, <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>. <br />HERMES: Tell me, my dear, what are your feelings with regard to them?

The next day you will celebrate equestrian games, in which the riders will ride side by side, or else the chariot teams, thrown one on top of another, panting and whinnying, will roll and knock against each other on the ground, while other rivals, thrown out of their seats, will fall before reaching the goal, utterly exhausted by their efforts. — Come, <a href=/people/1337 target=_blank>Prytanes</a>, take Theoria.
