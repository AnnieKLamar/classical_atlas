For all these men whom you see present at this trial think that a man ought to be defended against all injury contrived against him by unrivalled wickedness; but through the sad state of the times they do not dare to defend him themselves. So it comes to pass that they are present here because they are attending to their business, but they are silent because they are afraid of danger. [2] What then? Am I the boldest of all these men? By no means. Am I then so much more attentive to my duties than the rest? I am not so covetous of even that praise, as to wish to rob others of it. What is it then which has impelled me beyond all the rest to undertake the cause of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a>? Because, if any one of those men, men of the greatest weight and dignity, whom you see present, had spoken, had said one word about public affairs, as must be done in this case, he would be thought to have said much more than he really had said. [3] But if I should say all the things which must be said with ever so much freedom, yet my speech will never go forth or be diffused among the people in the same manner. Secondly, because anything said by the others cannot be obscure, because of their nobility and dignity, and cannot be excused as being spoken carelessly, on account of their age and prudence; but if I say anything with too much freedom, it may either be altogether concealed, because I have not yet mixed in public affairs, or pardoned on account of my youth; although not only the method of pardoning, but even the habit of examining into the truth is now eradicated from the State. [4] There is this reason, also, that perhaps the request to undertake this cause was made to the others so that they thought they could comply or refuse without prejudice to their duty; but those men applied to me who have the greatest weight with me by reason of their friendship with me, of the kindnesses they have done me, and of their own dignity; whose kindness to me I could not be ignorant of whose authority I could not despise, whose desires I could not neglect. </p>                        </div>

Perhaps you may ask, What is that dread, and what is that alarm which hinders so many, and such eminent men, from being willing, as they usually are, to plead on behalf of the life and fortunes of another? And it is not strange that you are as yet ignorant of this, because all mention of the matter which has given rise to this trial has been designedly omitted by the accusers. [6] What is that matter? The property of the father of this <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a>, which is six millions of sesterces, which one of the most powerful young men of our city at this present time, Lucius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a>, says he bought of that most gallant and most illustrious man Lucius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, whom I only name to do him honour, for two thousand sesterces. He, O judges, demands of you that, since he, without any right, has taken possession of the property of another, so abundant and so splendid, and as the life of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> appears to him to stand in the way of and to hinder his possession of that property, you will efface from his mind every suspicion, and remove all his fear. He does not think that, while this man is safe, he himself can keep possession of the ample and splendid patrimony of this innocent man; but if he be convicted and got rid of, he hopes he may be able to waste and squander in luxury what he has acquired by wickedness. He begs that you will take from his mind this uneasiness which day and night is pricking and harassing him, so as to profess yourselves his assistants in enjoying this his nefariously acquired booty. [7] If his demand seems to you just and honourable, O judges, I, on the other hand, proffer this brief request, and one, as I persuade myself, somewhat more reasonable still. </p>                        </div>

In the second place, I beg you, O judges, to resist the wickedness of audacious men; to relieve the calamities of the innocent, and in the cause of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> to repel the danger which is being aimed at every one. [8] But if any pretence for the accusation — if any suspicion of this act — if, in short, any, the least thing be found, — so that in bringing forward this accusation they shall seem to have had some real object, — if you find any cause whatever for it, except that plunder which I have mentioned, I will not object to the life of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> being abandoned to their pleasure. But if there is no other object in it, except to prevent anything being wanting to those men, whom nothing can satisfy, if this alone is contended for at this moment, that the condemnation of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> may be added as a sort of crown, as it were, to this rich and splendid booty, — though many things be infamous, still is not this the most infamous of all things, that you should be thought fitting men for these fellows now to expect to obtain by means of your sentences and your oaths, what they have hitherto been in the habit of obtaining by wickedness and by the sword; that though you have been chosen out of the state into the senate because of your dignity, and out of the senate into this body because of your inflexible love of justice — still assassins and gladiators should ask of you, not only to allow them to escape the punishment which they ought to fear and dread at your hands for their crimes, but also that they may depart from this court adorned and enriched with the spoils of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a>? </p>                        </div>

For my want of capacity is a hindrance to my speaking with propriety; my age, to my speaking with dignity; the times themselves are an obstacle to my speaking with freedom. To this is added great fear, which both nature and my modesty cause me, and your dignity, and the violence of our adversaries, and the danger of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a>. On which account, I beg and entreat of you, O judges, to hear what I have to say with attention, and with your favourable construction. [10] Relying on your integrity and wisdom, I have undertaken a greater burden than, I am well aware, I am able to bear. If you, in some degree, lighten this burden, O judges, I will bear it as well as I can with zeal and industry. But if, as I do not expect, I am abandoned by you, still I will not fail in courage, and I will bear what I have undertaken as well as I can. But if I cannot support it, I had rather be overwhelmed by the weight of my duty, than either through treachery betray, or through weakness of mind desert, that which has been once honestly entrusted to me. [11] I also, above all things, entreat you, O Marcus <a href=/people/1133 target=_blank>Fannius</a>, to show yourself at this present time both to us and to the Roman people the same man that you formerly showed yourself to the Roman people when you before presided at the trial in this same cause. </p>                        </div>

You are aware how great is the expectation of men, and how great their desire that the decisions of the courts of law should be severe and impartial. After a long interval, this is the first cause about matters of bloodshed which has been brought into court, though most shameful and important murders have been committed in that interval. All men hope that while you are praetor, these trials concerning manifest crimes, and the daily murders which take place, will be conducted with no less severity than this one. [12] We who are pleading this cause adopt the exclamations which in other trials the accusers are in the habit of using. We entreat of you, O Marcus <a href=/people/1133 target=_blank>Fannius</a>, and of you, O judges, to punish crimes with the greatest energy; to resist audacious men with the greatest boldness; to consider that unless you show in this cause what your disposition is, the covetousness and wickedness, and audacity of men will increase to such a pitch that murders will take place not only secretly, but even here in the forum, before your tribunal, O Marcus <a href=/people/1133 target=_blank>Fannius</a>; before your feet, O judges, among the very benches of the court. [13] In truth, what else is aimed at by this trial, except that it may be lawful to commit such acts? They are the accusers who have invaded this man's fortunes. He is pleading his cause as defendant, to whom these men have left nothing except misfortune. They are the accusers, to whom it was an advantage that the father of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> should be put to death. He is the defendant, to whom the death of his father has brought not only grief, but also poverty. They are the accusers, who have exceedingly desired to put this man himself to death. He is the defendant who has come even to this very trial with a guard, lest he should be slain here in this very place, before your eyes. Lastly, they are the accusers whom the people demand punishment on, as the guilty parties. [14] He is the defendant, who remains as the only one left after the impious slaughter committed by them. And that you may be the more easily able to understand, O judges, that what has been done is still more infamous than what we mention, we will explain to you from the beginning how the matter was managed, so that you may the more easily be able to perceive both the misery of this most innocent man, and their audacity, and the calamity of the republic. </p>                        </div>

And of all his property he has left this alone to his son, — for domestic robbers have possession of his patrimony, which they have seized by force the fame and life of this innocent man is defended by his paternal connections and friends. [16] As he had at all times been a favourer of the side of the nobility, so, too, in this last disturbance, when the dignity and safety of all the nobles was in danger, he, beyond all others in that neighbourhood, defended that party and that cause with all his might, and zeal, and influence. He thought it right, in truth, that he should fight in defence of their honour, on account of whom he himself was reckoned most honourable among his fellow-citizens. After the victory was declared, and we had given up arms, when men were being proscribed, and when they who were supposed to be enemies were being taken in every district, he was constantly at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a>, and was daily in the sight of every one; so that he seemed rather to exult in the victory of the nobility, than to be afraid lest any disaster should result to him from it. [17] He had an ancient quarrel with two Roscii of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426124UAme class=place long=12.4134 lat=42.5572>Ameria</a>, one of whom I see sitting in the seats of the accusers, the other I hear is in possession of three of this man's farms; and if he had been as well able to guard against their enmity as he was in the habit of fearing it, he would be alive now. And, O judges, he was not afraid without reason. In these two Roscii, (one of whom is surnamed <a href=/people/903 target=_blank>Capito</a>; the one who is present here is called <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a>,) are men of this sort. One of them is an old and experienced gladiator, who has gained many victories, but this one here has lately betaken himself to him as his tutor: and though, before this contest, he was a mere tyro in knowledge, he easily surpassed his tutor himself in wickedness and audacity. </p>                        </div>

In ten hours of the night he travelled fifty-six miles in a gig; not only to be the first to bring his enemy the wished-for news, but to show him the blood of his enemy still quite fresh, and the weapon only lately extracted from his body. [20] Four days after this happened, news of the deed is brought to <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a> to the camp of Lucius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/434109UVol class=place long=10.86 lat=43.4035>Volaterra</a>.

This property, worth six millions of sesterces, is bought for two thousand. I well know, O judges, that all this was done without the knowledge of Lucius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>; [22] and it is not strange that while he is surveying at the same time both the things which are past, and those which seem to be impending; when he alone has, the authority to establish peace, and the power of carrying on war; when all are looking to him alone, and he alone is directing all things; when he is occupied incessantly by such numerous and such important affairs that he cannot breathe freely, it is not strange, I say, if he fails to notice some things; especially when so many men are watching his, busy condition, and catch their opportunity of doing something of this sort the moment he looks away. To this is added, that although he is fortunate, as indeed he is, yet no man can have such good fortune, as in a vast household to have no one, whether slave or freedman, of worthless character. [23] In the meantime Titus <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a>, excellent man, the agent of <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a>, comes to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426124UAme class=place long=12.4134 lat=42.5572>Ameria</a>; he enters on this man's farm; turns this miserable man, overwhelmed with grief, who had not yet performed all the ceremonies of his father's funeral, naked out of his house, and drives him headlong from his paternal hearth and household gods; he himself becomes the owner of abundant wealth. He who had been in great poverty when he had only his own property, became, as is usual, insolent when in possession of the property of another; he carried many things openly off to his own house; he removed still more privily; he gave no little abundantly and extravagantly to his assistants; the rest he sold at a regular auction. </p>                        </div>

In truth, many things calculated to cause grief were brought at once before their eyes; the most cruel death of a most prosperous man, <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a>, and the most scandalous distress of his son; to whom that infamous robber had not left out of so rich a patrimony even enough for a road to his father's tomb; the flagitious purchase of his property, the flagitious possession of it; thefts, plunders, largesses. There was no one who would not rather have had it all burnt, than see Titus <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> acting as owner of and glorying in the property of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a>, a most virtuous and honourable man. [25] Therefore a decree of their senate is, immediately passed, that the ten chief men should go to Lucius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, and explain to him what a man <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> had been; should complain of the wickedness and outrages of those fellows, should entreat him to see to the preservation both of the character of the dead man, and of the fortunes of his innocent son, And observe, I entreat you, this decree — [here the decree is read] — The deputies come to the camp. It is now seen, O judges, as I said before, that these crimes and atrocities were committed without the knowledge of Lucius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>. For immediately <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a> himself comes to them, and sends some men of noble birth to them too, to beg them not to go to <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, and to promise them that <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a>, will do everything which they wish. [26] But to such a degree was he alarmed, that he would rather have died than have let <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> be informed of these things. These old-fashioned men, who judged of others by their own nature, when he pledged himself to have the name of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> removed from the lists of proscription, and to give up the farms unoccupied to his son, and when Titus <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> <a href=/people/903 target=_blank>Capito</a>, who was one of the ten deputies, added his promise that it should be so, believed him; they returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426124UAme class=place long=12.4134 lat=42.5572>Ameria</a> without presenting their petition. And at first those fellows began every day to put the matter off and to procrastinate; then they began to be more indifferent; to do nothing and to trifle with them; at last, as was easily perceived, they began to contrive plots against the life of this <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a>, and to think that they could no longer keep possession of another man's property while the owner was alive. </p>                        </div>

By her virtue and good faith and diligence it has been caused that he now is rather classed as a living man among the accused, than as a dead man among the proscribed.

What wickedness does there seem to be wanting in these numberless atrocities?

What sort of man is he? is he a young man, corrupted, and led on by worthless men? He is more than forty years old. Is he forsooth an old assassin, a bold man, and one well practised in murder? You have not heard this so much as mentioned by the accuser. To be sure; then, luxury, and the magnitude of his debts, and the ungovernable desires of his disposition, have urged the man to this wickedness? <a href=/people/12124 target=_blank>Erucius</a> acquitted him of luxury, when he said that he was scarcely ever present at any banquet. But he never owed anything Further what evil desires could exist in that man who as his accuser himself objected to him has always lived in the country and spent his time in cultivating his land, a mode of life which is utterly removed from covetousness, and inseparably allied to virtue? [40] What was it then which inspired <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> with such madness as that? Oh, says he, he did not please his father. He did not please his father? For what reason? for it must have been both a just and an important and a notorious reason. For as this is incredible, that death should be inflicted on a father by a son, without many and most weighty reasons; so this, too, is not probable, that a son should be hated by his father, without many and important and necessary causes. [41] Let us return again to the same point, and ask what vices existed in this his only son of such importance as to make him incur the displeasure of his father. But it is notorious he had no vices. His father then was mad to bate him whom he had begotten, without any cause. But he was the most reasonable and sensible of men. This, then, is evident, that, if the father was not crazy, nor his son profligate, the father had no cause for displeasure, nor the son for crime. </p>                        </div>

The same thing which happened to <a href=/people/12124 target=_blank>Erucius</a> in supporting this wicked and trifling charge, has happened to me in advocating a most righteous cause. He could find no means of supporting this trumped-up charge; I can hardly find out by what arguments I am to invalidate and get rid of such trifling circumstances. [43] What do you say, <a href=/people/12124 target=_blank>Erucius</a>? Did <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> entrust so many farms, and such fine and productive ones to his son to cultivate and manage, for the sake of getting rid of and punishing him? What can this mean? Do not fathers of families who have children, particularly men of that class of municipalities in the country, do they not think it a most desirable thing for them that their sons should attend in a great degree to their domestic affairs, and should devote much of their labour and attention to cultivating their farms? [44] Did he send him off to those farms that he might remain on the land and merely have life kept in him at this country seat? that he might be deprived of all conveniences? What? if it is proved that he not only managed the cultivation of the farms, but was accustomed himself to have certain of the farms for his own, even during the lifetime of his father? Will his industrious and rural life still be called removal and banishment? You see, O <a href=/people/12124 target=_blank>Erucius</a>, how far removed your line of argument is from the fact itself, and from truth. That which fathers usually do, you find fault with as an unprecedented thing; that which is done out of kindness, that you accuse as having been done from dislike; that which a father granted his son as an honour, that you say he did with the object of punishing him. [45] Not that you are not aware of all this, but you are so wholly without any arguments to bring forward, that you think it necessary to plead not only against us, but even against the very nature of things, and against the customs of men, and the opinion of every one. </p>                        </div>

[46] If fortune did not give to you to know the father whose son you are, so that you could understand what was the affection of fathers towards their children; still, at all events, nature has given you no small share of human feeling. To this is added a zeal for learning, so that you are not unversed in literature.

[47] Why do you have recourse to such trifling? you will say. As if it were a hard matter for me to bring forward ever so many by name, of my own tribe, or my own neighbours, (not to wander too far off,) who wish those sons for whom they have the greatest regard, to be diligent farmers. But it is an odious step to quote known men, when it is uncertain whether they would like their names to be used; and no one is likely to be better known to you than this same <a href=/people/3025 target=_blank>Eutychus</a>; and certainly it has nothing to do with the argument, whether I name this youth in a play, or some one of the country about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420124UVei class=place long=12.3897 lat=42.0233>Veii</a>.

[48] Come now; turn your thoughts, if you please, to reality, and consider not only in Umbria and that neighbourhood, but in these old municipal towns, what pursuits are most praised by fathers of families.

Certainly you, who think it a crime to have superintended the cultivation of a farm, would consider that <a href=/people/585 target=_blank>Atilius</a>, whom those who were sent to him found sowing seed with his own hand, a most base and dishonourable man. But, forsooth, our ancestors judged very differently both of him and of all other such men. And therefore from a very small and powerless state they left us one very great and very prosperous. For they diligently cultivated their own lands, they did not graspingly desire those of others; by which conduct they enlarged the republic, and this dominion, and the name of the Roman people, with lands and conquered cities, and subjected nations. [51] Nor do I bring forward these instances in order to compare them with these matters which we are now investigating; but in order that that may be understood: that, as in the times of our ancestors, the highest and most illustrious men, who ought at all times to have been sitting at the helm of the republic, yet devoted much of their attention and time to the cultivation of their lands; that man ought to be pardoned, who avows himself a rustic, for having lived constantly in the country, especially when be could do nothing which was either more pleasing to his father, or more delightful to himself, or in reality more honourable. [52] The bitter dislike of the father to the son, then, is proved by this, O <a href=/people/12124 target=_blank>Erucius</a>, that he allowed him to remain in the country. Is there anything else? Certainly, says he, there is. For he was thinking of disinheriting him. I hear you. Now you are saying something which may have a bearing on the business, for you will grant, I think, that those other arguments are trifling and childish. He never went to any feasts with his father. Of course not, as he very seldom came to town at all. People very seldom asked him to their houses.

I ask how you know it? Although you ought to mention and enumerate all the reasons. And it was the duty of a regular accuser, who was accusing a man of such wickedness, to unfold all the vice and sins of a son had exasperated the father so as to enable him to bring his mind to subdue nature herself — to banish from his mind that affection so deeply implanted in it — to forget in short that he was a father; and all this I do not think could have happened without great errors on the part of the son. [54] But I give you leave to pass over those things, which, as you are silent, you admit have no existence. At all events you ought to make it evident that he did intend to disinherit him.

Invent something at least with probability in it; that you may not manifestly be convicted of doing what you are openly doing — insulting the fortunes of this unhappy man, and the dignity of these noble judges.

A man is innocent. But although he is free from guilt he is not free from suspicion. Although it is a lamentable thing, still I can, to some extent, pardon a man who accuses him. For when be has anything which he can say, imputing a crime, or fixing a suspicion, he does not appear knowingly to be openly mocking and calumniating. On which account we all easily allow that there should be as many accusers as possible; because an innocent man, if he be accused, can be acquitted; a guilty man, unless or he be accused cannot be convicted. But it is more desirable that an innocent man should be acquitted, than that a guilty man should not be brought to trial.

A charge which, O judges, even when many motives appear to concur, and to be connected with one another, is still not rashly believed, nor is such a case allowed to depend on slight conjecture, nor is any uncertain witness listened to, nor is the matter decided by the ability of the accuser. Many crimes previously committed must be proved, and a most profligate life on the part of the prisoner, and singular audacity, and not only audacity, but the most extreme frenzy and madness. When all these things are proved, still there must exist express traces of the crime: where, in what manner, by whose means, and at what time the crime was committed.

What followed? it was, indeed, a suspicious business; that neither of them were aware of it, and that some one had ventured to introduce himself into that chamber, especially at that time when two young men were in the same place, who might easily have heard the noise and defended him. Moreover, there was no one on whom suspicion of the deed could fall. [65] Still as it was plain to the judges that they were found sleeping with the door open, the young men were acquitted and released from all suspicion. For no one thought that there was any one who, when he had violated all divine and human laws by a nefarious crime, could immediately go to sleep; because they who have committed such a crime not only cannot rest free from care, but cannot even breathe without fear. </p>                        </div>

And this is the truth, O judges. The blood of one's father and mother has great power, great obligation, is a most holy thing, and if any stain of that falls on one, it not only cannot be washed out, but it drips down into the very soul, so that extreme frenzy and madness follow it. [67] For do not believe, as you often see it written in fables, that they who have done anything impiously and wickedly are really driven about and frightened by the furies with burning torches. It is his own dishonesty and the terrors of his own conscience that especially harassed each individual; his own wickedness drives each criminal about and affects him with madness; his own evil thoughts, his own evil conscience terrifies him. These are to the wicked their incessant and domestic furies which night and day exact from wicked sons punishment for the crimes committed against their parents. [68] This enormity of the crime is the cause why, unless a parricide is proved in a manner almost visible, it is not credible, unless a man's youth has been base, unless his life has been stained with every sort of wickedness, unless his extravagance has been prodigal and accompanied with shame and disgrace, unless his audacity has been violent, unless his rashness has been such as to be not far removed from insanity. There must be, besides a hatred of his father, a fear of his father's reproof — worthless friends, slaves privy to the deed, a convenient opportunity, a place fitly selected for the business. I had almost said the judges must see his hands stained with his father's blood, if they are to believe so monstrous, so barbarous, so terrible a crime. [69] On which account, the less credible it is unless it be proved, the more terribly is it to be punished if it be proved. </p>                        </div>

When he was asked why he had appointed no punishment for him who killed his father, he answered that he had not supposed that any one would do so. He is said to have done wisely in establishing nothing about a crime which had up to that time never been committed, lest he should seem not so much to forbid it as to put people in mind of it. How much more wisely did our ancestors act! for as they understood that there was nothing so holy that audacity did not sometimes violate it, they devised a singular punishment for parricides in order that they whom nature herself had not been able to retain in their duty, might be kept from crime by the enormity of the punishment. They ordered them to be sown alive in a sack, and in that condition to be thrown into the river. </p>                        </div>

They would not throw his body to wild beasts, lest we should find the very beasts who had touched such wickedness, more savage; they would not throw them naked into the river, lest when they were carried down into the sea, they should pollute that also, by which all other things which have been polluted are believed to be purified. There is nothing in short so vile or so common that they left them any share in it. [72] Indeed what is so common as breath to the living, earth to the dead, the sea to those who float, the shore to those who are cast up by the sea? These men so live, while they are able to live at all, that they are unable to draw breath from heaven; they so die that earth does not touch their bones; they are tossed about by the waves so that they are never washed; lastly, they are cast up by the sea so, that when dead they do not even rest on the rocks.

[73] Is it that you do not see what the cause really is, or before whom it is being pleaded?

Did he give them a bribe? to whom did he give it? by whose agency did he give it? whence did he get it, and how much did he giver? Are not these the steps by which one generally arrives at the main fact of guilt? And let it occur to you at the same time how you have painted this man's life; that you have described him as an unpolished and country-mannered man; that he never held conversation with any one, that he had never dwelt in the city. [75] And in this I pass over that thing which might be a strong argument for me to prove his innocence, that atrocities of this sort are not usually produced among country manners, in a sober course of life, in an unpolished and rough sort of existence. As you cannot find every sort of crop, nor every tree, in every field, so every sort of crime is not engendered in every sort of life. In a city, luxury is engendered; avarice is inevitably produced by luxury; audacity must spring from avarice, and out of audacity arises every wickedness and every crime. But a country life, which you call a clownish one, is the teacher of economy, of industry, and of justice. </p>                        </div>

I ask then by whose instrumentality did this man, who, as you yourself say, never mixed with men, contrive to accomplish this terrible crime with such secrecy, especially while absent? There are many things, O judges, which are false, and which can still be argued so as to cause suspicion. But in this matter, if any grounds for suspicion can be discovered, I will admit that there is guilt. <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> is murdered at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, while his son is at his farm at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426124UAme class=place long=12.4134 lat=42.5572>Ameria</a>. He sent letters, I suppose, to some assassin, he who knew no one at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. He sent for some one — but when? He sent a messenger — whom? or to whom? Did he persuade any one by bribes, by influence, by hope, by promises? None of these things can even be invented against him, and yet a trial for parricide is going on. [77] The only remaining alternative is that he managed it by means of slaves. Oh ye immortal gods, how miserable and disastrous is our lot. That which under such an accusation is usually a protection to the innocent, to offer his slaves to the question, that it is not allowed to <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> to do. You, who accuse him, have all his slaves. There is not one boy to bring him his daily food left to <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> out of so large a household. I appeal to you now, Publius <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, to you <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, while you were acting as his advocates, while you were pleading his cause, did not <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> often demand of his adversaries that two of his father's slaves should be put to the question? Do you remember that you, O Titus <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a>, refused it? What? Where are those slaves? They are waiting on <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a>, O judges; they are honoured and valued by him. Even now I demand that they be put to the question; he begs and entreats it. [78] What are you doing? Why do you refuse? Doubt now, O judges, if you can, by whom <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> was murdered; whether by him, who, on account of his death, is exposed to poverty and treachery, who has not even opportunity allowed him of making inquiry into his father's death; or by those who shun investigation, who are in possession of his property, who live amid murder, and by murder. Everything in this cause, O judges, is lamentable and scandalous; but there is nothing which can be mentioned more bitter or more iniquitous than this. The son is not allowed to put his father's slaves to the question concerning his father's death. He is not to be master of his own slaves so long as to put them to the question concerning his father's death. I will come again, and that speedily, to this topic. For all this relates to the Roscii; and I have promised that I will speak of their audacity when I have effaced the accusations of <a href=/people/12124 target=_blank>Erucius</a>. </p>                        </div>

You must inevitably agree with me, if he is really implicated in this crime, that he either committed it with his own hand, which you deny, or by means of some other men, either freemen or slaves. Were they freemen? You can neither show that he had any opportunity of meeting them, nor by what means he could persuade them, nor where he saw them, nor by what agency he trafficked with them, nor by what hope, or what bribe he persuaded them. I show, on the other hand, not only that <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> did nothing of all this, but that he was not even able to do anything, because he had neither been at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> for many years, nor did he ever leave his farm without some object. The name of slaves appeared to remain to you, to which, when driven from your other suspicions, you might fly as to a harbour, when you strike upon such a rock that you not only see the accusation rebound back from it, but perceive that every suspicion falls upon you yourselves. [80] What is it, then? Whither has the accuser betaken himself in his dearth of arguments? The time, says he, was such that men were constantly being killed with impunity; so that you, from the great number of assassins, could effect this without any trouble. Meantime you seem to me, O <a href=/people/12124 target=_blank>Erucius</a>, to be wishing to obtain two articles for one payment; to blacken our characters in this trial, and to accuse those very men from whom you have received payment. What do you say? Men were constantly being killed? By whose agency? and by whom? Do you not perceive that you have been brought here by brokers? What next? Are we ignorant that in these times the same men were brokers of men's lives as well as of their possessions? [81] Shall those men then, who at that time used to run about armed night and day, who spent all their time in rapine and murder, object to <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> the bitterness and iniquity of that time? and will they think that troops of assassins, among whom they themselves were leaders and chiefs, can be made a ground of accusation against him? who not only was not at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, but who was utterly ignorant of everything that was being done at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, because he was continually in the country, as you yourself admit. [82] I fear that I may be wearisome to you, O judges, or that I may seem to distrust your capacity, if I dwell longer on matters which are so evident. The whole accusation of <a href=/people/12124 target=_blank>Erucius</a>, as I think, is at an end; unless perhaps you expect me to refute the charges which he has brought against us of peculation and of other imaginary crimes of that sort; charges unheard of by us before this time, and quite novel; which he appeared to me to be spouting out of some other speech which he was composing against some other criminal; so wholly were they unconnected with either the crime of parricide, or the man who is now on his trial. But as he accuses us of these things with his bare word, it is sufficient to deny them with our bare word. If there is any point which he is keeping back to prove by witnesses, there also, as in this cause, he shall find us more ready than he expected. </p>                        </div>

For that man appears to me the most honourable who arrives at a higher rank by his own virtue, not he who rises by the distress and misfortunes of another. Let us cease for awhile to examine into these matters which are unimportant; let us inquire where the guilt is, and where it can be detected. By this time you will understand, O <a href=/people/12124 target=_blank>Erucius</a>, by how many suspicious circumstances a real crime must be proved, although I shall not mention every thing, and shall touch on every thing slightly. And I would not do even that if it were not necessary, and it shall be a sign that I am doing it against my will, that I will not pursue the point further than the safety of <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> and my own good faith requires.

[85] Those who were about to be tried avoided and dreaded him as an investigator and a judge; because, although he was afraid of truth, he yet seemed not so much inclined by nature to mercy, as drawn by circumstances to severity.

What if this be added to that consideration that you were previously poor? what if it be added that you are avaricious? what if it be added that you are audacious? what if it be added that you were the greatest enemy of the man who has been murdered? need any further motive be sought for, which may have impelled you to such a crime? But which of all these particulars can be denied? [87] The poverty of the man is such that it cannot be concealed, and it is only the more conspicuous the more it is kept out of sight. Your avarice you make a parade of when you form an alliance with an utter stranger against the fortunes of a fellow-citizen and a relation. How audacious you are (to pass over other points), all men may understand from this, that out of the whole troop, that is to say, out of so many assassins, you alone were found to sit with the accusers, and not only to show them your countenance, but even to volunteer it. You must admit that you had enmity against <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a>, and great disputes about family affairs. [88] It remains, O judges, that we must now consider which of the two rather killed <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a>; did he to whom riches accrued by his death, or did he to whom beggary was the result? Did he who, before that, was poor, or he, who after that became most indigent? Did he, who burning with avarice rushes in like an enemy against his own relations, or he who has always lived in such a manner as to have no acquaintance with exorbitant gains, or with any profit beyond that which he procured with toil? Did he who, of all the brokers is the most audacious, or he who, because of the insolence of the forum and of the public courts, dreads not only the bench, but even the city itself? Lastly, O judges, what is most material of all to the argument in my opinion did his enemy do it or his son? </p>                        </div>

In truth, on each of these topics the materials are such that you might spend a whole day on each. And I could do the same; for I will not derogate so much from my own claims, though I arrogate nothing, as to believe that you can speak with more fluency than I can. But I, perhaps, owing to the number of advocates, may be classed in the common body; the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413162UCan class=place long=16.1515 lat=41.2964>Cannae</a> has made you a sufficiently respectable accuser. We have seen many men slain, not at Thrasymenus, but at <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a>. [90] “Who was not wounded there with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> steel?” I need not enumerate all, — the Curtii, the <a href=/people/6641 target=_blank>Marii</a>, the Mamerci, whom age now exempted from battles; and, lastly, the aged <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> himself, <a href=/people/1531 target=_blank>Antistius</a>, whom not only his age, but even the laws excused from going to battle. There are now six hundred men, whom nobody even mentions by name because of their meanness, who are accusers of men on charges of murdering and poisoning; all of whom, as far as I am concerned, I hope may find a livelihood. For there is no harm in there being as many <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> as possible, where there are many men to be watched, and many things to be guarded. [91] But, as is often the case, the violence and tumultuous nature of war brings many things to pass without the knowledge of the generals. While he who was administering the main government was occupied in other matters, there were men who in the meantime were curing their own wounds; who rushed about in the darkness and threw everything into confusion as if eternal night had enveloped the whole Republic. And by such men as these I wonder that the courts of justice were not burnt, that there might be no trace left of any judicial proceedings; for they did destroy both judges and accusers. There is this advantage, that they lived in such a manner that even if they wished it, they could not put to death all the witnesses; for as long as the race of men exists, there will not be wanting men to accuse them: as long as the state lasts, trials will take place. But as I began to say, both <a href=/people/12124 target=_blank>Erucius</a>, if he had these arguments to use which I have mentioned, in any cause Of his, would be able to speak on them as long as he pleased, and I can do the same. But I choose, as I said before, to pass by them lightly, and only just to touch on each particular, so that all men may perceive that I am not accusing men of my own inclination, but only defending my own client from a sense of duty. </p>                        </div>

Let us now see whether he had any opportunity of committing it. Where was <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> slain? — at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>.

But what is that to the purpose? many other men were there too. As if the point now were, who of so vast a crowd slew him, and as if this were not rather the question, whether it is more probable that he who was slain at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was slain by that man who was constantly at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> at that time, or by him who for many years had never come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> at all? [93] Come, let us consider now the other circumstances which might make it easy for him. There was at that time a multitude of assassins, as <a href=/people/12124 target=_blank>Erucius</a> has stated, and men were being killed with impunity. What! — what was that multitude? A multitude, I imagine, either of those who were occupied in getting possession of men's property, or of those who were hired by them to murder some one. If you think it was composed of those who coveted other men's property, you are one of that number, — you who are enriched by our wealth; if of those whom they who call them by the lightest name call slayers, inquire to whom they are bound, and whose dependents they are, believe me you will find it is some one of your own confederacy, whatever you say to the contrary, compare it with our defence, and by this means the cause of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> will be most easily contrasted with yours. [94] You will say, “what follows if I was constantly at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>?” I shall answer, “But I was never there at all.” “I confess that I am a broker, but so are many other men also.” “But I, as you yourself accuse me of being, am a countryman and a rustic.” “It does not follow at once, because I have been present with a troop of assassins, that I am an assassin myself.” “But at all events I, who never had even the acquaintance of assassins, am far removed from such a crime.” There are many things which may be mentioned, by which it may be understood that you had the greatest facilities for committing this crime, which I pass over, not only because I do not desire to accuse, but still more on this account, — because if I were to wish to enumerate all the murders which were then committed on the same account as that on which <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> was slain, I fear lest my speech would seem to refer to others also. </p>                        </div>

For whatever your conduct may be, O Titus <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a>, I am afraid of appearing to be so eager to save my client, as to be quite regardless whether I spare you or not. And as I am afraid of this, and as I wish to spare you in some degree, as far as I can, saving my duty to my client, I will again change my purpose. For the thoughts on your countenance present here occur to my mind, that you when all the rest of your companions were flying and hiding themselves in order that this trial might appear to be not concerning their plunder, not concerning this man's crime, should select this part above all others for yourself, to appear at the trial and sit with the accuser, by which action you gain nothing beyond causing your impudence and audacity to be known to all mortals. [96] After <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> is slain, who is the first to take the news to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426124UAme class=place long=12.4134 lat=42.5572>Ameria</a>? <a href=/people/2893 target=_blank>Mallius</a> Glaneia, whom I have named before, your own client and intimate friend. What did it concern him above all men to bring the news of what, if you had not previously formed some plan with reference to his death and property, and had formed no conspiracy with any one else, having either the crime or its reward for its object, concerned you least of all men? Oh, <a href=/people/2893 target=_blank>Mallius</a> brought the news of his own accord! What did it concern him, I beg? or, as he did not come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426124UAme class=place long=12.4134 lat=42.5572>Ameria</a> on account of this business, did it happen by chance that he was the first to tell the news which he had heard at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>? On what account did he come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426124UAme class=place long=12.4134 lat=42.5572>Ameria</a>? I cannot conjecture, says he. I will bring the matter to such a point that there shall be no need of conjecture. On what account did he announce it first to <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> <a href=/people/903 target=_blank>Capito</a>? When the house, and wife, and children of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> were at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426124UAme class=place long=12.4134 lat=42.5572>Ameria</a>; when he had so many kinsmen and relations on the best possible terms with himself, on what account did it happen that that client of yours, the reporter of your wickedness, did it to Titus <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> <a href=/people/903 target=_blank>Capito</a> above all men? [97] He was slain returning home from supper. It was not yet dawn when it was known at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426124UAme class=place long=12.4134 lat=42.5572>Ameria</a>. Why was this incredible speed? What does this extraordinary haste and expedition intimate? I do not ask who struck the blow; you have nothing to fear, O <a href=/people/2621 target=_blank>Glaucia</a>. I do not shake you to see if you have any weapon about you. I am not examining that point; I do not think I am at all concerned with that. Since I have found out by whose design he was murdered, by whose hand he was murdered I do not care. I assume one point, which your open wickedness and the evident state of the case gives me. Where, or from whom, did <a href=/people/2621 target=_blank>Glaucia</a> hear of it? Who knew it so immediately? Suppose he did hear of it immediately; what was the affair which compelled to take so long a journey in one night? What was the great necessity which pressed upon him, so as to make him, if he was going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426124UAme class=place long=12.4134 lat=42.5572>Ameria</a> of his own accord, set out from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> at that time of night, and devote no part of the night to sleep? </p>                        </div>

[100] I hear besides, that this suspicion is not fixed upon <a href=/people/903 target=_blank>Capito</a> for the first time now; that he has gained many infamous victories; but that this is the first very splendid one which he has gained at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; that there is no manner of committing murder in which he has not murdered many men; many by the sword, many by poison.

O the excellent witness, O judges; O gravity worthy of being attended to; O honourable course of life! such that you may with willing minds make your oaths depend upon his testimony!

The other (if the immortal gods will only let him) is going to give evidence also against <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a>. As if the matter now in question were, whether what he said is to be believed, or whether what he did is to be punished. Therefore it was established by the custom of our ancestors, that even in the most insignificant matters, the most honourable men should not be allowed to give evidence in their own cause. [103] <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a>, who declares by his surname that he subdued a third part of the whole world, still, if a case of his own were being tried, would not give evidence. For I do not venture to say with respect to such a man as that, if he did give evidence he would not be believed. See now everything is altered and changed for the worse. When there is a trial about property and about murder, a man is going to give evidence, who is both a broker and an assassin; that is, he who is himself the purchaser and possessor of that very property about which the trial is taking place, and who contrived the murder of the man whose death is being inquired into. [104] What do you want, O most excellent man? Have you anything to say? Listen to me. Take care not to be wanting to yourself; your own interest to a great extent is at stake. You have done many things wickedly, many things audaciously, many things scandalously; one thing foolishly, and that of your own accord, not by the advice of <a href=/people/12124 target=_blank>Erucius</a>. There was no need for you to sit there. For no man employs a dumb accuser, or calls him as a witness, who rises from the accuser's bench. There must be added to this, that that cupidity of yours should have been a little more kept back and concealed. Now what is there that any one of you desire to hear, when what you do is such that you seem to have done them expressly for our advantage against your own interest?

Is it not evident that it was the same man who sent the news to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426124UAme class=place long=12.4134 lat=42.5572>Ameria</a>? <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a> takes care that his goods shall be immediately sold; he who had neither his own the man nor his estate. But how did it occur to him to wish for the farms of a man who was unknown to him, whom he had never seen in his life? You are accustomed, O judges, when you hear anything of this sort to say at once, some fellow-citizen or neighbour must have told him; they generally tell these things; most men are betrayed by such. Here there is no ground for your entertaining this suspicion. [106] I will not argue thus. It is probable that the Roscii gave information of that matter to <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a>, for there was of old, friendship between them and <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a>; for though the Roscii had many ancient patrons and friends hereditarily connected with them, they ceased to pay any attention and respect to them, and betook themselves to the protection and support of <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a>. [107] I can say all this with truth; for in this case I have no need to rely on conjecture. I know to a certainty that they themselves do not deny that <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a> made the attack on this property at their instigation. If you see with your own eyes who has received a part of the reward for the information, can you possibly doubt, O judges, who gave the information? Who then are in possession of that property; and to whom did <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a> give a share in it? The two Roscii! — Any one else? No one else, O judges. Is there then any doubt that they put this plunder in <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a>'s way, who have received from him a share of the plunder? [108] Come now let us consider the action of the Roscii by the judgment of <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a> himself. If in that contest the Roscii had done nothing which was worth speaking of, on what account were they presented with such rewards by <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a>?

Learn from his behaviour on this deputation the whole life and nature and manners of the man. Unless you are of opinion, O judges, that there is no duty and no right so holy and solemn that his wickedness and perfidy has not tampered with and violated it, then judge him to be a very excellent man. [110] He is the hindrance to <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>'s being informed of this affair; he betrays the plans and intentions of the other deputies to <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a>; he gives him warning to take care that the affair be not conducted openly; he points out to him, that if the sale of the property be prevented, he will lose a large sum of money, and that he himself will be in danger of his life. He proceeds to spur him on, to deceive those who were joined in the commission with him; to warn him continually to take care; to hold out treacherously false hopes to the others; in concert with him to devise plans against them, to betray their counsels to him; with him to bargain for his share in the plunder, and, relying constantly on some delay or other, to cut off from his colleagues all access to <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>. Lastly, owing to his being the prompter, the adviser, the go-between, the deputies did not see <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>; deceived by his faith, or rather by his perfidy, as you may know from themselves, if the accuser is willing to produce them as witnesses, they brought back home with a false hope instead of a reality. [111] In private affairs if any one had managed a business entrusted to him, I will not say maliciously for the sake of his own gain and advantage, but even carelessly, our ancestors thought that he had incurred the greatest disgrace. Therefore, legal proceedings for betrayal of a commission are established, involving penalties no less disgraceful than those for theft. I suppose because, in cases where we ourselves cannot be present, the vicarious faith of friends is substituted; and he who impairs that confidence, attacks the common bulwark of all men, and as far as depends on him, disturbs the bonds of society. For we cannot do everything ourselves; different people are more capable in different matters. On that account friendships are formed, that the common advantage of all may be secured by mutual good offices. [112] Why do you undertake a commission, if you are either going to neglect it or to turn it to your own advantage? Why do you offer yourself to me, and by feigned service hinder and prevent my advantage? Get out of the way, I will do my business by means of some one else. You undertake the burden of a duty which you think you are able to support; a duty which does not appear very heavy to those who are not very worthless themselves. </p>                        </div>

It is therefore the part of a most abandoned man, at the same time to dissolve friendship and to deceive him who would not have been injured unless he had trusted him. [113] Is it not so? In the most trifling affairs be who neglects a commission, must be condemned by a most dishonouring sentence; in a matter of this importance, when he to whom the character of the dead, the fortunes of the living have been recommended and entrusted, loads the dead with ignominy and the living with poverty, shall he be reckoned among honourable men, shall he even be reckoned a man at all? In trifling affairs, in affairs of a private nature, even carelessness is accounted a crime, and is liable to a sentence branding a man with infamy; because, if the commission be properly executed, the man who has given the commission may feel at his ease and be careless about it: he who has undertaken the commission may not. In so important an affair as this, which was done by public order and so entrusted to him, what punishment ought to be inflicted on that man who has not hindered some private advantage by his carelessness, but has polluted and stained by his treachery the solemnity of the very commission itself? or by what sentence shall he be condemned? [114] If <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> had entrusted this matter to him privately to transact and determine upon with <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a>, and to involve his credit in the matter if it seemed to him to be necessary — if he who had undertaken the affair had turned ever so minute a point of the business to his own advantage, would he not, if convicted by the judge, have been compelled to make restitution, and would he not have lost all credit? [115] Now it is not <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> who gave him this commission, but what is a much more serious thing, <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> himself, with his character, his life, and all his property, is publicly entrusted by the senators to <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a>; and, of this trust, Titus <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> has converted not some small portion to his own advantage, but has turned him entirely out of his property; he has bargained for three farms for himself; he has considered the intention of the senators and of all his fellow-citizens of just as much value as his own integrity. </p>                        </div>

In less important matters, to deceive one's partner is a most shameful thing, and equally base with that which I have mentioned before. And rightly; because he who has communicated an affair to another thinks that he has procured assistance for himself. To whose good faith, then, shall a man have recourse who is injured by the want of faith in the man whom he has trusted? But these offences are to be punished with the greatest severity which are guarded against with the greatest difficulty. We can be reserved towards strangers; intimate friends must see many things more openly; but how can we guard against a companion? for even to be afraid of him is to do violence to the rights of duty. Our ancestors therefore rightly thought that he who had deceived his companion ought not to be considered in the number of good men. [117] But Titus <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> did not deceive one friend alone in a money matter, (which, although it be a grave offence, still appears possible in some degree to be borne) but he led on, cajoled, and deserted nine most honourable men, betrayed them to their adversaries, and deceived them with every circumstance of fraud and perfidy. They who could suspect nothing of his wickedness, ought not to have been afraid of the partner of their duties; they did not see his malice, they trusted his false speech. Therefore these most honourable men are now, on account of his treachery, thought to have been incautious and improvident He who was at the beginning a traitor, then a deserter — who at first reported the counsels of his companions to their adversaries, and then entered into a confederacy with the adversaries themselves, even now terrifies us, and threatens us, adorned with his three farms, that is, with the prizes of his wickedness. In such a life as his, O judges, amid such numerous and enormous crimes, you will find this crime too, with which the present trial is concerned. [118] In truth you ought to make investigation on this principle; where you see that many things have been done avariciously, many audaciously, many wickedly, many perfidiously, there you ought to think that wickedness also lies hid among so many crimes; although this indeed does not lie hid at all, which is so manifest and exposed to view, that it may be perceived, not by those vices which it is evident exist in him, but even if any one of those vices be doubted of, he may be convicted of it by the evidence of this crime. What then, I ask, shall we say, O judges? Does this gladiator seem entirely to have thrown off his former character? or does that pupil of his seem to yield but little to his master in skill? Their avarice is equal, their dishonesty similar, their impudence is the same; the audacity of the one is twin-sister to the audacity of the other. </p>                        </div>

I have already said before, that two slaves have been continually begged of them to be put to the question. You have always refused it, O Titus <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a>. I ask of you whether they who asked it were unworthy to obtain it? or had he, on whose behalf they asked it, no influence with you? or did the matter itself appear unjust? The most noble and respectable men of our state, whom I have named before, made the request, who have lived in such a manner, and are so esteemed by the Roman people, that there is no one who would not think whatever they said reasonable. And they made the request on behalf of a most miserable and unfortunate man, who would wish even himself to be submitted to the torture, provided the inquiry into his father's death might go on. [120] Moreover, the thing demanded of you was such that it made no difference whether you refused it or confessed yourself guilty of the crime. And as this is the case, I ask of you why you refused it? When <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> was murdered they were there. The slaves themselves, as far as I am concerned, I neither accuse nor acquit; but the point which I see you contending for, namely, that they be not submitted to the question, is full of suspicion. But the reason of their being held in such horror by you, must be that they know something, which, if they were to tell, will be pernicious to you. Oh, say you, it is unjust to put questions to slaves against their masters. Is any such question meant to be put? For <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> is the defendant, and when inquiry is being made into his conduct, you do not say that you are their masters. Oh, they are with <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a>. I suppose so; <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a> is so taken with their learning and accomplishments, that be wishes these men — men little better than labourers from the training of a rustic master of a family at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426124UAme class=place long=12.4134 lat=42.5572>Ameria</a>, to mingle with his elegant youths, masters of every art and every refinement — youths picked out of many of the politest households. [121] That cannot be the truth, O judges; it is not probable that <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a> has taken a fancy to their learning or their politeness, or that he should be acquainted with their industry and fidelity in the business of a household. There is something which is hidden; and the more studiously it is bidden and kept back by them, so much the more is it visible and conspicuous. </p>                        </div>

Is <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a> unwilling that these men shall be put to the question for the sake of concealing his own crime? Not so, O judges; I do not think that the same arguments apply to every one. As far as I am concerned, I have no suspicion of the sort respecting <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a>, and this is not the first time that it has occurred to me to say so. You recollect that I so divided the cause at the beginning; into the accusation, the whole arguing of which was entrusted to <a href=/people/12124 target=_blank>Erucius</a>; and into audacity, the business of which was assigned to the Roscii; — whatever crime, whatever wickedness, whatever bloodshed there is, all that is the business of the Roscii. We say that the excessive interest and power of <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a> is a hindrance to us, and can by no means be endured; and that it ought not only to be weakened, but even to be punished by you, since you have the power given to you. [123] I think as follows; that he who wishes these men to be put to the question, whom it is evident were present when the murder was committed, is desirous to find out the truth; that he who refuses it, though he does not dare admit it in words, yet does in truth by his actions, confesses himself guilty of the crime. I said at the beginning, O judges, that I was unwilling to say more of the wickedness of those men than the cause required, and than necessity itself compelled me to say. For many circumstances can be alleged, and every one of them can be discussed with many arguments. But I cannot do for any length of time, nor diligently, what I do against my will, and by compulsion. Those things which could by no means be passed over, I have lightly touched upon, O judges; those things which depend upon suspicion, and which, if I begin to speak of them, will require a copious discussion, I commit to your capacities and to your conjectures. </p>                        </div>

For this cause is, in truth, a novel and an extraordinary cause. <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a> is the purchaser of the property of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a>. [125] Let us see this first, on what pretence the property of that man was sold, or how they could be sold. And I will not put this question, O judges, so as to imply that it is a scandalous thing for the property of an innocent man to be sold at all. For if these things are to be freely listened to and freely spoken, <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> was not a man of such importance in the state as to make us complain of his fortune more than of that of others. But I ask this, how could they be sold even by that very law which is enacted about prescriptions, whether it be the <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> or Cornelian law, — for neither know nor understand which it is — but by that very law itself how could the property of <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> be sold? [126] For they say it is written in it, “that the property of those men who have been proscribed is to be sold”; in which number <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> is not one: “or of those who have been slain in the garrisons of the opposite party.” While there, were any garrisons, he was in the garrisons of <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>; after they laid down their arms, returning from supper, he was slain at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> in a time of perfect peace. If he was slain by law, I admit that his property was sold by law too; but if it is evident that he was slain contrary to all laws, not merely to old laws, but to the new ones also, then I ask by what right, or in what manner, or by what law they were sold? </p>                        </div>

Last of all, I suspect that this property was never sold at all; and this matter I will open presently, O judges, if you will give me leave.

Some months afterwards the man was slain, and his property is said to have been sold. Now, either this property has never been returned in the public accounts, and we are cheated by this scoundrel more cleverly than we think, or, if they were returned, then the public accounts have some way or other been tampered with, for it is quite evident that the property could not have been sold according to law.

What quantities besides of embossed plate, of embroidered quilts; of paintings, of statues, and of marble, do you think he has in his house? All, forsooth, that in a time of disturbance and rapine can be crammed into one house from the plunder of many magnificent families. But why should I mention how vast a household too was his, and in what various trades was it instructed? [134] I say nothing of those ordinary arts, cooks, bakers, and litter-bearers; he has so many slaves to gratify his mind and ears, that the whole neighbourhood resounds with the daily music of voices, and stringed instruments, and flutes. In such a life as this, O judges, how great a daily expense, and what extravagance do you think there must be? And what banquets? Honourable no doubt in such a house; if that is to be called a house rather than a workshop of wickedness, and a lodging for every sort of iniquity. [135] In what a style he himself flutters through the forum, with his hair curled and perfumed, and with a great retinue of citizens, you yourselves behold, O judges; in truth you see how he despises every one, how he thinks no one a human being but himself, how he thinks himself the only happy, the only powerful man. But if I were to wish too mention what he does and what he attempts, O judges, I am afraid that some ignorant people would think that I wish to injure the cause of the nobility, and to detract from their victory; although I have a right to find fault if anything in that party displeases me.

For who was there who did not see that meanness was disputing with dignity for the highest honours? a contest in which it was the part of an abandoned citizen not to unite himself to those, by whose safety dignity at home and authority abroad would be preserved. And that all this was done, and that his proper honour and rank was restored to every one, I rejoice, O judges, and am exceedingly delighted; and I know that it was all done by the kindness of the gods, by the zeal of the Roman people, by the wisdom and government, and good fortune of Lucius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>. [137] I have no business to find fault with punishment having been inflicted on those who laboured with all their energies on the other side; and I approve of honours having been paid to the brave men whose assistance was eminent in the transaction of all these matters. And I consider that the struggle was to a great extent with this object, and I confess that I shared in that desire in the part I took. But if the object was, and if arms were taken with the view of causing the lowest of the people to be enriched with the property of others, and of enabling them to make attacks on the fortunes of every one, and if it is unlawful not only to hinder that by deed, but even to blame it in words, then the Roman people seems to me not to have been strengthened and restored by that war, but to have been subdued and crushed. [138] But the ease is totally different: nothing of this, O judges, is the truth: the cause of the nobility will not only not be injured if you resist these men, but it will even be embellished. </p>                        </div>

And now it is impossible for any one to be either so foolish or so worthless as to say: “I wish it were allowed me, I would have said...” You may say... “I would have done...” You may do... No one hinders you. “I would have decreed...” “Decree, only decree rightly, every one will approve.” “I should have judged...” All will praise you if you judge rightly and properly. [139] While it was necessary and while the ease made it inevitable, one man had all the power, and after he created magistrates and established laws, his own proper office and authority was restored to every one. And if those who recovered it wish to retain it, they will be able to retain it for ever. But if they either participate in or approve of these acts of murder and rapine, these enormous and prodigal expenses — I do not wish to say anything too severe against them; not even as an omen; but this one thing I do say; unless those nobles of ours are vigilant, and virtuous, and brave, and merciful, they must abandon their honours to those men in whom these qualities do exist. [140] Let them, therefore, cease at least to say that a man speaks badly, if he speaks truly and with freedom; let them cease to make common cause with <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a>; let them cease to think, if he be injured, that any injury has been done to them; let them see how shameful and miserable a thing it is that they, who could not tolerate the splendour of the knights, should be able to endure the domination of a most worthless slave — a domination, which, O judges, was formerly exerted in other matters, but now you see what a road it is making for itself, what a course it is aiming at, against your good faith, against your oaths, against your decisions, against almost the only thing which remains uncorrupted and holy in the state. [141] Does <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a> think that in this particular too he has some influence? Does her even wish to be powerful in this? O miserable and bitter circumstance!

[142] If that was the object, I confess that I erred in being anxious for their success. I admit that I was mad in espousing their party, although I espoused it, O judges, without taking up arms. But if the victory of the nobles ought to be an ornament and an advantage to the republic and the Roman people, then, too, my speech ought to be very acceptable to every virtuous and noble man. But if there be any one who thinks that he and his cause is injured when <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a> is found fault with, he does not understand his cause, I may almost say he does not know himself. For the cause will be rendered more splendid by resisting every worthless man. The worthless favourers of <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a>, who think that his cause and theirs are identical, are injured themselves by separating themselves from such splendour. [143] But all this that I have been now saying, as I mentioned before, is said on my own account, though the republic, and my own indignation, and the injuries done by these fellows, have compelled me to say it. But <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> is indignant at none of these things; he accuses no one; he does not complain of the loss of his patrimony; he, ignorant of the world, rustic and down that he is, thinks that all those things which you say were done by <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> were done regularly, legally and according to the law of nations. If he is only exempted from blame and acquitted of this nefarious accusation, he will be glad to leave the court. [144] If he is freed from this unworthy suspicion, he says that he can give up all his property with equanimity. He begs and entreats you, O <a href=/people/2731 target=_blank>Chrysogonus</a>, if he has converted no part of his father's most ample possessions to his own use; if he has defrauded you in no particular; if he has given up to you and paid over and weighed out to you all his possessions with the most scrupulous faith; if he has given up to you the very garment with which he was clothed, and the ring off his finger; if he has stripped himself bare of everything, and has excepted nothing — he entreats you, I say, that he may be allowed to pass his life in innocence and indigence, supported by the assistance of his friends. </p>                        </div>
