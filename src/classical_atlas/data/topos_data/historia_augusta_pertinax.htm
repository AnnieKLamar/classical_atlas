The hour he was born a black <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> climbed to the roof, and after remaining there for a short time, fell to the ground and died. 3 Disturbed by this occurrence, his father went to a <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a>, and he prophesied future greatness for the boy, saying that he himself had lost his child. 4 As a boy, <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> was educated in the rudiments of literature and in arithmetic and was also put under the care of a Greek teacher of grammar and, later, of <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a> <a href=/people/943 target=_blank>Apollinaris</a>; after receiving instruction from this man, <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> himself took up the teaching of grammar. <br />5 But when he found little profit in this profession, with the aid of <a href=/people/3622 target=_blank>Lollianus</a> <a href=/people/5493 target=_blank>Avitus</a>, a former consul and his father's patron, he sought an appointment to a command in the ranks. 6 Soon afterwards, in the reign of <a href=/people/3477 target=_blank>Titus</a> <a href=/people/11042 target=_blank>Aurelius</a>, he set out for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> as prefect of a cohort, and there, because he had used the imperial post without official letters of recommendation, he was forced by the governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> to make his way from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> to his station on foot. </p>                        </div>

His mother followed him all the way to <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a>, and there she died, and her tomb is said to be still standing there. 4 From this command he was transferred to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=place long=25 lat=44.5>Dacia</a> at a salary of two hundred thousand sesterces, but through the machinations of certain persons he came to be distrusted by Marcus and was removed from this post; afterwards, however, through the influence of <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> <a href=/people/11060 target=_blank>Pompeianus</a>, the son-in-law of Marcus, he was detailed to the command of detachments on the plea that he would become <a href=/people/11060 target=_blank>Pompeianus</a>' aide. 5 Meeting with approval in this position, he was enrolled in the senate. 6 Later, when he had won success in war for the second time, the plot which had been made against him was revealed, and Marcus, in order to remedy the wrong he had done him, raised him to the rank of praetor and put him in command of the First Legion. Whereupon <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> straightway rescued <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469105RRae class=place long=10.47 lat=46.85>Raetia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/470150RNor class=place long=15 lat=47>Noricum</a> from the enemy. 7 Because of his conspicuous prowess in this campaign he was appointed, on the recommendation of Marcus, to the consulship. 8 Marcus' speech has been preserved in the works of <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>; it contains a eulogy of him and relates, moreover, everything that he did and suffered. 9 And besides this speech, which it would take too much space to incorporate in this work, Marcus praised <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> frequently, both in the assemblies of soldiers and in the senate, and publicly expressed regret that he was a senator and therefore could not be made prefect of the guard. 10 After <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>' revolt had been suppressed, <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> set out from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> to protect the bank of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Danube</a>, 11 and presently he was appointed to govern both the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440205RMys class=place long=20.5 lat=44>Moesias</a> and, soon thereafter, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=place long=25 lat=44.5>Dacia</a>.

Next he was made proconsul of Africa. 2 During this proconsulship, it is said, he suppressed many rebellions by the aid of prophetic verses which issued from the temple of Caelestis. Next he was made prefect of the city, 3 and in this office, as successor to Fuscianus, a very stern man, <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> was exceedingly gentle and considerate, and he proved very pleasing to <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> himself, for he was . . . when <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> was made consul for the second time. 4 And while in this position, <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> did not avoid complicity in the murder of <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>, when a share in this plot was offered him by the other conspirators. <br />5 After <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> was slain, <a href=/people/11054 target=_blank>Laetus</a>, the prefect of the guard, and Eclectus, the chamberlain, came to <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> and reassured him, and then led him to the camp. 6 There he harangued the soldiers, promised a donative, and said that the imperial power had been thrust upon him by <a href=/people/11054 target=_blank>Laetus</a> and Eclectus. 7 It was pretended, moreover, that <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> had died a natural death, chiefly because the soldiers feared that their loyalty was merely being tested. 8 Finally, and at first by only a few, <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> was hailed as emperor.

Furthermore, as we related above, the heart and upper portion of the liver could not be found in the victims. And on the day before he died, stars of great brilliancy were seen near the sun in the day-time. 4 He was responsible himself, it is said, for an omen about his successor, <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a>. For when <a href=/people/3581 target=_blank>Didius</a> <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> presented a nephew of his, to whom he was betrothing his daughter, the Emperor exhorted the young man to show deference to his uncle, and added: Honour my colleague and successor. 5 For <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> had previously been his colleague in the consulship and had succeeded him in his proconsular command. <br />6 The soldiers and court-retainers regarded him with hatred, but the people felt great indignation at his death, since it had seemed that all the ancient customs might be restored through his efforts. 7 His head, fixed on a pole, was carried through the city to the camp by the soldiers who killed him. 8 His remains, including his head, which was recovered, were laid in the tomb of his wife's grandfather. 9 And <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a>, his successor, buried his body with all honour, after he had found it in the Palace. 10 At no time, however, did he make any public mention of <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> either before the people or in the presence of the senate, but when he, too, was deserted by the soldiers <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> was raised to the rank of the gods by the senate and the people. </p>                        </div>

The birthday-games decreed for him, however, are still observed. <br />6 He was born on the Kalends of August in the consulship of <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> and Ambibulus, and was killed on the fifth day before the Kalends of April in the consulship of Falco and <a href=/people/12125 target=_blank>Clarus</a>. He lived sixty years, seven months and twenty-six days, 7 and reigned for two months and twenty-five days. He gave the people a largess of one hundred denarii apiece, and promised twelve thousand sesterces to each soldier of the guard, though he gave only six thousand. The sum promised to the armies he did not give for the reason that death forestalled him. 8 A letter which <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> included in his life of <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> shows that he shrank from taking the imperial power, but this letter, on account of its great length, I have not thought best to insert. </p>                        </div>
