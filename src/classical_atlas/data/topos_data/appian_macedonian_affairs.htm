As he was a very young man and somewhat flustered, they directed him to read his father's memorandum in which were written down, one by one, the things already done and those yet to be done, although decided upon contrary to justice; for, indeed, his unjust acts were prominent in the thought of many. Nevertheless, the Senate, having regard to his late zeal in the matter of <a href=/people/60 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, said that it would pardon him, but added that it did so on account of <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>. <a href=/people/35 target=_blank>Philip</a>, having been confessedly most useful to them in the war with <a href=/people/60 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, when he might have done them the greatest damage if he had cooperated with <a href=/people/60 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, as the latter asked him to, expecting much on this account and now seeing himself discredited and accused, and considered worthy of pardon rather than of gratitude, and even this merely on account of <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, was indignant and angry, but concealed his feelings for a time. Afterwards, in a certain arbitration before the Romans, they transferred much of his territory to <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a>, seeking all the time to weaken him.
