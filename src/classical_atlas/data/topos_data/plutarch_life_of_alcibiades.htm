Certain it is that <a href=/people/115 target=_blank>Nicias</a>, <a href=/people/536 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, <a href=/people/712 target=_blank>Lamachus</a>, <a href=/people/188 target=_blank>Phormio</a>, <a href=/people/253 target=_blank>Thrasybulus</a>, and <a href=/people/378 target=_blank>Theramenes</a> were prominent men, and his contemporaries, and yet we cannot so much as name the mother of any one of them; whereas, in the case of <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a>, we even know that his nurse, who was a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a> woman, was called <a href=/people/8802 target=_blank>Amycla</a>, and his tutor <a href=/people/1101 target=_blank>Zopyrus</a>. The one fact is mentioned by <a href=/people/436 target=_blank>Antisthenes</a>, the other by <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>. As regards the beauty of <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a>, it is perhaps unnecessary to say aught, except that it flowered out with each successive season of his bodily growth, and made him, alike in boyhood, youth and manhood, lovely and pleasant. The saying of <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, that beauty's autumn, too, is beautiful, is not always true. But it was certainly the case with <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a>, as with few besides, because of his excellent natural parts. </p>                        </div>
