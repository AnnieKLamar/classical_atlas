For I, from pure regard and reverence for my kith and kin, though might have lived at peace in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>, alone of all my race shared with <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> his labours, while he was yet with us, and now that he dwells in heaven, I keep these his children safe beneath my wing, though myself need protection. For when their father passed from earth away, <a href=/people/247 target=_blank>Eurystheus</a> would first of all have slain us, but we escaped. And though our home is lost, our life was saved.
