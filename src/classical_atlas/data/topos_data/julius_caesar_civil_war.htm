On the conclusion of these proceedings, as credit throughout <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> was somewhat restricted and loans were not being repaid, he decided that arbitrators should be appointed to estimate the value of real and movable property as it had been before the war and that the creditors should be paid on that basis. He considered that this was the most suitable method at once of removing or diminishing the fear of that general repudiation of debts which is apt to follow war and civil strife and of maintaining the good faith of the debtors. Moreover, on motions brought before the people by the praetors and tribunes, he restored to their former rights persons who, in those critical times when <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> had kept in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> a detachment of his troops as a bodyguard, had been convicted of bribery under the Pompeian law, and whose trials had been carried through, each in a single day, with one set of judges hearing the evidence and another voting on the issue. As these persons had offered themselves to him at the beginning of the civil war in case he should wish to use their services in the war, he accounted them as having been actually in his service since they had placed themselves at his disposal. For he had determined that they ought to be restored by a decision of the popular assembly rather than be supposed to be reinstated by his own act of kindness, his object being that he might not appear either ungrateful in the matter of returning a benefit, or too presumptuous in robbing the popular assembly of its right to confer a favour. </p>                        </div>

Now, the town was strongly protected by the nature of its site and by a hill. But the Roman citizens, rapidly constructing wooden towers, protected themselves with them, and, being weak in resistance owing to their small numbers, worn out by constant wounds, betook themselves to the last resource of despair and armed all their grown-up slaves, and cut off the hair of all their women to make catapult ropes. <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, having ascertained their sentiments, surrounded the town with five camps and began to press the inhabitants at once by blockade and by siege operations. Prepared to endure everything they suffered most in the matter of the corn supply. To remedy this they sent envoys to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and begged his aid. The rest of their troubles they endured by themselves as well as they could. And after a long interval, when the protracted siege had made the Octavians rather careless, taking advantage of the opportunity afforded by the hour of noon when the enemy had withdrawn, they placed their boys and women on the walls that no particular of their daily routine might be missed by the besiegers, and forming themselves into a band together with those whom they had just recently liberated, they burst into the nearest camp of <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>.

Such was the end of the siege. And now winter was approaching, and <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, despairing of the siege of the town after receiving such heavy losses, retired to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413194PEpi class=place long=19.4449 lat=41.3164>Dyrrachium</a> to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. </p>                        </div>

In consideration of the benefits that he had conferred on him <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had decided that <a href=/people/2268 target=_blank>Vibullius</a> was a suitable person to send with instructions to Gn. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, and he also understood that he had influence with Gn. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. Now this was the main purport of his instructions — that each of them ought to put an end to his obstinacy, lay down his arms, and no longer tempt fortune. Sufficiently serious losses had been incurred on both sides, which might serve them as a lesson and warn them to fear further mischances: <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> had been driven from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> after the loss of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a> and the two Spains, and one hundred and thirty cohorts of Roman citizens in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and Spain; he himself had suffered by the death of <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> and the disaster to the African army, and the surrender of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> and his troops at Curicta. So let them spare themselves and the republic, since by their own losses they were already a sufficient example to themselves of what fortune could do in war. This was the one time for treating of peace, when each had confidence in himself and both seemed on an equality. But if fortune should show but a little partiality to one of the two the one who should seem superior would not adopt terms of peace, nor would he who was sure that he would have everything be contented with an equal division. Conditions of peace should now be sought at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> from the senate and the people, since it had not been possible to agree on them before. Meanwhile it ought to satisfy the republic and themselves if each should at once swear in a public assembly that he would disband his army within the next three days. If they laid aside their arms and gave up the reinforcements on which they now relied, each would necessarily be contented with the judgment of the people and the senate. That these proposals might be more easily approved by <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, he said that he would disband all his land forces. </p>                        </div>

The rest of the legates swear the same oath; they are followed by the tribunes and centurions, and the whole army takes the same pledge. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, finding himself forestalled in his march to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413194PEpi class=place long=19.4449 lat=41.3164>Dyrrachium</a>, stays his rapid advance and pitches his camp by the River <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408196WAps class=place long=19.574 lat=40.75>Apsus</a>, in the territory of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407195PApo class=ethnic long=19.4727 lat=40.7215>Apolloniates</a>, that the communities which had deserved well of him might be protected by a garrison, and decides to wait there for the arrival of the rest of his legions from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and to winter in tents. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> did the same, and, pitching his camp the other side of the River <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408196WAps class=place long=19.574 lat=40.75>Apsus</a>, conveyed thither all his forces and auxiliaries. </p>                        </div>

The position was one of great difficulty, as they were oppressed by extreme scarcity of necessaries, to such an extent that they were obliged to bring up by merchant-ships from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer class=place long=19.9156 lat=39.6063>Corcyra</a> supplies of wood and water as of other stores, and it even happened at the same time that, experiencing rather rough weather, they were compelled to catch the night's moisture in the skins with which the ships were covered.

As regards a truce, there was this distinction between them in their conduct of the war: they with their fleet were hindering his ships and reinforcements; he was preventing them from watering and from landing. If they desired any concession in this respect, let them make some concessions themselves about their surveillance by sea; if they retained that, he would retain his position also.

Without even the proclamation for breaking up camp, he crossed the river by night and returned to the same part from which he had come and there pitched his camp on a natural elevation near the river.

By making twenty-four redoubts he embraced a circuit of fifteen miles, and within this he foraged; and in this district there were a number of hand-sown crops with which he could meanwhile feed his animals. And just as our men by a continuous line of fortifications took measures to prevent the Pompeians from breaking out anywhere and attacking us in the rear, so the enemy made an unbroken line of defence in the interior of the space so that our men should not be able to enter any part of it and surround them from the rear.

Whenever <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had to occupy any spot, although <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> had decided not to try to prevent it with his whole armed force and fight a pitched battle, yet he kept sending up, in suitable positions, archers and slingers, of whom he had a great number, and many of our men were wounded.

In one of these, when <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s Ninth Legion had occupied a certain post and had begun to fortify it, <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> occupied a hill near and opposite to it and began to hinder our men in their work; and since on one side <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s position admitted of an almost level approach, he first of all threw round a force of archers and slingers, and then, sending up a great multitude of light-armed men and putting forward his engines, he began to hinder the works; nor was it easy for our men at one and the same time to stand on the defensive and to fortify. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, on seeing that in every direction his men were being wounded, ordered them to retire and to quit the position.

He himself drew up his slingers in suitable places to serve as a protection to our men in their retreat. When these arrangements were finished he ordered the legion to be withdrawn. The Pompeians then began with all the more insolence and audacity to press and close in on our men, and in order to cross the ditches overthrew the hurdles that had been set up as a defence against them. And <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, on observing this, fearing lest his men should appear to have been flung back rather than withdrawn and a more serious loss should be incurred, exhorted his men about midway down the slope, by the mouth of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, who was in command of that legion, and ordered the signal to be given with the clarion and the enemy to be charged. The men of the Ninth with prompt and unanimous resolution hurled their pikes and, breaking into a run from the lower ground and charging up the hill, drove the Pompeians headlong and compelled them to turn their backs in flight; the overturned hurdles and the uprights planted in their way and the ditches that had been drawn across proved a great hindrance to them in their retreat.

For whenever one army has attempted to blockade another, it is when they have attacked a discomfited and weakened foe, overcome in battle or demoralized by some reverse, and have thus hemmed them in, being themselves superior in number of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and foot; while the motive of the blockade has usually been to prevent the foe from getting supplies.

This camp bordered on a wood and was not more than three hundred paces from the sea.

So the smaller camp included in a larger one took the place of a redoubt and citadel. Also from the left corner of his camp he had drawn a line of entrenchments to the river, about four hundred paces long, in order that his men might get water with more freedom from risk. But he, too, changing his plan for certain reasons which it is not necessary to mention, had quitted that place.

As they were thus hindered from pursuing, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, having foreseen that this would happen, gave the signal for departure, and about noon led out his army, and doing a double march this day he advanced about eight miles from this place. This <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> was unable to do owing to the dispersal of his men. </p>                        </div>

And so, experiencing the utmost zeal on the part of his troops, he began to besiege the town, which had very high walls, on the very day of his arrival after the ninth hour, and took it by storm before sunset, and gave it over to his men for plunder.

For even on those days he fought a successful cavalry skirmish and killed among some others one of the two <a href=/people/11071 target=_blank>Allobrogians</a> who, as we explained above, had deserted to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. </p>                        </div>

And at the same time a battle was fought at the port, and this affair produced by far the most serious fighting. For at one and the same time a battle was going on with scattered forces in several streets and the enemy were attempting in great numbers to seize the warships, of which fifty had been sent to the support of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> and had returned home after the battle in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, all of them quadriremes and quinqueremes fitted and equipped with everything necessary for navigation, and, besides these, twenty-two which had usually been on duty at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, all of them decked. And if they had seized these, by robbing <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> of his fleet they would have the harbour and the whole seaboard in their control and would shut off <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> from supplies and reinforcements. Consequently the struggle was fought with the intense eagerness that was bound to occur when the one side saw a speedy victory, the other their own safety, depending on the event. But <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> gained his purpose. He burnt all those ships and the rest that were in the docks, because he could not protect so wide an extent with his small force, and at once he embarked his men and landed them on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299IPha class=place long=29.8856 lat=31.213>Pharos</a>. </p>                        </div>

This island, lying over against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, makes a harbour, but it is connected with the town by a narrow roadway like a bridge, piers nine hundred feet in length having been thrown out seawards by former kings. On this island there are dwelling-houses of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> and a settlement the size of a town, and any ships that went a little out of their course there through carelessness or rough weather they were in the habit of plundering like <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>. Moreover, on account of the narrowness of the passage there can be no entry for ships into the harbour without the consent of those who are in occupation of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299IPha class=place long=29.8856 lat=31.213>Pharos</a>. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, now fearing such difficulty, landed his troops when the enemy was occupied in fighting, and seized <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299IPha class=place long=29.8856 lat=31.213>Pharos</a> and placed a garrison on it. The result of these measures was that corn and reinforcements could be safely conveyed to him on shipboard. For he sent messengers to all the neighbouring provinces and summoned reinforcements from them. In the remaining parts of the town the result of the fighting was that they separated after an indecisive engagement and neither side was beaten, the reason of this being the narrowness of the space; and a few men having been slain on both sides, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> drew a cordon round the most necessary positions and strengthened the defences by night. In this region of the town there was a small part of the palace to which he had been at first conducted for his personal residence, and a theatre was attached to the house which took the place of a citadel, and had approaches to the port and to the other docks. These defences he increased on subsequent days so that they might take the place of a wall as a barrier against the foe, and that he might not be obliged to fight against his will. Meanwhile the younger daughter of King <a href=/people/3077 target=_blank>Ptolomaeus</a>, hoping to have the vacated tenure of the throne, removed herself from the palace to join <a href=/people/1437 target=_blank>Achillas</a>, and began to conduct the war with him. But there quickly arose a controversy between them about the leadership, an event which increased the bounties to the soldiers, for each strove separately to win their favour by large sacrifices. While this was going on among the enemy, <a href=/people/2924 target=_blank>Pothinus</a>, the young king's tutor and controller of the kingdom, in <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s part of the town, while sending messengers to <a href=/people/1437 target=_blank>Achillas</a> and exhorting him not to slacken in the business nor to fail in spirit, was slain by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, his messengers having been informed against and arrested.
