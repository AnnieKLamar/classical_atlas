                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi1242.phi001:1.p'><b>&sect; 1.p</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The period of the Seven Kings, beginning with <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a><br />The Roman people during the seven hundred years, from the time of King <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> down to that of Caesar <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, achieved so much in peace and war that, if a man were to compare the greatness of their empire with its years, he would consider its size as out of all proportion to its age. 2 So widely have they extended their arms throughout the world, that those who read of their exploits are learning the history, not of a single people, but of the human race. By so many toils and dangers have they been buffeted that Valour and <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> seem to have competed to establish the Roman Empire. 3 So, as the history of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> is especially worthy of study, yet because the very vastness of the subject is a hindrance to the knowledge of it, and the diversity of its topics distracts the keenness of the attention, I intend to follow the example of those who describe the geography of the earth, and include a complete representation of my subject as it were in a small picture. I shall thus, I hope, contribute something to the admiration in which this illustrious people is held by displaying their greatness all at once in a single view. <br /> 4 If anyone were to contemplate the Roman people as he would a single individual and review its whole life, how it began, how it grew up, how it arrived at what may be called the maturity of its manhood, and how it subsequently as it were reached old age, he will find that it went through four stages of progress. 5 The first period, when it was under the rule of kings, lasted for nearly four hundred years, during which it struggled against its neighbours in the immediate vicinity of the capital. This period will be its infancy. 6 Its next period extends from the consulship of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/7531 target=_blank>Collatinus</a> to that of <a href=/people/11074 target=_blank>Appius Claudius</a> and Quintus <a href=/people/152 target=_blank>Fulvius</a>, a space of one hundred and fifty years, during which the Roman people subjugated <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. It was an age of extreme activities for its soldiers and their arms, and may therefore be called its youth. 7 The next period is the hundred and fifty years down to the time of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> Caesar, during which it spread peace throughout the world. This was the manhood and, as it were, the robust maturity of the empire. 8 From the time of Caesar <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> down to our own age there has been a period of not much less than two hundred years, during which, owing to the inactivity of the emperors, the Roman people, as it were, grew old and lost its potency, save that under the rule of <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> it again stirred its arms and, contrary to general expectation, again renewed its vigour with youth as it were restored. </p>                        </div>

Finding them in these circumstances under a tree, <a href=/people/12127 target=_blank>Faustulus</a>, the shepherd of the royal flock, took them to his cottage and brought them up. 4 <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=place long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alba</a> was at that time the chief city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=place long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latium</a>, having been built by <a href=/people/1160 target=_blank>Iulus</a>; he had disdained <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417125ULav class=place long=12.4793 lat=41.6564>Lavinium</a>, the city of his father <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>. <a href=/people/795 target=_blank>Amulius</a>, of the seventh generation from <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> and <a href=/people/1160 target=_blank>Iulus</a>, was reigning, having driven out his brother <a href=/people/772 target=_blank>Numitor</a>, whose daughter was mother of <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>. 5 <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, therefore, in the first ardour of youth, expelled his uncle from the citadel and restored his grandfather. He himself, being a lover of the river and mountains amongst which he had been brought up, conceived the idea of building a new city. 6 As he and <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a> were twins, they resolved to call in the help of the gods to decide which of them should inaugurate the city and rule there. <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a> took his stand on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LAve class=place long=12.4792 lat=41.8835>Aventine</a>, <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LPal class=place long=12.4884 lat=41.8896>Palatine</a> hill. <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a> first observed six vultures, <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> was after him in time but saw twelve. 7 Being thus victorious in augury, he began to build the city, full of hope that it would prove warlike; for the birds, accustomed to blood and prey, seemed to indicated this. 8 It was thought that a rampart was enough for the protection of the new city. In derision of its small size <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a> leaped over it and was put to death for doing so, whether by his brother's order or not is uncertain; at any rate he was the first victim and hallowed the fortification of the new city with his blood. <br /><a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> had brought into being the idea of a city rather than an actual city; for inhabitants were lacking. 9 There was in the neighbourhood a grove, and this he made a place of refuge; and immediately an extraordinary number of men flocked thither — <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscan</a> shepherds, and even men from across the sea, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a> who had entered the country under <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a> who had come with <a href=/people/686 target=_blank>Evander</a>. Thus he gathered together a single body consisting of various ingredients and, as king, himself created the Roman people. 10 But a population consisting solely of men could only last for a single lifetime; wives were, therefore, demanded from the neighbouring peoples and, when they were refused, were seized by force. For, a pretence being made of holding <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>-races, the maidens who had come to look on were carried off. This immediately gave rise to wars. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420124UVei class=ethnic long=12.3897 lat=42.0233>Veientines</a> were defeated and put to flight; 11 the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419126UCae class=place long=12.6135 lat=41.9228>Caenina</a> was captured and plundered. Moreover, <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> with his own hands bore to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> <a href=/people/3841 target=_blank>Feretrius</a> the spoils of honour won from their king <a href=/people/4054 target=_blank>Agron</a>. 12 To the <a href=/people/11083 target=_blank>Sabines</a> the gates of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> were betrayed by the maiden <a href=/people/3703 target=_blank>Tarpeia</a>. She had craftily demanded as the reward of her act the objects which they carried on their left arms — it is doubtful whether the words meant their shields or their bracelets; they, in order both to fulfil their promise and to take vengeance upon her, overwhelmed her with their shields. 13 The enemy having been thus admitted within the walls, so fierce a battle took place in the very forum that <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> prayed to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> to stay the disgraceful flight of his men; in commemoration of this a temple was erected and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> received the title of the Stayer of flight. 14 At last the women who had been carried off, with their hairs dishevelled, interposed between the furious combatants. Thus peace was made and a treaty concluded with <a href=/people/1911 target=_blank>Tatius</a>; and a wonderful event followed, namely, that the enemy left their homes and migrated to the new city and, by way of dowering their daughters, shared their ancestral wealth with their sons-in-law. 15 Their strength rapidly growing, the king very wisely imposed the following new organization upon the State: the young men were divided into tribes and were to keep watch with arms and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> against any unexpected attack, while the policy of the State was to be in the hands of the old men, who were called fathers from the authority which they exercised, and from their age the senate. 16 After making these arrangements, <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> was suddenly borne away from human sight while he was holding an assembly near the lake of the She-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>. 17 Some think he was torn to pieces by the Senate because of his excessive harshness; but a storm which arose and an eclipse of the sun created the impression that he had been deified. 18 This belief was strengthened when <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> <a href=/people/2438 target=_blank>Proculus</a> declared that <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> had appeared to him in a form more majestic than he had possessed in his lifetime, and also commanded that they should regard him as a deity, and declared that his name in heaven was <a href=/people/773 target=_blank>Quirinus</a>, and that it was the will of the gods that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> should rule over the world. </p>                        </div>

All these arrangements he attributed to the advice of the goddess <a href=/people/3169 target=_blank>Egeria</a>, so that his barbarous subjects might accept them with greater willingness. 4 In a word, he induced a fierce people to rule with piety and justice an empire which they had acquired by violence and injustice. </p>                        </div>

It was he who founded all military discipline and the art of warfare. 2 So when he had wondrously trained the soldiers of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, he ventured to challenge the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=ethnic long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Albans</a>, an important and for a long time a leading people. 3 But when both sides, possessed of equal strength, were becoming weakened by frequent battles, the fortunes of the two peoples were entrusted, as a method of shortening the war, to the <a href=/people/5703 target=_blank>Horatii</a> and <a href=/people/6400 target=_blank>Curiatii</a>, triplets of brothers on either side. 4 It was a well-contested and noble struggle and remarkable in the manner of its end. For when three had been wounded on one side and two killed on the other, the surviving <a href=/people/274 target=_blank>Horatius</a>, adding craft to valour, pretended flight in order to separate his adversaries, and attacking them singly, in the order in which they were able to follow him, overcame them. 5 In this way (an honour rarely won on any other occasion) victory was achieved by one man's hand — a hand with which he soon afterwards sullied by murder. He had noticed his sister weeping because he wore the spoils of one who, though he was her betrothed, was her country's foe. The maiden's girlish affection he punished with the sword. 6 <a href=/people/194 target=_blank>Justice</a> arraigned the crime, but his valour saved him from the penalty for murder, and his guilt was accounted less than the glory which he had won. <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=demonym long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alban</a> people were not long true to their allegiance.

Thus the deceit of the traitors proved fruitless. 8 So after the defeat of the enemy <a href=/people/928 target=_blank>Tullus</a> bound Mettus <a href=/people/5670 target=_blank>Fufetius</a>, the violator of the treaty, between two chariots, and tore him asunder with swift <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>.

Setting out thence to the battle-field, in order that he might keep up the tradition of his rustic employment, he made his conquered enemies pass like <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> under the yoke. 14 The campaign being concluded, this farmer who had enjoyed a triumph returned to his <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, and, ye Heavens, with what speed! 15 For the war was begun and finished within fifteen days, so that it seemed for all the world as if the dictator had hurried back to finish the work which he had left. </p>                        </div>

The disaster which befell them is well, all too well, known. 2 Near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420124WCre class=place long=12.4153 lat=42.0095>Cremera</a> three hundred of them, an army of patricians, were slain, and so the gate which sent them forth to the battle was branded with the name of the Evil Gate. 3 But for this disaster atonement was made by great victories, when the strongest cities were captured under different leaders and with different results. 4 The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/423124UFal class=ethnic long=12.4146 lat=42.2911>Falisci</a> surrendered voluntarily; <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420125UFid class=place long=12.5123 lat=41.9784>Fidenae</a> was consumed by its own flames; <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420124UVei class=place long=12.3897 lat=42.0233>Veii</a> was thoroughly plundered and destroyed. 5 When the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/423124UFal class=ethnic long=12.4146 lat=42.2911>Falisci</a> were being besieged, the honourable conduct of the Roman commander was a subject of admiration, and not without reason; for he actually sent back in chains a schoolmaster who offered to betray the city, together with the boys whom he had brought with him. 6 For, being a man of integrity and wisdom, he knew that the only true victory is that which is won with untainted honour and unimpaired dignity. 7 The people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420125UFid class=place long=12.5123 lat=41.9784>Fidenae</a>, not being a match for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> with the sword, had armed themselves with torches and had put on vari-coloured fillets resembling <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a>, in order to inspire terror, and had marched forth like furies; but their funereal attire was an omen of their overthrow. 8 The ten years' siege which <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420124UVei class=place long=12.3897 lat=42.0233>Veii</a> sustained is an indication of its strength. It was the first occasion on which a Roman army spent the winter under tents of skin, and winter service was compensated by special pay, and the soldiers at their own suggestion were bound under an oath not to return until the city had been captured. 9 The spoils won from Lars <a href=/people/5290 target=_blank>Tolumnius</a>, the king, were brought back in triumph and dedicated to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> <a href=/people/3841 target=_blank>Feretrius</a>. In the end the fall of the city was brought about, not by scaling-ladders or assault, but by a mine and underground stratagems. 10 Lastly, the booty appeared so rich that a tithe of it was sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=person long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, and the whole of the Roman people was summoned to plunder the city. 11 Such was <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420124UVei class=place long=12.3897 lat=42.0233>Veii</a> in those days.

But what sense of justice could be expected from barbarians? They only acted with greater ferocity, with the result that an open conflict ensued. 7 The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/482033UAge class=ethnic long=3.284 lat=48.198>Senones</a> turned away from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430119UClu class=place long=11.9488 lat=43.0152>Clusium</a> and, as they marched upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, were met by the consul <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> with an army at the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420125WAli class=place long=12.5207 lat=42.0177>Alia</a>. One could not easily find a more disgraceful defeat, and so <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> has set a black mark against that day in its calendar. 8 The Roman army having been routed, the enemy were approaching the walls of the city, and there was no garrison. It was then, as upon no other occasion, that the true Roman valour showed itself. 9 In the first place the older men who had held the highest offices collected in the forum and there consecrated themselves to the infernal deities, the chief pontiff performing the ceremony; 10 they then immediately returned each to his own house and, still clad in their official robes and richest attire, they seated themselves in their curule chairs, so that, when the enemy arrived, they might all die with proper dignity. 11 The pontiffs and priests dug holes and buried some of the most sacred objects which were in the temples and carried off others with them on waggons to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420124UVei class=place long=12.3897 lat=42.0233>Veii</a>. 12 At the same time the virgins of the priesthood of <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a>, barefooted, accompanied the sacred objects in their flight. It is said, however, that a plebeian, <a href=/people/5418 target=_blank>Albinius</a>, assisted the virgins in their escape, and having set down his wife and children, received them in his waggon; to such an extent, even in the utmost extremities, did the respect for religion prevail over personal affection. 13 A band of young men, whose number is generally held to have been scarcely a thousand, under the leadership of <a href=/people/215 target=_blank>Manlius</a>, took up a position on the citadel of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitoline</a> hill, having called upon <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> himself, as though he were there in very presence, to defend their valour as they themselves had met to guard his temple. 14 Meanwhile the Gauls arrived and entered the open city, at first in alarm lest some hidden stratagem was in the background, but afterwards, when they saw no one about, with equal noise and impetuosity. They approached the houses, which were everywhere open: here they were overawed by the elders in their purple-edged robes seated in their curule chairs as though they were gods and genii;1 but presently, when it was obvious that they were mortals, and when, besides, they disdained to answer a word, they slaughtered them all, acting with the same brutality, and hurled torches into the houses and razed the whole city to the ground with fire and sword and the labour of their hands. 15 For six months (who could credit it?) the barbarians clung round that single hill, making every kind of attempt upon it by night as well as by day. <a href=/people/215 target=_blank>Manlius</a>, on his part, roused by the cries of a goose, hurled them from the top of the rock as they were climbing up at night and, in order to deprive the enemy of their hopes, though he was suffering the extremities of famine, cast down loaves of bread from the citadel so as to create the impression that he was confident. 16 Also on the appointed day he sent <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> the pontiff through the midst of the enemy's guards to perform a solemn sacrifice on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LQui class=place long=12.4871 lat=41.9011>Quirinal</a> Hill; he returned safely, protected by the sacred character of his mission, through the enemies' weapons, and announced that the gods were propitious. 17 Finally, when the barbarians had been worn out by their own siege-operations and were offering to depart for a payment of 1000 pounds of gold (making their offer, moreover, in an insolent manner by throwing a sword into the scale to make the weights unfair, and uttering the proud taunt Woe to the vanquished!), <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a>, suddenly attacking them from the rear, made such a slaughter as to wipe out all traces of the burning of the city with the delegate of Gallic blood. 18 We are inclined to thank the gods that the destruction of the city was so complete; for they were the huts of shepherds that the fire overwhelmed, and the flames buried <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>' poor little settlement. What other effect then did the fire produce except that the city, destined to be the abode of men and gods, seemed not so much to have been destroyed and overthrown as to have been sanctified and purified? 19 Thus, when the city had been saved by <a href=/people/215 target=_blank>Manlius</a> and restored by <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a>, the Roman people rose up again against their neighbouring foes with increased vigour and force. </p>                        </div>

The latter, with the wisdom of advanced years, had advised him either to let them all go free or else to slay them all; 11 <a href=/people/1756 target=_blank>Pontius</a> preferred to strip them of their arms and send them under the yoke, so that they were not made his friends by an act of kindness but rendered bitterer enemies by the affront put upon them. The result was that the consuls by a generous act of devotion immediately wiped out the disgrace of the treaty by voluntarily surrendering themselves; and the soldiers, under the leadership of <a href=/people/897 target=_blank>Papirius</a>, calling for vengeance, rushed furiously along (horrible to relate) with their swords drawn as they advanced before they came to blows, and, when the encounter took place, the enemy affirmed that the eyes of all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> blazed with fire.

The theatre lies immediately above the harbour in such a position as to command a view of the sea, and this was the cause of all the misfortunes which befell the unhappy city. 4 They happened to be celebrating a festival when they saw the Roman fleet rowing towards the shore, and thinking that they were enemies, they rushed out and began to hurl indiscriminate insults at them, asking who the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were and whence they had come. 5 Nor was this all; for when an embassy immediately came and lodged a complaint, they foully affronted them also by a shameful and indecent insult.

By this time, to be sure, the terror inspired by the monsters had passed away, and Gaius <a href=/people/3219 target=_blank>Numicius</a>, a front-rank soldier of the fourth legion, had shown, by cutting off the trunk of one of them, that the monsters were mortal. 10 And so javelins were concentrated against them, and torches, hurled against the towers which they carried, covered all the ranks of the enemy with flaming ruins. The slaughter was brought to an end only when night separated the armies, and the king, the last to desert the field, was himself carried away by his attendants on his own shield wounded in the shoulder. 11 The last engagement was fought under the leaders already mentioned above on the Arusine Plains in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=place long=16 lat=40.4>Lucania</a>. On this occasion the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> won a complete victory. Chance brought about a result which valour otherwise would have secured. 12 For, when the elephants again moved forward into the front rank, a young one that happened to be among them was struck a heavy blow on the head with a spear and turned round; and when it was hurrying back through the confused mass of its fellows, trumpeting with pain, its dam recognized it and left her place to defend it, causing by her vast bulk as great a disturbance around her as if she were attacking the enemy. 13 Thus the same beasts which deprived the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> of their first victory and equalized the second battle, gave them undoubted victory in the third fight. 14 And it was not only with arms and on the battle-field that the struggle with King <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> was carried on, but also by intrigue at home; for after his first victory the wily king, recognizing the valour of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, immediately gave up hope of military success and had recourse to craft. 15 For he burnt the bodies of the slain, treated his prisoners with indulgence and gave them back without ransom, and sending ambassadors to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> strove by every device to obtain a treaty and be admitted to friendship. 16 But in peace and war, at home and abroad, Roman valour proved its worth in every respect; and the victory in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=demonym long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentine</a> war, more than any other, showed the bravery of the Roman people, the wisdom of the senate and the magnanimity of the generals. 17 What kind of men were those who, we are told, were trampled underfoot by the elephants in the first battle? The wounds of all of them were upon their chests; some shared death with their foes, all had their swords still in their hands, a threatening mien still marked their features, and their anger yet lived even in death. 18 So struck was <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> with admiration that he exclaimed, How easy were it for me to win the empire of the world if I had an army of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, or for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> to win it if they had me as their king! Again, how great must have been their promptitude in replacing their losses! 19 For <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> said, I plainly see that I am sprung of the seed of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, when I see all these heads of foes cut off springing up again from their blood as they sprang from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375227ULer class=demonym long=22.7182 lat=37.5511>Lernaean</a> <a href=/people/1205 target=_blank>hydra</a>. 20 Again, what was the character of the senate? When, on the proposal of <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389270WKai class=place long=27.011 lat=38.957>Caecus</a>, the ambassadors of <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> had been expelled from the city with their presents and the king asked them what they thought of the abode of their enemies, they confessed that the city seemed to them to be a temple and the senate an assembly of kings. 21 Again, what kind of men were their generals? Even in the field, <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a> sent back the physician who offered the head of <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> for sale, and <a href=/people/820 target=_blank>Fabricius</a> refused a share in his kingdom offered to him by the king; 22 in peace, <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a> preferred his earthenware vessels to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413148RSam class=demonym long=14.8 lat=41.3>Samnite</a> gold, and <a href=/people/820 target=_blank>Fabricius</a>, with all the authority of the censorial office, stigmatized as a luxury the possession of <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a>, a man of consular rank, of ten pounds of silver. 23 Who then can wonder that with such moral principles and such military valour the Roman people were victorious, and that, in their single war against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=ethnic long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentines</a>, they subdued, within the space of four years, the greater part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, the bravest nations, the richest cities and the most fertile regions? 24 Or what can be more incredible than the contrast presented by the beginning of the war and its conclusion? <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> victorious in the first battle, while all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a> trembled, laid waste the banks of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412138WLir class=place long=13.7751 lat=41.2434>Liris</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415135UFre class=place long=13.5394 lat=41.5369>Fregellae</a>, looked forth from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418129UPra class=place long=12.8924 lat=41.8399>Praeneste</a> upon a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> which he had all but captured, and, at a distance of only about twenty miles, filled the eyes of the trembling citizens with his smoke and dust. 25 Yet afterwards, when this same king had twice had his camp captured and had been twice wounded and had been driven as a fugitive over sea and land back to his own land of Greece, peace and tranquillity ensued, and so rich a spoil was gathered from so many wealthy races that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> could not contain the fruits of her victory. 26 Scarcely ever did a fairer or more glorious triumph enter the city. 27 Up to that time the only spoils which you could have seen were the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416133RVol class=ethnic long=13.3 lat=41.6>Volscians</a>, the flocks of the <a href=/people/11083 target=_blank>Sabines</a>, the waggons of the Gauls, the broken arms of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413148RSam class=ethnic long=14.8 lat=41.3>Samnites</a>; now if you looked at captives, they were <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398206RMol class=ethnic long=20.6 lat=39.8>Molossians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392165RBre class=ethnic long=16.5 lat=39.2>Bruttians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=41>Apulians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=ethnic long=16 lat=40.4>Lucanians</a>; if you looked upon the procession, you saw gold, purple statues, pictures and all the luxury of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>. 28 But upon nothing did the Roman people look with greater pleasure than upon those huge beasts, which they had feared so much, with towers upon their backs, now following the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> which had vanquished them, with heads bowed low not wholly unconscious that they were prisoners. </p>                        </div>

Hence there was still in it a certain spirit of ferocity inherited from shepherd ancestors, and an untamed spirit yet breathed. 2 Hence it was that the army mutinied in camp and stoned the general <a href=/people/419 target=_blank>Postumius</a>, when he denied them the spoils which he had promised; that under <a href=/people/11074 target=_blank>Appius Claudius</a> they refused to defeat the enemy when it was in their power to do so; that when under the leadership of Volero many refused to serve, the consul's fasces were broken. 3 Hence it was that they punished with exile their most illustrious chiefs, because they opposed their will; <a href=/people/2734 target=_blank>Coriolanus</a>, for example, when he ordered them to till their fields (and he would have avenged his wrongs by force of arms with even greater severity, if his mother Veturia had not disarmed him by her tears when he was already advancing), 4 and <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a> himself, because he was thought to have divided the spoils of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420124UVei class=place long=12.3897 lat=42.0233>Veii</a> unfairly between the people and the army. <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a>, however, a truer patriot, lived to grow old in the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420124UVei class=place long=12.3897 lat=42.0233>Veii</a> which he had captured, and afterwards took vengeance on behalf of those who implored his aid against the Gaulish foe. 5 With the senate, too, there were struggles which went beyond all justice and right, since the people even left their homes and threatened their country with desolation and ruin. <br /> 2 The first dispute was due to the tyranny of the usurers. When these actually vented their fury upon their persons as though they were slaves, the common people took up arms and seceded to the Sacred Mount, and were with difficulty induced to return (and then only after their demand for a tribune had been granted) at the instance of the eloquent and wise <a href=/people/12247 target=_blank>Menenius Agrippa</a>. 2 The fable, quite in the old style of oratory, which was most efficacious in promoting concord, is still remembered, in which he said that the members of the human body once revolted, on the ground that, while they all performed their functions, the stomach alone lived without doing any duty, but afterwards, when they found themselves dying, owing to their separation from it, they returned to a good understanding with it, because they found that its service was to convert food into the blood which flows in them. <br /> 3 The second disagreement occurred in the very centre of the city and was caused by the lust of the Decemvirate. Ten eminent citizens had been chosen by order of the people, and had jointly drawn up a code of laws derived from Greece, and the whole system of justice had been arranged upon twelve tables; but they afterwards still retained, in the lawless spirit of the kings, the fasces which had been entrusted to them. 2 <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> attained such a spirit of insolence beyond all the rest that he destined a free-born maiden for dishonour, forgetful of <a href=/people/12037 target=_blank>Lucretia</a> and the kings and the code which he himself helped to draw up. 3 And so when <a href=/people/5313 target=_blank>Virginius</a>, the maiden's father, saw his daughter being dragged away to slavery after an unjust sentence, without a moment's delay he slew her in the midst of the forum with his own hand and, moving up companies of his fellow-soldiers, surrounded the whole band of tyrants with an armed force and dragged them from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LAve class=place long=12.4792 lat=41.8835>Aventine</a> Hill to prison and chains. <br /> 4 The third insurrection was caused by the question of marriage-dignity, arising from the demand that plebeians should intermarry with patricians. This disturbance burst into flames on the Hill of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LJan class=place long=12.4608 lat=41.8913>Janiculum</a> at the instigation of <a href=/people/2725 target=_blank>Canuleius</a>, the tribune of the people. 26 The fourth insurrection was due to the desire for office and the demand that magistrates should be elected from among the plebeians also. 2 <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> <a href=/people/12048 target=_blank>Ambustus</a> was the father of two daughters, one of whom he had given in marriage to <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a>, a man of patrician blood, while <a href=/people/4697 target=_blank>Stolo</a>, the plebeian, had wedded the other. 3 The wife of the latter having been the object of somewhat insolent laughter on the part of her sister because she had been alarmed by the sound of the lictor's staff (a sound which was unfamiliar to her in her own home), <a href=/people/4697 target=_blank>Stolo</a> could not endure the affront. 4 And so, when he obtained the tribunate, he extorted from the senate, against their will, a share in public offices and magistracies. <br /> 5 Even in these insurrections one may admire, not without good reason, this sovereign people, since at one time it championed liberty, at another chastity, at another the dignity of birth, at another the right to distinctions and insignia of office, and among all these things was a zealous upholder of nothing so much as of liberty, 6 and could not be corrupted by any kind of bribery to put it up for sale, although, as was to be expected in a large and daily increasing community, dangerous citizens arose from time to time. 7 The people punished by immediate execution <a href=/people/862 target=_blank>Spurius</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, who were suspected of aiming at the royal power, the former through his excessive largesses, the latter by his agrarian law. The punishment of <a href=/people/862 target=_blank>Spurius</a> was undertaken by his own father, while <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> was stabbed in the middle of the forum at the order of <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, the dictator, by <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a> <a href=/people/7192 target=_blank>Ahala</a>, the master of the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. 8 <a href=/people/215 target=_blank>Manlius</a> too, the saviour of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, they hurled from the very citadel which he had himself defended, when he began to behave in a manner too arrogant and ill-fitting a private citizen on the strength of having set free a number of debtors. <br />Such were the Roman people at home and abroad, in peace and in war, as it passed through the stormy waters of its youth, that is to say, the second age of its empire, during which it subdued by force of arms all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> between the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> and the Straits. </p>                        </div>

Yet so little were they alarmed that they welcomed the violence of the rushing tide as a godsend, 6 and immediately without delay defeated <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hiero</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=person long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a> with a suddenness that made him confess that he was defeated before he set eyes upon the enemy. <br /> 7 In the consulship of <a href=/people/4511 target=_blank>Duillius</a> and <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> they ventured to meet the enemy at sea also. On this occasion the very speed with which they had constructed their fleet was an omen of victory; for within sixty days of the felling of the timber, a fleet of a hundred and sixty vessels rode at anchor, so that it seemed as if the trees had not been made into ships by the art of man, but changed and altered thereto by a dispensation of heaven. 8 The ordering of the battle too was wonderful, since the heavy, slow Roman vessels came to grips with the swift and active craft the enemy. Nought availed their usual manoeuvres of sweeping away the enemy's oars or frustrating their charge by flight; 9 for grappling-irons and strong appliances, which before the battle had caused much derision on the part of the enemy, fastened upon their ships and obliged them to fight as it were upon dry land. Thus victorious off the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385150IAio class=place long=15.05 lat=38.5>Liparae</a> Islands, after sinking or routing the enemy's fleet, they celebrated their first naval triumph. 10 And how great was their joy! <a href=/people/4511 target=_blank>Duillius</a>, who had been in command, not content with a single day's triumph, throughout his life, when he returned from supper, ordered torches to be lighted and pipes to play before him by way of celebrating a daily triumph. 11 In comparison with <a href=/people/4511 target=_blank>Duillius</a>' great victory, the death of the other consul, <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> Asina, in an ambush was a trifling loss; but his invitation to a pretended conference and consequent seizure was a good example of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> treachery. <br /> 12 In the dictatorship of <a href=/people/9057 target=_blank>Calatinus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> expelled almost all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> garrisons — from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373136PAkr class=place long=13.5855 lat=37.2906>Agrigentum</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380125UDre class=place long=12.5178 lat=38.0171>Drepanum</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381134UPan class=place long=13.363 lat=38.118>Panormus</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380126UEry class=place long=12.588 lat=38.04>Eryx</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378124ULil class=place long=12.4342 lat=37.7991>Lilybaeum</a>. 13 On one occasion there was a panic in the forest of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369144PCam class=place long=14.4474 lat=36.8721>Camarina</a>, but by the extraordinary bravery of <a href=/people/1017 target=_blank>Calpurnius</a> <a href=/people/4530 target=_blank>Flamma</a>, a military tribune, we extricated ourselves. He, with a chosen band of three hundred men, seized a knoll, which was beset by the enemy, and so delayed them long enough to give the whole army time to escape. 14 By the glorious result of his action he equalled the fame of <a href=/people/212 target=_blank>Leonidas</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388225FThe class=place long=22.536 lat=38.795>Thermopylae</a>, the Roman hero being more illustrious in that he survived his great exploit, though he did not write anything in his own blood.4 <br /> 15 In the consulship of Lucius <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Cornelius Scipio</a>, when <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> was already a suburban province of the Roman people, the war spread further, and they crossed over to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a> and the adjoining island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420090IKyr class=place long=9 lat=42>Corsica</a>. 16 They terrified the inhabitants by the destruction of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409095UOlb class=place long=9.5078 lat=40.9236>Olbia</a> in the former island and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421095PAla class=place long=9.5106 lat=42.1025>Aleria</a> in the latter, and so completely cleared land and sea of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> that only Africa itself still remained to be conquered. <br /> 17 Under the leadership of Marcus <a href=/people/585 target=_blank>Atilius</a> <a href=/people/512 target=_blank>Regulus</a> the war was now transferred to Africa. There had been some, however, who quailed at the very mention of the Punic sea and the terror which it inspired, their alarm being further increased by the tribune Nautius; but the general, by threatening him the axe if he refused to obey, inspired them with courage for the journey through the fear of death. 18 All haste was then made with sails and oars, and the approach of the enemy so alarmed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> that the gates of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> were almost opened and the city captured. 19 The war began with the taking of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368111UAsp class=place long=11.1155 lat=36.8378>Clipea</a>, which projects as a citadel or watch-tower from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> coast. This and three hundred other fortresses were destroyed. 20 But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had to contend not only with human beings, but also with monsters; for a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> of wondrous size, which seemed to have been created for the defence of Africa, harassed their camp on the <a href=/people/4891 target=_blank>Bagradas</a>. 21 But <a href=/people/512 target=_blank>Regulus</a>, everywhere victorious, having spread far and wide the terror of his name and having slain or holding as prisoners a large number of the enemy's troops and even of their generals, and having sent in advance to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> a fleet laden with immense spoils and full of material for a triumph, was already threatening <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> itself, the author of the war, with blockade and pressing hard upon its very gates. 22 At this point the breeze of fortune veered somewhat, but only in order to provide more evidence of the Roman valour, the greatness of which is more often put to the proof by misfortunes. 23 For when the enemy had resorted to foreign aid and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemon</a> had sent <a href=/people/727 target=_blank>Xanthippus</a> to be their general, we were defeated by a very skilful leader — a disgraceful disaster such as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had never before experienced — and the brave commander-in-chief fell alive into the enemies' hands. But he proved himself able to face such a calamity; his spirit was not broken either by a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> prison or by the mission to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> which he undertook. 24 For, contrary to the instructions of the enemy, he expressed an opinion against making peace or consenting to an exchange of prisoners. 25 His voluntary return to his enemies and his final sufferings, whether in prison or on the cross, in no way sullied his dignity; nay, rendered by all this only the more worthy of admiration, what did he do but triumph victorious over his victors and, since <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> had not yielded, over <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> herself? 26 The Roman people, on their part, were even more eager and intent on avenging <a href=/people/512 target=_blank>Regulus</a> than on obtaining a victory. <br /> 27 In the consulship, therefore, of <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> became bolder and the war had been transferred back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> inflicted such a defeat upon their foes at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381134UPan class=place long=13.363 lat=38.118>Panormus</a> that they gave up all thought of further attacks upon the island. 28 The extent of their victory is proved by the capture of about a hundred elephants — a vast prey even if they had captured them not in war but in the chase. <br /> 29 In the consulship of <a href=/people/11074 target=_blank>Appius Claudius</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were defeated not by the enemy but by the gods, whose auspices he had despised, their fleet being immediately sunk on the spot where <a href=/people/11074 target=_blank>Appius Claudius</a> had ordered the sacred chickens to be thrown overboard, because he was warned by them not to fight. <br /> 30 In the consulship of Marcus <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> Buteo they defeated the enemy's fleet near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371108IAeg class=place long=10.8124 lat=37.1199>Aegimurus</a> in the African sea, while it was actually sailing against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. 31 But what a triumph was ruined by the storm which then occurred, when the fleet, loaded with rich booty, driven by contrary winds, covered Africa, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340105WSyr class=place long=10.5 lat=34>Syrtes</a> 32 and the shores of all the adjacent islands with its wreckage! A great calamity indeed! but it did not fail to redound to the honour of an imperial people that it was a storm which had intercepted their victory, and a shipwreck which had destroyed their triumph. And, seeing that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> spoil floated off every promontory and island, even so the Roman people triumphed. <br /> 33 In the consulship of <a href=/people/1512 target=_blank>Lutatius</a> <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a> the war was at last brought to a close near the islands called the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379123IAig class=place long=12.3286 lat=37.9311>Aegatae</a>. No greater fight was ever fought at sea. 34 For the enemy's fleet came up loaded with supplies, troops, towers and arms; indeed you might say that all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> was on board it. And it was this that caused its ruin; 35 for the Roman fleet, easily handled, light and unencumbered and in a way resembling a land army, was guided by its oars just as <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> are guided by their reins in a cavalry engagement, and the beaks of the ships, moving rapidly to ram now this foe and now that, presented the appearance of living creatures. 36 And so in a moment of time the enemy's vessels were cut to pieces and covered the whole sea between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a> with their wreckage. 37 In a word, so great was the victory that no question was raised of demolishing the enemy's walls; it seemed superfluous to vent their fury on a citadel and walls when <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> had already been destroyed upon the sea. </p>                        </div>

When the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> prevaricated, the chief of the embassy exclaimed, Why this delay? In the folds of this robe I bear war and peace; which do you choose? And when they cried out War, he answered, Take war then, and shaking out the front of his toga in the midst of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate-house</a>, he spread it out with a gesture which did not fail to produce the alarm which might have been expected had he really carried war in its folds. <br /> 8 The course of the war resembled its beginning: for, as though the last curses of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397-03USag class=ethnic long=-0.2807 lat=39.677>Saguntines</a> at their public self-immolation and burning had demanded such funeral rites, atonement was made to their shades by the devastation of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, the subjugation of Africa and the destruction of the leaders and kings who waged the war. 9 As soon, therefore, as the dire and dismal stress and storm of the Punic War had arisen in Spain and had forged in the flames of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397-03USag class=place long=-0.2807 lat=39.677>Saguntum</a> the thunderbolt which had long been destined to fall upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, immediately, hurried along by some compelling force, it burst its way through the midst of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> and swooped down upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> from those snows of fabulous heights like a missile hurled from the skies. </p>                        </div>

The Roman army under <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> was scattered, and the general himself would have fallen wounded into the enemy's hands had not his son, still a mere youth, protected his father and rescued him from the very jaws of death. 11 This youth was destined to be that <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> who grew up to be the conqueror of Africa and was to win a title of honour from its misfortunes. <br /> 12 After the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/452091WTic class=place long=9.1458 lat=45.1809>Ticinus</a> came that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450096WTre class=place long=9.614 lat=45.0433>Trebia</a>. It was here that in the consulship of <a href=/people/265 target=_blank>Sempronius</a>, the second storm of the Punic War wreaked its fury. On this occasion the crafty enemy, finding the day cold and snowy, after warming themselves at their fires and oiling themselves, defeated us (horrible to relate) though they came from the warmth of the southern sunshine, by the aid of our own winter. <br /> 13 <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>'s third thunderbolt was launched at Lake <a about=https://topostext.org/place/432121WTra class=place long=12.053 lat=43.183>Trasimene</a>, where <a href=/people/504 target=_blank>Flaminius</a> commanded the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. Here <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> craft devised a new stratagem; for their cavalry, under the cover of a mist from the lake and the undergrowth of the marshes, suddenly attacked the rear of our fighters. 14 Nor can we blame the gods; for swarms of <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> settling on our standards and the reluctance of the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> to advance, and a violent earthquake which ensued upon the beginning of the engagement — unless, indeed, it was the rush of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and men and the unusually violent clash of arms which caused this trembling of the earth — had warned its rash commander of the impending disaster. <br /> 15 The fourth and almost mortal wound received by the Roman Empire was dealt at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413162UCan class=place long=16.1515 lat=41.2964>Cannae</a>, an insignificant <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=demonym long=16.3 lat=41>Apulian</a> village, which emerged from its obscurity as the scene of a great disaster and gained fame from the slaughter of 60,000 men. There the general, the battle-field, the atmosphere and the weather — in fact, all nature — conspired to bring about the destruction of the unhappy army. 16 The wily <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>, not content with sending pretended deserters who presently fell upon the rear of the fighters, having, moreover, noticed the character of the ground in the open plains (where the sun is very hot and the dust abundant and the wind blows constantly, as though on a fixed principle, from the east) drew up his army in such a way that, while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had all these factors against them, he himself fought with the elements on his side, aided by the wind, the dust and the sun. 17 Thus two great Roman armies were slaughtered till the enemy were satiated and <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> bade his soldiers stay their swords. One of our generals fled, the other was captured. It is difficult to decide which showed the greater courage: <a href=/people/10991 target=_blank>Paulus</a>, who was ashamed to survive, or <a href=/people/79 target=_blank>Varro</a>, who refused to despair. 18 As proofs of the vastness of the slaughter the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412160WAuf class=place long=16.02 lat=41.23028>Aufidus</a> for a long time ran with blood; a bridge of corpses was constructed by order of the general over the torrent of Vergellus; two pecks of rings were sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> and the services of the equestrian order thus estimated by measure. 19 After this no doubt will be entertained that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> would have seen its last day and <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> might within five days have feasted on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, if (as they say <a href=/people/5100 target=_blank>Maharbal</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a>, the son of <a href=/people/2843 target=_blank>Bomilcar</a>, observed) he had known how to use his victory as well as he knew how to obtain it. </p>                        </div>

They had no arms; they took down the arms fixed up in the temples. They had no men; slaves were set free and took the oath of service. 24 The treasury was empty; the senators voluntarily offered their wealth to the State, retaining not a particle of gold except in the bullae and in the single ring which each of them wore. The example of the senate was followed by the knights, who, in their turn, were imitated by the tribes, 25 with the result that when, in the consulship of <a href=/people/871 target=_blank>Laevinus</a> and <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>, the resources of private individuals were poured into the public treasury, the registers and the hands of the clerks scarcely sufficed to record them. 26 Furthermore, what wisdom the centuries showed in the choice of magistrates, when the younger men sought from their seniors advice about the election of the consuls! For against a foe so often victorious and so crafty it behooved them to fight not only with courage but with stratagem also on their side. <br /> 27 The first hope of the Empire, as it began to recover and, so to speak, return to life, was <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a>, who devised a new method of defeating <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> — by not fighting him.

He had also protected both his flanks with elephants of huge size, brilliant with gold, purple and silver and the sheen of their own ivory. 17 But all this great force was embarrassed by its very size, as well as by a shower of rain, which, suddenly descending, had, by a piece of wonderful good luck, destroyed the efficiency of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> bows.

Also <a href=/people/35 target=_blank>Philip</a> had been succeeded by his son <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Perses</a>, who thought that it ill accorded with the high repute of the nation that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, once conquered, should remain for ever conquered. 3 Under his leadership, therefore, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> rose with much more vigour than under his father. They had induced the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> to support their efforts and had thus tempered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> persistence with Thracian energy, and Thracian savagery with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> discipline. 4 A further advantage was the skill of their leader, who, having surveyed the topography of his territory from the summit of Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/428247LHae class=place long=24.659 lat=42.773>Haemus</a>, pitched his camp in an inaccessible spot, and so fortified his realm with arms and the sword that he seemed to have left no means of access except to an enemy who should descend from the sky. 5 But the Roman people, under the consul <a href=/people/10971 target=_blank>Marcius</a> <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a>, having entered the province and having carefully explored the approaches by the Lake of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398223WAsc class=person long=22.252 lat=39.945>Ascuris</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398232RPer class=demonym long=22 lat=39.85>Perrhaebian</a> Mountains, effected an entrance over heights which seemed inaccessible even to birds, and by a sudden inroad surprised the king, who thought himself safe and feared no such attack. 6 Such was his alarm that he ordered all his money to be thrown into the sea, lest it should be lost, and his fleet to be burned, lest it should be set on fire. 7 Under the consul <a href=/people/10991 target=_blank>Paulus</a>, after larger and more frequent garrisons had been established, other methods were used to take <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> by surprise through the remarkable skill and perseverance of the general, who threatened an attack at one point and broke through at another. 8 His mere approach so alarmed the king that he did not dare to take an active part in the war, but committed the management of it to his generals. 9 Being defeated, therefore, in his absence he fled to the sea, and to the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405255PSam class=place long=25.5348 lat=40.5039>Samothrace</a>, relying on the well-known sanctity of the place, as though temples and altars could protect one whom his own mountains and arms had been unable to save. 10 No king ever clung more tenaciously to the memory of the great position which he had lost. When he wrote to the Roman general as a suppliant from the temple in which he had taken refuge and signed the letter with his name, he added the title of king. On the other hand, no one ever showed more respect than <a href=/people/10991 target=_blank>Paulus</a> for captured majesty. 11 When his enemy came into his presence, he received him upon his tribunal, invited him to his own table, and warned his own children to respect <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> whose power was so great. 12 The triumph in honour of the conquest of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> was among the most splendid which the Roman people ever held and witnessed. The spectacle occupied three days; 13 on the first day the statues and pictures were displayed in procession, on the next day the arms and treasure, on the third day the captives, including the king himself, who seemed still to be dazed and stupefied by the suddenness of the disaster. 14 But the Roman people had already received the glad news of the victory long before it was announced by the victorious general's despatches. For it was known in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the very day on which <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Perses</a> was defeated 15 through the presence of two young men with white <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> washing off dust and gore at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WJut class=place long=12.4858 lat=41.8917>pool</a> of <a href=/people/2237 target=_blank>Juturna</a>.

In its results, however, it was by far the most important, for at last an end was made of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. 2 If one considers the significance of the three periods, the first saw the beginning of the war, the second saw it given a decisive turn, the third saw its final end. 3 The pretext of the war was that, contrary to an article in the treaty, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> had equipped a fleet and army — though it was only against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a>. 4 <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Massinissa</a>, it is true, caused frequent alarms on their frontier; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> supported this monarch as a good friend and ally. Deciding upon war, they discussed what was to happen when it was concluded. <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, with implacable hatred, kept declaring, even when he was consulted on other subjects, that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> must be destroyed. 5 <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> <a href=/people/896 target=_blank>Nasica</a> thought that it ought to be preserved, lest, if the fear of the rival city were removed, prosperity should begin to have a demoralizing effect. The senate decided upon the middle course, namely, that the city should merely be removed to another site; 6 for they could imagine nothing which redounded more to their credit than that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> should still exist, but a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> which they need not fear. 7 And so, in the consulship of <a href=/people/1949 target=_blank>Manilius</a> and <a href=/people/2605 target=_blank>Censorinus</a>, the Roman people attacked <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> and burnt within the very sight of the city the fleet which had been voluntarily surrendered because hopes of peace had been raised. 8 They then summoned the chief citizens and ordered them to leave <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> territory, if they wished to save their lives. This demand, by its severity, so kindled their wrath that they preferred to suffer any extremity. And so they immediately gave up all hope of the national cause, and with one voice the cry was raised, To arms! 9 and it was resolved to resist by every means in their power — not that any hope remained, but because they preferred that their country should be ruined by the hands of the enemy rather than by their own. 10 Their spirit of furious resistance may be understood from the facts that they tore off the roofs of their houses for material to construct a new fleet, and that, in the munition factories, gold and silver were melted down instead of bronze and iron, while the women contributed their hair to form cords for the engines of war. Under the consul <a href=/people/1752 target=_blank>Mancinus</a> a hot siege was kept up by land and sea. 11 The harbours were blocked up; the first, then the second, and finally the third wall was dismantled; but the <a href=/people/3548 target=_blank>Byrsa</a>, as they called their citadel, held out like a second city. 12 Though the destruction of the city was thus as good as certain, yet it seemed as if fate required a <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> to make an end of Africa. The State, therefore, turned to another <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> and demanded that he should complete the war. This man, the offspring of <a href=/people/10991 target=_blank>Paulus</a> Macedonicus, had been adopted by the son of the great <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a> for the glory of the family, for the grandson was destined by fate to overthrow the city which his grandfather had shattered. 13 But, just as the bite of a dying animal is always most deadly, even so <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, half destroyed, caused more trouble than when it was whole. 14 While the enemy had been driven into the sole remaining stronghold, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had also blocked up the harbour from the sea. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> thereupon excavated another harbour on another side of the city, though not with the object of escaping; 15 but at a point where no one imagined that they could break out, a fleet, as it were, sprang suddenly into birth and sallied forth, while at the same time, now by day and now by night, some new structure or engine of war or some fresh band of desperate men started forth like a sudden flame from the ashes of a buried fire. 16 When the position finally became hopeless, 36,000 men led — though it is scarcely credible — by <a href=/people/144 target=_blank>Hasdrubal</a> surrendered themselves. 17 How much braver was the conduct of a woman, the wife of the commander, who, with her two children in her arms, hurled herself from the roof of her house into the midst of the flames, following the example of the queen who founded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>!3 18 How mighty was the city which was destroyed is shown, to mention only a single fact, by the long duration of the fire; for it was only after seventeen days of continual effort that the flames were with difficulty put out which the enemy had themselves kindled in their houses and temples, in order that, since the city could not be saved from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, the material for a triumph might be burnt. </p>                        </div>

Otherwise it is so well protected on all sides by the sea and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426007LPyr class=place long=0.658 lat=42.632>Pyrenees</a> that, owing to its geographical conformation, it would be unassailable. 4 But it was beset by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> before it recognized its own possibilities, and was the only one of the provinces that discovered its strength only after it had been defeated. 5 Fighting continued in Spain over a period of nearly two hundred years, from the earliest of the <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipios</a> down to the first Caesar <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, yet not continuously and without intermission, but at the call of circumstances; and the first hostilities were directed not against the Spanish but against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> in Spain, from whom the contagion spread and who were the cause of all the wars. <br /> 6 The two <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipios</a>, Publius and Gnaeus, bore the first Roman standards over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426007LPyr class=place long=0.658 lat=42.632>Pyrenees</a>, and defeated <a href=/people/381 target=_blank>Hanno</a> and <a href=/people/144 target=_blank>Hasdrubal</a>, the brothers of <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>, in important encounters. Spain would have been carried by assault had not the gallant Roman leaders, in the hour of victory, been surprised and killed by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> craft, when they had been successful by land and sea. 7 And so, that other <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, afterwards to be known as <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a>, coming to avenge his father and uncle, entered as it were a new and unimpaired province. After immediately capturing <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> and other cities, not content with having expelled the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>, he made Spain into a province paying tribute to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and subdued all the inhabitants on both sides of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407006WEbr class=place long=0.5741 lat=40.7277>Iberus</a>, and was the first Roman general to reach <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gades</a> and the shores of the Ocean as a conqueror. It is easier to create than to retain a province. 8 Generals were, therefore, sent to deal with the inhabitants in detail, now to this region and now to that, who, with much toil and after sanguinary encounters, taught submission to savage races who had hitherto been free and were, therefore, impatient of the yoke. 9 <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, the well-known censor, broke the resistance of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403-29RCel class=ethnic long=-2.9 lat=40.32>Celtiberians</a>, the flower of Spanish manhood, in several battles. <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a>, the famous father of the <a href=/people/1832 target=_blank>Gracchi</a>, punished the same race by the destruction of a hundred and fifty cities. 10 <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, who had won in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> the title of Macedonicus, deserved also that of Celtibericus, after he had achieved a notable exploit in the capture of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415000UCon class=place long=-1.0271 lat=41.5131>Contrebia</a> and had gained still greater glory by sparing <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415000UNer class=place long=-1.3646 lat=41.5021>Nertobriga</a>. 11 <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> conquered the <a href=/people/12086 target=_blank>Turduli</a> and <a href=/people/12070 target=_blank>Vaccaei</a>, from whom the younger <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> had won the spolia opima in a single combat to which their king had challenged him. 12 <a href=/people/11075 target=_blank>Decimus Brutus</a> conquered a much wider district, which included the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-83RLus class=ethnic long=-8.3 lat=39>Lusitanians</a> and all the peoples of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426-80RGal class=place long=-8 lat=42.6>Callaecia</a> and the River of <a href=/people/1072 target=_blank>Oblivion</a>, much dreaded by the soldiers, and, after marching victorious along the shores of the Ocean, did not turn back until, not without a certain dread of impiety and a feeling of awe, he beheld the sun sinking into the sea and its fires quenched in the waters. <br /> 13 But the chief trouble in the contest lay with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-83RLus class=ethnic long=-8.3 lat=39>Lusitanians</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418000UNum class=ethnic long=-2.4442 lat=41.8095>Numantines</a>, and not without reason; for they were the only Spanish tribe that possessed leaders. There would have been trouble also with all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403-29RCel class=ethnic long=-2.9 lat=40.32>Celtiberians</a> had not the leader of their rising, Olyndicus — a man of great craft and daring, if only fortune had favoured him — been put out of the way early in the war. 14 This man, brandishing a silver spear which he claimed had been sent from heaven, and behaving like a prophet, had attracted general attention; but having, with corresponding temerity, approached the consul's camp under the cover of night, he ended his career by the javelin of a sentry close to the very tent of the consul. 15 The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-83RLus class=ethnic long=-8.3 lat=39>Lusitanians</a> were stirred to revolt by Viriatus, a man of extreme cunning, who from being a hunter became a brigand, and from a brigand suddenly became a leader and general, and, if fortune had favoured him, would have become the <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> of Spain. Not content with defending the liberty of his countrymen, for fourteen years he laid waste with fire and sword all the land on both sides of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407006WEbr class=place long=0.5741 lat=40.7277>Iberus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-89WTag class=place long=-8.9819 lat=38.9536>Tagus</a>; 16 attacked the camps of the praetors and the Roman garrisons; defeated <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> Unimanus, almost completely exterminating his army; and fixed up in his native mountains trophies adorned with the official robes and fasces which he had captured from us. 17 At last <a href=/people/11073 target=_blank>Fabius Maximus</a> had overcome him also; but his victory was spoilt by the conduct of his successor <a href=/people/677 target=_blank>Popilius</a>, who, in his eagerness to finish the campaign, assailed the enemy leader, when he was already defeated and was contemplating the final step of surrender, by craft and stratagem and private assassins, and so gave him the credit of seeming to have been invincible by any other method. </p>                        </div>

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418000UNum class=ethnic long=-2.4442 lat=41.8095>Numantines</a> had harboured their allies and kinsmen the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384-65USeg class=ethnic long=-6.5893 lat=38.3785>Segidians</a> who had escaped from the hands of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. 4 The intercession which they made on their behalf produced no result. When they offered to withdraw from all participation in the war, they were ordered to lay down their arms as the price of a regular treaty. This demand was interpreted by the barbarians as equivalent to the cutting off of their hands; and so they immediately had recourse to arms under the leadership of the brave Megaravicus. They attacked <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, but, when they might have utterly defeated him, they preferred to conclude a treaty. They next attacked <a href=/people/779 target=_blank>Hostilius</a> <a href=/people/1752 target=_blank>Mancinus</a>; 5 him too they reduced by inflicting continual losses upon him, so that no one could endure even to look in the eyes or hear the voice of a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418000UNum class=demonym long=-2.4442 lat=41.8095>Numantine</a>. 6 Nevertheless, when they might have wreaked their fury in wholesale destruction, they preferred to make a treaty with him, being content to despoil his men of their arms. 7 But the Roman people, as much incensed at the dishonour and shame of this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418000UNum class=demonym long=-2.4442 lat=41.8095>Numantine</a> treaty as they had been at that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411147LCaF class=place long=14.5398 lat=41.0302>Caudine Forks</a>, wiped out the disgrace of the disaster of the moment by surrendering <a href=/people/1752 target=_blank>Mancinus</a> to the enemy, 8 and then, under the leadership of <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, who had been trained for the destruction of cities by the burning of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, at last their desire for vengeance burst into flames. At first he had a harder struggle in the camp than in the field, 9 and more with our own soldiers than with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418000UNum class=ethnic long=-2.4442 lat=41.8095>Numantines</a>; 10 for, worn out with continual, excessive and, for the most part, servile tasks, on the ground that they did not know how to fight they were ordered to carry more than the usual number of stakes, and because they refused to stain themselves with blood, they were bidden to befoul themselves with mud. In addition to this, the women and camp-followers and all the baggage except what was absolutely necessary were dispensed with. 11 It is a true proverb which says that a general has the army which he deserves. The troops having been thus reduced to discipline, a battle was fought, and the sight of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418000UNum class=ethnic long=-2.4442 lat=41.8095>Numantines</a> in flight, which no one had even expected to see, was actually realized. 12 They were willing to surrender if conditions were imposed to which men of spirit could submit. But since <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> desired a complete and unqualified victory, they were first reduced to the necessity of rushing into the fray resolved to die, after they had first gorged themselves with, as it were, a funeral banquet of half-raw flesh and caelia, a name which they give to a local drink made from corn. 13 Their intention was perceived by the general, and so, ready though they were to die, no opportunity was given them of fighting. When famine pressed hard upon them — for they were surrounded by a trench and breastwork and four camps — they begged the general to allow them to engage him, so that he might slay them like men, and, when their request was refused, they determined to make a sortie. 14 This resulted in a battle in which very many of them were slain and, as hunger pressed them hard, they lived for a while on the dead bodies.11 Finally, they made up their minds to flee, but this was prevented by their wives, who cut the girths of their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> — a grievous wrong, but due to their affection. 15 Despairing, therefore, of escape and in a revulsion of rage and fury, they, at last, under the leadership of Rhoecogenes, made an end of themselves, their families and their native city with the sword, with poison and with general conflagration. 16 All glory to a brave city, a city blessed, so it seems to me, even in its misfortunes; for it loyally helped its allies and with so small a force withstood for so long a period a people which was supported by the resources of the whole world.

Only the name of the city remained over which they could triumph. <br /> 19 Hitherto the Roman people had been glorious, illustrious, humane, upright and high-minded; the rest of their history during this period, though equally grand, was more disturbed and disgraced by the vices which increased with the very greatness of their empire; 2 so much so that, if one were to subdivide this third age, which saw conquests beyond the seas and to which we have allotted two hundred years, he would reasonably and justly admit that the first hundred years, during which they subdued Africa, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and Spain, might be named, in the language of the poets, golden, 3 and the following hundred years an age of iron and bloodshed or whatever is still more terrible. For these years included not only the Jugurthine, <a href=/people/946 target=_blank>Cimbrian</a>, <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridatic</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> and <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>piratical</a> wars, and the wars in Gaul and <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a> (when the glory of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> rose to the very heavens), but the murders of the <a href=/people/1832 target=_blank>Gracchi</a> and <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>, and also the wars against the slaves, and also (that nothing might be wanting to their infamy) those against the gladiators. 4 Lastly, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, turning upon themselves, as though in madness and fury, rent themselves to pieces — a crime indeed — by the hands of the Marian and Sullan parties, and finally by those of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. 5 These events, though they are closely connected and involved with one another, nevertheless, in order that they may be set forth more clearly, and also that the crimes may not obscure the virtues, shall be related separately. And so, in the first place, in accordance with our original plan, we will describe the just and honourable wars waged against foreign nations, in order that that greatness of the daily increasing empire may be made manifest; and afterwards we will turn to the crimes and to the disgraceful and impious struggles of the citizens amongst themselves. </p>                        </div>

Who, after the fate of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, could expect another war to arise in Africa? 2 Yet <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a> bestirred herself in a serious effort, and there was something in <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> to make him an object of dread as the successor of <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>. This crafty king used his wealth to attack the Roman people when they were invincible with arms. Contrary to general expectation, fate decreed that a king pre-eminent in stratagem should himself be ensnared by a stratagem. 3 <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a>, the grandson of <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Massinissa</a> and the adopted son of <a href=/people/3893 target=_blank>Micipsa</a>, having, in his hurry to possess kingly power, determined to put his brothers to death, was less afraid of them than of the Roman senate and people, in whose allegiance and under whose protection the kingdom then was; he, therefore, relied on treachery in the commission of his first crime. 4 Having possessed himself of the head of <a href=/people/3187 target=_blank>Hiempsal</a>, he had turned his attention to <a href=/people/2581 target=_blank>Adherbal</a>, who had fled to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and sending ambassadors with money he won over the senate to his side. This was his first victory over us. 5 Adopting similar methods with the commissioners who had been sent to partition the kingdom between him and <a href=/people/2581 target=_blank>Adherbal</a>, and having carried by assault the very embodiment of the character of the Roman Empire by bribing <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a>, he trusted to audacity to complete the evil with which he had begun. 6 But crimes do not long remain undetected. The scandal of the bribed commission came to light, and it was resolved to begin hostilities against the murderer of his own kinsman. 7 The consul <a href=/people/1017 target=_blank>Calpurnius</a> <a href=/people/3782 target=_blank>Bestia</a> was the first general to be sent against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a>; but the king, who knew by experience that gold was more efficacious against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> than steel, purchased peace from him. 8 <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a>, being accused of this criminal action and having been summoned to appear before the senate under promise of safe-conduct, showed equal effrontery in coming to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and sending an assassin and murdering Massiva, his rival for the throne. 9 This act was an additional pretext for war against the king. The vengeance that was to follow was entrusted to <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>. But his brother too (shameful to relate) so corrupted the army that, through the spontaneous flight of our troops, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=demonym long=3 lat=36>Numidian</a> was victorious and gained possession of our camp. This was followed by a disgraceful treaty fixing the terms of their safety, under which he allowed the armies which he had brought to depart. 10 At last <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> arose to defend not so much the might as the honour of the Roman Empire. With great skill he used their own wiles against the enemy, who sought to delude him now with entreaties and now with threats, at one moment by pretended and at another by actual flight. 11 Not content with laying waste the fields and villages, he attacked the principal cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a>. He was unsuccessful indeed in his assault upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361093UZam class=place long=9.2853 lat=36.1119>Zama</a>, but plundered Thala, a storehouse of arms and royal treasures. 12 He then pursued the king, stripped of his cities and now a fugitive from his country and kingdom, through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=place long=-5 lat=35>Mauretania</a> and <a href=/people/12044 target=_blank>Gaetulia</a>. 13 Finally, <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> with considerably increased forces (for, acting as one would expect a low-born man to act, he had forced the lowest class of citizens to enlist), though he attacked the king when he was already routed and wounded, did not, however, defeat him any more easily than if his strength had been fresh and unimpaired. 14 <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> not only captured, by a wonderful stroke of good fortune, the city of Capsa founded by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> in the middle of Africa, defended by waterless tracts, <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> and sand, but he also penetrated, thanks to a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=demonym long=8.3 lat=44.3>Ligurian</a> soldier, to Molucha, a city built on a rocky height, the approach to which was steep and inaccessible. 15 Presently he defeated not only <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> himself but also <a href=/people/1442 target=_blank>Bocchus</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=place long=-5 lat=35>Mauretania</a>, who from ties of kinship was supporting the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a>, near the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364066UCir class=place long=6.6125 lat=36.3682>Cirta</a>. 16 <a href=/people/1442 target=_blank>Bocchus</a>, apprehensive about his own interests and afraid of being involved in another's ruin, offered the person of <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> as the price of a treaty and friendship. 17 Thus the most treacherous of kings was entrapped by the treachery of his own father-in-law and handed over to <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, and at last the Roman people saw <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> led in triumph loaded with chains; 18 and he himself, too, conquered and in chains, saw the city of which he had vainly prophesied that it could be bought and would one day perish if it could find a purchaser. In <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> it had a purchaser — if it had been for sale; but once it had escaped his hands, it was certain that it was not doomed to perish. </p>                        </div>

The most conspicuous figure in the triumph was King <a href=/people/7383 target=_blank>Bituitus</a> himself, in his vari-coloured arms and silver chariot, just as he had appeared in battle. 6 The great joy caused by both these victories may be judged from the fact that both <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> <a href=/people/1039 target=_blank>Ahenobarbus</a> and <a href=/people/11073 target=_blank>Fabius Maximus</a> set up towers of stone on the actual sites of the battles which they had fought, and fixed on the top of them trophies adorned with the enemy's arms.

Thus repulsed they began to seek by force of arms what they had failed to obtain by entreaties. 4 <a href=/people/816 target=_blank>Silanus</a> could not withstand the first attack of the barbarians, nor <a href=/people/1949 target=_blank>Manilius</a> the second, nor <a href=/people/1001 target=_blank>Caepio</a> the third; they were all routed and the camps captured. 5 There would have been an end of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> if that age had not had the good fortune to possess <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>. Even he did not dare to meet the enemy immediately, but kept his soldiers in camp until the irresistible fury and rage, which in barbarians takes the place of courage, spent itself. 6 The barbarians, therefore, made off, jeering at our men and — such was their confidence that they would capture <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> — advising them to give them any messages which they had for their wives.

It is uncertain whether the general acted designedly or whether he converted a mistake into a stratagem; at any rate the valour of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> under the constraint of necessity gave them victory. 9 For when the men demanded water, <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> replied, If you are men, there it is yonder for you. With such ardour, then, did they fight and such was the slaughter of the enemy that the victorious <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> drank as much barbarian gore as water from the blood-stained stream. 10 Their king, Teutobodus himself, who had been accustomed to vault over four or even six <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, could scarcely find one to mount when he fled, and having been captured in a neighbouring forest was a striking figure in the triumphal procession; for, being a man of extraordinary stature, he towered above the trophies of his defeat. <br /> 11 The <a href=/people/4314 target=_blank>Teutones</a> having been thus absolutely destroyed, attention was next directed to the <a href=/people/946 target=_blank>Cimbri</a>. This people, though it is scarcely credible, had already descended during the winter (which increases the height of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a>) from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/461111UTri class=demonym long=11.1206 lat=46.0697>Tridentine</a> ranges like an avalanche into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. 12 Attempting at first to cross the river Atesis, not by a bridge or in boats, but, with the stupidity of barbarians, by swimming, when they had vainly tried to stem the current with their hands and shields, they blocked it by hurling trees into it, and so crossed. 13 If they had immediately marched upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> with hostile intent, the danger would have been great; but in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/457120REne class=place long=12.01 lat=45.7>Venetia</a>, a district in which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> climate is almost at its softest, the very mildness of the country and of the air sapped their vigour. When they had been further demoralized by the use of bread and cooked meat and the delights of wine, <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> opportunely approached them. 14 They came of their own accord — for the barbarians have no trace of fear — and asked our general to name a day for the battle; and so he appointed the morrow. The armies met in a very wide plain which they call the Raudian Plain. On the side of the enemy 65,000 men fell, on our side less than 300; the slaughter of the barbarians continued all day. 15 On this occasion too our general had added craft to courage, imitating <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> and his stratagem at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413162UCan class=place long=16.1515 lat=41.2964>Cannae</a>. For, in the first place, the day he had chosen was misty, so that he could charge the enemy unawares, and it was also windy, so that the dust was driven into the eyes and faces of the enemy; finally, he had drawn up his line facing the west, so that, as was afterwards learned from the prisoners, the sky seemed to be on fire with the glint reflected from the bronze of the Roman helmets. 16 There was quite as severe a struggle with the women-folk of the barbarians as with the men; for they had formed a barricade of their waggons and carts and, mounting on the top of it, fought with axes and pikes. 17 Their death was as honourable as their resistance; for when, after sending a delegation to <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, they had failed to secure their liberty and to be made priestesses — a request which could not lawfully be granted — they strangled all their infants or dashed them to pieces, and themselves either fell by wounds inflicted by one another, or else, making ropes of their own hair, hanged themselves on trees or the yokes of their waggons. 18 Their king Boiorix fell fighting energetically in the forefront of the battle, and not without having inflicted vengeance on his foes. <br />The third body, consisting of the Tigurini, who had taken up their position as a reserve force among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/470150RNor class=demonym long=15 lat=47>Norican</a> ranges of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a>, dispersing in different directions, resorted to ignoble flight and depredations and finally vanished away. 19 The joyful and happy news of the deliverance of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and the salvation of the empire was received by the Roman people not, as usual, through human agency but from the lips of the gods themselves, if we may believe the tale. 20 For on the same day as that on which the battle was fought, young men were seen to present to the praetor a despatch decked with laurels in front of temple of <a href=/people/327 target=_blank>Pollux</a> and <a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a>, and the rumour of a victory over the <a href=/people/946 target=_blank>Cimbri</a> spread far and wide through the theatre. . . .8 exclaimed, May it be a good omen. 21 What could be more wonderful or remarkable than this? For just as though <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, raised aloft on her hills, was present watching the battle, the people in the city were raising the usual applause which is given at a gladiatorial show at the very moment when the <a href=/people/946 target=_blank>Cimbri</a> were falling on the field of battle. </p>                        </div>

The earliest king of these regions and races was <a href=/people/320 target=_blank>Aeetes</a>, after him came <a href=/people/7305 target=_blank>Artabazes</a>, who was sprung from one of the seven <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, and then came <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, by far the greatest of their rulers; 2 for, while four years sufficed to defeat <a href=/people/85 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> and thirteen to defeat <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>, <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> resisted for forty years, until, defeated in three great wars, he was brought to nought by the good fortune of <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, the valour of <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> and the might of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. 3 He had alleged to our ambassador <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> as the cause of the war that his frontiers were being violated by <a href=/people/349 target=_blank>Nicomedes</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a>; but, in fact, carried away by boundless ambition, he was consumed by a burning desire to possess himself of all <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> and, if he could, of Europe also. 4 Our weaknesses gave him hope and confidence; for a tempting opportunity was offered while we were preoccupied by civil wars, and the activities of <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> and <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> made it known far and wide that the flank of the empire was unprotected. 5 While the State was thus wounded and distracted, suddenly, as though it had chosen the opportune moment, the tempest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=demonym long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontic</a> war broke forth from the furthest outpost of the North against a people who were both weary and preoccupied. <br /> 6 The first assault immediately won <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a>; whereupon <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> was seized by a general panic, and without delay our cities and peoples revolted to the king. 7 He was on the spot, he was insistent, he practised cruelty as though it were a virtue. For what could be more outrageous than that one decree of his by which he gave orders for the murder of all those in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> who were of Roman citizenship? At the same time the sanctity of private houses, temples and altars, and all laws, human and divine, were violated. 8 The alarm thus inspired in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> also opened to the king the gates of Europe. He, therefore, sent his generals, <a href=/people/12355 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> and <a href=/people/385 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a>, and (except <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>, which supported us more loyally than ever) all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372248RKyk class=place long=24.8 lat=37.2>Cyclades</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> itself, the glory of Greece, were occupied. 9 The dread of the king now spread to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> itself. Our great commander, <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, therefore, hastened to oppose him and, as he advanced with violence unabated, stayed his further progress by, as it were, a mere gesture of the hand. 10 First, he compelled <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, where corn was first discovered, by siege and famine (the story is scarcely credible) to feed on human flesh; then the harbour of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Piraeus</a>, surrounded by six or more walls, was destroyed. When he had subdued the most ungrateful of men, he nevertheless (to use his own words) spared them because of their shrines and past glory, as an act of respect towards their dead forefathers. 11 Then, when he had driven the king's garrisons out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a>, he scattered the whole of his forces in one battle at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385228PCha class=place long=22.8416 lat=38.4944>Chaeronea</a> and in another at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385230POrc class=place long=22.9641 lat=38.4956>Orchomenus</a>, and then, immediately crossing over into <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, overwhelmed the king himself. The war would have been brought to an end if <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> had not preferred a speedy rather than a thorough triumph over <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>. 12 The following was the state of affairs which <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> had established in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>: a treaty was made with the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>; <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a> was handed over by <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> to <a href=/people/349 target=_blank>Nicomedes</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a> to <a href=/people/642 target=_blank>Ariobarzanes</a>, <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> was again ours, as before; but <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> had been only repulsed. This condition of affairs, so far from breaking the spirit of the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>, only inflamed them; 13 for the king, lured on as it were by the bait of <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> and Europe, now sought to recover them by right of arms, as though they did not belong to others but had been snatched from him, because he had failed to retain his conquests. 14 And so, just as fire not wholly extinguished bursts forth again into greater flames, so <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, with greatly increased forces and indeed with the whole weight of his kingdom, overran <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> afresh by land and sea and river. <br /> 15 The noble city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404279UCyz class=place long=27.8878 lat=40.3895>Cyzicus</a> with its citadel, walls, harbour and marble towers is the glory of the coast of <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>. This he had attacked with all his forces, as though it were a second <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. 16 But a messenger who, by an extraordinary feat, had made his way through the midst of the enemy's fleet buoyed up by an inflated skin, steering with his feet and presenting to distant observers the appearance of some sea-monster, had inspired the townspeople with confidence to resist by the news of <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>' approach. 17 Soon afterwards, when ill-fortune went over to the king's side and, owing to the length of the siege, famine afflicted him and pestilence as a result of famine, he retreated. <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> followed him and dealt him so heavy a blow that the rivers <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403273WGra class=place long=27.2716 lat=40.3067>Granicus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403278WAis class=place long=27.6022 lat=40.2674>Aesepus</a> ran with blood. 18 The crafty king, who had had experience of Roman avarice, ordered that gold and money should be scattered in their path by his flying troops in order to delay his pursuers. His flight by sea was no more fortunate than by land; for a tempest which arose in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Black Sea</a> attacked his fleet of more than a hundred ships laden with material of war, 19 and shattered them with such terrible loss as to produce the effect of a naval defeat and make it appear as if <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, by some compact with the waves and storms, had handed over the king to the wind to be defeated. 20 All the resources of his powerful kingdom were now exhausted, but his misfortunes only served to raise his spirit. 21 Turning, therefore, to the neighbouring peoples he involved almost the whole of the East and the North in his ruin. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420435RIbe class=ethnic long=43.5 lat=42>Iberians</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400516WHyr class=ethnic long=51.6 lat=40>Caspians</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407465RAlb class=ethnic long=46.5 lat=40.7>Albanians</a>, and both the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> peoples were rallied to his cause, <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> thus seeking fresh opportunities to win honour, fame and new titles of glory for her favourite <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. 22 He, seeing that fresh flames of rebellion were being kindled in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> and that one king after another was rising, considered that he ought not to delay, and before the nations could consolidate their strength, built a bridge of boats over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>, and was the first to cross that river by this means, and coming up with the king as he was fleeing through the middle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a>, defeated him, with his usual good luck, in a single battle. 23 The engagement took place at night, and the moon took sides in it; for when the goddess, as if fighting on <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>' side, had placed herself behind the enemy and facing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> aimed at their own unusually long shadows, thinking that they were the bodies of their foes. 24 That night saw the final defeat of <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>; for he never again effected anything, although, like a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a>, which, though its head is crushed, threatens to the last with its tail, he tried every expedient. 25 For, after escaping from the enemy to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=ethnic long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchians</a>, he formed a plan (though it remained only a plan) of bridging the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411291WBos class=place long=29.0753 lat=41.1194>Bosporus</a> and then crossing through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> and Greece and making a sudden inroad in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>; 26 but, baulked by the desertion of his subjects and the treachery of his son <a href=/people/452 target=_blank>Pharnaces</a>, he ended by the sword a life which he had in vain tried to destroy with poison. <br /> 27 Meanwhile Gnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> Magnus, pursuing the remnants of rebellious <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, was hastening through nations and lands lying far apart. Following the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a> eastward he captured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399446UArt class=place long=44.5794 lat=39.8865>Artaxata</a>, the very capital of that race, and bade <a href=/people/12245 target=_blank>Tigranes</a>, who implored his pardon, retain his kingdom. 28 To the North, following the route to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a> by the stars, as sailors steer at sea, he defeated the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=ethnic long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchians</a>, pardoned the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420435RIbe class=ethnic long=43.5 lat=42>Iberians</a>, and spared the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407465RAlb class=ethnic long=46.5 lat=40.7>Albanians</a>. Having pitched his camp at the very foot of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>, he ordered their king, <a href=/people/2010 target=_blank>Orodes</a>, to descend into the plain, while he commanded Arthoces, who was ruler of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420435RIbe class=ethnic long=43.5 lat=42>Iberians</a>, to hand over his children as hostages; he even rewarded <a href=/people/2010 target=_blank>Orodes</a>, who actually sent a golden bed and other gifts from his kingdom of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407465RAlb class=place long=46.5 lat=40.7>Albania</a>. 29 Furthermore, turning his army southwards, he passed through the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/339358LLib class=place long=35.765 lat=33.925>Lebanon</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> and through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335363UDam class=place long=36.311 lat=33.509>Damascus</a>, and bore the Roman standards through the famous scented groves and woods of frankincense and balm. He found the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabs</a> ready to carry out any orders which he might give. 30 The <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> attempted to defend <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>; but this also he entered and saw the great secret of that impious nation laid open to view, the heavens beneath a golden vine.4 Being appointed arbitrator between the two brothers who were disputing the throne, he decided in favour of <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> and threw <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> into prison, because he was seeking to restore his power. 31 Thus the Roman people, under the leadership of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, traversed the whole of <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> in its widest extent and made what had been the furthest province into a central province;5 for with the exception of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, who preferred to make a treaty, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, who as yet knew nothing of us, all <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> between the Red and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400516WHyr class=demonym long=51.6 lat=40>Caspian</a> Seas and the Ocean was in our power, conquered or overawed by the arms of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. </p>                        </div>

nor did the enemy refuse an engagement, 13 though their boldness seemed to be inspired not so much by confidence as by the knowledge that they were hard pressed. However, they did no more than meet the first onslaught; for as soon as they saw the beaks of our ships all round them, they immediately threw down their weapons and oars, and with a general clapping of hands, which was their sign of entreaty, begged for quarter. 14 We never gained so bloodless a victory, and no nation was afterwards found more loyal to us. This was secured by the remarkable wisdom of our commander, who removed this maritime people far from the sight of the sea and bound it down to the cultivation of the inland districts, thus at the same time recovering the use of the sea for shipping and restoring to the land its proper cultivators. 15 In this victory what is most worthy of admiration? Its speedy accomplishment — for it was gained in forty days — or the good fortune which attended it — for not a single ship was lost — or its lasting effect — for there never were any <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> again? </p>                        </div>

In this, while there were many notable exploits on the part of Roman soldiers, a remarkable feat was performed by the general himself; for when his troops were wavering and on the point of retiring, snatching a shield out of the hand of a retreating soldier, he rushed to the front line and by his own efforts restored the battle. 5 Next came a naval war with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/477-28UVen class=ethnic long=-2.7568 lat=47.6579>Veneti</a>; but it was a struggle rather against the ocean than against the enemy's fleet. For their vessels were rude and clumsy and went to pieces as soon as they had felt the beaks of our ships; but the battle was obstructed by the shallow water, since the ocean, retiring with usual fall of tide in the very middle of the engagement, seemed to take part in the struggle. 6 The operations of the war varied with the nature of the people and the country. The crafty <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450010RAqu class=ethnic long=1 lat=45>Aquitani</a> betook themselves to caves; <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> ordered that they should be blockaded there. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/506023UMor class=ethnic long=2.2584 lat=50.6364>Morini</a> scattered amongst their forests; <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> ordered that the forests should be burnt. Let no one say that the Gauls are mere savages, for they can act with cunning. 7 <a href=/people/12023 target=_blank>Indutiomarus</a> stirred up the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/498066UCol class=ethnic long=6.644 lat=49.7597>Treveri</a>, <a href=/people/12026 target=_blank>Ambiorix</a> the <a href=/people/9292 target=_blank>Eburones</a>. In <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s absence these two tribes banded together and attacked the lieutenant-generals. <a href=/people/12023 target=_blank>Indutiomarus</a> was bravely repulsed by <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>, and his head was brought back to the camp. 8 <a href=/people/12026 target=_blank>Ambiorix</a>, however, defeated us by the stratagem of an ambush set in a valley, with the result that our camp was plundered and we lost the lieutenant-generals <a href=/people/2839 target=_blank>Aurunculeius</a> <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a> and <a href=/people/6029 target=_blank>Titurius</a> <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a>.

When our ambassadors told him to come to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, he replied, Who is <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>? Let him come to me if he likes: what does it matter to him what we in <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a> do? 12 Do I interfere with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>? So great was the alarm inspired in the camp by this unknown people, that there was a general making of wills even in the camp square. But the vaster the stature of our enemies, the more were they exposed to our swords and other weapons. 13 The ardour of our soldiers in the fray cannot be better illustrated than by the fact that, when the barbarians protected themselves by forming a tortoise with their shields raised over their heads, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> actually leaped on the top of the shields and from there fell upon their throats with their swords. 14 Further complaints against the Germans were brought by the <a href=/people/12166 target=_blank>Tencteri</a>. On this occasion <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> took the initiative and crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/497066WMos class=place long=6.6265 lat=49.7338>Moselle</a> by a bridge of boats and made for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> itself and the enemy in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/484084RHer class=place long=8.35 lat=48.35>Hercynian forest</a>s; but the whole tribe had fled away to their woods and marshes, so great was the panic caused by the appearance of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> on the further bank of the river. 15 Nor was this the only occasion on which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> was crossed, but he penetrated across it a second time by a bridge which he had built. The alarm of the enemy was ever greater this time; for when they saw their <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> placed as it were a prisoner under the yoke of the bridge, they fled again to their woods and marshes and, to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s bitter disappointment, no enemy remained to be conquered. <br /> 16 Having penetrated everywhere by land and sea, he turned his gaze towards the ocean and, as if this world of ours sufficed not for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, set his thoughts on another. He, therefore, collected a fleet and crossed over to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a> with wonderful speed; for starting from the harbour of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/506023UMor class=ethnic long=2.2584 lat=50.6364>Morini</a> at the third watch he disembarked upon the island before midday. 17 The shores were crowded with a confused throng of the enemy, and their chariots were hurrying to and fro in panic at the strange sight before their eyes. This panic was as good as a victory for <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, who received arms and hostages from his frightened foes and would have advanced further if the ocean had not taken vengeance on his presumptuous fleet by wrecking it. 18 He, therefore, returned to Gaul and then, with a larger fleet and increased forces, made another attempt against the same ocean and the same <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=ethnic long=-1.5 lat=53>Britons</a>. Having pursued them into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/571-47RCal class=demonym long=-4.672 lat=57.145>Caledonian</a> forests, he made one of their kings, Casuellanus, a prisoner. 19 Content with these achievements (for he sought a reputation rather than a province) he returned with greater spoil than before, the very ocean showing itself more calm and propitious, as though it confessed itself unequal to opposing him. <br /> 20 The greatest, and at the same time the last, of all the risings in Gaul, took place when <a href=/people/8482 target=_blank>Vercingetorix</a>, a chief formidable alike for his stature, his skill in arms, and his courage, endowed too with a name which seemed to be intended to inspire terror, formed a league alike of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458031UAug class=ethnic long=3.0858 lat=45.7787>Arverni</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/471024UAva class=ethnic long=2.3992 lat=47.0822>Bituriges</a>, 21 and at the same time of the Carnuntes and <a href=/people/12012 target=_blank>Sequani</a>. He at their festivals and councils, when he found them collected in their greatest crowds in their groves, roused them by his ferocious harangues to vindicate their ancient rights of freedom. 22 <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was absent at the time holding a levy at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> had been swollen by winter snows; hence they thought that his passage was blocked. But <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, starting just as he was on the receipt of the news, by a most successful act of daring made his way across Gaul with a light-armed force through ranges of mountains never before crossed and over ways and snows never trodden before, and collected his troops from distant winter quarters and was in the middle of Gaul before the terror of his approach had reached its borders. 23 Attacking the cities which were the headquarters of the enemy's forces, he burnt to the ground <a about=https://topostext.org/place/471024UAva class=place long=2.3992 lat=47.0822>Avaricum</a>, which was defended by 40,000 men, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475045XAle class=place long=4.5001 lat=47.5393>Alesia</a>, which had a garrison of 250,. 24 All the most important operations were concentrated round <a about=https://topostext.org/place/457031XGer class=place long=3.1189 lat=45.7201>Gergovia</a> in the territory of the Averni. This mighty city, defended by a wall and citadel and steep river-banks, had a garrison of 80,000 men. 25 <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, surrounding it with a rampart, a palisade and a trench, into which he admitted water from the river, and also eighteen towers and a huge breastwork, first reduced it by starvation; and then, when the defenders attempted to make sallies, cut them down at the ramparts and palisades, and finally reduced them to surrender. 26 The king himself, to crown the victory, came as a suppliant to the camp, and placing before <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and its trapping and his own arms, exclaimed, Receive these spoils; thou thyself, bravest of men, hast conquered a brave enemy. </p>                        </div>

In the first place, <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> deserted the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>, which provided the sole means of transporting his supplies and protecting his rear, trusting to the advice of a pretended deserter, a certain Syrian named Mazaras. 7 Next, again under the same guidance, the army was conducted into the midst of vast plains, to be exposed to enemy attacks from every side. 8 And so he had scarcely reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369390UCar class=place long=39.031 lat=36.864>Carrhae</a>, when the king's generals, Silaces and <a href=/people/8352 target=_blank>Surenas</a>, displayed all around him their standards fluttering with gold and silken pennons; then without delay the cavalry, pouring round on all sides, showered their weapons as thick as hail or rain upon them. Thus the army was destroyed in lamentable slaughter. 9 The consul himself, invited to a parley, would on a given signal have fallen alive into the hands of the enemy, had not the barbarians, owing to the resistance of the tribunes, used their swords to prevent his escape.1 10 The general's son they overwhelmed with missiles almost within his father's sight.

It was the conquest of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> which first corrupted us, followed by the Asiatic inheritance bequeathed by the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=place long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamon</a>. 8 The resources and wealth thus acquired spoiled the morals of the age and ruined the State, which was engulfed in its own vices as in a common sewer. For what else caused the Roman people to demand from their tribunes land and food except the scarcity which luxury had produced? Hence arose the first and second Gracchan revolutions and the third raised by <a href=/people/2034 target=_blank>Apuleius</a>. 9 What was the cause of the violent division between the equestrian order and the senate on the subject of the judiciary laws except avarice, in order that the revenues of the State and the law-courts themselves might be exploited for profit? Hence arose the attempt of <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> and the promise of citizenship to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a>, which resulted in war with our allies. 10 Again, what brought the servile wars upon us except the excessive size of our establishments? How else could those armies of gladiators have arisen against their masters, save that a profuse expenditure, which aimed at conciliating the favour of the common people by indulging their love of shows, had turned what was originally a method of punishing enemies into a competition of skill? 11 Again, to touch upon less ugly vices, was not ambition for office also stimulated by wealth? 12 Why, it was from this the Marian and Sullan disturbances arose. Again, were not the sumptuous extravagance of banquets and the profuse largesses due to a wealth which was bound soon to produce want? 13 It was this too that brought <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a> into collision with his country. Finally, whence did the lust for power and domination arise save from excessive wealth? It was this which armed <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> with the fatal torches which kindle the flames that destroyed the State. 14 We will, therefore, now describe in their order all these domestic disturbances as distinct from foreign wars properly so called. </p>                        </div>

There was one, however, who preferred exile, namely, <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>. 3 After his departure, when all the nobility were thoroughly cowed, <a href=/people/2034 target=_blank>Apuleius</a>, now in the third year of his tyranny, became so utterly reckless that he even disturbed the consular elections by a fresh murder. 4 For in order to obtain the election as consul of <a href=/people/2621 target=_blank>Glaucia</a>, a supporter of his insane policy, he ordered the murder of his opponent Gaius <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, and in the confusion which followed, heard himself with pleasure hailed as king by his followers. 5 Then at last the senators leagued themselves against him, and <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> himself, now consul, finding that he could no longer protect him, turned against him, and the two parties faced one another under arms in the forum.

The Roman knights, relying on the extraordinary powers, which placed the fate and fortunes of the leading citizens in their hands, were plundering the State at their pleasure by embezzling the revenues; the senate, crippled by the exile of <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> and the condemnation of <a href=/people/1250 target=_blank>Rutilius</a>, had lost every appearance of dignity. 4 In this state of affairs <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a> <a href=/people/1001 target=_blank>Caepio</a> and <a href=/people/330 target=_blank>Livius</a> <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>, men of equal wealth, spirit and dignity — and it was this which inspired the emulation of <a href=/people/330 target=_blank>Livius</a> <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> — supported, the former the knights, the latter the senate. 5 Standards, <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> and banners were, it is true, lacking; but the citizens of one and the same city were as sharply divided as if they formed two camps.

A saying of his has survived, that he had left nothing for anyone else to distribute, unless he wished to share out the mire or the air. 7 The day for the promulgation of the bills was at hand, when on a sudden so vast a multitude appeared on all sides that the city seemed to be beset by a hostile force. 8 <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a> the consul, nevertheless, ventured to oppose the bills; but the tribune's attendant seized him by the throat and did not let go until blood poured into his mouth and eyes. 9 Thus the bills were brought forward and passed by violence. Thereupon the allies immediately demanded the price of their support; but death carried off <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>, who was unequal to the occasion and weary of the disturbance which he had rashly aroused — a death opportune at such a crisis.

On this occasion, while the State was taken up with the troubles caused by the tribunes, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> was besieged and afterwards rescued by the consul; but it was a local rising rather than a war. It is difficult to believe that, at a later date, while the forces of the empire were engaged in various parts of the world, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> was far more cruelly laid waste in a war against slaves than during the Punic War. 3 This land, so rich in corn, a province lying, as it were, at our very doors, was occupied by large estates in the possession of Roman citizens. The numerous prisons for slaves employed in tilling the soil and gangs of cultivators who worked in chains provided the forces for the war. 4 A certain Syrian named <a href=/people/2048 target=_blank>Eunus</a> (the seriousness of our defeats causes his name to be remembered), counterfeiting an inspired frenzy and waving his dishevelled hair in honour of the Syrian goddess, incited the slaves to arms and liberty on the pretence of a command from the gods. 5 In order to prove that he was acting under divine inspiration, he secreted in his mouth a nut which he had filled with sulphur and fire, and, by breathing gently, sent forth a flame as he spoke. 6 This miracle first of all collected 2,000 men from those whom he encountered, but presently, when the prisons had been broken open by force of arms, he formed an army of more than 60,000 men. Adorning himself — in order to fill up the cup of his wickedness — with the insignia of royalty, he laid waste fortresses, villages and towns with pitiable destruction. 7 Nay, even the camps of the praetors were captured — the most disgraceful thing that can occur in war; nor will I shrink from mentioning the names of these commanders, who were <a href=/people/215 target=_blank>Manlius</a>, <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> and <a href=/people/3859 target=_blank>Hypsaeus</a>. Thus those who ought to have been hauled away by the overseers, themselves pursued praetorian generals in flight from the battle-field. 8 At last punishment was inflicted upon them under the leadership of <a href=/people/3443 target=_blank>Perperna</a>, who, after defeating them and finally besieging them at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376143UEnn class=place long=14.2796 lat=37.5677>Enna</a>, reduced them by famine as effectually as by a plague and requited the surviving marauders with fetters, chains and the cross. He was content with an ovation for his victory over them, so that he might not sully the dignity of a triumph by the mention of slaves. <br /> 9 Scarcely had the island recovered itself, when, in the praetorship of <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a>, the command suddenly passed from the hands of a Syrian into those of a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=demonym long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilician</a>. A shepherd, <a href=/people/5485 target=_blank>Athenio</a>, having murdered his master, released the slaves from their prison and formed them into an organized force. 10 Himself arrayed in a purple robe, carrying a silver sceptre and crowned like a king, he collected an army quite as large as that of his fanatical predecessor, and with even greater energy, on the pretext of avenging him, plundering villages, towns and fortresses, vented his fury with even greater violence upon the slaves than upon their masters, treating them as renegades. 11 He too routed praetorian armies and captured the camps of <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a> and <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>. But Titus <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquilius</a> following the example of <a href=/people/3443 target=_blank>Perperna</a>, reduced the enemy to extremities by cutting off their supplies and easily destroyed their forces in battle when they were reduced by starvation. They would have surrendered, had they not, in their fear of punishment, preferred voluntary death. 12 The penalty could not be inflicted upon their leader, although he fell alive into their hands; for, while the crowd was quarrelling about his apprehension, the prey was torn to pieces in the hands of the disputants. </p>                        </div>

But I know not what name to give to the war which was stirred up at the instigation of <a href=/people/1118 target=_blank>Spartacus</a>; 2 for the common soldiers being slaves and their leaders being gladiators — the former men of the humblest, the latter men of the worst, class — added insult to the injury which they inflicted upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. <br /> 3 <a href=/people/1118 target=_blank>Spartacus</a>, <a href=/people/2859 target=_blank>Crixus</a> and <a href=/people/10889 target=_blank>Oenomaus</a>, breaking out of the gladiatorial school of <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> with thirty or rather more men of the same occupation, escaped from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>. When, by summoning the slaves to their standard, they had quickly collected more than 10,000 adherents, these men, who had been originally content merely to have escaped, soon began to wish to take their revenge also. 4 The first position which attracted them (a suitable one for such ravening monsters) was Mt. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408144LVes class=place long=14.425 lat=40.8216>Vesuvius</a>. Being besieged here by <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> Glabrus, they slid by means of ropes made of vine-twigs through a passage in the hollow of the mountain down into its very depths, and issuing forth by a hidden exit, seized the camp of the general by a sudden attack which he never expected. 5 They then attacked other camps, that of Varenius and afterwards that of Thoranus; and they ranged over the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>.

Failing in this attempt, they finally made a sally and met a death worthy of men, fighting to the death 14 as became those who were commanded by a gladiator. <a href=/people/1118 target=_blank>Spartacus</a> himself fell, as became a general, fighting most bravely in the front rank. </p>                        </div>

On this occasion (alas for the crime of it!) what heroes, what generals they were — <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> and <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, the pride and glory of their age — who even gave the support of their high position to the very worst of misdeeds! <br /> 3 The Marian or Sullan civil war was waged under three different constellations, if I may use the expression. In the first period the conflict was of the nature of a mild and unimportant rising rather than a war, the cruelty being confined to the leaders of the two parties; 4 then it became a more bitter and cruel struggle, in which the victory struck at the very heart of the senate; 5 finally, all the bounds of the rage, not merely of citizen against citizen, but of enemy against enemy, were excelled, the fury of war being supported by all the resources of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and hatred venting its cruelty till none remained to be slain. <br /> 6 The origin and cause of the war was <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>' insatiable desire for office, which led him to seek, by means of the law of <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a>, the province allotted to <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>. The latter, unable to tolerate this injury, immediately wheeled round his legions, and postponing the war against <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, poured his army in two columns through the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LEsq class=place long=12.496 lat=41.895>Esquiline</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPCo class=place long=12.4988 lat=41.9073>Colline Gates</a>. 7 When the consuls <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a> and Albinovanus had thrown their troops in his way, and stones and weapons were being hurled on all sides from the walls, <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> himself also forced a passage by hurling burning brands and occupied the citadel of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, which had escaped capture by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> and Gallic <a about=https://topostext.org/place/482033UAge class=ethnic long=3.284 lat=48.198>Senones</a>, like a victorious general in a captive city. 8 Then after his adversaries had been declared enemies of the State by a decree of the senate, he took violent measures, under the form prescribed by law, against the tribune who was within reach and other members of the opposing faction. <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> saved himself by flight like that of a runaway slave, or rather fate preserved him to fight another day. <br /> 9 In the consulship of <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a> and Gnaeus <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, the flames, which had been imperfectly extinguished, burst forth afresh, owing, indeed, to a difference of opinion between the consuls themselves, when the question of recalling those whom the senate had declared enemies was referred to the people. 10 The assembly met armed with swords, but when those prevailed who preferred peace and quiet, <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a> fled from his country and joined his confederates. <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> returned from Africa, all the greater for his misfortunes, since his imprisonment and chains, his flight and exile had added a certain awe to his high reputation. 11 So at the name of so famous a general men flocked from far and near; recourse was had to the disgraceful expedient of arming slaves and convicts; and the general had no difficulty in finding an army. 12 In thus seeking to return by violence to the country from which he had been driven by violence, <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> might seem to have acted justly, but that he disgraced his cause by cruelty. But returning at enmity with gods and men, he directed his first onslaught against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Ostia</a>, a city dependent upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and her foster-child, which he laid waste with impious destruction. 13 Soon afterwards the city was entered by four detachments distributed under the command of <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a>, <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, <a href=/people/669 target=_blank>Carbo</a> and <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a>. When all <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>' troops had been dislodged from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LJan class=place long=12.4608 lat=41.8913>Janiculum</a>, immediately, at a given signal, they wreaked their fury in the slaughter of the leading citizens with even greater cruelty than even in a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> city. 14 The head of the consul <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a> was displayed on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BRoA class=place long=12.48458 lat=41.89258>Rostra</a>, that of <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, an ex-consul, on <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>' own table. <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and <a href=/people/11019 target=_blank>Fimbria</a> were butchered at the household shrines of their own homes. The elder and younger <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> were slain in the sight of one another. <a href=/people/836 target=_blank>Baebius</a> and <a href=/people/8036 target=_blank>Numitorius</a> were dragged through the forum on the hooks of the executioners. 15 <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a> saved himself from the insults of his enemies by swallowing fire. 16 <a href=/people/2114 target=_blank>Merula</a>, the priest of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, bespattered the visage of the god himself with the blood from his veins. <a href=/people/8810 target=_blank>Ancharius</a> was stabbed in the presence of <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> himself, because, forsooth, when he saluted him, <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> had not stretched out to him the hand which was to decide his fate. 17 All these deaths of senators were the result of <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>' seventh consulship between the 1st and the 9th of January. What would have happened if he had completed his full year of office? <br /> 18 In the consulship of <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> and <a href=/people/1374 target=_blank>Norbanus</a>, the third storm of civil rage broke forth in all its fury. On the one side stood eight legions and 500 cohorts in arms, while on the other side <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> was hastening back from <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> with his victorious army. And, indeed, since <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> had acted so cruelly towards the supporters of <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, what cruelty was needed that <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> might take vengeance upon <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>? 19 Their forces first met at the River <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410139WVol class=place long=13.9399 lat=41.0354>Vulturnus</a> near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>; the whole army of <a href=/people/1374 target=_blank>Norbanus</a> was immediately routed and <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>'s forces were promptly overwhelmed after hopes of peace had been held out to them. 20 Then the consuls, the younger <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> and <a href=/people/669 target=_blank>Carbo</a>, as though despairing of victory and desirous of not perishing unavenged, offered sacrifice beforehand to their own shades with the blood of the senate; the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate-house</a> was besieged and the senators were led out thence for execution as from a prison. 21 What countless deaths took place in the forum, the circus and the innermost recesses of the temples! <a href=/people/1024 target=_blank>Mucius</a> <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a>, the priest of <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a>, clinging to the altar of the goddess, was almost buried in the flames which burnt upon it. 22 <a href=/people/3869 target=_blank>Lamponius</a> and <a href=/people/2191 target=_blank>Telesinus</a>, the leaders of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413148RSam class=ethnic long=14.8 lat=41.3>Samnites</a>, were laying waste <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Etruria</a> with even more brutality than <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> or <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>, and were exacting vengeance on their own account under the pretence of helping their cause. 23 But all the enemy's forces were defeated, those under <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> at Sacriportus, those under <a href=/people/2191 target=_blank>Telesinus</a> at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPCo class=place long=12.4988 lat=41.9073>Colline Gate</a>. However, the end of the fighting was not also the end of the killing; for even after peace was made, swords were drawn and punishment was inflicted upon those who had surrendered voluntarily. 24 The slaughter of more than 70,000 men by <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> at Sacriportus and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPCo class=place long=12.4988 lat=41.9073>Colline Gate</a> was a lesser crime, for it was what one expects in war. But he ordered 4,000 unarmed citizens who had been surrendered to be slain in the Villa Publica.8 25 Do not all these 4,000 slain in peace really outnumber those other 70,? Who can compute the total of those whom anyone, who wished to do so, slew in various parts of the city? At last, when <a href=/people/4532 target=_blank>Fufidius</a> advised that some men ought to be allowed to live in order that <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> might have someone to whom to give orders, that vast proscription-list was put up, and from the flower of the equestrian order and the senate 2,000 men were chosen and condemned to death. It was an edict for which there was no precedent. 26 It would be tedious after this to relate the insulting end of <a href=/people/669 target=_blank>Carbo</a> and <a href=/people/2786 target=_blank>Soranus</a>, the deaths of Plaetorii and Venuleii; how <a href=/people/836 target=_blank>Baebius</a> was torn to pieces, not by the sword, but by men's hands, like a wild beast; and how <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, the brother of the general, after his eyes had been gouged out at the tomb of <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>, was kept alive for some time after his hands and legs had been broken off, so that he might die limb by limb. 27 One could endure the punishment of individuals, but the most renowned towns of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> were put up to auction — <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spoletium</a>, Interamnium, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418129UPra class=place long=12.8924 lat=41.8399>Praeneste</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/438113UFlo class=place long=11.2569 lat=43.7687>Florentia</a>. 28 As for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420139USul class=place long=13.9256 lat=42.0468>Sulmo</a>, an allied and friendly city of long standing, <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, instead of storming or besieging it according to the rules of warfare, committed an act of base injustice in condemning the city and ordering its destruction, even as those who are condemned to death are ordered to be led to execution. </p>                        </div>

I know not whether to call it a war against enemies or a civil war, for it was waged by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390-83RLus class=ethnic long=-8.3 lat=39>Lusitani</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403-29RCel class=ethnic long=-2.9 lat=40.32>Celtiberi</a> under a Roman leader. 2 <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a>, an exile and fugitive from that fatal proscription-list, a man of great, but ill-starred, valour, involved seas and lands in his personal misfortunes. Having tried his fortune at one time in Africa, at another time in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397032IGym class=demonym long=3.25 lat=39.65>Balearic</a> Islands, he extended his plans to include the Ocean and Fortunate Isles, and finally armed Spain. 3 A brave man easily unites with other brave men; and the energy of the Spanish soldiers never appeared to better advantage than under a Roman leader. 4 Yet Spain was not enough for him, and he turned his gaze towards <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> and the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> and helped the king with his fleet. 5 Why should such a general have limited his ambitions, when the Roman State could not withstand him with one general only? 6 Gnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> was therefore sent to help <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>. They wore down his forces, pursuing him over almost the whole of Spain. The fighting continued for a long time, always with doubtful result; and his defeat was due not so much to operations in the field as to the crime and treachery of his own followers. The first engagements were fought by lieutenant-generals, <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> and Thorius commencing operations on one side and the Hirtulei on the other. 7 After the defeat of the latter at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410-41USeg class=place long=-4.1264 lat=40.9501>Segovia</a> and of the former at the River <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372-74WAna class=place long=-7.4182 lat=37.2359>Ana</a>, the generals themselves tried their strength in combat and suffered equal disasters at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396-06UEde class=place long=-0.594 lat=39.6258>Lauro</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392-03USuc class=place long=-0.3868 lat=39.1994>Sucro</a>.

And since the estates of the condemned citizens, assigned to others by <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, though wrongfully seized, were yet held under a form of law, the demand for their restoration undoubtedly tended to disturb the condition of the State now tranquillized. 4 It was expedient, therefore, that the sick and wounded State should by some means of other be allowed to rest, lest its wounds should be torn open by the very attempt to heal them. 5 <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>, therefore, having alarmed the State by his excited harangues, which seemed like a trumpet-call, set out for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Etruria</a> and thence directed his arms and troops against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. 6 But <a href=/people/1512 target=_blank>Lutatius</a> <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a> and Gnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, who had been leaders and standard-bearers under <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>'s domination, had already occupied the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BBMi class=place long=12.4671 lat=41.9352>Mulvian Bridge</a> and the Hill of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LJan class=place long=12.4608 lat=41.8913>Janiculum</a> with another army. 7 Having been immediately driven back by these generals at his first onslaught and declared an enemy by the senate, he fled without further bloodshed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Etruria</a> and thence to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>, where he died of disease and remorse. 8 The victors were content with restoring peace, a thing which has rarely happened in civil wars. </p>                        </div>

A <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a>, a <a href=/people/756 target=_blank>Porcius</a>, a <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, a <a href=/people/965 target=_blank>Cethegus</a>, an <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a>, a Vargunteius and a <a href=/people/1477 target=_blank>Longinus</a> — what men of family and high senatorial distinction! — and <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, too, while actually holding the office of praetor, all these he had as accomplices in his atrocious crimes. 4 Human blood, which they handed round in bowls and drank, was used as a pledge to bind the conspirators together — in itself an act of the utmost wickedness, were not the object for which they drank it still more wicked. 5 There would have been an end of our glorious empire, had not the conspiracy happened to fall into the consulship of <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> and <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, of whom the former by his diligence laid bare the plot, while the latter suppressed it by force of arms. 6 Information about the outrageous crime came to light through <a href=/people/821 target=_blank>Fulvia</a>, a worthless prostitute, but less blameworthy than her patrician associates. 7 The consul, having called the senate together, made a speech against the accused, who was present; but the only result of his action was that his enemy left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and as he went, threatened openly and without disguise that he would extinguish the flames which he had kindled in general ruin. 8 He set out for the army which <a href=/people/215 target=_blank>Manlius</a> had already prepared in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Etruria</a>, intending to march upon the city. <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, prophesying for himself the kingship which the <a href=/people/12187 target=_blank>Sibylline</a> verses foretold should belong to his family, disposed throughout the city men, torches and arms ready for the day prearranged by <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a>. 9 Not content with a conspiracy in which only <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were involved, he incited the representatives of the <a href=/people/11071 target=_blank>Allobroges</a>, who happened to be in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> at the time, to take up arms. The rage for conspiracy would have passed beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> had not a letter from the praetor been intercepted by another betrayal, this time on the part of Volturcius. By <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>'s orders the barbarians were immediately arrested, and the praetor was openly proved guilty in the senate. 10 When the question of punishment was discussed, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> expressed the opinion that the conspirators ought to be spared on account of their position; <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> thought that they ought to be punished in accordance with their crime. 11 There was a general agreement in favour of the latter course, and the traitors were strangled in prison. Though part of the conspiracy was thus put down, <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a> did not abandon his designs; but, as he was marching against the city from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Etruria</a> with hostile intent, he was surprised by the army of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>. 12 The result of the battle showed how desperate was the fighting; not a single one of the enemy survived, and each man's lifeless body covered the spot at which he had taken his post in the battle. <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a> was discovered far in front of his fellows amid the dead bodies of his foes, thus dying a death which would have been glorious if he had thus fallen fighting for his country. </p>                        </div>

If one looks at the ground and space which it covered, it began in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, it next directed its course into Gaul and Spain, and then, returning from the West, settled in full force upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>; thence it suddenly leaped across into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, whence it cast a backward glance upon <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, brooded over Africa, and finally wheeled back into Spain, where at last it died out. 7 But the close of the war did not see the end of party hatred, which did not subside until the rancour of those who had been defeated sated itself with the murder of the victor in the city itself, in the midst of the senate. <br /> 8 The cause of this great calamity was the same which caused all our calamities, namely, excessive good fortune. In the consulship of Quintus <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> and Lucius <a href=/people/847 target=_blank>Afranius</a>, when the majesty of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> held sway throughout the world and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was celebrating in the theatres of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> her recent victories and her triumphs over the peoples of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a>, the excessive power enjoyed by <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> excited, as often happens, a feeling of envy among the ease-loving citizens. 9 <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, because his triumph over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> was shorn of its splendour, and <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, who always looked askance upon those in power, began to decry <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> and clamour against his measures. Annoyance at this drove <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> into opposition and induced him to seek support for his position. 10 <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> happened at this time to be at the height of a reputation due to his birth, wealth and the high offices which he had held, and yet he wished to increase his riches; Gaius <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s fame for eloquence and courage was now enhanced by his tenure of the consulship;5 but <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> occupied a higher position than either of them. 11 <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, therefore, being desirous of winning, <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> of increasing, and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> of retaining his position, and all alike being eager for power, readily came to an agreement to seize the government. 12 So, each striving with the support of the others to win glory for himself, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> entered upon the government of Gaul, <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> upon that of <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> upon that of Spain. They possessed three great armies, and the rule of the whole world was vested in these by association of the three leaders. 13 This domination lasted for ten years in accordance with their compact, because they were restrained by fear of one another. But when <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> had fallen fighting against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, and <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a>, who, as <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s daughter and the wife of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, by this bond of marriage maintained friendly relations between father-in-law and son-in-law, had died, rivalry immediately broke out. 14 <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s power now inspired the envy of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, while <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>' eminence was offensive to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> could not brook an equal or <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> a superior. Oh, the wickedness of it! They strove for the first place, as though the fortunes of a great empire could not find room for both of them. 15 And so, in the consulship of <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> and <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>, the bond of agreement was first broken. The senate — in other words, <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> — began to agitate for the appointment of a successor to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and he was not inclined to object provided that his name should be considered at the coming elections. 16 The granting of the consulship to him in his absence, which the tribunes of the people had recently decreed with the support of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, was now refused through secret machinations on the part of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, and it was urged that he should come and stand as a candidate in accordance with ancient precedent. 17 <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, on the other hand, demanded that the decree should be put into execution, and refused to disband his army unless the compact held good. A decree was, therefore, passed declaring him a public enemy. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, exasperated at this, determined to defend by arms the prizes which he had won by arms. <br /> 18 The first arena of the civil war was <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, the strongholds of which <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> had occupied with light garrisons; but <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s sudden attack carried all before it. 19 The first trumpet-call was sounded at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441126UAri class=place long=12.5753 lat=44.0602>Ariminum</a>; <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a> was driven out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Etruria</a>, <a href=/people/1574 target=_blank>Thermus</a> from <a href=/people/9930 target=_blank>Umbria</a>, <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421138UCor class=place long=13.8422 lat=42.1238>Corfinium</a>.

A shameful tale, he who was but lately head of the senate and arbiter of peace and war fleeing, in a storm-beaten and almost dismantled vessel, over the sea which had been the scene of his triumphs. 21 The flight of the senate from the city was as discreditable as that of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> on his entrance into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> found it almost deserted owing to the fear which he inspired, and made himself consul.7 When the tribunes showed themselves slow in unlocking the sacred treasury, he ordered it to be broken open, thus taking possession of the revenue and inheritance of the Roman people before he assumed the government. <br /> 22 <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> being routed and in flight, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> preferred to set the provinces in order before he pursued him. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>, which insure our corn supply, he secured by his lieutenant-generals. 23 There was no hostility in Gaul, where he himself had established peace. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433054PMas class=place long=5.36 lat=43.3>Marseilles</a>, however, as he was passing through on his way at once attack <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>' armies in Spain, dared to close its gates to him; the luckless city, desirous of peace, became involved in war through its dread of war. But since it was protected by walls, he gave orders that it should be reduced for him in his absence. 24 This, though only a Greek city, failing to justify its reputation for effeminacy, had the courage to break through the enemy's circumvallations and to burn their engines of war and even to engage them at sea. 25 But <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, to whom the operations had been entrusted, defeated and overcame them by land and sea. They quickly surrendered and were deprived of everything which they possessed except the most valued of all their possessions, their liberty. <br /> 26 In Spain an indecisive war with varying success, but without heavy bloodshed, was fought against <a href=/people/1898 target=_blank>Petreius</a> and <a href=/people/847 target=_blank>Afranius</a>, the lieutenant-generals of Gnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, whom, while they were encamped at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416006UIle class=place long=0.6261 lat=41.6178>Ilerda</a> on the river <a href=/people/3250 target=_blank>Sicoris</a>, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> attempted to besiege and cut off from the town. 27 Meanwhile the flooding of the river in the spring prevented him from obtaining supplies; thus his camp was threatened with starvation, and the besieger was himself as it were besieged. 28 When, however, the river resumed its tranquil course and opened the country to ravaging and fighting, he again fiercely attacked the enemy and, when they retreated into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403-29RCel class=place long=-2.9 lat=40.32>Celtiberia</a>, followed them up and reduced them to surrender by ditch and rampart and consequent lack of water. 29 Thus Hither Spain was recovered, nor did Further Spain delay <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> long; for what could one legion do after five had been defeated?

Some rafts sent to his assistance by <a href=/people/6129 target=_blank>Basilus</a> — as good a substitute as he could make for the lack of ships — were captured, as in a net, by means of ropes drawn along under the water, a new device on the part of some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=ethnic long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicians</a> in <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>' service. 33 The tide, however, floated two of them off; but one of them, which carried troops from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458125UOpi class=place long=12.4933 lat=45.7824>Opitergium</a>, went aground on the shallows and provided an incident worthy of record in history.

Sent to recover that province and elated at having routed <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> and put him to flight, he was unable to resist a sudden attack of King <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a> and the Moorish cavalry. A way of flight was open to the defeated general, but shame induced him to share the fate of an army which had been lost through his rashness. <br /> 35 But, <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> now demanding that the destined pair of combatants should meet, <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> had chosen <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> as the scene of operations, and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was not slow to face him. 36 Having set all things in order in his rear, although mid-winter impeded his passage with a storm, he sailed to war, 37 and having pitched his camp at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403195UOri class=place long=19.4297 lat=40.319>Oricum</a> and finding that the absence of part of his army, which had been left behind at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> owing to lack of ships, was delaying operations, he was so impatient that, though a gale was raging at sea, he attempted to cross in the depth of the night alone in a light reconnoitering boat to keep them off. His remark to the master of the vessel, who was alarmed at the greatness of the risk, has come down to us: Why are you afraid? You have <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> on board. 38 All their forces having been collected together from every side and their camps pitched close to one another, the plans of the two generals were very different. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, naturally aggressive and eager to obtain a decision, displayed his troops in line of battle and provoked and challenged the enemy. 39 At one time he blockaded <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>' camp, which he had surrounded with a rampart sixteen miles in circumference; but what harm could a siege do to an army which, from its command of the sea, could obtain supplies of every kind in abundance? </p>                        </div>

The fates thus forcing on an issue, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a> was chosen as the scene of the battle, and the destiny of the city, the empire and the human race was entrusted for decision to the plains of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410243PPhi class=place long=24.285 lat=41.012>Philippi</a>. 44 Never did <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> see so much of the might and dignity of the Roman people collected in one place; more than 300,000 men were assembled in the two armies as well as auxiliary troops, kings and senate. 45 Never were the portents of impending disaster more clearly manifest, victims escaping from slaughter, <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> swarming upon the standards, and darkness coming on in the daytime. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> himself dreamed that he was surrounded in his own theatre by a clapping of hands which resembled the beating of breasts, and in the morning appeared at his headquarters clad in a dark cloak — an omen of misfortune. 46 <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s army was never more eager and alert, and it was from his side that the first trumpet-call was sounded and the first weapons were discharged. The javelin of <a href=/people/5579 target=_blank>Crastinus</a> was noted as that of the man who started the battle, and the strangeness of the wound which he received — he was found among the dead with a sword thrust into his mouth — showed the zeal and rage with which he had fought. 47 Nor was the issue of the campaign less wondrous; for although <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> had such a superiority in cavalry that he thought he could easily surround <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, he was himself surrounded. 48 For when the fight had continued for a long time without advantage to either side and, by <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>' order, his cavalry had poured forth in an onslaught from the wing, suddenly at a given signal the German cohorts made so violent an attack from that quarter on the cavalry as they rushed out that the latter seemed but infantry, while their assailants seemed to be mounted on horseback. 49 The slaughter of the retreating cavalry was accompanied by the destruction of the light infantry; then the panic extended further and, one body of troops spreading confusion to another, the slaughter of the rest was accomplished as though by one sweep of the hand, and the very size of the army contributed more than anything to its destruction. 50 <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was everywhere in the battle and combined the functions of a general and of a common soldier. Some of his remarks too, made as he rode about, are preserved. One of them, Soldiers, strike the foe in the face, was cruel but judicious and conducive to success. Another, Spare your fellow-citizens, 51 uttered when he was himself pursuing <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> (who would have been lucky in his misfortunes if the same fate which overtook his army had fallen upon himself), was intended merely as a boast.

Yet the embers of the conflagration in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a> burst forth again in flames with far greater fury and violence. 54 In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, indeed, a war broke out against <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> which had no connection with the party faction. 55 Since <a href=/people/1376 target=_blank>Ptolemaeus</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, had perpetrated the crowning atrocity of the civil war and had sealed a treaty of friendship with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> by means of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>' murder, fate called for vengeance for the shade of so illustrious a victim; and an occasion soon presented itself. 56 <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, the king's sister, threw herself at <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s feet and asked for the restoration of part of the kingdom. He was moved by the beauty of the damsel, which was enhanced by the fact that, being so fair, she seemed to have been wronged, and by hatred for the king himself, 57 who had sacrificed <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> to the fortunes of a faction and not out of any consideration for <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, against whom he would certainly have made the same attempt if occasion had arisen. 58 When <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> ordered that <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> should be restored to the throne, he was immediately surrounded in the palace by those who had assassinated <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, but, though he had only a small body of troops, he resisted with wonderful bravery the pressure of a vast army. 59 First of all, by setting fire to the neighbouring buildings and docks he kept the missiles of his assailants at a distance; then he made a sudden sally and occupied the peninsula of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299IPha class=place long=29.8856 lat=31.213>Pharos</a>. Driven thence into the sea he succeeded, with wonderful good fortune, in swimming to the nearer vessels of the fleet, leaving his cloak behind him in the water, either through luck or by design, that it might be a target for the shower of missiles and stones thrown by the enemy. </p>                        </div>

The body of the king was found buried in mud, distinguishable by his golden coat of mail. <br /> 61 In <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> too a fresh disturbance arose from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>, fortune as it were designedly seeking thus to make an end of the kingdom of <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, in order that his son might be conquered by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> just as the father had been defeated by <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. 62 King <a href=/people/452 target=_blank>Pharnaces</a>, relying rather upon our internal feuds than upon his own valour, invaded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a> with a hostile force. 63 <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> attacked him, and in a single battle — or, if I may use the expression, in part of a battle — crushed him like a thunderbolt which in one and the same moment has come, has struck and has departed. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s boast was no vain one when he said that the enemy was defeated before he was seen. <br /> 64 So much for foreign enemies; in Africa <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had a much more bitter struggle against his fellow-countrymen than at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393224UPha class=place long=22.3869 lat=39.2883>Pharsalia</a>. It was on the coast of Africa that the tide of flight had cast ashore the remnants of the shipwrecked faction — remnants, indeed, one can hardly call them, but rather material for a fresh war. 65 Their forces had been scattered rather than defeated, and the fate of their leader had in itself confirmed the obligation of their oath, and they were no degenerate leaders who succeeded him; for the names of <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> and <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> had a sufficiently imposing sound to take place of that of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=place long=-5 lat=35>Mauretania</a>, also joined their forces, apparently in order that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> might spread his conquest still more widely. 66 There was no difference between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393224UPha class=place long=22.3869 lat=39.2883>Pharsalia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/356110UTha class=place long=11.0428 lat=35.6225>Thapsus</a>, except that the latter was on a larger scale; also the attack of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s troops was all the more vigorous because they were indignant that the war had assumed greater dimensions since <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>' death. Furthermore, the trumpeters gave the signal for the attack of their own accord before receiving the general's order — a thing which happened on no other occasion. 67 The defeat began with <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a>, whose elephants, unaccustomed to war and only recently brought from the woods, panic-stricken at the sudden noise of the trumpets, wheeled round and charged their own side. The army immediately turned to flight, nor were the generals too brave to flee; the deaths, however, of all of them were remarkable. 68 <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> was escaping on a ship, but, when the enemy came up with him, he thrust a sword right through his vitals; and when someone inquired where he was, he replied, All is well with the general. 69 <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a>, having reached his palace, held a sumptuous banquet the following day with <a href=/people/1898 target=_blank>Petreius</a>, the companion of his flight, and at the table, in the midst of his cups, offered himself to die at his hands. <a href=/people/1898 target=_blank>Petreius</a> had courage enough for the king and himself, and the half-consumed meats, their funeral feast, on the table before them, were drenched with the blood of the king and the Roman. 70 <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> was not present at the fighting; having pitched his camp on the <a href=/people/4891 target=_blank>Bagradas</a>, he was holding <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371101UUti class=place long=10.0623 lat=37.0565>Utica</a> as a second line for the defence of Africa. 71 When, however, he received the news of the defeat of his party, he did not hesitate but cheerfully, as became a philosopher, called death to his aid. Having embraced and dismissed his son and the members of his staff, and having read far into the night by the light of a lamp the book of <a href=/people/2345 target=_blank>Plato</a> which treats of the immortality of the soul, he slept for a while 72 and then, about the first watch, drew his sword and once and again struck his bared breast. After this the doctors with their fomentations must needs lay their vulgar hands upon this hero: he endured it until they departed, and then tore the wounds open and, a rush of blood ensuing, left his dying hands in the wound which he had twice dealt himself. <br /> 73 Just as though there had been no fighting hitherto, warfare and party spirit broke out afresh, and Spain outdid Africa, just as Africa surpassed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>. 74 The Pompeian party gained greatly in popularity from the fact that its leaders were brothers, and that two Pompeii took the place of one. 75 Nowhere, therefore, were the encounters more bitter or the results so doubtful. First <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> and <a href=/people/3581 target=_blank>Didius</a>, the lieutenant-generals, fought at the very mouth of the Ocean. But the ships had a harder struggle against the sea than against one another; for the Ocean, as though it were punishing the madness of civil war, destroyed both fleets by shipwreck. 76 What a dread conflict was that in which waves, storms, men, ships and arms all strove together at the same time! Mark too the terrible nature of the battle-field — the shores of Spain closing in on one side and those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=place long=-5 lat=35>Mauretania</a> on the other, an outer and an inner sea, and the Watch-towers of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> overhanging them, while all around was the rage of battle and of storm. 77 Soon after this both sides scattered in different directions to besiege the unhappy cities, which, between the leaders on one side and the other, paid a heavy price for their alliance with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. The final struggle took place at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374000UMun class=place long=-5.196 lat=37.376>Munda</a>. 78 On this occasion <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s usual good fortune was lacking, and the struggle was for a long time doubtful and anxious; so much so that <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> seemed clearly to be deliberating some strange issue. 79 <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself too before the battle was unusually depressed, either from a consideration of human weakness, or because he felt doubtful whether his good luck, having lasted so long, would continue, or else because, having started on the same career as <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, he feared that the same fate might befall him.

Finally, an unaccustomed disgrace presented itself to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s eyes: his tried band of veterans, after fourteen years of service, gave ground, and though they had not gone so far as to flee, yet it was obvious that shame rather than valour made them resist. 82 Sending away his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> rushed forward like a madman to the forefront of the battle, where he seized hold of those who were fleeing, heartened the standard-bearers, uttered prayers, exhortations and rebukes, and, in a word, dashed this way and that through the ranks with glances, gestures and shouts. 83 In the turmoil he is even said to have meditated making an end of himself and to have shown clearly by his expression that he wished to take his own life; only, at that moment, five cohorts of the enemy, which had been sent by <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a> to protect the camp, which was in danger, crossed the battle-field and suggested an appearance of flight. 84 <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> either actually believed that the enemy was fleeing or else craftily made use of the incident and gave them heart against an enemy, who they thought was fleeing and already conquered, while he discouraged the foe. His men, thinking that they were winning the day, followed more boldly, while the Pompeians, thinking that their own side was in flight, began to flee. 85 How great was the rage and fury of the victors in the slaughter of the enemy can be gathered from the fact that, when the fugitives had retreated to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374000UMun class=place long=-5.196 lat=37.376>Munda</a>, and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> immediately ordered that his conquered foes should be besieged, a rampart was constructed of corpses piled up and held together by the javelins and missiles which were thrust through them — an expedient which would have been horrible even if it had been used against barbarians. 86 <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>' sons clearly had no longer any hope of victory; Gnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, a fugitive from the battle-field and wounded in the leg, was overtaken, as he was seeking some solitary and inaccessible place of refuge, by <a href=/people/6313 target=_blank>Caesonius</a> near the town of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396-06UEde class=place long=-0.594 lat=39.6258>Lauro</a>, and was killed, still showing enough spirit to resist; 87 <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> allowed Sextus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> to remain hidden for the moment in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403-29RCel class=place long=-2.9 lat=40.32>Celtiberia</a> and preserved him to fight again after <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s time. <br /> 88 <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> returned home victorious and celebrated a triumph first over Gaul, in which figured the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437046WRho class=place long=4.5989 lat=43.6544>Rhone</a> and the captive Ocean represented in gold.

No one was put to death by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s orders except <a href=/people/847 target=_blank>Afranius</a> it was enough that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had once pardoned him) and <a href=/people/1629 target=_blank>Faustus</a> <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> (for the example of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> had taught <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> to be afraid of sons-in-law), and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>' daughter and her children by <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, as a precaution for posterity. 91 His fellow-citizens were not ungrateful and heaped every kind of honour upon him as sole ruler. Statues of him were set up in the temples; in the theatre he wore a crown adorned with rays; he had a raised chair in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate-house</a>; a high gable was added to his house; a month in the calendar was named after him. In addition to this he was called Father of his Country and Perpetual Dictator. Finally — though it is doubtful whether it was by his own wish — he was offered the insignia of royalty in front of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BRoA class=place long=12.48458 lat=41.89258>Rostra</a> by the consul <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>. 92 But all these things were, as it were, decorations heaped upon a victim doomed to die; for the envy which he inspired influenced men more than his clemency, and his very power to confer favours was intolerable to free citizens. 93 His rule was not long endured; <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> and other senators conspired together to kill their leader. 94 How powerful is fate! The plot had become widely known; on the very day fixed for its execution, written information of it had been presented to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and, though he sacrificed a hundred victims, he had been unable to obtain favourable omens. Yet he came into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate-house</a> thinking of his campaign against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a>. 95 As he was seated there in his curule chair the senators attacked him, and he was borne to the ground wounded in twenty-three places. Thus he who had filled the whole world with the blood of his fellow-citizens at last filled the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate-house</a> with his own. </p>                        </div>

Though the nature of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> was always evil, on this occasion his wife <a href=/people/821 target=_blank>Fulvia</a>, girding herself with the sword of her husband's service, egged him on yet more. He had, therefore, stirred up further hostilities by rousing the farmers who had been dispossessed of their lands. 3 He was thereupon declared a public enemy not merely in the judgment of private citizens but by the votes of the whole senate, and <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, attacking him, drove him within the walls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a>, and by the humiliating device of starvation, against which he tried every expedient, finally reduced him to surrender. <br /> 6 The Triumvirate <br />Although <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> by himself was a sufficient menace to peace and to the State, <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> joined him and thus, as it were, added fire to fire.

The formation of the triumvirate followed a bad precedent, and with the overthrow of the constitution by arms, the Sullan proscription came back. Its most remarkable act of atrocity was the murder of as many as a hundred and forty senators. 4 Shocking, brutal and pitiable deaths in every part of the world awaited those who escaped. What lamentation can do justice to the disgrace involved in the proscription by <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> of his uncle Lucius <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and of his brother Lucius <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> by <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>? 5 It had long been customary to expose on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BRoA class=place long=12.48458 lat=41.89258>Rostra</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> the heads of those who had been executed; but, even so, the citizens could not restrain their tears when they saw the severed head of <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> on those very <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BRoA class=place long=12.48458 lat=41.89258>Rostra</a> which he had made his own, and men rushed to gaze upon him as once they were wont to crowd to listen to him. 6 These crimes were the result of the proscription-lists of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> and <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>; <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> contented himself with proscribing his father's murderers, for fear lest his death might be considered to have been deserved if it had remained unavenged. </p>                        </div>

They were not without the courage to avenge <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, but they were as yet without a leader. 3 So, since it was manifest what a calamity was threatening the State, the idea of vengeance was rejected, though the murder met with disapprobation. 4 Therefore although on the advice of <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> an amnesty was passed, yet, to avoid offending the gaze of the sorrowful populace, the murderers had withdrawn to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, the provinces which had been assigned to them by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, the very man whom they had murdered. Thus revenge for <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was delayed rather than stifled. <br /> 5 The governing power having been distributed between the triumvirs rather as it could be than as it should be, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> prepared to make war on <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> and <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, while <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> remained behind to guard the capital. 6 <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, having collected vast forces, had occupied the same ground as had been fatal to Gnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>.5 On this occasion too threatening signs of impending disaster were not lacking. 7 A swarm of <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> settled on the standards; the birds which usually feed upon corpses flew round the camp, as though it were already their prey; 8 and an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=demonym long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopian</a> who met the troops as they were marching to battle was only too clearly an omen of disaster. Also, while <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> himself was meditating at night, according to his custom, with a lamp at his side, a gloomy phantom presented itself, and on being asked who it was replied, I am your evil genius, and then vanished from his wondering sight. 9 In <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s camp birds and victims had with equal clearness given every promise of better fortune. The most striking incident was that <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s physician was warned in a dream that <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> should quit his camp, which was on the point of being captured. And this actually happened; 10 for when the battle had begun and both sides had been fighting for some time with equal ardour and, though on one side both generals were present, on the other side one had been kept away by illness, the other by fear and cowardice, yet the invincible good fortune both of the avenger and of him who was being avenged supported their cause, as the result of the battle proved. At first the issue was so doubtful that, danger threatening both sides alike, 11 the camp of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was captured on the one hand and that of <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> on the other. But how much more powerful is fortune than valour, and how true it is, as the dying <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> said with his last breath, that virtue exists not in reality but in name only!8 A mistake decided the victory in this battle. 12 <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, at a moment when the wing of his army had given way, on seeing the cavalry returning at full speed after the capture of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s camp, thought that they were in flight and made his way to some higher ground. 13 Here, when the dust and confusion and the approaching darkness prevented him from seeing what had happened, and a scout whom he had sent out to obtain news was slow in bringing it, thinking that his cause was lost, he made one of those who were standing by cut off his head. 14 <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, having lost his second self by the death of <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, in order that he might not fail in carrying out every detail of their compact (for it had been agreed that neither of them should survive the battle), presented his side to one of his companions that he might plunge his sword into it. 15 Who can but wonder that these wise and brave men did not die by their own hands? But it was perhaps a further example of their adherence to their philosophical principles, that they should not stain their hands with blood, but that, for the destruction of their brave and pious lives, though the decision to die was their own, they should employ the hands of others to execute the crime. </p>                        </div>

Then, meeting with <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s fleet, he burnt and sank it and not only <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> himself, but also <a href=/people/1593 target=_blank>Menas</a> and <a href=/people/733 target=_blank>Menecrates</a>, base slaves whom he had put in command of his fleet, made sudden raids in search of plunder along all the coasts. 3 In return for all these successes he made a sacrifice of a hundred <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> with gilded horns at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383157LPel class=place long=15.651 lat=38.267>Pelorum</a> and flung a living <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> with an offering of gold into the straits as gifts to <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a>, in order to induce the ruler of the sea to allow him to reign in his domain. At last the danger became so great that a treaty of peace was concluded with the enemy — if a son of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> can be called an enemy. 4 How great was the joy (though it was short-lived), when an agreement was made on the embankment on the shores of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PBai class=place long=14.0699 lat=40.8178>Baiae</a> permitting his return and the restitution of his property, and when, at his invitation, they dined on board his ship, and railing against his fate, he said, There are keels (carinae) where I liveb — a witty remark, seeing that his father had lived in Carinae, the most fashionable quarter of the capital, while his own home and his household gods tossed in a ship. 5 But owing to the incivility of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> and because the spoil from <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>' property, of which <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> had been the purchaser, had been squandered, the entry of Sextus into possession of his estates could not be sustained; thus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> began to back out of the pact of agreement. So recourse was had to arms again, and a fleet was now equipped with all the resources of the Empire against the young leader. Preparations for it were made on a magnificent scale; 6 for by cutting through the track of the Herculean Way and digging up the shore, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141WLuc class=place long=14.08 lat=40.8292>Lucrine Lake</a> was turned into a harbour and the Lake of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141WAve class=place long=14.0822 lat=40.8393>Avernus</a> added to it by cutting away the ground between, in order that manoeuvring on these quiet waters the fleet might practise a semblance of naval warfare. 7 The young commander was brought to action by this superior force and defeated in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> straits, and would have carried with him to the grave the reputation of a great leader if he had attempted nothing further; but it is a characteristic of genius never to lose hope. 8 When his position became desperate, he fled away and made sail for <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, only to fall there into the hands of the enemy and to suffer imprisonment and undergo the most wretched fate which can befall a brave man, namely, death by the sword of the executioner at the bidding of his foes. 9 There had been no such pitiable flight since that of <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>; for he who had been but lately lord of three hundred and fifty ships fled with six or seven and with the lights extinguished on his flagship, after throwing his rings into the sea, casting anxious looks behind him, though his only fear was lest he should fail to meet with death. </p>                        </div>

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, who were crafty as well as confident in their arms, pretended to be panic-stricken and to fly across the plains. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> immediately followed them, thinking that he had already won the day, when suddenly a not very large force of the enemy unexpectedly burst forth, like a storm of rain, upon his troops in the evening when they were weary of marching, and overwhelmed two legions with showers of arrows from all sides. 4 No disaster had ever occurred comparable with that which threatened the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> on the following day, if the gods in pity had not intervened. A survivor from the disaster of <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> dressed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> costume rode up to the camp, and having uttered a salutation in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> and thus inspired trust by speaking their language, informed them of the danger that was threatening them. 5 The king, he said, would soon be upon them with all his forces; they ought, therefore, to retreat and make for the mountains, though even so, they would probably have no lack of enemies to face. The result was that a smaller body of the enemy than was anticipated came up with them. However, it did come up with them, 6 and the rest of their forces would have been destroyed, had not some of the soldiers, as though they had been drilled to it, by chance kneeled down, when the missiles fell like hail upon them, and raising their shields above their heads presented the appearance of dead men; whereupon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> refrained from further use of their bows. 7 Then, when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> rose up again, it seemed like a miracle that one of the barbarians cried out, Depart, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and farewell; rumour deservedly calls you victorious over the nations, since you have escaped the weapons of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>. The subsequent losses of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> on the march were quite as heavy as those inflicted by the enemy. 8 In the first place the lack of water in the district was fatal, but still more fatal to some was the brackish water which they drank; 9 and, finally, even fresh water was harmful when drunk with avidity by the soldiers in their already debilitated condition. Afterwards the heat in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a> and the snows of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a> and the sudden change from one climate to another were as destructive as a plague. 10 Thus, when scarcely a third part of the sixteen legions was left, and his silver plate had been cut up with hatchets and distributed, and the famous general had on several occasions begged his sword-bearer to put him to death, he at last reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> in flight, where, by an extraordinary perversion of mind, he grew even more self-confident, for all the world as if, by escaping, he had won the day. </p>                        </div>

After the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> expedition he acquired a loathing for war and lived a life of ease, and a slave to his love for <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, rested in her royal arms as though all had gone well with him. 2 The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> woman demanded the Roman Empire from the drunken general as the price of her favours; and this <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> promised her, as though the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were more easily conquered than the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>. 3 He, therefore, began to aim at sovereignty — though not for himself — and that in no secret manner; but, forgetful of his country, his name, his toga and the emblems of his office, he soon completely degenerated into the monster which he became, in feeling as well as in garb and dress. In his hand was a golden sceptre, at his side a scimitar; he wore a purple robe studded with huge gems; a crown only was lacking to make him a king dallying with a queen. 4 At the first rumour of his latest proceedings <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had crossed over from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> to meet the approach of war, and, pitching his camp in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> had surrounded all the shore of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390208SAkt class=place long=20.7683 lat=38.9509>Actium</a>, the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387207PLeu class=place long=20.717 lat=38.81>Leucas</a>, Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386205SApo class=place long=20.5486 lat=38.5688>Leucate</a> and the promontories enclosing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390210WAmb class=place long=20.9692 lat=38.9725>Ambracian Gulf</a> with a formidable fleet. 5 We had more than four hundred ships, the enemy less than two hundred; but their size compensated for their numerical inferiority. For having from six to nine banks of oars and also rising high out of the water with towers and platforms so as to resemble castles or cities, they made the sea groan and the wind labour as they moved along. Their very size, indeed, was fatal to them. 6 <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s ships had from two to six banks of oars and no more; being, therefore, easily handled for any manoeuvre that might be required, whether for attacking, backing water or tacking, they scattered at their will the opposing vessels, which were clumsy and in every respect unwieldy, several of them attacking a single ship with missiles and with their beaks, and also with firebrands hurled into them. 7 The vastness of the enemy's forces was never more apparent than after the victory; for, as a result of the battle, the wreckage of the huge fleet floated all over the sea, and the waves, stirred by the winds, continually yielded up the purple and gold-bespangled spoils of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/145440RSab class=ethnic long=44 lat=14.5>Sabaeans</a> and a thousand other Asiatic peoples. 8 The queen led the retreat, putting out into the open sea in her golden vessel with purple sails. 9 <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> soon followed her, but <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was hard upon his tracks. And so neither their preparations for flight into the Ocean, nor their occupation of the two promontories of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/314272UPar class=place long=27.245 lat=31.359>Paraetonium</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/310325UPel class=place long=32.5462 lat=31.0424>Pelusium</a>, with garrisons availed them aught; they were almost within <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s grasp. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> was the first to seize the sword of a suicide; the queen, casting herself at <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s feet, tried to attract his glances, but in vain, for her beauty was unable to prevail over his self-control. 10 Her efforts were aimed not at saving her life, which was freely offered to her, but at obtaining a portion of his kingdom. Despairing of winning this from <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and perceiving that she was being reserved to figure in his triumph, profiting by the carelessness of her guard, she betook herself to the mausoleum, as the royal sepulchre is called. 11 There, having put on the elaborate raiment by the side of her beloved <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> in a coffin filled with rich perfumes, and applying <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a> to her veins thus passed into death as into a sleep. <br /> 12 Thus the civil wars came to an end; the other wars were waged against foreign nations and broke out in different quarters of the world while the empire was distracted by its troubles. 2 <a href=/people/280 target=_blank>Peace</a> was a new state of affairs, and the proud and haughty necks of the nations, not yet accustomed to the reins of servitude, revolted against the yoke recently imposed upon them. 3 It was in particular the northern region, where dwelt the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/470150RNor class=ethnic long=15 lat=47>Noricans</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=ethnic long=19 lat=45>Pannonians</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=ethnic long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatians</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440205RMys class=ethnic long=20.5 lat=44>Moesians</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=ethnic long=25 lat=44.5>Dacians</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490315RSar class=ethnic long=31.5 lat=49>Sarmatians</a> and Germans, that showed the most spirit. </p>                        </div>

Its loss was a disgrace which far outweighed the glory of its acquisition. 22 But since he was well aware that his father, Gaius <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, had twice crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> by bridging it and sought hostilities against <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a>, he had conceived the desire of making it into a province to do him honour. His object would have been achieved if the barbarians could have tolerated our vices as well as they tolerated our rule. <br /><a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> was sent into the province and conquered the <a href=/people/8476 target=_blank>Usipetes</a> first, and then overran the territory of the Tencturi and <a href=/people/12145 target=_blank>Catthi</a>. He erected, by way of a trophy, a high mound adorned with the spoils and decorations of the <a href=/people/11059 target=_blank>Marcomanni</a>. 24 Next he attacked simultaneously those powerful tribes, the <a href=/people/12042 target=_blank>Cherusci</a>, <a href=/people/11067 target=_blank>Suebi</a> and <a href=/people/12069 target=_blank>Sicambri</a>, who had begun hostilities after crucifying twenty of our centurions, an act which served as an oath binding them together, and with such confidence of victory that they made an agreement in anticipation for dividing the spoils. The <a href=/people/12042 target=_blank>Cherusci</a> had chosen the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, 25 the <a href=/people/11067 target=_blank>Suebi</a> the gold and silver, the <a href=/people/12069 target=_blank>Sicambri</a> the captives. Everything, however, turned out contrariwise; for <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>, after defeating them, divided up their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, their herds, their necklets and their own persons as spoil and sold them. 26 Furthermore, to secure the province he posted garrisons and guard-posts all along the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/517060WMos class=place long=5.959 lat=51.6928>Mosa</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/535100WAlb class=place long=10 lat=53.4726>Elbe</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/535055WVis class=place long=5.5458 lat=53.5132>Visurgis</a> (Weser). Along the banks of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> he disposed more than five hundred forts. He built bridges at Borma and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507016UGes class=place long=1.6151 lat=50.7263>Gesoriacum</a>, and left fleets to protect them. 27 He opened a way through the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/484084RHer class=place long=8.35 lat=48.35>Hercynian forest</a>, which had never before been visited or traversed. In a word, there was such peace in <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a> that the inhabitants seemed changed, the face of the country transformed, and the very climate milder and softer than it used to be. 28 Lastly, when the gallant young general had died there, the senate itself, not from flattery but as an acknowledgment of his merit, did him the unparalleled honour of bestowing upon him a surname derived from the name of a province. <br />But it is more difficult to retain than to create provinces; they are won by force, they are secured by justice. 30 Therefore our joy was short-lived; for the Germans had been defeated rather than subdued, and under the rule of <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> they respected our moral qualities rather than our arms. 31 After his death they began to detest the licentiousness and pride not less than the cruelty of Quintillius <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a>. He had the temerity to hold an assembly and had issued an edict against the <a href=/people/12145 target=_blank>Catthi</a>, just as though he could restrain the violence of barbarians by the rod of a lictor and the proclamation of a herald. 32 But the Germans who had long been regretting that their swords were rusted and their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> idle, as soon as they saw the toga and experienced laws more cruel than arms, snatched up their weapons under the leadership of <a href=/people/3141 target=_blank>Armenius</a>. 33 Meanwhile <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> was so confident of peace that he was quite unperturbed even when the conspiracy was betrayed to him by <a href=/people/12189 target=_blank>Segestes</a>, one of the chiefs. 34 And so when he was unprepared and had no fear of any such thing, at a moment when (such was his confidence) he was actually summoning them to appear before his tribunal, they rose and attacked him from all sides. His camp was seized, and three legions were overwhelmed. 35 <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> met disaster by the same fate and with the same courage as <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> on the fatal day of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413162UCan class=place long=16.1515 lat=41.2964>Cannae</a>. 36 Never was there slaughter more cruel than took place there in the marshes and woods, never were more intolerable insults inflicted by barbarians, especially those directed against the legal pleaders. 37 They put out the eyes of some of them and cut off the hands of others; they sewed up the mouth of one of them after first cutting out his tongue, exclaiming, At last, you <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>viper</a>, you have ceased to hiss. 38 The body too of the consul himself, which the dutiful affection of the soldiers had buried, was disinterred. As for the standards and <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a>, the barbarians possess two to this day; the third <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> was wrenched from its pole, before it could fall into the hands of the enemy, by the standard-bearer, who, carrying it concealed in the folds round his belt, secreted himself in the blood-stained marsh.

Here two powerful nations, the <a href=/people/12072 target=_blank>Cantabrians</a> and the <a href=/people/12045 target=_blank>Asturians</a>, lived in freedom from the rule of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. 47 The <a href=/people/12072 target=_blank>Cantabrians</a> rose first and were more energetic and obstinate in their rebellion; not content with defending their liberty, they tried also to dominate their neighbours and harassed the <a href=/people/12070 target=_blank>Vaccaei</a>, the Turmogi and the Autrigones by frequent raids. 48 The news of their unusual activity induced <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself to undertake an expedition instead of entrusting it to another. He came personally to Segisama, where he pitched his camp, and then, dividing his army into three parts, enveloped the whole of <a href=/people/12072 target=_blank>Cantabria</a> and enclosed its fierce people like wild beasts in a net. 49 Nor did he give them any peace on the side of the Ocean; for they were also assailed in the rear by the attacks of his fleet. The first battle against the <a href=/people/12072 target=_blank>Cantabrians</a> was fought under the walls of Bergida. From here they fled to the lofty peak of Mount Vindius, to which they had thought the Roman army was less likely to ascend than the waters of the Ocean. 50 Next the town of Aracelium offered a stout resistance, but was eventually taken. The last incident was the siege of Mount Medullus. When it had been surrounded by a continuous earthwork extending over eighteen miles and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were closing in upon it on every side, the barbarians, seeing that their last hour had come, vied with one another in hastening on their own deaths in the midst of a banquet by fire and the sword and a poison which is there commonly extracted from the yew-tree. Thus most of them saved themselves from a captivity which was deemed more grievous than death itself by men who had hitherto never been conquered. 51 <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> received the news of these operations, which were carried out by <a href=/people/1531 target=_blank>Antistius</a> and <a href=/people/1111 target=_blank>Furnius</a>, his lieutenant-generals, and <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, while he was wintering on the coast at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411013UTar class=place long=1.259 lat=41.1147>Tarraco</a>. 52 Himself arriving quickly on the scene, he brought some of the inhabitants down from the mountains, secured the fidelity of others by taking hostages, and sold others, by right of conquest, into slavery. 53 His success was considered by the senate to be worthy of a laurel crown and a triumphal chariot; but <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was so mighty that he despised any glory that a triumph could bestow. 54 The <a href=/people/12045 target=_blank>Asturians</a> meanwhile had come down from the snow-clad mountains in a vast host. This attack seems not to have been undertaken without consideration by the barbarians; but they pitched their camp at the river Astura and, dividing their forces into three parts, prepared a simultaneous attack on the three camps of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. 55 With such brave enemies attacking suddenly and with so well-conceived a plan the struggle would have been doubtful and bloody — and I would I could think that the losses on both sides would have been equal — 56 had not the Brigaecini acted as traitors and had not <a href=/people/9079 target=_blank>Carisius</a> arrived with his army as a result of their warnings. To have frustrated the enemy's designs meant victory, though, even so, the struggle was a bloody one. 57 The well-fortified city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425000ULan class=place long=-5.4314 lat=42.5305>Lancea</a> opened its gates to the remains of the defeated army; here such efforts were needed to counteract the natural advantage of the place, that when firebrands were demanded to burn the captured city, it was only with difficulty that the general won mercy for it from the soldiers, 58 on the plea that it would form a better monument of the Roman victory if it were left standing than if it were burnt. <br />This was the end of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>' campaigns as well as of the rebellion in Spain. After this we were able to rely on the loyalty of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390000RIbe class=ethnic long=-4 lat=39>Spaniards</a>, and uninterrupted peace ensued as a result both of their natural disposition for the arts of peace and also of the wise measures taken by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, who, dreading the confidence inspired by the mountains into which they were wont to retire, ordered them to occupy and cultivate the district in the plain where his camp had been; 60 he urged that the council of the nation should be held there and the place regarded as the capital. The natural advantages of the place favoured his plan; for the whole district bears gold and is rich in chrysocolla, vermilion and other pigments; he, therefore, ordered that the soil should be tilled. Thus the <a href=/people/12045 target=_blank>Astures</a>, digging deep into the ground in search of riches for others, gained their first knowledge of their own resources and wealth. </p>                        </div>

For all these great achievements he was named Perpetual Imperator and Father of his Country. 66 It was also discussed in the senate whether he should not be called <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, because he had established the empire; but the name of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> was deemed more holy and venerable, in order that, while he still dwelt upon earth, he might be given a name and title which raised him to the rank of a deity. </p>                        </div>
