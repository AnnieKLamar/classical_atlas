Before we proceed to write of him, the following caution seems necessary to be given to our readers; that they should not confound the customs of other nations with their own, or think that those things which appear unimportant to themselves must be equally so to others. We know that skill in music, according to our habits, is foreign to the character of any eminent personage; and that to dance is accounted disparaging to the character; while all such accomplishments among the Greeks are regarded both as pleasing and as worthy of admiration. <br />But as we wish to draw a correct picture of the habits and life of <a href=/people/150 target=_blank>Epaminondas</a>, we seem called upon to omit nothing that may tend to illustrate it. We shall therefore speak in the first place of his birth; we shall then show in what accomplishments, and by whom, he was instructed; next we shall touch upon his manners and intellectual endowments, and whatever other points in his character may deserve notice; and lastly on his great actions, which are more regarded by many than all the best qualities of the mind. </p>                        </div>

For his instructor in philosophy he had <a href=/people/12469 target=_blank>Lysis</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=person long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>, a <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagorean</a>, to whom he was so devoted that, young as he was, he preferred the society of a grave and austere old man before that of all those of his own age; nor did he part with him until he so far excelled his fellow students in learning, that it might easily be perceived he would in like manner excel them all in other pursuits. These acquirements, according to our habits, are trifling, and rather to be despised; but in Greece, at least in former times, they were a great subject for praise. After he grew up, and began to apply himself to gymnastic exercises, he studied not so much to increase the strength, as the agility, of his body; for he thought that strength suited the purposes of wrestlers, but that agility conduced to excellence in war. He used to exercise himself very much, therefore, in running and wrestling, as long as he could grapple, and contend standing, with his adversary. But he spent most of his labour on martial exercises. </p>                        </div>

Whenever he came into a company, therefore, in which a discussion was going on concerning government, or a conversation was being held on any point of philosophy, he never went away till the discourse was brought to its conclusion. He bore poverty so easily, that he received nothing from the state but glory. He did not avail himself of the means of his friends to maintain himself; but he often used his credit to relieve others, to such a degree that it might be thought all things were in common between him and his friends; for when any one of his countrymen had been taken by the enemy, or when the marriageable daughter of a friend could not be married for want of fortune, he used to call a council of his friends, and to prescribe how much each should give according to his means; and when he had made up the sum required, he brought the man who wanted it to those who contributed, and made them pay it to the person himself, in order that he, into whose hands the sum passed, might know to whom he was indebted, and how much to each. </p>                        </div>

He accordingly came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a> with a large sum in gold, and, by a present of five talents, brought over <a href=/people/1786 target=_blank>Micythus</a>, a young man for whom <a href=/people/150 target=_blank>Epaminondas</a> had then a great affection, to further his views. <a href=/people/1786 target=_blank>Micythus</a> went to <a href=/people/150 target=_blank>Epaminondas</a>, and told him the cause of <a href=/people/1625 target=_blank>Diomedon</a>'s coming. But <a href=/people/150 target=_blank>Epaminondas</a>, in the presence of <a href=/people/1625 target=_blank>Diomedon</a>, said to him, There is no need of money in the matter; for if what the king desires is for the good of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a>, I am ready to do it for nothing; but if otherwise, he has not gold and silver enough to move me, for I would not accept the riches of the whole world in exchange for my love for my country. At you, who have made trial of me without knowing my character, and have thought me like yourself, I do not wonder; and I forgive you: but quit the city at once, lest you should corrupt others though you have been unable to corrupt me. You, Mycithus, give <a href=/people/1625 target=_blank>Diomedon</a> his money back; or, unless you do so immediately, I shall give you up to the magistrates. <a href=/people/1625 target=_blank>Diomedon</a> entreating that he might be allowed to depart in safety, and carry away with him what he had brought, That, he replied, I will grant you, and not for your sake, but for my own, lest any one, if your money should be taken from you, should say that what I would not receive when offered me, had come into my possession after being taken out of yours. <a href=/people/150 target=_blank>Epaminondas</a> then asking <a href=/people/1625 target=_blank>Diomedon</a> whither he wished to be conducted, and <a href=/people/1625 target=_blank>Diomedon</a> having answered, To <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, he gave him a guard in order that he might reach that city in safety. Nor did he, indeed, think that precaution sufficient, but also arranged, with the aid of <a href=/people/406 target=_blank>Chabrias</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, of whom we have spoken above, that he should embark without molestation. Of his freedom from covetousness this will be a sufficient proof. We might indeed produce a great number; but brevity must be studied, as we have resolved to comprise, in this single volume, the lives of several eminent men, whose biographies many writers before us have related at great length. </p>                        </div>

He, seeing that <a href=/people/150 target=_blank>Epaminondas</a> was distinguished in military affairs, used to advise the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a> to prefer peace to war, in order that his services as a general might not be required. <a href=/people/150 target=_blank>Epaminondas</a> in consequence said to him, You deceive your countrymen with words, in dissuading them from war, since under the name of peace you are bringing upon them slavery; for peace is procured by war, and they, accordingly, who would enjoy it long, ought to be trained to war. If therefore, my countrymen, you wish to be leaders of Greece, you must devote yourselves to the camp, not to the palaestra. When this <a href=/people/5782 target=_blank>Meneclidas</a> also upbraided him with having no children, and with not having taken a wife, and, above all, with presumption in thinking that he had acquired the glory of <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> in war, Forbear, he rejoined, <a href=/people/5782 target=_blank>Meneclidas</a>, to reproach me with regard to a wife, for I would take nobody's advice on that subject less willingly than yours; (for <a href=/people/5782 target=_blank>Meneclidas</a> lay under a suspicion of making too free with other men's wives;) and as to supposing that I am emulous of <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, you are mistaken; for he, with the support of all Greece, hardly took one city in ten years; I, on the contrary with the force of this one city of ours, and in one day, delivered all Greece by defeating the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a>. </p>                        </div>

Nor did he act in this manner once only, but often; but the most remarkable instance was, when he had led an army into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a> against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a>, and had two joined in command with him, of whom one was <a href=/people/277 target=_blank>Pelopidas</a>, a man of valour and activity; — — on this occasion, when, through the accusations of their enemies, they had all fallen under the displeasure of their countrymen, and their commission was in consequence taken from them, and other commanders came to take their place, <a href=/people/150 target=_blank>Epaminondas</a> did not obey the order of the people, and persuaded his colleagues to follow his example, continuing to prosecute the war which he had undertaken, for he saw that, unless he did so, the whole army would be lost through the incautiousness and ignorance of its leaders. But there was a law at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>, which punished any one with death who retained his command longer than was legally appointed. <a href=/people/150 target=_blank>Epaminondas</a>, however, as he saw that this law had been made for the purpose of preserving the state, was unwilling to make it contribute to its ruin, and continued to exercise his command four months longer than the people had prescribed. </p>                        </div>
