                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0094.tlg001:001.1'><b>&sect; 001.1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>: This is a river of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, which falls with an extraordinary swift stream into the Saronitic Syrtis. <a href=/people/7494 target=_blank>Chrysippe</a>, by the impulse of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>, whom she had offended, fell in love with her father <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>, and not being able to curb her preternatural desires, by the help of her nurse, in the dead of the night got to his bed and received his caresses; after which, the king proving unfortunate in his affairs, he buried alive the old bawd that had betrayed him, and crucified his daughter. Nevertheless such was the excess of his grief for the loss of <a href=/people/7494 target=_blank>Chrysippe</a>, that he threw himself into the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a>, which was afterwards called by his name <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>. Moreover in this river there grows a stone, which is called lychnis, which resembles the color of oil, and is very bright in appearance. And when they are searching after it, which they do when the moon increases, the pipers play all the while. Nor is it to be worn by any but the richer sort. Also near that part of the river which is called <a href=/people/5214 target=_blank>Pylae</a>, there grows an herb which is very like a heliotrope, with the juice of which the people anoint their skins to prevent sunburning, and to secure them against the scorching of the excessive heat. The natives whenever they take their virgins tardy, nail them to a wooden cross, and fling them into this river, singing at the same time in their own language a hymn to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>. Every year also they bury a condemned old woman near the top of the hill called Therogonos; at which time an infinite multitude of creeping creatures come down from the top of the hill, and devour the insects that hover about the buried carcass. This <a href=/people/3799 target=_blank>Chrysermus</a> relates in his History of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, though <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> gives a more exact account of these things in his Treatise of Rivers. Near to this river lies the mountain <a href=/people/4514 target=_blank>Elephas</a>, so called upon this occasion. When <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=person long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> advanced with his army into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, and the natives were resolved to withstand him with all their force, the elephant upon which <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>, king of that region, was wont to ride, being of a sudden stung with a gad-<a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>, ran up to the top of the mountain of the sun, and there uttered these words distinctly in human speech: O king, my lord, descended from the race of Gegasius, forbear to attempt any thing against <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, for he is descended from <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>. And having so said, he presently died. Which when <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> understood, afraid of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, he fell at his feet and sued for peace. Which when he had obtained, he called the mountain <a href=/people/4514 target=_blank>Elephas</a>; — as <a href=/people/3580 target=_blank>Dercyllus</a> testifies in his Third Book of Mountains. </p>                        </div>

It was formerly called the foot of <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a>, upon this occasion. When <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a> had slain the dragon which kept the fountain of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, he was afraid to taste of the water, believing it was poisoned; which forced him to wander about in search of another fountain to allay his thirst. At length, by the help of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>, he came to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225CKor class=demonym long=22.5217 lat=38.5158>Corycian</a> den, where his right leg stuck deep in the mire. And from that hole it was that, after he had pulled his leg out again, sprung a fair river, which the hero, after the solemnity of his sacrifices performed, called by the name of <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a>'s foot. Some time after, <a href=/people/863 target=_blank>Ismenus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/393 target=_blank>Amphion</a> and <a href=/people/479 target=_blank>Niobe</a>, being wounded by <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> and in great pain, threw himself into the said river, which was then from his name called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233WIsm class=place long=23.3244 lat=38.3248>Ismenus</a>; — as <a href=/people/988 target=_blank>Sostratus</a> relates in his Second Book of Rivers. Near to this river lies the mountain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233LCit class=place long=23.2506 lat=38.185>Cithaeron</a>, formerly called <a href=/people/2279 target=_blank>Asterion</a> for this reason. <a href=/people/885 target=_blank>Boeotus</a> the son of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a> was desirous, of two noble ladies, to marry her that should be most beneficial to him; and while he tarried for both in the night-time upon the top of a certain nameless mountain, of a sudden a star fell from heaven upon the shoulders of Eurythemiste, and immediately vanished. Upon which <a href=/people/885 target=_blank>Boeotus</a>, understanding the meaning of the prodigy, married the virgin, and called the mountain <a href=/people/2279 target=_blank>Asterion</a> from the accident that befell him. Afterwards it was called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233LCit class=place long=23.2506 lat=38.185>Cithaeron</a> upon this occasion. <a href=/people/1495 target=_blank>Tisiphone</a>, one of the <a href=/people/1744 target=_blank>Furies</a>, falling in love with a most beautiful youth whose name was <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233LCit class=place long=23.2506 lat=38.185>Cithaeron</a>, and not being able to curb the impatience of her desires, declared her affection to him in a letter, to which he would not return any answer. Whereupon the Fury, missing her design, pulled one of the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a> from her locks, and flung it upon the young lad as he was keeping his <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> on the top of the mountain <a href=/people/2279 target=_blank>Asterion</a>; where the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> twining about his neck choked him to death. And thereupon by the will of the Gods the mountain was called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233LCit class=place long=23.2506 lat=38.185>Cithaeron</a>; — as <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=person long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> writes in his History of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=person long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a>. But <a href=/people/2521 target=_blank>Hermesianax</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=person long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a> tells the story quite otherwise. For he says, that <a href=/people/11009 target=_blank>Helicon</a> and <a href=/people/9144 target=_blank>Cithaeron</a> were two brothers, quite different in their dispositions. For <a href=/people/11009 target=_blank>Helicon</a> was affable and mild, and cherished his aged parents. But <a href=/people/9144 target=_blank>Cithaeron</a>, being covetous and greedily gaping after the estate, first killed his father, and then treacherously threw his brother down from a steep precipice, but in striving together, fell himself along with him. Whence, by the providence of the Gods, the names of both the mountains were changed. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233LCit class=place long=23.2506 lat=38.185>Cithaeron</a>, by reason of his impiety, became the haunt of the <a href=/people/1744 target=_blank>Furies</a>. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384228LHel class=place long=23.0154 lat=38.3207>Helicon</a>, for the young man's love to his parents, became the habitation of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. </p>                        </div>

But then being divorced from his first wife, he married <a href=/people/10689 target=_blank>Damasippe</a>, the daughter of <a href=/people/8614 target=_blank>Atrax</a>, and brought her home over his son's head; with whom the mother-in-law falling in love, invited him by letters to her embraces. But he, avoiding his mother-in-law as a Fury, gave himself over to the sport of hunting. On the other side the impious woman, missing her purpose, belied the chaste youth, and accused him of attempting to ravish her. Upon this <a href=/people/146 target=_blank>Cassander</a>, raging with jealousy, flew to the wood in a wild fury, and with his sword drawn pursued his son, as one that treacherously sought to defile his father's bed. Upon which the son, finding he could no way escape his father's wrath, threw himself into the river Rhombus, which was afterwards called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407260WHeb class=place long=26.1825 lat=40.78557>Hebrus</a> from the name of the young man; — as <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a> testifies in his Eleventh Book of Rivers. Near to this river lies the mountain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409241LPan class=place long=24.0828 lat=40.9169>Pangaeus</a>, so called upon this occasion. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409241LPan class=place long=24.0828 lat=40.9169>Pangaeus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> and Critobule, by a mistake lay with his own daughter; which perplexed him to that degree that he fled to the <a href=/people/6329 target=_blank>Carmanian</a> mountain, where, overwhelmed with a sorrow that he could not master, he drew his sword and slew himself. Whence, by the providence of the Gods, the place was called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409241LPan class=place long=24.0828 lat=40.9169>Pangaeus</a>. In the river before mentioned, grows an herb not much unlike to origanum; the tops of which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> cropping off burn upon a fire, and after they are filled with the fruits of <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a>, they hold their heads over the smoke, and snuff it up into their nostrils, letting it go down their throats, till at last they fall into a profound sleep. Also upon the mountain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409241LPan class=place long=24.0828 lat=40.9169>Pangaeus</a> grows an herb, which is called the harp upon this occasion. The women that tore <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a> in pieces cast his limbs into the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407260WHeb class=place long=26.1825 lat=40.78557>Hebrus</a>; and his head being changed, the whole body was turned into the shape of a dragon. But as for his harp, such was the will of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, it remained in the same form. And from the streaming blood grew up the herb which was called the harp; which, during the solemnity of the sacrifices to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a>, sends forth a sound like that of an harp when played upon. At which time the natives, being covered with the skins of young hinds and waving their thyrsuses in their hands, sing a hymn, of which these are part of the words, When wisdom all in vain must be, Then be not wise at all; as <a href=/people/5566 target=_blank>Clitonymus</a> reports, in his Third Book of Thracian Relations. </p>                        </div>

A certain Calaurian nymph had by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> a son called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/38898WGan class=place long=89.8009 lat=23.7818>Ganges</a>, conspicuous for his beauty. Who growing up to manhood, being once desperately overcome with wine, in the heat of his intoxication lay with his mother. The next day he was informed by the nurse of what he had done; and such was the excess of his sorrow, that he threw himself into a river called Chliarus, afterwards called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/38898WGan class=place long=89.8009 lat=23.7818>Ganges</a> from his own name. In this river grows an herb resembling bugloss, which the natives bruise, and keep the juice very charily. With this juice in the dead of the night they go and besprinkle the tigers' dens; the virtue of which is such, that the tigers, not being able to stir forth by reason of the strong scent of the juice, are starved to death; — as <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a> reports in his Third Book of Hunting. Upon the banks of this river lies the mountain called the <a href=/people/6209 target=_blank>Anatole</a> for this reason. The <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, beholding the nymph <a href=/people/3503 target=_blank>Anaxibia</a> innocently spending her time in dancing, fell passionately in love with her, and not able to curb his loose amours, pursued her with a purpose to ravish her.

Upon which the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, that followed her close at the heels, not knowing what was become of his beloved, overwhelmed with grief, rose in that very place. And from this accident it was that the natives called the top of that mountain <a href=/people/6209 target=_blank>Anatole</a>, or the rising of the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>; — as Caemaron reports in his Tenth Book of the Affairs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>. </p>                        </div>

But the name of it was altered upon this occasion. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=place long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasis</a>, the child of the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> and Ocyrrhoe daughter of <a href=/people/527 target=_blank>Oceanus</a>, slew his mother, whom he took in the very act of adultery. For which being tormented by the <a href=/people/1744 target=_blank>Furies</a> appearing to him, he threw himself into the river <a href=/people/632 target=_blank>Arcturus</a>, which was afterwards called by his own name <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=place long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasis</a>. In this river grows a reed, which is called leucophyllus, or the reed with the white leaf. This reed is found at the dawning of the morning light, at what time the sacrifices are offered to <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a>, at the time when the divinely inspired paean is chanted, at the beginning of the spring; when they who are troubled with jealous heads gather this reed, and strew it in their wives' chambers to keep them chaste. And the nature of the reed is such, that if any wild extravagant person happens to come rashly in drink into the room where it lies, he presently becomes deprived of his rational thoughts, and immediately confesses whatever he has wickedly done and intended to do. At what time they that are present to hear him lay hold of him, sew him up in a sack, and throw him into a hole called the Mouth of the Wicked, which is round like the mouth of a well. This after thirty days empties the body into the Lake <a about=https://topostext.org/place/460370WMai class=place long=37 lat=46>Maeotis</a>, that is full of worms; where of a sudden the body is seized and torn to pieces by several vultures unseen before, nor is it known from whence they come; — as <a href=/people/737 target=_blank>Ctesippus</a> relates in his Second Book of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> Relations. Near to this river lies the mountain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>, which was before called <a href=/people/208 target=_blank>Boreas</a>'s Bed, upon this occasion. <a href=/people/208 target=_blank>Boreas</a> in the heat of his amorous passion ravished away by force <a href=/people/2565 target=_blank>Chione</a>, the daughter of <a href=/people/632 target=_blank>Arcturus</a>, and carried her to a certain hill which was called Niphantes, and upon her begot a son whom he called Hyrpax, who succeeded <a href=/people/4553 target=_blank>Heniochus</a> in his kingdom. For which reason the mountain was first called <a href=/people/208 target=_blank>Boreas</a>'s Bed; but afterwards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a> upon this occasion. After the fight of the <a href=/people/11034 target=_blank>Giants</a>, <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a>, to avoid the menaces of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, fled to the top of <a href=/people/208 target=_blank>Boreas</a>'s Bed, and there being turned into a crocodile [lay concealed.

Presently <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> appearing, and binding his father with a woollen list, threw him down to hell. Then changing the name of the mountain in honor of the shepherd <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>, he chained <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a> to it, and caused him to be tormented by an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> that fed upon his entrails, because he was the first that found out the inspection of bowels, which <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> deemed a great cruelty; — as <a href=/people/561 target=_blank>Cleanthes</a> relates in his Third Book of the Wars of the Gods.

In this river there breeds a certain large fish, which by the natives is called Clupaea. This fish during the increase of the moon is white; but all the while the moon is in the wane, it is altogether black; and when it grows over bulky, it is (as it were) stabbed by its own fins. In the head of it is found a stone like a corn of salt, which, being applied to the left parts of the body when the moon is in the wane, cures quartan agues; — as <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397165PSyb class=person long=16.491 lat=39.714>Sybarite</a> tells us in the Thirteenth Book of Gallic Relations, from whom <a href=/people/2672 target=_blank>Timagenes</a> the Syrian borrowed his argument. Near to this river stands a mountain called Lugdunum, which changed its name upon this occasion. When Momorus and Atepomarus were dethroned by Seseroneus, in pursuance of the oracle's command they designed to build a city upon the top of the hill. But when they had laid the foundations, great numbers of <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crows</a> with their wings expanded covered all the neighboring trees.

For <a href=/people/4120 target=_blank>Chrysorrhoas</a>, the son of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> and Agathippe, being a mechanic artist, and one that only lived from hand to mouth upon his trade, one time in the middle of the night made bold to break open the treasury of <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a>; and conveying thence a good quantity of gold, he made a distribution of it to his family. But being pursued by the king's officers, when he saw he must be taken, he threw himself into the river which was afterwards from his name called <a href=/people/4120 target=_blank>Chrysorrhoas</a>, and afterwards changed into that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385281WPac class=place long=28.0628 lat=38.4804>Pactolus</a> upon this occasion. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385281WPac class=place long=28.0628 lat=38.4804>Pactolus</a>, the son of . . . and <a href=/people/1073 target=_blank>Leucothea</a>, during the performance of the mysteries sacred to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>, ravished <a href=/people/5365 target=_blank>Demodice</a> his own sister, not knowing who she was; for which being overwhelmed with grief, he threw himself into the river <a href=/people/4120 target=_blank>Chrysorrhoas</a>, which from that time forward was called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385281WPac class=place long=28.0628 lat=38.4804>Pactolus</a>, from his own name. In this river is found a most pure gold sand, which the force of the stream carries into the bosom of the Happy Gulf. Also in this river is to be found a stone which is called the preserver of the fields, resembling the color of silver, very hard to be found, in regard of its being mixed with the gold sand. The virtue of which is such, that the more wealthy <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=ethnic long=28 lat=38.5>Lydians</a> buy it and lay it at the doors of their treasuries, by which means they preserve their treasure, whatever it be, safe from the seizure of pilfering hands. For upon the approach of thieves or robbers, the stone sends forth a sound like that of a trumpet. Upon which the thieves surprised, and believing themselves apprehended by officers, throw themselves headlong and break their necks; insomuch that the place where the thieves thus frighted come by their violent deaths is called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385281WPac class=place long=28.0628 lat=38.4804>Pactolus</a>'s prison. In this river also there grows an herb that bears a purple flower, and is called chrysopolis; by which the inhabitants of the neighboring cities try their purest gold. For just before they put their gold into the melting-pot, they touch it with this herb; at what time, if it be pure and unmixed, the leaves of the herb will be tinctured with the gold and preserve the substance of the matter; but if it be adulterated, they will not admit the discoloring moisture; — as <a href=/people/3799 target=_blank>Chrysermus</a> relates in his Third Book of Rivers. Near to this river lies the mountain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383281LTmo class=place long=28.1016 lat=38.3237>Tmolus</a>, full of all manner of wild beasts, formerly called <a href=/people/9081 target=_blank>Carmanorion</a>, from <a href=/people/4335 target=_blank>Carmanor</a> the son of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a> and Alexirrhoea, who was killed by a wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> as he was hunting; but afterward <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383281LTmo class=place long=28.1016 lat=38.3237>Tmolus</a> upon this occasion. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383281LTmo class=place long=28.1016 lat=38.3237>Tmolus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> and Theogone, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a>, while he was a hunting upon <a href=/people/9081 target=_blank>Carmanorion</a>, chanced to see the fair virgin Arrhippe that attended upon <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, and fell passionately in love with her. And such was the heat of his love, that not being able to gain her by fair means, he resolved to vitiate her by force. She, seeing she could by no means escape his fury otherwise, fled to the temple of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, where the tyrant, contemning all religion, ravished her, — an infamy which the nymph not being able to survive immediately hanged herself. But <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> would not pass by so great a crime; and therefore, to be revenged upon the king for his irreligious insolence, she set a mad <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> upon him, by which the king being tossed up in the air, and falling down upon stakes and stones, ended his days in torment. But <a href=/people/2486 target=_blank>Theoclymenus</a> his son, so soon as he had buried his father, altered the name of the mountain, and called it <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383281LTmo class=place long=28.1016 lat=38.3237>Tmolus</a> after his father's name. Upon this mountain grows a stone not unlike a pumice-stone, which is very rare to be found. This stone changes its color four times a day; and is to be seen only by virgins that are not arrived at the years of understanding. But if marriageable virgins happen to see it, they can never receive any injury from those that attempt their chastity; — as <a href=/people/3157 target=_blank>Clitophon</a> reports. </p>                        </div>

True it is, at first he withstood the force of his passion; but finding he could not vanquish the fatal necessity of yielding to divine impulse, and yet desirous to preserve his respect and piety towards his mother, he flung himself into the Amazonian river, which was afterwards called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/473393WTan class=place long=39.336 lat=47.268>Tanais</a>, from the name of the young man. In this river grows a plant which is called halinda, resembling a colewort; which the inhabitants bruising, and anointing their bodies with the juice of it, find themselves in a condition better able to endure the extremity of the cold; and for that reason, in their own language they call it <a href=/people/4093 target=_blank>Berossus</a>'s oil. In this river grows a stone not unlike to crystal, resembling the shape of a man with a crown upon his head. Whoever finds the stone when the king dies, and has it ready against the time that the people meet upon the banks of the river to choose a new sovereign, is presently elected king, and receives the sceptre of the deceased prince; — as <a href=/people/231 target=_blank>Ctesiphon</a> relates in his Third Book of Plants; and <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> gives us the same account in his First Book of Stones. Near to this river also lies a mountain, in the language of the natives called Brixaba, which signifies the forehead of a ram. And it was so called upon this occasion. <a href=/people/5186 target=_blank>Phryxus</a> having lost his sister <a href=/people/1689 target=_blank>Helle</a> near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Euxine</a> Sea, and, as Nature in justice required, being extremely troubled for his loss, retired to the top of a certain hill to disburden himself of his sorrow. At which time certain barbarians espying him, and mounting up the hill with their arms in their hands, a gold-fleeced ram leaping out of a thicket, and seeing the multitude coming, with articulate language and the voice of a man, awakened <a href=/people/5186 target=_blank>Phryxus</a>, who was fast asleep, and taking him upon his back, carried him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=place long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchis</a>. From this accident it was that the mountainous promontory was called the ram's forehead. In this mountain grows an herb, by the barbarians called phryxa (which being interpreted signifies hating the wicked), not unlike our common rue. If the son of a former mother have it in his possession, he can never be injured by his step-dame. It chiefly grows near the place which is called <a href=/people/208 target=_blank>Boreas</a>'s Den, and being gathered, is colder than snow. But if any step-dame be forming a design against her son-in-law, it sets itself on fire and sends forth a bright flame. By which means they who are thus warned avoid the danger they are in; — as <a href=/people/2032 target=_blank>Agatho</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=person long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samian</a> testifies in his Second Book of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> Relations. </p>                        </div>

It was formerly called Melas, from <a href=/people/1257 target=_blank>Melas</a> the son of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a>; but afterwards it was called <a href=/people/1155 target=_blank>Egyptus</a> upon this occasion. <a href=/people/1155 target=_blank>Egyptus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Vulcan</a> and <a href=/people/2075 target=_blank>Leucippe</a>, was formerly king of the country, between whom and his own subjects happened a civil war; on which account the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> not increasing, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> were oppressed with famine. Upon which the oracle made answer, that the land should be again blessed with plenty, if the king would sacrifice his daughter to atone the anger of the Gods. Upon which the king, though greatly afflicted in his mind, gave way to the public good, and suffered his daughter to be led to the altar. But so soon as she was sacrificed, the king, not able to support the burden of his grief, threw himself into the river <a href=/people/1257 target=_blank>Melas</a>, which after that was called <a href=/people/1155 target=_blank>Egyptus</a>. But then it was called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nilus</a> upon this occasion. Garmathone, queen of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, having lost her son Chrysochoas while he was yet very young, with all her servants and friends most bitterly bemoaned her loss. At what time <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> appearing to her, she surceased her sorrow for a while, and putting on the countenance of a feigned gratitude, kindly entertained the goddess. She, willing to make a suitable return to the queen for the piety which she expressed in her reception, persuaded <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> to bring back her son from the subterranean regions. When <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> undertook to do this, at the importunity of his wife, <a href=/people/752 target=_blank>Cerberus</a> — whom some call the Terrible — barked so loud, that <a href=/people/1804 target=_blank>Nilus</a>, Garmathone's husband, struck with a sudden frenzy, threw himself into the river <a href=/people/1155 target=_blank>Egyptus</a>, which from thence was afterwards called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nilus</a>. In this river grows a stone, not unlike to a bean, which so soon as any <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> happens to see, he ceases to bark. It also expels the evil spirit out of those that are possessed, if held to the nostrils of the party afflicted. There are other stones which are found in this river, called kollotes, which the swallows picking up against the time that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nilus</a> overflows, build up the wall which is called the Chelidonian wall, which restrains the inundation of the water and will not suffer the country to be injured by the fury of the flood; — as <a href=/people/506 target=_blank>Thrasyllus</a> tells us in his Relation of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>.

At what time this same <a href=/people/8622 target=_blank>Gorgophonos</a> (or <a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Gorgon</a>-slayer), king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376232PEpi class=ethnic long=23.1602 lat=37.6335>Epidaurians</a>, being expelled his kingdom, received this answer upon his consulting the oracle, that he should visit all the cities of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374229WArg class=place long=22.9 lat=37.37>Argolic</a> territory, and that where he found the chape of a scabbard (called in Greek μυϰής), he should build a city. Thereupon coming to the mountain Argium, and finding there an ivory scabbard, he built a city, and from the accident called it <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377228PMyk class=place long=22.7561 lat=37.7308>Mycenae</a>. In this mountain there is found a stone, which is called corybas, of a <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>-color, which he that finds and wears about him shall never be afraid of any monstrous apparitions. As for the mountain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379227LApe class=place long=22.74 lat=37.861>Apesantus</a>, this may be added, that Apesantus, the son of <a href=/people/864 target=_blank>Acrisius</a>, as he was a hunting in that place, chanced to tread upon a venomous <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>, which occasioned his death. Whom when his father had buried, in memory of his son he named the hill <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379227LApe class=place long=22.74 lat=37.861>Apesantus</a>, which before was called Selinuntius. The mountain <a href=/people/6374 target=_blank>Coccygium</a> derived its name from this accident. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> falling desperately in love with his sister <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>, and having vanquished her by his importunity, begat a male child. From whence the mountain, before called Lyrceum, was named <a href=/people/6374 target=_blank>Coccygium</a>; — as Agathonymus relates in his Persis. In this mountain grows a tree, which is called paliurus; upon the boughs of which whatever fowl happens to perch, it is presently entangled as it were with bird-lime, and cannot stir; only the cuckoo it lets go free, without any harm; — as <a href=/people/231 target=_blank>Ctesiphon</a> testifies in his First Book of Trees. As for the mountain Athenaion, it derives its name from <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>. For after the destruction of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> returning to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>, ascended the mountain Ceraunius, and there erecting a temple to <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>, called the mountain Athenaion from her name <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>. Upon the top of this mountain grows a root like to that of rue, which if any woman unwarily taste of, she presently runs mad. This root is called <a href=/people/1436 target=_blank>Adrastea</a>; — as Plesimachus writes in his Second Book of the Returns of the Heroes. </p>                        </div>

In the same river there is also found a stone of a black color, called sicyonus. This stone, when the oracle advises the sacrificing of a human victim, is laid upon the altar of the mischief-diverting Gods. And then, no sooner does the priest touch it with his knife, but it sends forth a stream of blood; at what time the superstitious sacrificers retire, and with howlings and loud ohoning carry the stone to the temple; — as <a href=/people/1368 target=_blank>Dorotheus</a> the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldaean</a> relates in his Second Book of Stones. Near to this river lies the mountain <a href=/people/6436 target=_blank>Diorphus</a>, so called from <a href=/people/6436 target=_blank>Diorphus</a> the son of the <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>, of whom this story is reported. <a href=/people/2244 target=_blank>Mithras</a> desirous to have a son, yet hating woman-kind, lay with a stone, till he had heated it to that degree that the stone grew big, and at the prefixed time was delivered of a son, called <a href=/people/6436 target=_blank>Diorphus</a>; who, growing up and contending with <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> for courage and stoutness, was by him slain, and by the providence of the Gods was transformed into the mountain which was called <a href=/people/6436 target=_blank>Diorphus</a> by his name. In this mountain grows a tree, not unlike a pomegranate-tree, which yields plenty of apples, in taste like grapes. Now if any one gather the ripest of this fruit, and do but name <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> while he holds it in his hand, it will presently grow green again; — as <a href=/people/231 target=_blank>Ctesiphon</a> witnesses in his Thirteenth Book of Trees. </p>                        </div>
