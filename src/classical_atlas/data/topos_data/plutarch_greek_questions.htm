Solution: The managers of the affairs of the commonwealth were one hundred and eighty men; out of these they elected senators, which they called ἄϱτυνοι. The most part of the common people were conversant in husbandry; these they called ϰονίποδες, because (as may be supposed) they were known by their dirty feet when they came into the city. </p>                        </div>

Solution: This was one of the women taken in adultery, which they brought into the market-place, and set her upon a certain stone to be seen of all; from thence they took her and set her on <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>-back, and led her round about the city, and afterwards set her up again upon the stone; the rest of her life she led under disgrace. Her they called Onobatis (the woman that rode upon an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>); hence they abominated the stone as unclean. There was also a certain magistrate among them, called Phylactes (a conservator); he that had this office kept the prison for the rest of his time; but at the nocturnal convention of the senators he came into the council, and laying hands on the kings led them forth, and detained them in custody until the senate had determined concerning them, by a vote given in private, whether they had acted unrighteously or not. </p>                        </div>

Solution: The sixty select men chosen from among the nobles, whom they used as overseers and principal counsellors for life in matters of greatest concern, they called Amnemones (as a man may suppose) because they were not accountable to any for what they did, or verily (in my opinion) rather because they were men carrying much business in their memories.

And why do they call one of the months Bysius? Solution: They call the slain sacrifice Ὁσιωτήϱ when the ὅσιος (the holy one) is declared. There are five of these holy ones for life, and these transact many things with the prophets, and sacrifice together with them, supposing that they are descended from <a href=/people/10993 target=_blank>Deucalion</a>. The month Bysius, as many think, is the same as Φύσιος (natural), for it is in the beginning of the spring, when most things do sprout and put forth buds. But this is not the true reason. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225PDel class=ethnic long=22.5056 lat=38.4806>Delphians</a> do not use B for PH (as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, who say Bilippus, <a href=/people/2498 target=_blank>Balacrus</a>, and Beronica, for Philippus, Phalacrus, and Pheronica), but instead of P; they for the most part saying βατεῖν for πατεῖν, and βιϰϱόν for πιϰϱόν. Therefore they say Bysius for Pysius, because in that month they enquire of and consult their God <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>. This is their genuine and country way of speaking.

Solution: The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225PDel class=ethnic long=22.5056 lat=38.4806>Delphians</a> solemnized three nonennial feasts in regular order, of which they call one Stepterium, another Herois, and the third <a href=/people/4924 target=_blank>Charila</a>. The Stepterium represents by imitation the fight which <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> had with <a href=/people/826 target=_blank>Python</a>, and both his flight and pursuit after the fight unto <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399227LTem class=place long=22.576 lat=39.877>Tempe</a>. For some say that he fled, as needing purification by reason of the slaughter; others say that he pursued <a href=/people/826 target=_blank>Python</a> wounded, and flying along the highway which they now call Sacred, he just missed of being present at his death; for he found him just dead of his wound, and buried by his son, whose name was Aix, as they say. Stepterium therefore is the representation of these or some such things. But as to Herois, it hath for the most part a mysterious reason which the <a href=/people/6995 target=_blank>Thyades</a> are acquainted with; but by the things that are publicly acted one may conjecture it to be the calling up of <a href=/people/205 target=_blank>Semele</a> from the lower world. Concerning <a href=/people/4924 target=_blank>Charila</a>, they fable some such things as these. A famine by reason of drought seized the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225PDel class=ethnic long=22.5056 lat=38.4806>Delphians</a>, who came with their wives and children as suppliants to the king's gate, whereupon he distributed meal and pulse to the better known among them, for there was not sufficient for all. A little orphan girl yet coming and importuning him, he beat her with his shoe, and threw his shoe in her face. She indeed was a poor wandering beggar-wench, but was not of an ignoble disposition; therefore withdrawing herself, she united her girdle and hanged herself. The famine hereupon increasing and many diseases accompanying it, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythia</a> gives answer to the king, that the maid <a href=/people/4924 target=_blank>Charila</a> who slew herself must be expiated. They with much ado at last discovering that this was the maid's name which was smitten with a shoe, they instituted a certain sacrifice mixed with expiatory rites, which they yet solemnize to this day every ninth year. Whereat the king presides, distributing meal and pulse to all strangers and citizens (for they introduce a kind of an effigy of the wench <a href=/people/4924 target=_blank>Charila</a>); and when all have received their doles, the king smites the idol with his shoe. Upon this the governess of the <a href=/people/6995 target=_blank>Thyades</a> takes up the image and carries it away to some rocky place, and there putting a halter about its neck, they bury it in the place where they buried <a href=/people/4924 target=_blank>Charila</a> when she had strangled herself. </p>                        </div>

Solution: Many have been the removes of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389221RAin class=ethnic long=22.0945 lat=38.8374>Aenianes</a>. First they inhabited the plain of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398228LDot class=place long=22.65 lat=39.56>Dotion</a>; thence they were expelled by the <a href=/people/721 target=_blank>Lapithae</a> to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398213RAit class=ethnic long=21.29 lat=39.75>Aethices</a>; from thence they betook themselves to a region of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398206RMol class=place long=20.6 lat=39.8>Molossia</a> about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406195WAou class=place long=19.4813 lat=40.6125>Aous</a>, where they were called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400209RPar class=ethnic long=20.92 lat=39.98>Paravaeans</a>; afterward they took possession of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384225PKir class=place long=22.4455 lat=38.4296>Cirrha</a>; they had no sooner landed at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384225PKir class=place long=22.4455 lat=38.4296>Cirrha</a> (<a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> so commanding their king <a href=/people/8049 target=_blank>Oinoclus</a>) but they went down to the country bordering on the river <a href=/people/684 target=_blank>Inachus</a>, inhabited by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378228WIna class=ethnic long=22.744 lat=37.625>Inachians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a>. There was an oracle given to the latter, that they would lose all their country if they should part with any of it, — and to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389221RAin class=ethnic long=22.0945 lat=38.8374>Aenianes</a>, that they would hold it if they should take it of such as freely resigned it. <a href=/people/8379 target=_blank>Temo</a>, a noted man among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389221RAin class=ethnic long=22.0945 lat=38.8374>Aenianes</a>, putting on rags and a scrip, like a beggar, addressed himself to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378228WIna class=ethnic long=22.744 lat=37.625>Inachians</a>; the king, in a way of reproach and scorn, gave him a clod of earth. He receives it and puts it up into his scrip, and absconds himself, making much of his dole; for he presently forsakes the country, begging no more. The old men wondering at this, the oracle came fresh to their remembrance; and going to the king, they told him that he ought not to slight this man, nor suffer him to escape. <a href=/people/8379 target=_blank>Temo</a> well perceiving their designs, hastens his flight, and as he fled, vowed a hecatomb to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>. Upon this occasion the kings fought hand to hand; and when Phemius, the king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389221RAin class=ethnic long=22.0945 lat=38.8374>Aenianes</a>, saw <a href=/people/4362 target=_blank>Hyperochus</a>, the king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378228WIna class=ethnic long=22.744 lat=37.625>Inachians</a>, charging him with a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> at his heels, he said he dealt not fairly to bring a second with him to fight him; whereupon <a href=/people/4362 target=_blank>Hyperochus</a> going to drive away the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, and turning himself about in order to throw a stone at the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, Phemius slays him. Thus the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389221RAin class=ethnic long=22.0945 lat=38.8374>Aenianes</a> possessed themselves of that region, expelling the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378228WIna class=ethnic long=22.744 lat=37.625>Inachians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a>; but they reverence that stone as sacred, and sacrifice to it, wrapping it in the fat of the victim. And when they offer a hecatomb to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, they sacrifice an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, a choice part of which they distribute to <a href=/people/8379 target=_blank>Temo</a>'s posterity, and call it the beggars' flesh. </p>                        </div>

Yet they waged war with much moderation and neighborly designs; for no man did at all injure the husbandman, and there was a stated ransom determined for all that were taken captives. And this they received after the release of the prisoner, and not before; but he that took the captive prisoner brought him home, gave him entertainment, and then gave him liberty to depart to his own house. Wherefore he that brought in the price of his ransom was applauded, and remained the friend of him that received it, and was called doryxenus, from his being a captive by the spear; but he that dealt fraudulently was reputed an unjust and unfaithful person, not only by the enemy but by his fellow-citizens also. </p>                        </div>

This <a href=/people/4013 target=_blank>Poemander</a> hurling rashly slung, and missing Policrithus, slew his own son <a href=/people/935 target=_blank>Leucippus</a>. He was then forced by law to depart out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a> and become a wandering and begging pilgrim; neither was that easy for him to do, because of the incursions which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a> made into the region of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383236PTan class=place long=23.5841 lat=38.3074>Tanagra</a>.

They say that <a href=/people/8043 target=_blank>Ochna</a> his niece fell in love with him, who was one of the daughters of Colonus; and when he perceived that she tempted him to lie with her, manifesting his indignation he went and accused her to her brethren.

Now <a href=/people/8043 target=_blank>Ochna</a> growing penitent and full of terror, as well to discharge the grief she had for her beloved as out of commiseration towards her brethren, confesses the whole truth to <a href=/people/7635 target=_blank>Elieus</a>, and he declares it to Colonus, who condemned them.

The relations therefore receiving those few that were left, and observing the other citizens overwhelmed with sorrow and grief, thought it not convenient to make any public appearances of joy or to sacrifice to the Gods; but every one entertained privately in his own house his relations that were escaped with feasts and entertainments, they themselves giving attendance to their fathers, kinsfolks, brethren, and acquaintance, none of other families being admitted thereto. Hence in imitation of these they celebrate a sacrifice to <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, which is called the Thiasi, in which they revel without any noise, each family apart by itself, for the space of sixteen days, without any servant attending them; then offering sacrifices to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, they finish this solemn feast. Upon this account they are called Monophagi, i.e. such as feed apart by themselves. </p>                        </div>

Solution: The <a href=/people/6503 target=_blank>Geomori</a> got the government into their hands, after <a href=/people/3378 target=_blank>Demoteles</a> was slain, and after the dissolution of his monarchial constitution. At this time the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a> waged war with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410280UPer class=ethnic long=27.953 lat=40.971>Perinthians</a>, being a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=demonym long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samian</a> colony, and brought fetters with them (as they say) to put on the captives. When the <a href=/people/6503 target=_blank>Geomori</a> were acquainted with these proceedings, they immediately sent aid, sending forth nine commanders and manning thirty ships, two of which, launching forth and lying before the haven, were destroyed with lightning. The commanders, proceeding on their voyage in the rest, subdued the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a>, and took six hundred of them alive. They were so elevated with this victory, that they meditated the subversion of this Geomoran oligarchy; but the occasion was given by the states themselves writing to them that they should bring the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=demonym long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarian</a> captives bound in their own fetters. When they received these letters, they showed them privately to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a>, persuading them to concur with them in a conspiracy to procure the people's liberty. A consult was held in common between them about this matter, and they decided that the best way was to beat off the rings from the fetters, and put them on the legs of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a>, and fasten them with thongs to their girdles, that they might not fall off nor being loose hinder them in their going. Accordingly they accoutred the men in this manner, and giving each of them a scimitar, they soon sailed back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a> and landed, and accordingly led the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a> through the market-place to the council-house, where all the <a href=/people/6503 target=_blank>Geomori</a> were sitting together. Then, the sign being given, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a> fell on and slew those men. Whereupon, the city being set at liberty, they admitted the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a> (as many as would) into the number of citizens, and erecting a magnificent edifice, hung up the fetters (πέδαι) in it. From this the house was named Πεδήτης. </p>                        </div>

Solution: <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, setting sail from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> with six ships, was attacked by a storm, and lost all his ships but one, with which only he was forced by the wind upon the coast of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369273PKos class=place long=27.2859 lat=36.8914>Cos</a>, and fell upon a place called <a href=/people/6584 target=_blank>Laceter</a>, saving nothing besides his men and armor. There happening to meet with a flock of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, he requested one ram of the shepherd (the man was called <a href=/people/1984 target=_blank>Antagoras</a>), who, being a robust-bodied young man, challenged <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> to fight with him; and if he were worsted, <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> should carry away the ram. As soon as this fellow engaged with <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, the Meropes came in to the aid of <a href=/people/1984 target=_blank>Antagoras</a>; and the Grecians coming in to assist <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, a great fight ensued. Whereat (they say) <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, overpowered by the multitude, betook himself for refuge to a Thracian woman, and was concealed by disguising himself in woman's apparel. But when afterwards, conquering the Meropes and passing under purification, he married the daughter of Alciopus, he put on a flowery robe. Hence the priests offer sacrifices in the place where the battle was fought, and the bridegrooms are clothed in women's apparel when they receive their brides. </p>                        </div>
