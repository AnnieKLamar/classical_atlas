But as for his parents, his father was convicted of peculation, and his mother, <a href=/people/4906 target=_blank>Caecilia</a>, had the bad name of a dissolute woman. <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> himself, while he was still a mere youth, before he had entered public life or stood for any office, made it his first business to impeach his father's accuser, <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a> the Augur, whom he found wronging the commonwealth. </p>                        </div>

Indeed, they thought the business of impeachment, on general principles and without special provocation, no ignoble thing, but were very desirous to see their young men fastening themselves on malefactors like high-bred whelps on wild beasts. However, the case stirred up great animosity, so that sundry persons were actually wounded and slain, and <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a> was acquitted. <br /></p>                        </div>

For the style of <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> was not only businesslike and ready; the same was true of many another man's in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a>.

And when he came to be well on in years, he suffered his mind to find complete leisure and repose, as it were after many struggles, in philosophy, encouraging the contemplative side of his nature, and giving timely halt and check, after his difference with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, to the play of his ambition. </p>                        </div>

And it would seem that the lot prescribed a Greek history, for there is extant a Greek history of the <a href=/people/1401 target=_blank>Marsic</a> war. <br />Of his affection for his brother Marcus there are many proofs, but the Romans dwell most upon the first. Although, namely, he was older than his brother, he was unwilling to hold office alone, but waited until his brother was of the proper age, and thus gained the favour of the people to such an extent that, although in absence from the city, he was elected aedile along with his brother. </p>                        </div>
