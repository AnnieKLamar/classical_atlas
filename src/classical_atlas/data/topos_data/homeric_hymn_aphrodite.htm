First is the daughter of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> who holds the aegis, bright-eyed <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athene</a>; for she has no pleasure in the deeds of golden <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, but delights in wars and in the work of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>, in strifes and battles and in preparing famous crafts. She first taught earthly craftsmen to make chariots of war and cars variously wrought with bronze, and she, too, teaches tender maidens in the house and puts knowledge of goodly arts in each one's mind. Nor does laughter-loving <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> ever tame in love <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, the huntress with shafts of gold; for she loves archery and the slaying of wild beasts in the mountains, the lyre also and dancing and thrilling cries and shady woods and the cities of upright men. Nor yet does the pure maiden <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Hestia</a> love <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>'s works. She was the first-born child of wily <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronos</a> and youngest too, by will of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> who holds the aegis, — a queenly maid whom both <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> sought to wed. But she was wholly unwilling, nay, stubbornly refused; and touching the head of father <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> who holds the aegis, she, that fair goddess, sware a great oath which has in truth been fulfilled, that she would be a maiden all her days. So <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the Father gave her an high honour instead of marriage, and she has her place in the midst of the house and has the richest portion. In all the temples of the gods she has a share of honour, and among all mortal men she is chief of the goddesses. </p>                        </div>

Nay, I am but a mortal, and a woman was the mother that bare me. <a href=/people/5343 target=_blank>Otreus</a> of famous name is my father, if so be you have heard of him, and he reigns over all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a> rich in fortresses.

And now the <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Slayer of Argus</a> with the golden wand has caught me up from the dance of huntress <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, her with the golden arrows. For there were many of us, nymphs and marriageable maidens, playing together; and an innumerable company encircled us: from these the <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Slayer of Argus</a> with the golden wand rapt me away. He carried me over many fields of mortal men and over much land untilled and unpossessed, where savage wild-beasts roam through shady coombes, until I thought never again to touch the life-giving earth with my feet. And he said that I should be called the wedded wife of <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a>, and should bear you goodly children. But when he had told and advised me, he, the strong <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Slayer of Argus</a>, went back to the families of the deathless gods, while I am now come to you: for unbending necessity is upon me. But I beseech you by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and by your noble parents — for no base folk could get such a son as you — take me now, stainless and unproved in love, and show me to your father and careful mother and to your brothers sprung from the same stock. I shall be no ill-liking daughter for them, but a likely. Moreover, send a messenger quickly to the swift-horsed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a>, to tell my father and my sorrowing mother; and they will send you gold in plenty and woven stuffs, many splendid gifts; take these as bride-piece. So do, and then prepare the sweet marriage that is honourable in the eyes of men and deathless gods. </p>                        </div>
