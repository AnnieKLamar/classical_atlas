Well, now what are we to do? Shall we wait for him here, or do you think I had better go back on board? <br />TIMOL: No, no, let us walk on; he has probably gone tearing off home, not being able to find us.

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg065:45'><b>&sect; 45</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;What faults have you to find, <a href=/people/1115 target=_blank>Lycinus</a>? <br />LYCIN: None; it is not safe to thwart a man who has wings, and the strength of ten thousand. I have only one question to ask. Did you ever, among all the nations you passed in your flight, meet with a similar case of mental aberration? a man of mature years riding about on a finger-ring, moving whole mountains with a touch; bald and snub-nosed, yet the desire of all eyes? Ah, there was another point. What is to prevent one single ring from doing all the work? Why go about with your left hand loaded, — a ring to every finger? nay, they overflow; the right hand must be forced into the service. And you have left out the most important ring of all, the one to stop your drivelling at this absurd rate. Perhaps you consider that a stiffish dose of hellebore would serve the turn? </p>                        </div>

You find fault with everybody else; this time we should like to hear your version of a really unexceptionable wish. <br />LYCIN: What do I want with a wish? Here we are at the gates. What with the valiant <a href=/people/3466 target=_blank>Samippus</a>'s single combat at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, and your breakfasts in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> and dinners in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, you have used up my ground between you; and you are heartily welcome. I have no fancy for a short-lived visionary wealth, with the humiliating sequel of barley-bread and no butter. That will be your fate presently. Your bliss and your wealth will take wings; you will wake from your charming dreams of treasure and diadems, to find that your domestic arrangements are of quite another kind, like the actors who take the king's part in tragedies; — their late majesties King <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> and King <a href=/people/282 target=_blank>Creon</a> usually return to very short commons on leaving the theatre. Some depression, some discontent at your existing arrangements, is to be expected on the occasion. You will be the worst off, <a href=/people/1642 target=_blank>Timolaus</a>. Your flying-machine will come to grief, like that of <a href=/people/1088 target=_blank>Icarus</a>; you will descend from the skies, and foot it on the ground; and all those rings will slip off and be lost. As for me, I am content with the exquisite amusement afforded me by your various wishes; I would not exchange it for all the treasure in the world, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> included.
