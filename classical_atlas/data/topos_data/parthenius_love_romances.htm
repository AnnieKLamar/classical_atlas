The stories, as they are found in the poets who treat this class of subject, are not usually related with sufficient simplicity; I hope that, in the way I have treated them, you will have the summary of each: and you will thus have at hand a storehouse from which to draw material, as may seem best to you, for either epic or elegiac verse. I am sure that you will not think the worse of them because they have not that polish of which you are yourself such a master: I have only put them together as aids to memory, and that is the sole purpose for which they are meant to be of service to you. </p>                        </div>

One of these was <a href=/people/3494 target=_blank>Lyrcus</a> the son of <a href=/people/817 target=_blank>Phoroneus</a>, who covered a vast deal of land and sea without finding the girl, and finally renounced the toilsome quest: but he was too much afraid of <a href=/people/684 target=_blank>Inachus</a> to return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>, and went instead to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368286UKau class=place long=28.6215 lat=36.8259>Caunus</a>, where he married Hilebia, daughter of King Aegialus, who, as the story goes, had fallen in love with <a href=/people/3494 target=_blank>Lyrcus</a> as soon as she saw him, and by her instant prayers had persuaded her father to betroth her to him; he gave him as dowry a good share of the realm and of the rest of the regal attributes, and accepted him as his son-in-law. So a considerable period of time passed, but <a href=/people/3494 target=_blank>Lyrcus</a> and his wife had no children: and accordingly he made a journey to the oracle at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374273SDid class=place long=27.2561 lat=37.3848>Didyma</a>, to ask how he might obtain offspring; and the answer was, that he would beget a child upon the first woman with whom he should have to do after leaving the shrine. At this he was mighty pleased, and began to hasten on his homeward journey back to his wife, sure that the prediction was going to be fulfilled according to his wish; but on his voyage, when he arrived at Bybastus, he was entertained by <a href=/people/1232 target=_blank>Staphylus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, who received him in the most friendly manner and enticed him to much drinking of wine, and then, when his senses were dulled with drunkenness, united him with his own daughter <a href=/people/2573 target=_blank>Hemithea</a>, having had previous intimation of what the sentence of the oracle had been, and desiring to have descendants born to her: but actually a bitter strife arose between <a href=/people/4772 target=_blank>Rhoeo</a> and <a href=/people/2573 target=_blank>Hemithea</a>, the two daughters of <a href=/people/1232 target=_blank>Staphylus</a>, as to which should have the guest, for a great desire for him had arisen in the breasts of both of them. On the next morning <a href=/people/3494 target=_blank>Lyrcus</a> discovered the trap that his host had laid for him, when he saw <a href=/people/2573 target=_blank>Hemithea</a> by his side: he was exceedingly angry, and upbraided <a href=/people/1232 target=_blank>Staphylus</a> violently for his treacherous conduct; but finally, seeing that there was nothing to be done, he took off his belt and gave it to the girl, bidding her to keep it until their future offspring had come to man’s estate, so that he might possess a token by which he might be recognized, if he should ever come to his father at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368286UKau class=place long=28.6215 lat=36.8259>Caunus</a>: and so he sailed away home. Aegialus, however, when he heard the whole story about the oracle and about <a href=/people/2573 target=_blank>Hemithea</a>, banished him from his country; and there was then a war of great length between the partisans of <a href=/people/3494 target=_blank>Lyrcus</a> and those of Aegialus: Hilebia was on the side of the former, for she refused to repudiate her husband. In after years the son of <a href=/people/3494 target=_blank>Lyrcus</a> and <a href=/people/2573 target=_blank>Hemithea</a>, whose name was <a href=/people/6129 target=_blank>Basilus</a>, came, when he was a grown man, to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368286UKau class=demonym long=28.6215 lat=36.8259>Caunian</a> land; and <a href=/people/3494 target=_blank>Lyrcus</a>, now an old man, recognized him as his son, and made him ruler over his peoples. </p>                        </div>

Now, as it fell out, this stay was most agreeable to <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, for he had fallen in love with Polymela, one of <a href=/people/289 target=_blank>Aeolus</a>’s daughters, and was engaged in a secret intrigue with her.

She however said that she could tell that for the moment indeed he was wholly in love with her, but that the time would come when he would cross over to Europe, and would there, by his infatuation for a foreign woman, bring the horrors of war upon his kindred.

Consequently he was only too well known among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=ethnic long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycians</a> and their neighbours, who were constantly being plundered and suffering all kinds of ill treatment at his hands. Through the wrath of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> he fell in love with his own sister: at first he held out, thinking that he would easily be rid of his trouble; but when time went on and his passion did not abate at all, he told his mother of it, and implored her earnestly not to stand by and see him perish; for he threatened that, if she would not help him, he would kill himself. She promised immediately that she would help him to the fulfillment of his desires, and he as at once much relieved: she summoned the maiden to her presence and united her to her brother, and they consorted thenceforward without fear of anybody, until someone informed the girl’s intended spouse, who was indeed already betrothed to her. But he, taking with him his father and certain of his kinsfolk, went to Xanthius and informed him of the matter, concealing the name of <a href=/people/935 target=_blank>Leucippus</a>. Xanthius was greatly troubled at the news, and exerted all his powers to catch his daughter’s seducer, and straitly charged the informer to let him know directly he saw the guilty pair together. The informer gladly obeyed these instructions, and had actually led the father to her chamber, when the girl jumped up at the sudden noise they made, and tried to escape by the door, hoping so to avoid being caught by whoever was coming: her father, thinking that she was the seducer, struck her with his dagger and brought her to the ground. She cried out, being in great pain; <a href=/people/935 target=_blank>Leucippus</a> ran to her rescue, and, in the confusion of the moment not recognizing his adversary, gave his father his deathblow. For this crime he had to leave his home: he put himself at the head of a party of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> who had united to invade <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>, and after being driven thence by the inhabitants of the island, repaired to the country near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, where he colonized a tract of land which gained the name Cretinaeum.

When the day appointed for the battle arrived, <a href=/people/2770 target=_blank>Pallene</a> (who had fallen deeply in love with <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a>) was terribly afraid for him: she dared not tell what she felt to any of her companions, but tears coursed down and down over her cheeks until her old tutor realized the state of affairs, and, after he had become aware of her passion, encouraged her to be of good cheer, as all would come about according to her desires: and he went off and suborned the chariot-driver of <a href=/people/693 target=_blank>Dryas</a>, inducing him, by the promise of a heavy bribe, to leave undone the pins of his chariot-wheels.

Later on the tyrant himself was greatly struck by the boy’s beauty, and seemed likely to take him by force. At this <a href=/people/3760 target=_blank>Antileon</a> was greatly enraged; he urged <a href=/people/1749 target=_blank>Hipparinus</a> not to endanger his life by a refusal, and then, watching for the moment when the tyrant was leaving his palace, sprang upon him and killed him.

Immediately the<a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=person long=7 lat=49>Celt</a> appeared, Herippe related to him her husband’s journeyings, and how he had come to pay a ransom for her.

But when, however, he came to ponder upon her patriotism, being at the same time mastered by his passion, – for it was appointed, it seems, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=ethnic long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxians</a> should be relieved of the troubles that beset them – for the moment he returned no answer, taking time to consider his course of action, and on the morrow consented to the betrayal. <br />Meanwhile, three days later, came the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=ethnic long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Milesians</a>’ celebration of the <a href=/people/12205 target=_blank>Thargelia</a> – a time when they indulge in a deal of strong wine and make merry with very little regard to the cost; and he decided to take advantage of his for the occasion of his treachery. He then and there enclosed a letter, written on a tablet of lead, in a loaf of bread, and sent it to Polycrite’s brothers, who chanced to be the citizens’ generals, in which he bade them get ready and join him that very night; and he said that he would give them the necessary direction by holding up a light: and Polycrite instructed the bearer of the loaf to tell her brothers not to hesitate; for if they acted without hesitation the business would be brought to a successful end. When the messenger had arrived in the city, <a href=/people/1430 target=_blank>Polycles</a>, Polycrite’s brother, was in the deepest anxiety as to whether he should obey the message or no: finally universal opinion was on the side of action and the night-time came on, when they were bidden to make the sally in force. So, after much prayer to the gods, they joined <a href=/people/1129 target=_blank>Diognetus</a>’ company and then made an attack on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=ethnic long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Milesians</a>’ blockading wall, some through a gate left open for them and others by scaling the wall; and then, when once through, joined together again and inflicted terrible slaughter upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=ethnic long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Milesians</a>, and in the fray <a href=/people/1129 target=_blank>Diognetus</a> was accidentally killed. On the following day all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=ethnic long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxians</a> were most desirous of doing honour to the girl: but they pressed on her such a quantity of head-dresses and girdles that she was overcome by the weight and quantity of the offerings, and so was suffocated. They gave her a funeral in the open country, sacrificing a hundred <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> to her shade: and some say that, at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=ethnic long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxians</a>’ particular desire, the body of <a href=/people/1129 target=_blank>Diognetus</a> was burnt upon the same pyre as that of the maiden. </p>                        </div>

She used never to come down into the town, nor consort with the other maidens; but she got together a large pack of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> and used to hunt, either in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=place long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconia</a>, or sometimes going into the further mountains of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a>. For this reason she was very dear to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, who gave her the gift of shooting straight. On one occasion she was traversing the country of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378215REle class=place long=21.5 lat=37.8>Elis</a>, and there <a href=/people/935 target=_blank>Leucippus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/901 target=_blank>Oenomaus</a>, fell in love with her; he resolved not to woo her in any common way, but assumed women’s clothes, and, in the guise of a maiden, joined her hunt. And it so happened that she very soon became extremely fond of him, nor would she let him quit her side, embracing him and clinging to him at all times. But <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> was also fired with love for the girl, and it was with feelings of anger and jealousy that he saw <a href=/people/935 target=_blank>Leucippus</a> always with her; he therefore put it into her mind to visit a stream with her attendant maidens, and there to bathe. On their arrival there, they all began to strip; and when they saw that <a href=/people/935 target=_blank>Leucippus</a> was unwilling to follow their example, they tore his clothes from him: but when they thus became aware of the deceit he had practiced and the plot he had devised against them, they all plunged their spears into his body. He, by the will of the gods, disappeared; but <a href=/people/762 target=_blank>Daphne</a>, seeing <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> advancing upon her, took vigorously to flight; then, as he pursued her, she implored <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> that she might be translated away from mortal sight, and she is supposed to have become the bay tree which is called daphne after her. </p>                        </div>

When he was quite young, his mother was seized with a great passion of love for him, and for a time she satisfied her feelings by constantly embracing the lad; but as time went on her passion increased and she could no longer control it, so that she took a reckless resolve and went to the lad with a story that she made up, to the effect that a lady of great beauty was in love with him; and she exhorted him not to allow the poor woman to waste away any more for unrequited love. At first <a href=/people/346 target=_blank>Periander</a> said he would not betray a woman who was bound to her husband by all the sanctions of law and custom, but, at the urgent insistence of his mother, he yielded at last. Then, when the pre-arranged night was at hand, she told him that there must be no light in the chamber, nor must he compel his partner to address any word to him, for she made this additional request by reason of shame. <a href=/people/346 target=_blank>Periander</a> promised to carry out all his mother’s instructions; she then prepared herself with all care and went in to the youth, slipping out secretly before the first gleam of dawn. The next day she asked him if all had gone to his taste, and if he would like the woman to come again; to which <a href=/people/346 target=_blank>Periander</a> answered that he would like it particularly, and that he had derived no little pleasure from the experience. From that time onward she thus visited the lad constantly. But he began to feel real love for his visitant, and became desirous of knowing who she really was. For a time then he kept asking his mother to implore the woman to consent to speak to him, and that, since she had now enmeshed him in a strong passion, she should at last reveal herself: for as things stood, he found it extremely distasteful that he was never allowed to see the woman who had been consorting with him for so long a time. But when his mother refused, alleging the shame felt by the woman, he bade on of his body-servants to conceal a light in the chamber; and when she came as usual, and was about to lay herself down, <a href=/people/346 target=_blank>Periander</a> jumped up and revealed the light: and when he saw that it was his mother, he made as if to kill her. However, he was restrained by a heaven-sent apparition, and desisted from his purpose, but from that time on he was a madman, afflicted in brain and heart; he fell into habits of savagery, and slaughtered many citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>.

Now on one occasion a public festival was being celebrated by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403197RCha class=ethnic long=19.7 lat=40.3>Chaonians</a>, and while all the people were feasting, the young pair slipped away and crept under a certain bush. But it so happened that the king’s son, Cichyrus, was hunting a leopard; the beast was driven into the same thicket, and he hurled his javelin at it; he missed it, but hit the girl. Thinking that he had hit his leopard, he rode up; but when he saw the lad trying to staunch the girl’s wound with his hands, he lost his senses, flung away and finally fell off his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> down a precipitous and stony ravine. There he perished; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403197RCha class=ethnic long=19.7 lat=40.3>Chaonians</a>, to honour their king, put a wall round the place and gave the name of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392205UEph class=place long=20.5321 lat=39.2409>Cichyrus</a> to the city so founded. The story is also found in some authorities that the thicket in question was sacred to Epirus, the daughter of <a href=/people/2870 target=_blank>Echion</a>; she had left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a> and was journeying with <a href=/people/443 target=_blank>Harmonia</a> and <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a>, bearing the remains of <a href=/people/283 target=_blank>Pentheus</a>; dying there, she was buried in this thicket.

She had no taste for indoor life and staying at home, but she got together a great pack of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> and used to hunt, never admitting anybody to her company.

After some considerable time had passed, she fell deeply in love with him: at first, restrained by shame, she would not confess her affection; but then, her passion growing stronger, she took courage to tell him, and so by mutual consent he took her to wife.
