He says that once only in his life has he felt fear: at the time when he was first impeached as a criminal by me; because he was only lately arrived from his province, and was branded with unpopularity and infamy, not modern but ancient and of long standing; and, besides that, the time was unlucky, being very ill-suited for corrupting the judges. </p>                        </div>

But he loaded him with all sorts of kindnesses.

For <a href=/people/2180 target=_blank>Philodamus</a> and his son are convicted by a few votes: <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> is present; urges and presses <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> to have them executed as speedily as possible, in order that as few as may be may bear of that man's nefarious wickedness. </p>                        </div>

Since the establishment of the praetorian power, we have always adopted this principle — that if no will was produced, then possession was given to that person who would have had the best right to be the heir, if the deceased had died intestate. Why this is the most righteous principle it is easy to show; but in a matter so established by precedent it is sufficient to point out that all men had previously laid down the law in this way, and that this was the ancient and customary edict.

For, as for <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a> himself, he was only a man of a covetousness ever open-mouthed, and ever threatening, but he had no ingenuity, no resources; so that, in whatever he did of his own accord, (just as you know was the case with him at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>,) he seemed to rob openly rather than to cheat. </p>                        </div>

He, while he was attending the praetor about all the markets, and never leaving him, had got into such familiarity with, and aptitude at the practice of selling <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>'s decrees and decisions, and managing his other concerns, that he was considered almost a second <a href=/people/1175 target=_blank>Timarchides</a>. </p>                        </div>

I do know that, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, when you were praetor, you did transfer by your edict the possession of inheritance from the children to strangers, from the first heirs to the second, from the laws to your own licentious covetousness. I do know that you corrected the edicts of all your predecessors, and gave possession of inheritance not according to the evidence of those who produced the will, but according to theirs who said that a will had been made. And I do know too that those new practices, first brought forward and invented by you, were a very great profit to you. I recollect, moreover, that you also abrogated and altered the laws of the censors about the keeping the public buildings in repair; so that he might not take the contract to whom the care of the building belonged; so that his guardians and relations might not consult the advantage, of their ward so as to prevent his being stripped of all his property; that you appointed a very limited time for the work, in order to exclude others from the business; but that with respect to the contractor you favoured, you did not observe any fixed time at all. </p>                        </div>

Consider yourselves in your own minds, whether you think any one ever did so, especially when it might have happened, not solely through covetousness, but even though ignorance. Many must have done so. But I say that all extorted more, and a great deal more, than the proper tenths. Tell me of one man, in the whole three years of your praetorship, who was condemned in the eightfold penalty. Condemned, indeed! Tell me of one man who was ever prosecuted according to your edict. There was not, in fact, one cultivator who was able to complain that injustice had been done to him; not one collector who claimed one grain more as due to him than really was due. Far from that. <a href=/people/375 target=_blank>Apronius</a> seized and carried off whatever he chose from every one.

All these edicts, I say, you issued after the tenths had been sold.

For it is a quality of tenths, that they cannot be managed without many papers; for it is necessary to keep an account of, and to set down in books the names of all the cultivators, and with each name the amount of their tenth. All the cultivators made returns of their acres according to your command and regulation; I do not believe that any one made a return of a smaller quantity than he had in cultivation, when there were so many crosses, so many penalties, so many judges of that retinue before his eyes. On an acre of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373150PLeo class=place long=14.9981 lat=37.2855>Leontini</a> ground about a medimnus of wheat is usually sown, according to the regular and constant allowance of seed.

He gave the money. Where did he get it? from his corn? As if, while you were praetor, he had anything to sell.

How, then, were they compelled to do so, except by violence and ill-treatment? Again; that man, that most senseless man, in the selling of the tenths, caused additional sums to be added to every tenth. It was not much; he added two or three thousand sesterces. In the three years he made about five hundred thousand sesterces.

As if any steward, from a farm which had been used to produce ten thousand sesterces, having cut down and sold the trees, having taken away the buildings and the stock, and having driven off all the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, sent his master twenty thousand sesterces instead of ten, and made a hundred thousand more for himself.

In the second place, if <a href=/people/375 target=_blank>Apronius</a> were condemned, all men were likely to think that the cause of <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a> was involved in his; this at all events <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> did now decide, and he determined that their affairs and their causes were identical, since he determined that, if <a href=/people/375 target=_blank>Apronius</a> were condemned, it would be a prejudging of the case of <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>. And one fact is at the same time a proof of two things; both that the cultivators gave much more than they owed to <a href=/people/375 target=_blank>Apronius</a> because they were constrained by violence and fear; and also, that <a href=/people/375 target=_blank>Apronius</a> was transacting <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>'s business in his own name, since Lucius <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> determined that <a href=/people/375 target=_blank>Apronius</a> could not be condemned without giving a decision at the same time respecting the wickedness and dishonesty of <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>.

[82] <br />This is the charge; I wish you to understand, that my accusation turns not on the fact of his having valued the corn, nor even of his having valued it at three denarii but on that of his having increased the quantity of corn, and consequently the amount of the valuation. In truth this valuation originated, O judges, at first not in the convenience of the praetors or consuls, but in the advantage to the cultivators and the cities. For originally, no one was so impudent as to demand money when it was corn that was due; certainly this proceeded in the first instance from the cultivator or from the city which was required to furnish corn; when they had either sold the corn, or wished to keep it, or were not willing to carry it to that place where it was required to be delivered, they begged as a kindness and a favour, that they might be allowed, instead of the corn, to give the value of the corn.

In a case of this kind it is easier to form one's opinion, than to make out a case for blame; because we can think the man who does this avaricious, but we cannot easily make out a charge against him; because it appears that we must grant this to our magistrates, that they may have power to receive the corn in any place they choose; therefore this is what many perhaps have done, not, however, so many out that those whom we recollect, or whom we have heard of as the most upright magistrates, have declined to do it.

So that you may see that the corn must be badly sold if it is got in well, or else that the crop must be bad if you get a good price for it. And the whole business of agriculture is such, that it is regulated not by reason or by industry, but by those most uncertain things — the weather and the winds. When from agriculture one tenth is extracted by law and on fair terms — when a second is levied by a new regulation, on account of the necessity of procuring a sufficient supply for ourselves — when, besides, corn is purchased every year by public authority — and when, after all that, more still is ordered by magistrates and lieutenants to be supplied for the granary — what, or how much is there after all this of his own crop which the cultivator or owner can have at his own disposal, for his own profit? </p>                        </div>

And they were aware that, in the provinces, if he who was there with the command and power 80 of a governor wished to purchase what was in any one's possession, and was allowed to do so, it would come to pass that he would get whatever he chose, whether it was to be sold or not, at whatever price he pleased.

I recollect that <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378124ULil class=person long=12.4342 lat=37.7991>Lilybaeum</a>, a connection of mine by ties of hospitality, and a personal friend of mine, a man of the highest birth, told me, that when that man had taken from him, by his absolute power, an ewer made by the hand of <a href=/people/1395 target=_blank>Boethus</a>, of exquisite workmanship and great weight, he went home very sad in truth, and greatly agitated, because a vessel of that sort, which had been left to him by his father and his forefathers, and which he was accustomed to use on days of festival, and on the arrival of ancient friends, had been taken from him. While I was sitting at home, said he, in great indignation, up comes one of the slaves of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>; he orders me immediately to bring to the praetor some embossed goblets. I was greatly vexed, said he; I had two; I order them both to be taken out of the closet, lest any worse thing should happen, and to be brought after me to the praetor's house. When I got there the praetor was asleep; the Cibyratic brothers were walking about, and when they saw me, they said, <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a>, where are the cups? I show them with great grief; — they praise them. — I begin to complain that I shall have nothing left of any value at all, if my cups too were taken away. Then they, when they see me vexed, say, What are you willing to give us to prevent these from being taken from you? To make my story short, I said that I would give six hundred sesterces. Meantime the praetor summons us; he asks for the cups. Then they began to say to the praetor, that they had thought from what they had heard, that <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a>'s cups were of some value, but that they were miserable things, quite unworthy of <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a>'s having them among his plate. He said, he thought so too. </p>                        </div>

[15] <br />But when I heard this, I then for the first time understood that that was the use of these two Cibyratic brothers; that in his robberies he used his own hands, but their eyes. But he was so covetous of that splendid reputation of being thought to be a judge of such matters, that lately, (just observe the man's madness,) after his case was adjourned, when he was already as good as condemned, and civilly dead, at the time of the games of the circus, when early in the morning the couches were spread in preparation for a banquet at the house of Lucius <a href=/people/1851 target=_blank>Sisenna</a>, a man of the first consideration, and when the plate was all set out, and when, as was suited to the dignity of Lucius <a href=/people/1851 target=_blank>Sisenna</a>, the house was full of honourable men, he came to the plate, and began in a leisurely way to examine and consider every separate piece. Some marveled at the folly of the man, who, while his trial was actually going on, was increasing the suspicion of that covetousness of which he was accused; others marveled at his insensibility, that any such things could come into his head, when the time for judgment in his cause was so near at hand, and when so many witnesses had spoken against him. But <a href=/people/1851 target=_blank>Sisenna</a>'s servants, who, I suppose, had heard the evidence which had been given against him, never took their eyes off him, and never departed out of reach of the plate. </p>                        </div>

Do not suppose then that any one produced his carved plate out of his house for another man to steal, without the greatest distress. Everything is brought down to the shore. The Cibyratic brothers are summoned; they condemn some articles; whatever they approve of has its figures in relief or its embossed emblems torn off.

The kings, whom I have spoken of, had brought to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> a candelabrum of the finest jewels, made with most extraordinary skill, in order to place it in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>; but as they found that temple not yet finished, they could not place it there. Nor were they willing to display it and produce it in common, in order that it might seem more splendid when it was placed at its proper time in the shrine of the great and good <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>; and brighter; also, as its beauty would come fresh and untarnished before the eyes of men. They determined, therefore, to take it back with them into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, with the intention, when they should hear that the image of the great and good <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> was dedicated, of sending ambassadors who should bring that exquisite and most beautiful present, with other offerings, to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>. </p>                        </div>

For the king had wished it kept entirely concealed; not because he feared or suspected anything, but because he did not wish many to feast their eyes on it before the Roman people. He begs the king, and entreats him most earnestly to send it to him; he says that he longs to look at it himself, and that he will not allow any one else to see it. <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, being both of a childlike and royal disposition, suspected nothing of that man's dishonesty, and orders his servants to take it as secretly as possible, and well wrapped up, to the praetor's house. And when they brought it there, and placed it on a table, having taken off the coverings, <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a> began to exclaim that it was a thing worthy of the kingdom of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, worthy of being a royal present, worthy of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>. In truth, it was of such splendour as a thing must be which is made of the most brilliant and beautiful jewels; of such variety of pattern that the skill of the workmanship seemed to vie with the richness of the materials; and of such a size that it might easily be seen that it had been made not for the furniture of men, but for the decoration of a most noble temple. And when he appeared to have examined it sufficiently, the servants begin to take it up to carry it back again. He says that he wishes to examine it over and over again; that he is not half satiated with the sight of it; he orders them to depart and to leave the candelabrum.

The deputies from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/359144IMel class=place long=14.44 lat=35.88>Melita</a> sent by the public authority of their state, say that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358146SHer class=place long=14.5522 lat=35.8459>shrine</a> of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a> was plundered; that that man left nothing in that most holy temple; that that place, to which the fleets of enemies often came, where <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> are accustomed to winter almost every year, and which no <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirate</a> ever violated, no enemy ever attacked before, was so plundered by that single man, that nothing whatever was left in it. What, then, now are we to say of him as a defendant, of me as an accuser, of this tribunal? Is he proved guilty of grave crimes, or is he brought into this court on mere suspicion? Gods are proved to have been carried off, temples to have been plundered, cities to have been stripped of everything. And of those actions he has left himself no power of denying one, no plea for defending one. In every particular he is convicted by me; he is detected by the witnesses; he is overwhelmed by his own admissions; he is caught in the evident commission of guilt; and even now he remains here, and in silence recognises his own crimes as I enumerate them. </p>                        </div>

For ever since Marcus <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a> left it all the regulations and edicts of the praetors have been to this effect, that no slave should ever be seen with a weapon. What I am going to mention is an old story, and one, probably, owing to the severity of the example, not unknown to any one of you. They tell a story that Lucius <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> was praetor in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, and that an immense <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> was brought to him; that he, marveling at the size of the beast, asked who had killed it. When he was told that it was such-an-one's shepherd, he ordered him to be summoned before him; that the shepherd came eagerly to the praetor, expecting praise and reward; that <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> asked him how he had slain so huge a beast; that he answered With a hunting spear; and that he was instantly crucified by order of the praetor. This may, perhaps, appear harsh: I say nothing either way; all that I understand from the story is, that <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> preferred to appear cruel in punishing, to seeming negligent in overlooking offences.

For what did you want of a ship? when, if you were going anywhere on account of the state, ships were provided for you at the public expense, both to convey you, and to guard you?

Did you dare to drag any one to the cross who said that he was a Roman citizen? I was unwilling, O judges, to press this point so strongly at the former pleading; I was unwilling to do so. For you saw how the feelings of the multitude were excited against him with indignation, and hatred, and fear of their common danger. I, at that time, fixed a limit to my oration, and checked the eagerness of Caius <a href=/people/8036 target=_blank>Numitorius</a> a Roman knight, a man of the highest character, one of my witnesses. And I rejoiced that <a href=/people/1243 target=_blank>Glabrio</a> had acted (and he had acted most wisely) as he did in dismissing that witness immediately, in the middle of the discussion. In fact he was afraid that the Roman people might seem to have inflicted that punishment on <a href=/people/88 target=_blank>Verres</a> by tumultuary violence, which he was anxious he should only suffer according to the laws and by your judicial sentence. </p>                        </div>
