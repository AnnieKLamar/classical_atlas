We have a very brutal master, a perfect glutton for beans, and most bad-tempered; 'tis Demos the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BPny class=person long=23.7193 lat=37.9715>Pnyx</a>, an intolerable old man and half deaf. The beginning of last month he bought a slave, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap class=demonym long=30 lat=41>Paphlagonian</a> tanner, an arrant rogue, the incarnation of calumny. This man of leather knows his old master thoroughly; he plays the fawning cur, flatters, cajoles; wheedles, and dupes him at will with little scraps of leavings, which he allows him to get. Dear Demos, he will say, try a single case and you will have done enough; then take your bath, eat, swallow and devour; here are three obols. Then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap class=demonym long=30 lat=41>Paphlagonian</a> filches from one of us what we have prepared and makes a present of it to our old man.

He keeps us at a distance and suffers none but himself to wait upon the master; when Demos is dining, he keeps close to his side with a thong in his hand and puts the orators to flight. He keeps singing oracles to him, so that the old man now thinks of nothing but the <a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibyl</a>. Then, when he sees him thoroughly obfuscated, he uses all his cunning and piles up lies and calumnies against the household; then we are scourged and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap class=demonym long=30 lat=41>Paphlagonian</a> runs about among the slaves to demand contributions with threats and gathers 'em in with both hands. He will say, You see how I have had <a href=/people/1258 target=_blank>Hylas</a> beaten! Either content me or die at once! We are forced to give, for else the old man tramples on us and makes us spew forth all our body contains. There must be an end to it, friend. Let us see! what can be done?

From here I rushed straight to the Senate, right in the track of this man; he was already letting loose the storm, unchaining the lightning, crushing the Knights beneath huge mountains of calumnies heaped together and having all the air of truth; he called you conspirators and his lies caught root like weeds in every mind; dark were the looks on every side and brows were knitted. When I saw that the Senate listened to him favourably and was being tricked by his imposture, I said to myself, Come, gods of rascals and braggarts, gods of all fools, <a href=/people/10990 target=_blank>toad</a>-eaters and braggarts and thou, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237XAgo class=place long=23.723 lat=37.975>Agora</a>, where I was bred from my earliest days, give me unbridled audacity, an untiring chatter and a shameless voice.

All faces brightened at once and I was voted a chaplet for my good tidings; and I added, With a couple of words I will reveal to you, how you can have quantities of anchovies for an obol; 'tis to seize on all the dishes the merchants have. With mouths gaping with admiration, they applauded me. However, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap class=demonym long=30 lat=41>Paphlagonian</a> winded the matter and, well knowing the sort of language which pleases the Senate best, said, Friends, I am resolved to offer one hundred <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> to the goddess in recognition of this happy event. </p>                        </div>

The Senators then stood talking noisily about the anchovies. <a href=/people/285 target=_blank>Cleon</a>, however, begged them to listen to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonian</a> envoy, who had come to make proposals of peace; but all with one accord, cried, 'Tis certainly not the moment to think of peace now!

And with loud shouts they demanded that the <a href=/people/1337 target=_blank>Prytanes</a> should close the sitting and then leapt over the rails in all directions. As for me, I slipped away to buy all the coriander seed and leeks there were on the market and gave it to them gratis as seasoning for their anchovies. 'Twas marvellous!
