Otherwise we will come and conquer you. 32 So Athenobius the friend of the king came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and when he saw the splendor of <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a>, and the sideboard with its gold and silver plate, and his great magnificence, he was amazed. He reported to him the words of the king, 33 but <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a> gave him this reply: We have neither taken foreign land nor seized foreign property, but only the inheritance of our fathers, which at one time had been unjustly taken by our enemies. 34 Now that we have the opportunity, we are firmly holding the inheritance of our fathers. 35 As for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/320348UJop class=place long=34.752 lat=32.054>Joppa</a> and <a href=/people/7703 target=_blank>Gazara</a>, which you demand, they were causing great damage among the people and to our land; for them we will give you a hundred talents. Athenobius did not answer him a word, 36 but returned in wrath to the king and reported to him these words and the splendor of <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a> and all that he had seen. And the king was greatly angered. 37 Now <a href=/people/891 target=_blank>Trypho</a> embarked on a ship and escaped to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/345360UOrt class=place long=35.954 lat=34.5057>Orthosia</a>. <br /> 38 Then the king made Cendebeus commander-in-chief of the coastal country, and gave him troops of infantry and cavalry. 39 He commanded him to encamp against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>, and commanded him to build up Kedron and fortify its gates, and to make war on the people; but the king pursued <a href=/people/891 target=_blank>Trypho</a>. </p>                        </div>

Take my place and my brother's, and go out and fight for our nation, and may the help which comes from <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a> be with you. 4 So John chose out of the country twenty thousand warriors and horsemen, and they marched against Cendebeus and camped for the night in Modein. <br /> 5 Early in the morning they arose and marched into the plain, and behold, a large force of infantry and horsemen was coming to meet them; and a stream lay between them. 6 Then he and his army lined up against them. And he saw that the soldiers were afraid to cross the stream, so he crossed over first; and when his men saw him, they crossed over after him. 7 Then he divided the army and placed the horsemen in the midst of the infantry, for the cavalry of the enemy were very numerous. 8 And they sounded the trumpets, and Cendebeus and his army were put to flight, and many of them were wounded and fell; the rest fled into the stronghold. 9 At that time <a href=/people/11036 target=_blank>Judas</a> the brother of John was wounded, but John pursued them until Cendebeus reached Kedron, which he had built. </p>                        </div>
