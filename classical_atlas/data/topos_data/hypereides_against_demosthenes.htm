Against <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a><br />Personally, gentlemen of the jury, as I was just saying to those seated beside me, what surprises me is this. Is it really true that <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, unlike any other man in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, is exempt from the laws which enforce an agreement made by a person against his own interests? Is he unaffected by the people's decrees, which you have sworn to observe in voting, decrees which were proposed, not by any of his enemies, but by <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> himself, and which the people carried on his motion, almost as though he deliberately sought to destroy himself . . . and yet the just verdict, gentlemen of the jury, is, as I see it, simple: it is in our favor against <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>. In private suits differences are often settled by challenge, and that is how this affair also has been settled. Look at it in this way, gentlemen. The people accused you, <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, of having accepted twenty talents illegally, against the interests of the state. You denied having done so and drew up a challenge, which you laid before the people in the form of a decree entrusting the matter on which you were accused to the council of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=place long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagus</a>. . . . </p>                        </div>

Perhaps you will end by asking what you used it for after you obtained it, as though you were demanding a banker's statement from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=place long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagus</a>. I, on the other hand, should like to know from you why the council of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=place long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagus</a> said . . .. . . the reports. On the contrary they have shown, as you will recognize, an exceptionally democratic spirit in handling the affair. </p>                        </div>

It is not only his own trial which <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> has in mind when he determines to mislead you by abusing the report; he wishes also to frustrate all the other prosecutions which the city has in hand. That is a point to be carefully borne in mind and you must not be deceived by the defendant's argument. For these reports concerning the money of <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a> have all been drawn up by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=place long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagus</a> on an equal footing. They are the same for all the accused. In no case has the council added the reason why it publishes a particular name. It stated summarily how much money each man had received, adding that he was liable for that amount. Is <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> to have more weight with you than the report given against him? . . . For of course this argument, if it protects <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, will also protect the rest. The sum on which you are pronouncing judgement is not twenty, but four hundred, talents. You are judging all the crimes, not one. For your mad conduct, <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, has made you champion of all these criminals, foremost in danger as you are in impudence. In my opinion the fact that you took the gold is proved to the jury well enough by your being condemned by the council to which you entrusted yourself. . . .When <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a> arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, gentlemen of the jury, and the envoys from <a href=/people/489 target=_blank>Philoxenus</a> demanding him were, at the same time, brought into the Assembly, <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> came forward and made a long speech in which he argued that it was not right for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> to surrender <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a> to the envoys from <a href=/people/489 target=_blank>Philoxenus</a>, and that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> must not be left with any cause for complaint, on his account, against the people; the safest course for the city was to guard the money and the person of <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a>, and to take up all the money, with which <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a> had entered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAkr class=place long=23.7257 lat=37.9717>Acropolis</a> on the following day, while <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a> himself should announce then and there how much money there was. His real purpose, it seems, was not simply to learn the figure, but to find out from how large a sum he was to collect his commission. Sitting below in his usual place in the niche, he told <a href=/people/1709 target=_blank>Mnesitheus</a> the dancer to ask <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a> how much money there would be to take up to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAkr class=place long=23.7257 lat=37.9717>Acropolis</a>. The answer given was seven hundred talents. . . . He had told you himself in the Assembly that that was the correct figure; and yet when the total brought up to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAkr class=place long=23.7257 lat=37.9717>Acropolis</a> was three hundred and fifty talents instead of seven hundred, having by then received his twenty, he did not utter a word. . . . After saying before the Assembly that there were seven hundred talents you now bring up half. . . .<a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a> would not have bought . . . nor would the city be exposed to accusation and reproach. But of all these things, <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> . . . It was you who decreed that a guard should be posted over the person of <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a>. Yet when it relaxed its vigilance you did not try to restore it, and after it was disbanded you did not prosecute those responsible. I suppose you went unpaid for your shrewd handling of the crisis? If <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a> distributed his gold among the lesser orators, who had nothing to give but noise and shouting, what of you who control our whole policy? Did he pass you over? That is incredible. So supreme is the contempt, gentlemen of the jury, with which <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> has treated the affair, or to be quite frank, you and the laws, that at the outset, it seems, he admitted having taken the money but said that he had used it on your behalf and had borrowed it free of interest for the Theoric fund. <a href=/people/6373 target=_blank>Cnosion</a> and his other friends went about saying that <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> would be compelled by his accusers to publish facts which he wished kept secret and to admit that he had borrowed the money free of interest for the state to meet expenses of government. Since the anger of those of you who heard this statement was greatly increased by these aspersions cast on your democracy, on the grounds that he was not content to have taken bribes himself but thought fit to infect the people too . . . speaking and complaining that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=place long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagus</a> was seeking favor with <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and for that reason wanted to destroy him. As if you did not all know that no one destroys the kind of man who can be bought. On the contrary, it is the opponent who can be neither persuaded nor corrupted with bribes that men contrive to be rid of by any means in their power. There is some likelihood, it seems, that you, <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, are deaf to prayers and not to be persuaded into taking bribes? Do not imagine, gentlemen, that only trivial matters are affected by the venal conduct of these men. For it is no secret that all who conspire for power in Greece secure the smaller cities by force of arms and the larger ones by buying the influential citizens in them; and we know that <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a> reached the height he did because, at the outset, he sent money to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, and the rest of Greece, and those with power in the cities and authority. . . </p>                        </div>

Will you dare then presently to speak to me of friendship . . . you yourself broke up that friendship when you accepted bribes against your country and made a change of front. You made yourself a laughing stock and brought disgrace on those who had ever shared your policy in former years. When we might have gained the highest distinction in public life and been accompanied for the remainder of our lives by the best of reputations, you frustrated all these hopes, and you are not ashamed, even at your age, to be tried by youths for bribery. And yet the positions ought to be reversed: your generation ought to be training the younger orators, reproving and punishing any over-impetuous action. But the fact is just the opposite: the youths are taking to task the men of over sixty. Therefore, gentlemen of the jury, you have a right to feel resentful towards <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>; for after gaining a tolerable reputation and great riches, all through you, even on the threshold of old age he has no loyalty to his country.

For to take money is not so serious as to take it from the wrong source, and the private individuals who took the gold are not so culpable as the orators and generals. Why is that? Because the private individuals were given the money by <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a> for safe-keeping, but the generals and orators have accepted it with some policy in view. The laws prescribe that ordinary offenders shall pay a simple fine but that men accepting bribes shall pay ten times the usual sum. Therefore, just as we can lawfully fix the penalty for these men, so also . . . from you against them. . . . It is as I said in the Assembly. You give full permission, gentlemen of the jury, to the orators and generals to reap substantial rewards. It is not the laws which grant them this privilege but your tolerance and generosity. But on one point you insist: your interests must be furthered, not opposed, with the money they receive. Now <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> and <a href=/people/570 target=_blank>Demades</a>, from actual decrees passed in the city and from proxenies, have each received, I believe, more than sixty talents, quite apart from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> funds and money sent from <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. If neither of these sources suffices for them, and they have now accepted bribes which threaten the city's life itself, can we doubt our right to punish them? Suppose that one of you, mere private individuals, during the tenure of some office, makes a mistake through ignorance or inexperience; he will be overwhelmed in court by the eloquence of these men and will either lose his life or be banished from his country. Shall they themselves, after harming the city on such a scale, escape unscathed? <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380239DPai class=person long=23.8553 lat=37.9585>Paeania</a> took theoric money for his son who was abroad.

Later, too, though we were often brought to trial on the strength of that policy and the war itself, these men did not vote against us once but brought us safely through everything; and one could not have a more impressive, or a surer sign of popular favor. . . . the people so behaved that though deprived themselves by fortune of their crown of glory, they did not take from us the wreath which they had granted.
