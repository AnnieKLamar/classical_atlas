It was a story about <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a>. The grove was a beautiful place, abounding in trees and flowers. Streams of water gushed down, flowing from the same spring that nourished the trees and flowers. But I found more pleasure in the painting, instilled as it was with unparalleled artistry and the fortunes of <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a>. Many strangers, hearing about it, came to worship the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> and gaze upon its images. It showed women giving birth, others wrapping the newborn in swaddling clothes, exposed infants, flocks of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> suckling the babies, shepherds picking them up, and young people arranging marriages. There was a <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirate</a> raid and an invasion by the enemy. Many other things relating to <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> were there. I watched, and as I watched and stood amazed, passionate longing came over me to paint a response in writing to the painting. I searched out someone to interpret the images, and I completed four books. I offer them to <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> and the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> and <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a> as well as to all my fellows to be their delight and possession. It will heal whoever is ailing, console and comfort whoever is mourning, evoke memories for whoever has felt <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a>, and educate whoever has yet to feel <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a>. No one has escaped <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> or will escape <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> as long as there is beauty, and eyes see. May the gods grant me self-restraint in depicting what others have done. </p>                        </div>

A strait whose waters flow gently from the sea separates it from the mainland. Many bridges of wood and brilliant white stone garnish its roads. You would not believe that you're looking at a city but an island. Some twenty miles outward lies the estate of a prosperous man, a very beautiful property.

The sea dashed upon expansive beaches of soft sand. </p>                        </div>

All around was a copse of oaks and brambles and wandering ivy and soft grass, and on the grass was lying the child. A <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> was scurrying about constantly and kept disappearing from sight, leaving her <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kid</a> alone. (She was tending to a baby.) <a href=/people/971 target=_blank>Lamon</a> watched her running back and forth and took pity on her neglected <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kid</a>. During the heat of midday, he followed the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>'s tracks and beheld her bestriding the child, taking care not to trample him with her hooves. The infant was sucking her milk as if from his mother's breast. <a href=/people/971 target=_blank>Lamon</a> gawked at the sight — as well he might. He came nearer and found a male child of great size and beauty bound in swaddling clothes that assured exposure from fortunate parents.

She agreed with her husband about what to do.

Statues of the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> had been sculpted out of living rock inside. They were barefoot, their arms bare to the shoulder, and their hair falling freely across their necks. They wore a belt on their waists. They were smiling and were shown dancing. Half way into the cave, water was gushing forth from a spring, forming a flowing stream that nourished a lush and grassy meadow that spread round the mouth of the cave. Laid up inside were drinking bowels, all sorts of pipes and flutes, the offerings of shepherds of days gone by. </p>                        </div>

She looked lost. The shepherd wanted to stop her and restore her to good order. He twisted a pliable sprig into a noose and approached the rock to lasso her, but when he arrived, he saw nothing of what he was expecting. The ewe was acting like a human mother, giving her breast in a plentiful flow of milk to a child who was not crying but greedily sucking, moving her pure and fair mouth from one teat to the other. When the child was satisfied, the animal licked her face clean with her tongue. The child was a girl infant whose swaddling clothes lay beside her along with a girdle interwoven with golden threads. sandals gilded with gold, and golden anklets. </p>                        </div>

He came into his hut and told his wife what he had seen and showed her what he found. He implored her to care for the child as their own and raise her as their own daughter and forget what happened.

The boy touched them both with one arrow and ordered that for the future that the boy tend the herd of <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> and the girl the flocks of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>. </p>                        </div>

Were the children to turn out to be goatherds and shepherds? For this, when their swaddling clothes promised so much better an outcome and fortune? Was it because of that fortune that they raised the children on fine foods and taught them their letters and many beautiful things from country life? Still, it was prudent to obey the gods in dealing with children spared by the gods' doing. They shared their dreams with one another and sacrificed in the cave of the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> to the Winged Boy, for they couldn't state his name. They sent the children out with the herds but not before instructing them in each task — how they should go to pasture before noon and return after the heat abated, when they were to lead the flocks to water and to rest, when they should use their staff or their voice. The children were exuberant and accepted the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> and <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> as their magnificent empire. They loved them more than shepherds are wont to do. <a href=/people/12225 target=_blank>Chloe</a> traced her rescue back to a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, while <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a> remembered how he was exposed and a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> suckled him. </p>                        </div>

She forgot to eat, lay awake at night, and lost interest in her <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>. One moment she was laughing, a moment later, she was sobbing. First, she sat down, then she popped up. Her face grew pale, and then it blazed red. She was more restless than a <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a> in heat.

He stood in awe of her as if he gained eyes for the first time and was maimed before then. He took only enough food to taste and enough drink to moisten his lips.

The <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> heard the sound and recognized the melody. They bellowed and in unison leaped into the sea.

His was broken, you see, and he needed to haul up a rock to press his crushed grapes. He came down to the sea without anyone seeing him, and approached the unguarded ship. He loosened the stern cable and took it home to use for his business. In the morning, the young men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394262PMet class=place long=26.1769 lat=39.3692>Methymne</a> mounted a search for the cable, and as no one confessed to the theft, they mildly reproved their hosts and set out down the coast.

The <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> ran all over the place, barking and braying, and frightened the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>. The <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> quit their mountain pasture and raced to the beach. There wasn't anything for them to eat in the sand, but the bolder ones among them went to the ship and began eating the green rope that bound the ship. A wind down from across the mountain was blowing and stirring up the waves of the sea. The ebb tide quickly lifted up the ship and, since it was untied, carried it out into the high seas. When the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394262PMet class=ethnic long=26.1769 lat=39.3692>Methymneans</a> saw what had happened, some ran into the sea and others tried to round up the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>.

He came upon a promontory that extended into the sea in a crescent shape. Within its curvature the sea formed an anchorage calmer than harbors. He let out the anchors and secured the ships at sea so no one from the land could harass them. Then he gave his men leave for recreations of peace time. Since they had an abundance of everything in the plunder, the men drank and played games and carried on as if in a victory celebration. The day passed in this way, and with the onset of night, they stopped their festivities. Suddenly, the whole earth seem ablaze with fire, and a loud dashing noise was heard like that of oars of a vast fleet striking the water. One man cried out: To arms. Another called out to the general. That man seemed to be wounded, while this one looked exactly like a corpse. You would think you were looking at a naval battle found at night against an enemy, but none was in sight. </p>                        </div>

The oars snapped in pieces when they sat down to row. <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphins</a> were leaping out of the sea and striking the ship with their tails, and the planks were beginning to loosen.

A heavy snow fell suddenly and choked all the roads and barricaded the farmers in their homes. Water cascaded down in swollen torrents, while ice covered everything. The trees looked like they were about to split apart. The ground was blanketed except for the fringes of springs and rivers. No one led the flocks to pasture or ventured outside, but at the first call of the cock, they stoked the fires up high and busied themselves with spinning flax, carding <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>'s hair, and devising snares for catching birds. </p>                        </div>

Now they passed one sleepless night after another and days expended in misery. They looked forward to Spring as a resurrection from death itself. The touch of the bag that once held things to eat brought them pain. The sight of a drinking cup or a pipe, once a lover's gift, carelessly thrown away, filled them with agony. They prayed constantly to the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> and <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a> to release them from this awful plight and show them and their flocks the sun.

The trees were near one another, and the ivy stretched out between them. It spread out over the branches like a grape vine and, with its interlocking leaves, formed a kind of cave. Clusters of fruit as large as grapes hung down from the branches. Uncounted numbers of birds were attracted to the ivy as the only source of food they could find. Blackbirds, thrushes, wood pigeons, starlings and whatever other winged creature that ate ivy flocked about the enclosure. So, <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a> filled his bag with honeyed treats and set out on the pretext of hunting these birds.

All kinds of birds visited the spot, and enough were caught for him to have trouble collecting, killing, and plucking them. But nobody came out of the house, not man nor young woman nor fowl. Everyone stayed shut up in the house around the hearth. <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a> didn't know what to do. It looked like he arrived under evil birds of omen. Still, he resolved to get inside so he fashioned explanations and rehearsed the ones that sounded most persuasive to him. <br />I came to get fire for the hearth. Oh, the neighbors are only a few feet away. I came to borrow some bread. But your bag is full. I need wine. How? You harvested your grapes only the day before yesterday. A <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> chased me. Is that so? Where are his tracks? I came to hunt birds. In that case, when you finished, why didn't you leave?

He sat down before the fire and took the pigeons and blackbirds from his shoulder and put them on the table. He told them how bored he was with keeping house and how he ventured forth to hunt and how he trapped some birds with his snares and others with the lime as they were squabbling in the ivy. They praised his initiative and invited him to join they in eating what the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> had left behind.

She was pretending to be angry at <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a> because he came over to house but was going to leave without seeing her.

They sprinted to the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> and their cave, next to <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a> and his pine tree, and finally to the oak. Sitting beside it, they watched over their flocks and sought kisses from one another. They wanted to garland the gods so they rummaged around looking for flowers. Some, nurtured by the west wind and warmed by the sun, had just come out. They found violets, a narcissus, a pimpernel, and other first fruits of Spring. They milked the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> and <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, crowned the gods' statues, and poured libations of fresh milk. They also offered a pipe as if challenging the nightingales to a music contest.

The sight would arouse the urge to make love even in old men. But the young men were positively jumping out of their skins and exploding with energy.

Out in front of them all was <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a>, seeing how he had squandered his youth all winter in hanging around the house and doing nothing.

This is the only thing left from <a href=/people/1163 target=_blank>Philetas</a>' instructions. It may be the sole remedy for relieving the pains of love. What more is there, <a href=/people/12225 target=_blank>Chloe</a> asked, besides kissing and hugging and lying down together? <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a> replied: What the rams do with the ewes and the he-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> with the females. Don't you see that, after they do that thing, the females don't run away from the males, and the males don't wear themselves out chasing the females, but after they've shared the pleasures, they settle down and graze together? This thing is somehow sweet, as it seems, and subdues the bitterness of love. You've seen, I'm sure, <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a>, how the males do it standing up and the females have it done to them standing up? and how the males mount the females, and the females bear them on their backs? But you want me to lie down beside you naked? Besides, those females are so much hairier than I am fully clothed. Nonetheless, <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a> won her over and, stretching out beside her, he lay there naked for a long time. Since he didn't know how to do anything that he craved, he stood up again and grasped her from behind, trying to imitate the he-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>. But he became even more puzzled. He sat down and burst into tears at the thought that the rams knew more than he did about love. </p>                        </div>

He was past his prime, but he had a wife, a foreigner from the city, who was young, fresh and saucy, and far too uppity for country life. Her name was Lykainion. Each day, she watched <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a> driving his <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> in the morning out to pasture and back again at night. She lusted to seduce <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a> and make him her lover. So, one day she ambushed him when he was alone and gave him gifts, a pipe and a full honeycomb and a deer skin bag, but she stopped short of saying anything. Even she could see that he was devoted to the girl <a href=/people/12225 target=_blank>Chloe</a>. She gathered as much from the glances and laughter they shared. Lykainion's next assault came early one morning. She made up a story for her husband that she was going to visit a woman who was having a baby. She followed <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a> and <a href=/people/12225 target=_blank>Chloe</a> and hid behind some bushes so they wouldn't see her. She heard everything they said and saw everything they did. She didn't miss <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a>'s cries of frustration. She felt sorry for the two young people but she also recognized a double opportunity to help them and, at the same time, get what she wanted from <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a>.

She ordered him to sit down beside her, just as he was, and to kiss her in the usual way and number. Then, while he was kissing her, she told him to embrace her and lie down on the ground.

Resolving to stay with the usual pleasures he enjoyed with <a href=/people/12225 target=_blank>Chloe</a>, he left the woods, and coming to where she was weaving a garland of violets, he made up a story about how he snatched the goose out of the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a>'s claws.

There was no wind but a dead calm, and the fishermen had decided to row, which they were doing at great effort. They were hurrying to bring their catch into the city for a certain rich man while it was still fresh. As is the custom for sailors to take their minds off their toils, one man, the coxswain, sang sea ditties for them while the rest, like a chorus, shouted out in unison to the time of his voice. When they were on the open sea, their voices couldn't be heard, but when they drew underneath the promontory and were driving into the crescent-shaped bay, their shouting was magnified, and the songs of the rowers spilled clearly over onto the land. The plain was actually a hollow valley facing them that received the sound like an instrument and returned an echo that reproduced everything. The sounds of the oars and the voices of the sailors, each returned separately and distinctly. Sounds from the sea came first to be followed by sounds from the land, all very enjoyable to hear. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/12225 target=_blank>Chloe</a>, experiencing an echo for the first time, looked first to the sea when the sailors were calling time, and then she turned away to the forest, looking for whoever was shouting back. When they had sailed by, she asked <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a>: Is there a sea on the other side of the promontory, and was another ship sailing by with other sailors singing the same songs. Did they all fall silent at the same moment? <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a> laughed sweetly and gave her a kiss that was even sweeter. He put a wreath of violets upon her and began to tell her the story of <a href=/people/741 target=_blank>Echo</a>, but only after asking in return for his lesson a payment of ten more of her kisses. <br />The family of the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a>, my girl, is large.

All are beautiful, and all are skilled in music. <a href=/people/741 target=_blank>Echo</a> was the daughter of one of these <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a>. She was mortal from her father, but beautiful from her beautiful mother. She was raised by the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a>, and the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> taught her how to play the pipe and the flute and songs for the lyre and others for the guitar, every sort of song. When she reached the flower of her maidenhood, she joined in choruses with the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> and sang with the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. She fled all males, both human and divine, out of love for her maidenhood. <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a> was angered by the girl out of envy for her gift of music and his own failure to have her beauty. He threw madness into the shepherds and goatherds. Like <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> or <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a>, they tore her apart and threw her across the whole earth while she was still singing songs. <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> as a favor to the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> hid all her songs and preserved their music. At the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>' request, <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> sends back a voice and imitates every sound just as the girl used to do, the sounds of gods, men, musical instruments, and animals. She even imitates <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a> playing his pipe. When he hears these sounds, he leaps up and pursues them to find out who his secret student is. When he finished, <a href=/people/12225 target=_blank>Chloe</a> did not kiss him ten times but countless times, for <a href=/people/741 target=_blank>Echo</a> repeated everything <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a> said as if bearing witness that he was telling her the truth. </p>                        </div>

He did not dare to talk to <a href=/people/971 target=_blank>Lamon</a> about this, but he took heart and revealed his love to <a href=/people/1843 target=_blank>Myrtale</a>, laying out before her what he had to say about marriage. That night <a href=/people/1843 target=_blank>Myrtale</a> shared what he said with <a href=/people/971 target=_blank>Lamon</a>. <a href=/people/971 target=_blank>Lamon</a> opposed the whole idea and rebuked her for suggesting a shepherd's daughter for their boy who held out the prospect — as the tokens proved — of a great reward for themselves and who, when he found his kinsmen, would make them free and masters of larger fields. <a href=/people/1843 target=_blank>Myrtale</a> was afraid that if <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a> were completely dashed in his hopes for love, he would do something fatal so she told him different reasons for <a href=/people/971 target=_blank>Lamon</a>'s objections. We are poor people, my child, and we need a bride who will bring something more into the house. Wealthy people have need for wealthy bridegrooms. Go now, and persuade <a href=/people/12225 target=_blank>Chloe</a>, have her persuade her father to ask for nothing big but allow her to be married. She loves you in every way and prefers to lie with a handsome but poor man rather than a rich man who looks like a monkey. </p>                        </div>

When <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a> fell far short of what he wanted, he did what impoverished lovers usually do — he burst into tears. Once again he called upon the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> for help.

A bag containing three thousand drachmas was spit back by a wave and lies hidden beneath seaweed near a dead <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphin</a>.

I also know how to plow a field and winnow grain in the wind. <a href=/people/12225 target=_blank>Chloe</a> is my witness for how I tend my herd. I started with fifty she-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> and increased their number to twice as many.

I'm young and a faultless neighbor. A <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> suckled me as an ewe did <a href=/people/12225 target=_blank>Chloe</a>.

When he came upon them, they were measuring the barley that had just been winnowed and were feeling glum that there wasn't much more than what was needed for sowing. He consoled them about their situation, agreeing that scarcity was everywhere. He then asked that <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a> be <a href=/people/12225 target=_blank>Chloe</a>'s. He said that, although the others were offering many gifts for her, he wasn't going to accept anything from them. Besides, he would give something from his own house. The children were raised together and, while shepherding, were touched by a friendship that could not easily be undone. Now they have arrived at the age when they could sleep with one another. He pointed this out and more, seeing how he was speaking to persuade them, having already his prize of the three thousand drachmas. <a href=/people/971 target=_blank>Lamon</a> could not plead poverty as his excuse (for <a href=/people/693 target=_blank>Dryas</a> and Nape were not being overbearing about it). Still, he couldn't come out and admit the truth — that <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a> was better than such a marriage.

One apple tree had been harvested, and no longer had any fruit or leaves. The branches, all of them, were bare. Only one apple remained very high up on its highest branch.

Its fruit was ripening as if locked in a competition with the fruits of the trees. Besides cultivated trees, the garden held cypresses, laurels, plane-trees and pines. To them all, an ivy clung instead of a vine. Its clusters of berries were big and turning black, looking for all the world like clusters of grapes. Within these trees stood the fruit-bearing trees as if they were being guarded by the outer ring of trees that bore no fruit. Outside all of the trees was a small fence. Each tree was separate and divided from the others as was each trunk from every other. Overhead, the branches fell into one another and interlaced their leaves. The nature of the place seemed to have been artfully constructed. There were also flower beds containing both wild flowers, violets, narcissus, and pimpernels, and cultivated flowers, roses, hyacinths, and lilies.

He knew that the master enjoyed his garden very much, and so he conceived the plan to destroy and disfigure it as much as he could. If he tried to cut down the trees, the noise would give him away. He decided instead to mangle the flowers. Waiting for nightfall, he crossed the fence and dug up some of the flowers. He broke others off and trampled others into the ground the way a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> would do. No one saw him, and he left undetected. Early the next day, <a href=/people/971 target=_blank>Lamon</a> came to the garden, intending to water the flowers from the spring.

No lover concerns himself with that stuff, but whatever the body he discovers beauty in, he is captivated by it. For the same reason, someone loved a tree or a river or a wild beast. Who wouldn't pity a lover who had to fear his beloved? I love the body of a slave but the beauty of a free man. Don't you see how he has hair like hyacinths, eyes that shine from beneath his brows like gems set in rings of gold, a face that blushes and a mouth full of teeth like ivory? What lover wouldn't pray to take kisses from that place? If I loved a herdsman, I was imitating the gods. <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a> was a cowherd, and <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> had him. <a href=/people/3149 target=_blank>Branchos</a> was grazing <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>, and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> loved him. <a href=/people/1283 target=_blank>Ganymede</a> was a shepherd, and the god of the whole thing snatched him away.

What became of you, my dearest daughter? Are you alive, or did some shepherd chance upon these and bring them in? I beg you, <a href=/people/1827 target=_blank>Dionysophanes</a>, tell me where you found these. You have your son.

During this time, a daughter was born to me. I could not bear to raise her amid such poverty, so I dressed her in these tokens and exposed her. I knew that many wanted to become parents. She was set out in the care of the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a>, entrusted to the goddesses. The wealth then began pouring in each day, after I had no heir. Indeed, I have not been fortunate to become the parent of even a daughter, but as if the gods were mocking me, they kept sending me dreams that revealed that a little flock of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> would make me a father. </p>                        </div>
