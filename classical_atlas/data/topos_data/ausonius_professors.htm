TIBERIUS VICTOR MINERVIUS, THE ORATOR <br />You shall be named first, Minervius, chief ornament of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/448000UBur class=place long=-0.5792 lat=44.8378>Burdigala</a>, a second Quintilian to adorn the rhetorician's gown. Your teaching in its day made glorious <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and lastly our native town; which, though it cannot vie with that pair in dignity, yet for its name alone is more acceptable, because it is our native place: let <a about=https://topostext.org/place/423000UCa2 class=place long=-1.9611 lat=42.3015>Calagurris</a> make every claim to <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> as her son, if the chair of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/448000UBur class=place long=-0.5792 lat=44.8378>Burdigala</a> receive no less degree. A thousand pupils has Minervius given to the courts, and twice a thousand to the Senate's ranks and to the purple robes. I, too, was of that number; but since my consulship is so great a theme, I will refrain, and praise you for yourself and not through my distinctions. Should panegyric be the field of rivalry, then must you be classed with the orator of the Panathenaicus; or if the test be to develop the mock law-suits of our schools, Quintilian must look to his laurels. Your speech was like a torrent in full spate, yet one which whirled down pure gold without muddy sediment. As for that art in <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> which that great man thrice over called the orator's chief virtue, it was so strong in you that the master himself gives place to you. Shall I speak also of your natural gifts and that divine blessing, your memory, which was so prodigious that you retained what you had heard or read over once as though it were engraven on your mind, and that your ear was as retentive as a book? Once, after a long contested game, I have seen you tell over all the throws made by either side when the dice were tipped out with a sharp spin over the fillets cut out in the hollowed boxwood of the dicebox; and recount move by move, without mistake, which pieces had been lost, which won back, through long stretches of the game. No malice ever blackened your heart: your tongue, though free and full of wit, indulged only in kindly jests that held no sting. Your table showed that refinement with which a censor's code could find no fault: <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> the Frugal would not blush to call it his. Sometimes, as on birthdays or some other feast, it was furnished with greater luxury, but never so lavishly as to diminish your slender means. And when you died after six decades, although you left no heir, you were mourned by me as a father and a youth. 39 And now, if anything survives after <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a> has struck her final blow, you are living yet and not unmindful of your days gone by; or, if nothing at all remains, and death's long repose knows no feeling, you have lived your own life: we take pleasure in your fame.</p>                        </div>

In legal eloquence you were supreme, you were the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>' pride, and our one model in those letters which learned Greece fostered at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, or which <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> fosters throughout the Latin world. Shall I speak of your character and of the rule of life maintained to your life's end? Or of the brilliance of your renow r n, and the devotion to learning which made you wholly shun ambition? No man was more dignified than you, yet none was more agreeable or more generous to the needy in undertaking the defence if legal aid was needed, or in zealously teaching some pupil in the schools. Those upon whom you bestowed glorious renown will live in the memory of all succeeding ages, and your works will bestow upon <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a> greater renown than will the sceptre which he held so short a time. Your histories will throw more lustre on <a href=/people/926 target=_blank>Sallust</a>'s name than he ever gained through his consulship. So in your virtues, <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a>, and eloquence you have set a pattern to your sons. 27 If my pen, seeking to please, only offends, yet pardon me: 'tis the love I bear you is guilty, if, though I cannot voice aught worthy, I seek to pay my homage, harmfully zealous.

If report does not lie, you were sprung from the stock of the <a href=/people/12197 target=_blank>Druids</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/493-07UAug class=place long=-0.7038 lat=49.2756>Boiocassis</a>, and traced your hallowed line from the temple of Belenus; and hence the names borne by your family: you are called Patera; so the mystic votaries call the servants of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>.

In that age there was none who had such knowledge as you, such swift and rolling eloquence. Sound in memory as in learning, you had the gift of clear expression cast in sonorous and well-chosen phrase; your wit was chastened and without a spice of bitterness: sparing of food and wine, cheerful, modest, comely in person, even in age you were as an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> or a steed grown old.</p>                        </div>

Almost in the cradle itself, you began to be the poet of a famous god; a boy, wearing on your brow the garland of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympian</a> crown, you sang <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>'s praises: next, pressing onward like a raging flood, you strung together an epic all in verse more rapidly than any man free from the handicap of prosody could shape as much in prose. In divers fields your eloquence achieved renown, until its fame stood as high abroad as here at home; now when you appeared before the prefect of the pretorian cohort, and now in the presence of the provincial judges when you were briefed to defend the threatened honour or the life of the accused. How happy had you been had you pursued the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>' tasks amid the peaceful toil of letters; had not the impulse of revenge armed the hatred which great lawsuits l breed; or had you never sought to climb up to the unrestful Palace in the days of tyranny! While you ever conjured up far-distant hope, disdaining that which lay in your way, and preferred success to be your work rather than <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a>'s, you lost full much, wandering through all the empty titles of distinction and deserving greater prizes than you won. Hence arose the crushing charges which ensued, though your father's sorrow won your pardon. Thereafter you became a rhetorician; but lack of diligence in teaching disappointed the hopes of your pupil's fathers. It was by the grace of God you suffered no worse ill, but were carried off in middle age and spared the pain of your daughter's perversity and the execution of your wife.</p>                        </div>

You had every blessing <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a> can give, but withal felt the tooth of her cruel jealousy. For <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, too early ripe, gave you every gift and then snatched them away your rhetoric, denied the fruit of mature age; your brilliant marriage marred by your father's restlessness; the wealth of your line and your wife's left without heir. Even as the grass of midsummer, you were but displayed and snatched away at once, frustrating your friends' hopes, and were enriched with goods that would not endure. With what prophetic utterance is that verse of <a href=/people/3856 target=_blank>Horace</a> fraught: Nothing there is that is wholly blessed.</p>                        </div>

You too, Concordius, were another such, you who, fleeing your country, took in exchange a chair of little profit in a foreign town. Nor must I leave unmentioned the old man Phoebicius, who, though the keeper of Belenus' temple, got no profit thereby. Yet he, sprung, as rumour goes, from the stock of the <a href=/people/12197 target=_blank>Druids</a> of Armorica, obtained a chair at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/448000UBur class=place long=-0.5792 lat=44.8378>Burdigala</a> by his son's help: long may his line endure!

There he lived a poor man, stinted alike in food and dress, and in his old age lost the faint glimmer of renown which his country and his chair had shed on him.

You knew every branch of learning and all the lore which <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> stored in his innumerable tomes. Your heart was golden, your tongue persuasive and your speech unflurried; no hesitating was there and yet no hurrying.
