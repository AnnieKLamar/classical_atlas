But the most, even of those who in words mightily declaim against him, seem to applaud him in their actions. <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> could say, If speech grew scarce, and at great rates were sold, Commend himself what lavish fellow would? But since the infinite treasure of the air <a href=/people/1665 target=_blank>Praise</a> gratis yields, none truth or falsehood spare; Suffering no damage, though they give their ware. Yet he often brings in his heroes intolerably boasting, and stuffs their most tragical adventures and passions with improper discourses of themselves. So <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> declares, Unseasonably to glory Makes harmony with fury; but he forbears not to extol his own raptures, which indeed, by the confession of all men, are worthy of the noblest praise. But those who are crowned for mastery in the games or in the learned combats have others to celebrate their victories, that the people's ears be not grated with the harsh noises of self-applause. And <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a> is justly censured as unskilfully and irregularly setting forth his conquest of <a href=/people/3453 target=_blank>Phrynis</a>, when he thus proudly boasted it in writing: Happy man wast thou, <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a>, when the crier proclaimed, 'The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=person long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Milesian</a> <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a> hath vanquished the son of <a href=/people/669 target=_blank>Carbo</a>, the soft <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=demonym long=27.3 lat=38>Ionian</a> poet.' It is true then, as <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> says, The most pleasant sound that a man can hear is his own praise in another's mouth; but the most odious thing unto others is a man commending himself. For we brand them as impudent who commend themselves, it becoming them to be modest though they were praised by others; and we account them unjust in arrogating that to themselves which another has the sole propriety of bestowing on them. Besides, if we then are silent, we seem either angry or envious; but if we second their discourse, we are presently entangled and forced to contribute more than we intended, speaking to men's faces what sounds well only behind their backs; and so we undertake rather the base work of drudging flattery than any real offices of true honor. </p>                        </div>

There is indeed a praise of this kind which bears very excellent and lovely fruit, from whose seeds arise many of the same species very much meliorated and improved. And therefore it is that the wise statesman seeks glory not as the reward or solace of his virtue, nor embraces it merely as the companion of his achievements, but because the being accounted an honorable person and gallant man affords a thousand opportunities of compassing many and more desirable things. For it is easy and delightful to be of use to those who are apt to believe and love us; whereas, if a man lie under calumnies and suspicions, he cannot exert his virtue to the benefit of others without committing a kind of violence upon them. There may also be more reasons than these, which we must enquire into, that, while we endeavor to avert a frivolous and nauseous applauding of ourselves, we chance not to omit that sort which may be truly useful. </p>                        </div>

For as they who are ready to die for food are compelled against nature to gnaw off their own flesh, and thus put a miserable end to their famine; so they who mortally hunger after praise, unless some one afford them a little scantling alms of commendation, do violate the laws of decency, shamelessly endeavoring to supply those wants by an unnatural extolling of themselves. But when they do not on the bare consideration of themselves hunt applause, but strive to obscure the worth of others, by fighting against their praises and opposing their own works and practices to theirs, they add to their vanity an envious and abhorred baseness. He who thrusts his foot into another's dance is stigmatized with a proverb as a ridiculous and pragmatical clown; but upon envy and jealousy to thrust ourselves between the praises of others, or to interrupt the same with our own self praise, is a thing that we ought equally to beware of. Neither should we allow others to praise us at such a time, but frankly yield the honor to those who are then celebrated, if their merit be real; and though the persons be vicious or unworthy, yet must we not take from them by setting up ourselves; but rather on the other hand we must reprove the unskilful applauders, and demonstrate their encomiums to be improperly and dangerously conferred. It is plain that these errors must be avoided. </p>                        </div>

Thus <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a>: But ye are angry at me, a man inferior to none, whether it be in the understanding or interpreting of necessary things; a man who am a lover of my country, and above the meannesses of bribes. For, in speaking with this gallantry of himself, he was not only free from arrogance, vanity, and ambition, but he demonstrated the greatness and spirit of that virtue which could not be dejected itself, and even humbled and tamed the haughtiness of envy. Such men as these will hardly be condemned; but those who would vote against them are won over to their cause, do receive infinite satisfaction, and are agreeably inspirited with this noble boasting, especially if that bravery be steady, and the ground firm on which it stands. This history does frequently discover. For, when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=demonym long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Theban</a> generals accused <a href=/people/277 target=_blank>Pelopidas</a> and <a href=/people/150 target=_blank>Epaminondas</a> that, the time for their office as <a href=/people/9010 target=_blank>Boeotarchs</a> being expired, they did not forthwith give up their power, but made an incursion into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=place long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconia</a> and repaired and repeopled <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372219PMes class=place long=21.9195 lat=37.1779>Messene</a>, <a href=/people/277 target=_blank>Pelopidas</a>, submitting himself and making many lowly entreaties, very hardly obtained his absolution; but <a href=/people/150 target=_blank>Epaminondas</a> loftily glorying in those actions, and at last declaring he would willingly be put to death so that they would set up his accusation, <a href=/people/150 target=_blank>Epaminondas</a> hath wasted <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=place long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconia</a>, hath settled <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372219PMes class=place long=21.9195 lat=37.1779>Messene</a>, and happily united <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a> into one state, against our will, they admired him, and the citizens, wondering at the cheerful greatness of his courage, dismissed him with unspeakable pleasantness and satisfaction. Therefore, when <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> thus reproached <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a>, O son of <a href=/people/183 target=_blank>Tydeus</a>! — he whose strength could tame The bounding steeds, in arms a mighty name: Canst thou remote the mingling hosts descry, With han is inactive and a careless eye? <a href=/people/844 target=_blank>Sthenelus</a> is not to be much condemned for saying, Ourselves much greater than our ancestors We boast; for <a href=/people/844 target=_blank>Sthenelus</a> had not been calumniated himself, but he only patronized his abused friend; and so the cause excused that freedom of speech, which seemed otherwise to have something of the glorioso. But <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>'s magnifying his diligence and prudence in <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a>'s trial was not very pleasing to the Romans; yet when <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> said, they ought not to judge <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, who had enstated them in the power of judging all men, they as cended crowned to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, and sacrificed with him. For <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> was not necessitated to this, but merely spurred by the desire of glory; while the danger wherein <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> stood delivered him from envy. </p>                        </div>

For what addition can words make to those who already seem possessed of real glory, and do lie indulging and basking in her beams? But those who at present are incapable of ambition, if they express themselves loftily, seem only to bear up against the storms of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, to undergird the greatness of their souls, and to shun that pity and commiseration which supposes a shipwrecked and forlorn condition. As therefore those who in walking affect a stiffness of body and a stretched-out neck are accounted effeminate and foppish, but are commended if in fencing and fighting they keep themselves erect and steady; so the man grappling with ill fortune, if he raise himself to resist her, Like some stout boxer, ready with his blow, and by a bravery of speech transform himself from abject and miserable to bold and noble, is not to be censured as obstinate and audacious, but honored as invincible and great. So, although <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> described <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a> in the happinesses of his life as smooth and without envy, yet in death he makes him have something of the bravo, and a soldier's gallant roughness: Had twenty mortals, each thy match in might, Opposed me fairly, they had sunk in fight. So <a href=/people/182 target=_blank>Phocion</a>, though otherwise very mild, after the sentence passed on him, showed the greatness of his mind in many respects; particularly to one of his fellow-sufferers, who miserably cried out and bewailed his misfortune, What, says he, is it not a pleasure to thee to die with <a href=/people/182 target=_blank>Phocion</a>? </p>                        </div>

But it is not amiss to use some little revocations or corrections of what may seem spoken to our praise, before those who are of a sedate and composed temper. If any commend us as those who have learning, riches, or authority, we should hinder them from choosing such topics, and rather desire of them, if they can, to take notice of us as innocent, good, and useful. Thus we do not so much confer as transfer praises, and seem not to be puffed up with our applauders, but rather to be offended that they have not praised conveniently and for truly meritorious things. We hide also inferior with better qualifications; yet not as desiring to be commended, but as teaching to commend aright. Such forms as these may be referred hither: It is true, I have not walled the city with stones or brick; but if you will view my fortifications, you shall find armor, and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and confederates. But more apt is that of <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a>. When his friends bewailed him in the extremities of death, they put him in mind of his authority and the great offices he had discharged, as also what victories, trophies, and cities he had left the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>; but he, raising himself a little, reproved them as fixing only upon common encomiums, and enlarging rather on those of fortune than on those of virtue, whereas they neglected the greatest matter, which was more peculiar to himself, — that he had never been the occasion of any <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>'s wearing black. And hence the orator may learn, if he be a good man, to transfer the eulogiums of his eloquence to his virtuous life and manners; and the commander who is admired and applauded for his conduct and happy fortune in the wars may freely propose his clemency or justice as more worthy to be praised. Nay, further, it becomes even an emperor, upon a profusion of such glutting praises as flatterers are commonly guilty of, to say something of this nature: No God am I. Why do ye equal me Thus to th' immortal powers. If you know me well, let my justice or temperance, my equanimity or humanity, be rather spoken of. For even envy herself can easily concede the lesser honors to him who refuses the greater; nor will it rob any of true encomiums, not to expect false and vain ones. Therefore several princes, who permitted not themselves to be called Gods or the offspring of the Gods, have yet assumed the titles <a href=/people/8222 target=_blank>Philadelphus</a>, <a href=/people/1596 target=_blank>Philometor</a>, Euergetes, or <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a>; and were never offended when they were honored with those glorious yet human appellations. Again, they who in their writings and sayings are absolute votaries to wisdom by no means will be called σοφοί (or wise men), but can presently swallow the epithet of philosophers (or lovers of wisdom), or that of proficients, or any other easy name which sounds not big nor exposes them to envy; and so they beget and preserve a good esteem. But your rhetorical sophists, whilst in their orations they gape for the extraordinary acclamations of divine, angelical, wonderful, lose even those common ones of manly or pretty well. </p>                        </div>

Such a remark as this is also profitable against enemies, and recalls the spirits: Weak sons of misery our strength oppose. And such a reflection as that of <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a>, who said concerning the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, when he heard him called the Great: And who is greater than I, unless he be more just? So <a href=/people/150 target=_blank>Epaminondas</a> answered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>, when they had spun out a long accusation against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a>: I see then we have forced you out of your wonted humor of short speech. The like to these are proper against adversaries; but amongst our friends and fellow-citizens a seasonable glorying is good not only to humble and throw down their haughtiness, but if they be fearful or astonished, to fetch back their courage and teach them to rally up themselves again. Therefore <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> in perils and battles talked at a thundering rate, but otherwise was mild and gentle in discourse. And <a href=/people/2711 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> the Second generally was modest and free from blustering; but at the sea-fight at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369273PKos class=place long=27.2859 lat=36.8914>Cos</a>, — one of his friends saying, See you not how much greater the number of the enemy's ships is than ours? — he answers, And for how many ships dost thou reckon me? This <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> seems to have considered, who makes <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, when his friends were dismayed at the noise and horrible waves of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382156WCha class=place long=15.606 lat=38.248>Charybdis</a>, immind them of his former stratagems and valor: O friends! O often tried in adverse storms! With ills familiar in more dreadful forms! Deep in the dire Cyclopean den you lay, Yet safe return'd, — <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> led the way. For this kind of praise is not such as the haranguers to the people or sophistical beggars use, nor those who affect popular humming and applause; but a necessary pledge of that courage and conduct which must be given to hearten up our friends. For we know that opinion and confidence in him whom we esteem endued with the fortitude and experience of a complete captain is, in the crisis of a battle, no small advantage to the obtaining of the day. </p>                        </div>

For certainly any one will be pleased when he sees many voluntarily abstaining from the vices they heard cried down and reproved; but if baseness be well accounted of, and honor be made to attend on him who pursues pleasure or avarice, where is the nature so happily strong that can resist, much less conquer, the temptation? Therefore a generous and discreet person must set himself against the praises, not of evil men, but of evil actions; for this kind of commendation perverts the judgments of men, and miserably leads them to imitate and emulate unworthy practices as laudable. But they may be easily bewrayed by confronting them with opposite truths. <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a> the tragedian is reported to have said to <a href=/people/397 target=_blank>Satyrus</a> the comedian, It is not so wonderful an art to move the theatre's laughter as to force its tears. But if some philosopher should have retorted, Aye; but, friend, it is not so fit and seemly to make men weep, as to remove and free them from their sorrows, it is likely by this odd way of commending himself he would have delighted his hearer, and endeavored to alter or secure his judgment. So <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> knew how to speak for himself, when the great number of <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>'s scholars was opposed to the fewness of his, saying, His chorus is indeed greater than mine, but mine is sweeter. And <a href=/people/182 target=_blank>Phocion</a>, while <a href=/people/1096 target=_blank>Leosthenes</a> yet prospered, being asked by the orators what good he had done the city, replies: Nothing but this, that in my government of you there have been no funeral orations, but all the deceased were buried in the sepulchres of their ancestors. So <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a>, by way of antithesis to this epitaph of the glutton, What I have eat is mine; in words my will I've had, and of my lust have took my fill, well opposes these, What I have learnt is mine; I've had my thought, And me the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> noble truths have taught. This kind of praise is amiable and advantageous, teaching to admire and love convenient and profitable things instead of the superfluous and vain. Thus much for the stating of the question, in what cases and how far self-praise may be inoffensive. </p>                        </div>

Discourse of a man's self usually sallies from self-love, as from its fort, and is there observed to lay wait, even in those who are vulgarly thought free enough from ambition. Therefore, as it is one of the rules of health to avoid dangerous and unwholesome places, or being in them to take the greater care, so ought there to be a like rule concerning converse and speaking of one's self. For this kind of talk has slippery occasions, into which we unawares and indiscernibly are apt to fall. For first (as is above said), ambition usually intrudes into the praises of others with some flourishing remarks to adorn herself. For let a person be commended by his equal or inferior, the mind of the ambitious is tickled and rubbed at the hearing of his praise, and immediately he is hurried by an intemperate desire and precipitation after the like; as the appetite of the hungry is sharpened by seeing others eat. </p>                        </div>

In which kind of error it is observable that soldiers and mariners are most entangled. Nor is it infrequent with those who return from the government of provinces and the management of great affairs. Such as these, when mention is once made of illustrious and royal personages, presently thrust in some eulogies of themselves, as proceeding from the favor and kind opinion of those princes; and then they fancy they seem not at all to have praised themselves, but to have given only a bare account what great men have said honorably of them. So another sort, little different from these, think they are not discerned when they tell you all the familiarities of kings and emperors with them and their particular applying themselves to them in discourse, and appear to recount them, not as thereby intending their own honor, but as bringing in considerable evidences of singular affability and humanity in persons so exceeding great. We see then what reason we have to look narrowly to ourselves, that, whilst we confer praises on others, we give no ground for suspicion that we make them but the vehicles of our own, and that, in pretending to celebrate <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a>, under his name we mean romantically ourselves. </p>                        </div>

Of this old men are inclinable to be guilty, when, by chastising and debasing others for their vices, they exalt themselves as wonderfully great in the opposite virtues. Indeed to these there must be a very large concession, if they be reverend not only in age, but in virtue and place; for it is not altogether an unprofitable way, since it may sometimes create an extraordinary zeal and emulation of honor in those who are thus spurred up. But otherwise that sort of humor is carefully to be shunned; for reproof is often bitter, and wants a great deal of caution to sweeten and correct it. Now this is not done by the tempering our own praises with the reprehension of another; for he is an unworthy and odious fellow who seeks his own credit through any man's disgrace, basely endeavoring to build a slight reputation of his virtue upon the discovery of another's crimes. </p>                        </div>

They ought rather to blush, if they hear themselves commended, and not put on a brazen face. They ought modestly and handsomely to reprove their applauders as having honored them too much, and not chide them for having been too sparing in their praise. Yet in this many offend, putting those who speak advantageously of them in mind of more things of the same nature; endeavoring to make a huge heap of creditable actions, till by what they themselves add they spoil all that their friends have conferred to the promoting their esteem. Some there are who flatter themselves, till they are stupidly puffed up; others allure a man to talk of himself, and take him by casting some little gilded temptation in his way; and another sort for a little sport will be putting questions, as those in <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> to the silly braggadocio soldier: How did you get this wound?

Now the best and most certain way of security is to look back upon such as we can remember guilty of this fault, and to consider how absurd and ugly it is accounted by all men, and that hardly any thing is in converse a greater disturbance than this. Hence it is that, though there be no other quality in such persons unpleasing, yet, as if Nature had taught us to abhor and fly it, we hasten out to get a little fresh air; and even the very parasite and indigent flatterers are uneasy, when the wealthy and great men by whose scraps they live begin to admire and extol themselves; nay, they give out that they pay the greatest portion of the shot, when they must give ear to such vanities. Therefore he in <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> cries out, They kill me — I am a macerated guest With their wise sayings and their soldier's brags; How base these glorious are! But these faults are not only to be objected against common soldiers and upstarts who detain others with gaudy and proud relations of their own actions, but also against sophists, philosophers, and commanders who grow full of themselves and talk at a fastuous rate. Therefore it is fit we still remember that another's dispraise always accompanies the indiscreet praises of ourselves; that the end of vain-glory is disgrace; and that, as <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> tells us, the company will both be offended and judge otherwise of us than we would have them.
