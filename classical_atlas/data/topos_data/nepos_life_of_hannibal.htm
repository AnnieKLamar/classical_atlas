If it be true, as no one doubts, that the Roman people excelled all other nations in warlike merit, it is not to be disputed that <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> surpassed other commanders in ability as much as the Romans surpassed all other people in valour; for as often as he engaged with the Romans in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, he always came off with the advantage; and, had not his efforts been paralyzed by the envy of his countrymen at home, he would appear to have been capable of getting the mastery over the Romans. But the jealous opposition of many prevailed against the ability of one. He, however, so cherished in his mind the hatred which his father had borne the Romans, and which was left him, as it were, by bequest, that he laid down his life before he would abate it; for even when he was exiled from his country, and stood in need of support from others, he never ceased in thought to make war with the Romans. </p>                        </div>

As some ambassadors from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> were sent to that prince, in order to gain information respecting his intentions, and to endeavour, by underhand contrivances, to render <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> an object of suspicion to the king (as if, being bribed by them, he entertained other sentiments than before); and as they were not unsuccessful in their attempts, and <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> became aware of that fact, and found himself excluded from the privy council, he went at a time appointed to the king himself, and, after having said much concerning his attachment to him and his hatred to the Romans, he added the following statement: My father <a href=/people/235 target=_blank>Hamilcar</a>, said he, when I was a very little boy, being not more than nine years old, offered sacrifices at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, when he was going as commander into Spain, to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, the best and greatest of the gods; and while this religious ceremony was being performed, he asked me whether I should like to go with him to the camp. As I willingly expressed my consent, and proceeded to beg him not to hesitate to take me, he replied, 'I will do so, if you will give me the promise which I ask of you.' At the same time he led me to the altar at which he had begun to sacrifice, and, sending the rest of the company away, required me, taking hold of the altar, to swear that I would never be in friendship with the Romans, This oath, thus taken before my father, I have so strictly kept even to this day, that no man ought to doubt but that I shall be of the same mind for the rest of my life. If, therefore, you entertain any friendly thoughts towards the Romans, you will not act imprudently if you conceal them from me; but whenever you prepare war, you will disappoint yourself unless you constitute me leader in it. </p>                        </div>

When he had lain encamped there some days, and was turning back towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>, Quintus <a href=/people/11073 target=_blank>Fabius Maximus</a>, the Roman dictator, threw himself in his way in the <a href=/people/5008 target=_blank>Falernian</a> territory. Here, though enclosed in a confined space, he extricated himself without any loss to his army. He deceived <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a>, a most skilful commander; for, when night had come on, he set fire to some bundles of twigs, tied upon the horns of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, and drove forward a vast number of those <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, scattering themselves hither and thither. By presenting this object suddenly to their view, he struck such terror into the army of the Romans, that nobody ventured to stir beyond the rampart. Not many days after this success, he put to flight Marcus <a href=/people/427 target=_blank>Minucius</a> <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a>, master of the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, who was equal in power with the dictator, and who had been drawn into an engagement by a stratagem.

Under what consuls he died, is not agreed; for <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> has left it recorded in his chronicle that he ended his life in the consulship of Marcus <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> and Quintus <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> <a href=/people/822 target=_blank>Labeo</a>; but <a href=/people/160 target=_blank>Polybius</a> says in that of Lucius <a href=/people/10991 target=_blank>Aemilius Paullus</a> and Cnaeus <a href=/people/836 target=_blank>Baebius</a> <a href=/people/2451 target=_blank>Tamphilus</a>; and <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a> in that of Publius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/965 target=_blank>Cethegus</a> and Marcus <a href=/people/836 target=_blank>Baebius</a> <a href=/people/2451 target=_blank>Tamphilus</a>. <br />This great man, though occupied in such vast military operations, devoted some portion of his time to literature; for there are some books of his written in the Greek language, and amongst them one addressed to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=ethnic long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodians</a> on the acts of Cnaeus <a href=/people/215 target=_blank>Manlius</a> <a href=/people/3095 target=_blank>Vulso</a> in Asia. <br />Of the wars which he conducted many have given the history; and two of them were persons that were with him in the camp, and lived with him as long as fortune allowed, <a href=/people/344 target=_blank>Silenus</a> and Sosilus the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=person long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonian</a>; and this Sosilus <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> had as his instructor in the Greek language. But it is now time to make an end of this book, and to give an account of commanders among the Romans, that, when the actions of both are compared, it may be the better determined which generals deserve the preference. </p>                        </div>
