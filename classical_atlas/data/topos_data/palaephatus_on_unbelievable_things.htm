The more credulous of men are persuaded by anything that is said, not being conversant with wisdom and science. The more solid by nature and more curious completely disbelieve that any of these things happened. It seems to me that all the said events happened (not just the names, but there was no rational account of them. First the deed happened, and then the account of it.) As many species and shapes were talked about as occurring then, which now do not exist, such things did not happen. For if something ever happened another time, it happens now and will again. <br />I, for one, continually praise the writers <a href=/people/1224 target=_blank>Melissus</a> and <a href=/people/6590 target=_blank>Lamiscus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=person long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samian</a>, who say, In principle is what happened and will be now. Poets and logographers turned aside from what happened and toward the more untrustworthy and more marvelous, so that people would marvel. I know that it is not possible for such things to be as they are reported. I have dealt with this issue, that, if it didn't happened, they wouldn't have said it. Going to most of the countries, I have inquired from the older people what they heard about each of these, and I have written what I learned from them. And I saw the places as each one was, and wrote this, not the way they are spoken about, but as having gone and looked into them. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg1553.tlg001:1'><b>&sect; 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a><br />About <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a>, they say they were beasts with the whole appearance of a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, except for the head, which was that of a man. So if someone believes such a beast existed, it is impossible: first, the natures of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and human are incompatible, nor is their food similar, nor could the food of a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> to pass through the mouth and throat of a human. If a form once existed, it would still exist now. Here is the truth: When <a href=/people/729 target=_blank>Ixion</a> was king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, a herd of <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> went wild on Mt <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394230LPel class=place long=23.046 lat=39.437>Pelion</a>, which made the rest of the mountains inaccessible. The <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> would come down to where humans lived, damage trees and crops and destroy their plough animals. So <a href=/people/729 target=_blank>Ixion</a> announced via heralds that he would give a great amount of money to whomever killed the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>. Some young men from the foothills, from a town called <a href=/people/2809 target=_blank>Nephele</a> (cloud), thought up the idea of teaching teach <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> to carry riders. (Before this they did not know how to ride <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, but only used them for chariots.) They mounted their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and rode to where the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> were, and attacked the herd by hurling javelins. Whenever they were chased by the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>, the youths would manage to retreat - for <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> are more swift-footed. But when the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> came to a stop, they would turn and hurl their javelins. In this way they killed them, and took the name ‘<a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a>’ since they ‘pierced the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> through and through’. (The name did not come from their having the appearance of <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>, for <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a> do not have the appearance of a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>, but of a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and a human). So the name came from this event. The <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a> got money from <a href=/people/729 target=_blank>Ixion</a>, and their pride in their achievement and their wealth grew into arrogance: they committed many brutal acts, especially against <a href=/people/729 target=_blank>Ixion</a> himself. <a href=/people/729 target=_blank>Ixion</a> resided in what is now called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396224PLar class=place long=22.421 lat=39.6349>Larissa</a>, although at the time the people who lived there were called ‘<a href=/people/721 target=_blank>Lapiths</a>’. The <a href=/people/721 target=_blank>Lapiths</a> invited the <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a> to a feast; the <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a> got drunk and carried off their wives: they bundled the women onto their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and fled homeward. From that position, they made war on the <a href=/people/721 target=_blank>Lapiths</a>, descending onto the plain by night, they would hide, then burn and pillage by day before returning to the mountains. When they rode away in this manner, all that was visible to those watching them from a distance were their backs: like a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> but without a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>’s head, then the rest like a human, but without the legs. Onlookers, describing this strange sight, would say: ‘The <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a>, from <a href=/people/2809 target=_blank>Nephele</a>, are attacking us!’ And from such statements, and their appearance the unbelievable myth was fabricated, that from a cloud a horse and man was born on the mountain. </p>                        </div>

But I say this did not happen. First, it is not possible for one animal to feel sexual love for another having a womb unsuited to its private part. For it is not possible for a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> and an ape or <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> and hyena to have sex with each other, or buffalo with deer (for they are different races) nor, if they have sex with each other, to give birth. And it does not seem likely to be that a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> would have sex with a wooden <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>. For all quadruped animals sniff the private parts of the animal before copulation, and then mount it. Nor could the woman withstand being mounted by a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>, nor would it be possible for a woman to bear an embryo with horns. The truth is this: They say that <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a>, when his private parts were in pain, had been treated by <a href=/people/1460 target=_blank>Procris</a> the daughter of <a href=/people/507 target=_blank>Pandion</a> on the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>puppy</a> and javelin. [??] <a href=/people/4337 target=_blank>Cephalus</a>. [...] At this time, a youth of distinguished beauty, whose name was <a href=/people/94 target=_blank>Taurus</a>, was in <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a>' retinue. <a href=/people/930 target=_blank>Pasiphae</a> was smitten with desire for him, persuaded him to have sex, and gave birth to his child. <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> calculated the time when his private parts were in pain, and recognized that the child could not be his since they had not been sleeping together. Investigating carefully, he realized that the child was fathered by <a href=/people/94 target=_blank>Taurus</a>. He decided not to kill it, because he considered it a brother to his children. He sent the child to the mountain, where he grew up in the role of servant to the herdsmen. On coming to manhood, he did not obey the cowherds. When <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> learned this, he ordered him to be taken down to the city and detained. Left free, if he came willingly, but bound if not. Perceiving this, the young man went away in the mountains, and lived by rustling <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>. <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> sent a larger force to arrest him. The youth made a deep excavation and enclosed himself in it. There he stayed the rest of the time, attacking <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>; and <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>, and thus he fed himself. When <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> wanted to punish a person, he would send him to the man penned in this structure, and in this way he would be killed. When <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> took <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>, a warlike man, he took him to this place to die. <a href=/people/421 target=_blank>Ariadne</a> sent ahead a sword inside the enclosure, where <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a> killed the <a href=/people/1317 target=_blank>Minotaur</a>. From such an incident, the poets distorted the story in a mythical direction. </p>                        </div>

And if they didn't sprout in other land, so then they would <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> them henceforth in that land where they had sprouted before. So the truth is this. <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a> was a man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> race who came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>, having fallen out in rivalry over the kingdom with his brother <a href=/people/1543 target=_blank>Phoenix</a>. <a href=/people/2513 target=_blank>Drakon</a> the child of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> was king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a> then. As king, he had many other things and also elephants' teeth. <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a> killed him and became king. The friends of <a href=/people/2513 target=_blank>Drakon</a> waged war on him, and his sons stood by <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a>. The friends of <a href=/people/2513 target=_blank>Drakon</a>, were worsted in the battle. They grabbed <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a>' money and the ivory lying in the sanctuary, and fled homeward. Others were scattered here and there, some in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, some in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=place long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocis</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386231ROpu class=place long=23.04 lat=38.65>Locris</a>. From there they had set out to fight the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a>. They were troublesome fighters, sharing the same language and knowing the countryside. So when they snatched the teeth and fled, the citizens said, <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a> worked such evils for us by killing <a href=/people/2513 target=_blank>Drakon</a>. For from the teeth of that guy, many brave men came, who were scattered, to contend with us. From this event, which really happened, the myth was elaborated. </p>                        </div>

She used to sit on Mt. Phikion and sing to each citizen a riddle. She killed whoever was unable to solve the riddle. When <a href=/people/173 target=_blank>Oedipus</a> solved the riddle, he threw her down and killed her. The account is faithless and weak. No such form can exist, while eating those unable to solve a riddle is childish, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Cadmeians</a> not being able to shoot the beast with arrows, but instead to watch their citizens being eaten up as enemies, is silly. So the truth is as follows: <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a> had an Amazonian wife whose name was <a href=/people/974 target=_blank>Sphinx</a>. He came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>, killed <a href=/people/2513 target=_blank>Drakon</a> and took the kingdom. Afterwards he took the sister of <a href=/people/2513 target=_blank>Drakon</a>, whose name was <a href=/people/443 target=_blank>Harmonia</a>. <a href=/people/974 target=_blank>Sphinx</a> felt that he was going to marry the other woman, so she persuaded many of the citizens to come away with her. They seized most of the money, and the swift-footed <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hound</a> that <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a> brought, and took them to Mt. Phikion. There she waged war on <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a>, setting ambushes at appropriate moments and tearing to pieces those she killed. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Cadmeians</a> called the ambush riddle. It was common talk among the citizens that The savage <a href=/people/974 target=_blank>Sphinx</a> tears us to pieces having set a riddle, and sits upon a mountain. No one was able to discover the riddle, from it being impossible to fight openly. For she doesn't run but flies, and is <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> and woman, so swift-footed she is. <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a> proclaims that he will give lots of money to whoever kills <a href=/people/974 target=_blank>Sphinx</a>. So <a href=/people/173 target=_blank>Oedipus</a> comes, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a> man good at military things, with a swift <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. He made a band of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Cadmeians</a> and they went out at night and ambushed her. He found the riddle, i.e. the ambush, and killed <a href=/people/974 target=_blank>Sphinx</a>. After this happened, the rest was mythologized. </p>                        </div>

King Amisodaros lived on the <a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthos</a> river on some high mountain, from which the Telmissis wood/substance is deposited.

The name of this mountain is <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364305LChi class=place long=30.4558 lat=36.4316>Chimaera</a>. Then there was, as the locals say, a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> living by the front access, and a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> by the rear.

Do you see how skins then were so scarce that a king would take a fleece as bride-price for his own daughter, or else he thought his daughter was worthless? Already some, in order to avoid this ridiculous thing, say the skin was golden. And if the skin was golden, the king didn't need to take it from a foreign man.

He sent a ship and put in it whatever was of most value to <a href=/people/528 target=_blank>Athamas</a>, and filled the ship with all kinds of goods and money, among which things there was an image the mother of <a href=/people/1976 target=_blank>Merops</a>, the daughter of <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Helios</a> (her name was Kos) had made from her own money, an image of herself, life-size, of gold (it was a lot of gold and there was much talk of it).

And in this way, with one of them giving the eye to the other, they all could see. <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a> came up behind them with a quiet tread and took their eye, and said he wouldn't give it back until they told him where the <a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Gorgon</a> was. So they say he cut off her head, came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372245PSer class=place long=24.506 lat=37.154>Seriphos</a>, showed it to <a href=/people/2473 target=_blank>Polydectes</a>, and turned him to stone. And this is rather ridiculous, for a living man who sees the head of a corpse to be fossilized. For what power does a corpse have?

He left three daughters, <a href=/people/4357 target=_blank>Stheno</a>, <a href=/people/2028 target=_blank>Euryale</a>, <a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Medusa</a>. They did not want to marry anyone, and they divided the property with each ruling one island. They couldn't decide whether to dedicate the <a href=/people/2412 target=_blank>Gorgo</a> or to divide it up, but they put in alternately in the treasury of each. There was a companion of <a href=/people/1496 target=_blank>Phorcys</a>, a man of noble character, and they used him for everything, like their eye. <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a> was a fugitive from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a> who had ships and some forces with him. He plundered the sea shores. When he learned that here was a kingdom of women, with lots of gold and few men, he arrived. First he anchored in the strait between Kerne and Sarpedonia, and caught the Eye while he was sailing from one sister to another. This man told him that there was nothing else to take from them worth mentioning, except the <a href=/people/2412 target=_blank>Gorgo</a>. He told him how much gold it had. The girls, when Eye didn't come as arranged, met in one place together. Each started blaming the other. Once each had denied having him, they wondered what could have happened. At this point, <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a> sailed up to them, still together, and told them he had Eye. He said he would give him back to them only if they told him where the <a href=/people/2412 target=_blank>Gorgo</a> was. He also threatened to kill them if they didn't talk. <a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Medusa</a> said not to show him, but <a href=/people/4357 target=_blank>Stheno</a> and <a href=/people/2028 target=_blank>Euryale</a> showed him. So he killed <a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Medusa</a>, but gave Eye back to the others. He took the <a href=/people/2412 target=_blank>Gorgo</a> and cut it up. He readied a trireme and put <a href=/people/2412 target=_blank>Gorgo</a>'s head on it, and gave the ship the name <a href=/people/2412 target=_blank>Gorgo</a>. He then sailed around in it and collected money from the islanders, killing those who didn't give. He sailed up and demanded money from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372245PSer class=ethnic long=24.506 lat=37.154>Seriphians</a> as well. They asked a few days to collect the money.

Then they left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372245PSer class=place long=24.506 lat=37.154>Seriphus</a> and went away. <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a> sailed back to demand the money and came to the agora.

It seems to me, however, that no one can bring a person who has died back to life. What happened was something like this: When his daughters killed <a href=/people/390 target=_blank>Pelias</a>, his son <a href=/people/805 target=_blank>Acastus</a> chased after them, intending to kill them in return for their father. The other sisters he was able to catch, but <a href=/people/1166 target=_blank>Alcestis</a> escaped to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394228PPhe class=place long=22.7539 lat=39.379>Pherae</a> where her cousin <a href=/people/1035 target=_blank>Admetus</a> lived. Since she sat down at his hearth [as a suppliant], <a href=/people/1035 target=_blank>Admetus</a> was unable to give her back to <a href=/people/805 target=_blank>Acastus</a> when he demanded her. The latter besieged the city with a large army and began to ravage them with fire. <a href=/people/1035 target=_blank>Admetus</a> made a sortie during the night but happened on an ambush and was captured alive. <a href=/people/805 target=_blank>Acastus</a> threatened to kill him, if he refused to hand over <a href=/people/1166 target=_blank>Alcestis</a>, even though she was a suppliant. But <a href=/people/1166 target=_blank>Alcestis</a>, when she found out that <a href=/people/1035 target=_blank>Admetus</a> was about to lose his life because of her, came out and gave herself up to <a href=/people/805 target=_blank>Acastus</a>, who thereupon released <a href=/people/1035 target=_blank>Admetus</a> and took <a href=/people/1166 target=_blank>Alcestis</a> into custody. People therefore said: “Brave/manly <a href=/people/1166 target=_blank>Alcestis</a>, who voluntarily died on behalf of <a href=/people/1035 target=_blank>Admetus</a>.” However it did not happen in the way the myth has it. At about that time, <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> came from somewhere driving the mares of <a href=/people/1525 target=_blank>Diomedes</a>. <a href=/people/1035 target=_blank>Admetus</a> hosted him when he traveled. <a href=/people/1035 target=_blank>Admetus</a> was mourning the misfortune of <a href=/people/1166 target=_blank>Alcestis</a>; <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> got annoyed, attacked <a href=/people/805 target=_blank>Acastus</a>, and destroyed his whole army. The booty from this attack he distributed to his own troops, but <a href=/people/1166 target=_blank>Alcestis</a> he turned over to <a href=/people/1035 target=_blank>Admetus</a>. People, therefore, said that <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> had happened by and had rescued <a href=/people/1166 target=_blank>Alcestis</a> from <a href=/people/257 target=_blank>Death</a>.

The herdsman picked it up and put it to his lips. The oboe sang its song through a divine power, despite the user. But <a href=/people/2464 target=_blank>Marsyas</a> believed the aulos's power was his artistry: he put himself forward against the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> and against <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, saying he did not wish to exist if he could not surpass the god. But in the competition he was beaten, and following his defeat his skin was flayed off him. I myself saw the river in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>, named for <a href=/people/2464 target=_blank>Marsyas</a>.

The sea was a ferry crossing. No man had any complaint against <a href=/people/11023 target=_blank>Phaon</a>: he was fair and only took pay from those who could afford it. Among the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=place long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbos</a> there was admiration for his character. A goddess—they say it was <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>—gave her approval to <a href=/people/11023 target=_blank>Phaon</a>. She put on a human disguise as an aged woman and asked <a href=/people/11023 target=_blank>Phaon</a> about passage. He quickly ferried her across and did not ask for any payment. What did the goddess do? They say that she transformed him—rewarded the old man with youth and beauty.

But at that place a plant at once sprang forth. <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> at the peak of his desire ran into the plant for he had no way to avoid it.

The manner of the festival is: there is a cart with white <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a>, and the priestess of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> needs to be on the cart as far as the temple. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377228SHer class=place long=22.7747 lat=37.6919>sanctuary</a> is outside the city. The time came for the festival once, but the rite was imperfect because there were no <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a>. The priestess, however, cleverly solved the problem. She was the mother of young men who replaced the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> for the vehicle. Since the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a>’ role was performed by the children, when they stopped by the sacred statue, they asked a wage for their trouble.
