                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.phi004:1'><b>&sect; 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The study of rhetoric was introduced into our country in about the same way as that of grammar, but with somewhat greater difficulty, since, as is well known, its practice was at times actually prohibited. To remove any doubt on this point, I shall append an ancient decree of the senate, as well as an edict of the censors: <br />In the consulship of Gaius <a href=/people/1133 target=_blank>Fannius</a> <a href=/people/911 target=_blank>Strabo</a> and Marcus <a href=/people/141 target=_blank>Valerius</a> <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messala</a> the praetor Marcus <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a> laid a proposition before the senate. As the result of a discussion about philosophers and rhetoricians, the senate decreed that Marcus <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a>, the praetor, should take heed and provide, in whatever way seemed in accord with the interests of the State and his oath of office, that they be not allowed to live in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. Some time afterwards the censors Gnaeus <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> <a href=/people/1039 target=_blank>Ahenobarbus</a> and Lucius <a href=/people/11081 target=_blank>Licinius Crassus</a> issued the following edict about the same class of men: It has been reported to us that there be men who have introduced a new kind of training, and that our young men frequent their schools; that these men have assumed the title of Latin rhetoricians, and that young men spend whole days with them in idleness. Our forefathers determined what they wished their children to learn and what schools they desired them to attend. These innovations in the customs and principles of our forefathers do not please us nor seem proper. Therefore it appears necessary to make our opinion known, both to those who have such schools and to those who are in the habit of attending them, that they are displeasing to us. <br />By degrees rhetoric itself came to seem useful and honourable, and many devoted themselves to it as a defence and for glory. <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> continued to declaim in Greek as well as Latin up to the time of his praetorship, and in Latin even when he was getting on in years; and that too in company with the future consuls <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> and <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a>, whom he calls his pupils and his big boys. Some historians assert that Gnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> resumed the practice of declaiming just before the civil war, that he might be the better able to argue against Gaius <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>, a young man of very ready tongue, who was espousing <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s cause; and that Marcus <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, and <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> as well, did not give it up even during the war at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/446109UMut class=place long=10.925 lat=44.6472>Mutina</a>. The emperor <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> declaimed in the first year of his reign, and had also done so in public twice before. Furthermore, many even of the orators published declamations. In this way general enthusiasm was aroused, and a great number of masters and teachers flocked to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, where they were so well received that some advanced from the lowest estate to senatorial dignity and to the highest magistracies. <br />But they did not all follow the same method of teaching, and the individual teachers also varied in their practice, since each one trained his pupils in various ways. For they would explain fine speeches with regard to their figures, incidents and illustrations, now in one way and now in another, and compose narratives sometimes in a condensed and brief form, again with greater detail and flow of words. Sometimes they would translate Greek works, and praise or censure distinguished men. They would show that some practices in everyday life were expedient and essential, others harmful and superfluous. Frequently they defended or assailed the credibility of myths, an exercise which the Greeks call destructive and constructive criticism. But finally all these exercises went out of vogue and were succeeded by the debate. <br />The earlier debates were based either upon historical narrative, as indeed is sometimes the case at present, or upon some event of recent occurrence in real life. Accordingly they were usually presented with even the names of the localities included. At any rate that is the case with the published collections, from which it may be enlightening to give one or two specimens word for word. <br />Some young men from the city went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Ostia</a> in the summer season, and arriving at the shore, found some fishermen drawing in their nets. They made a bargain to give a certain sum for the haul. The money was paid and they waited for some time until the nets were drawn ashore. When they were at last hauled out, no fish was found in them, but a closed basket of gold. Then the purchasers said that the catch belonged to them, the fishermen that it was theirs. <br />When some dealers were landing a cargo of slaves from a ship at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, they dressed a handsome and high-priced young slave in the amulet and fringed toga for fear of the collectors of customs, and their fraud easily escaped detection. When they reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, the case was taken to court and a claim was made for the slave's liberty, on the ground that his master had voluntarily freed him. <br />Such discussions they formerly called by their Greek name of syntheses, but afterwards debates; but they might be either fictitious or legal. <br />The eminent teachers of the subject, of whom any account is to be found, are limited pretty closely to those whom I shall mention. </p>                        </div>

When crowds flocked to him, for all the most diligent students of the subject were trained under him, I regretted not having the same privilege.

Albucius undertook that rôle, and filled it so effectively, that he reduced <a href=/people/505 target=_blank>Plancus</a> to silence, since he did not venture to enter into competition. But when Albucius had thus become famous, he opened a lecture room of his own, where it was his habit after proposing a subject for a debate, to begin to speak from his seat, and then as he warmed up, to rise and make his peroration on his feet. He declaimed, too, in various manners, now in a brilliant and ornate style, and at another time, not to be thought invariably academic, speaking briefly, in everyday language and all but that of the streets. He also pleaded causes, but rather seldom, taking part only in those of greatest importance, and even then confining himself to summing them up. Later he withdrew from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a>, partly through shame and partly through fear. For in a case before the Hundred he had offered his opponent, whom he was inveighing against as undutiful towards his parents, the privilege of taking oath but merely as a figure of speech, using the following language: Swear by the ashes of your father and mother, who lie unburied; and made other remarks in the same vein. His opponent accepted the challenge; and since the judges made no objection, Albucius lost his case to his great humiliation. Again, when he was defending a client in a murder trial at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Mediolanum</a> before the proconsul Lucius <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, and the lictors tried to suppress the immoderate applause, he grew so angry, that lamenting the condition of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and saying that it was being reduced once more to the form of a province, he called besides upon Marcus <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> whose statue was in sight, as the founder and defender of our laws and liberties; and for that he narrowly escaped punishment. When already well on in years, he returned to Novara because he was suffering from a tumour, called the people together and explained in a long set speech the reasons which led him to take his life, and then starved himself to death. </p>                        </div>
