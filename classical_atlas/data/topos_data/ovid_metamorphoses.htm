It was a rude and undeveloped mass, that nothing made except a ponderous weight; and all discordant elements confused, were there congested in a shapeless heap. As yet the sun afforded earth no light, nor did the moon renew her crescent horns; the earth was not suspended in the air exactly balanced by her heavy weight. Not far along the margin of the shores had <a href=/people/1147 target=_blank>Amphitrite</a> stretched her lengthened arms, — for all the land was mixed with sea and air. The land was soft, the sea unfit to sail, the atmosphere opaque, to naught was given a proper form, in everything was strife, and all was mingled in a seething mass — with hot the cold parts strove, and wet with dry and soft with hard, and weight with empty void. </p>                        </div>

The fiery element of convex heaven leaped from the mass devoid of dragging weight, and chose the summit arch to which the air as next in quality was next in place. The earth more dense attracted grosser parts and moved by gravity sank underneath; and last of all the wide surrounding waves in deeper channels rolled around the globe. </p>                        </div>

Then poured He forth the deeps and gave command that they should billow in the rapid winds, that they should compass every shore of earth. he also added fountains, pools and lakes, and bound with shelving banks the slanting streams, which partly are absorbed and partly join the boundless ocean. Thus received amid the wide expanse of uncontrolled waves, they beat the shores instead of crooked banks. At His command the boundless plains extend, the valleys are depressed, the woods are clothed in green, the stony mountains rise. And as the heavens are intersected on the right by two broad zones, by two that cut the left, and by a fifth consumed with ardent heat, with such a number did the careful God mark off the compassed weight, and thus the earth received as many climes. — Such heat consumes the middle zone that none may dwell therein; and two extremes are covered with deep snow; and two are placed betwixt the hot and cold, which mixed together give a temperate clime; and over all the atmosphere suspends with weight proportioned to the fiery sky, exactly as the weight of earth compares with weight of water. </p>                        </div>

No suppliant multitude the countenance of <a href=/people/194 target=_blank>Justice</a> feared, averting, for they dwelt without a judge in peace. Descended not the steeps, shorn from its height, the lofty pine, cleaving the trackless waves of alien shores, nor distant realms were known to wandering men. The towns were not entrenched for time of war; they had no brazen trumpets, straight, nor horns of curving brass, nor helmets, shields nor swords. There was no thought of martial pomp — secure a happy multitude enjoyed repose. Then of her own accord the earth produced a store of every fruit. The harrow touched her not, nor did the plowshare wound her fields. And man content with given food, and none compelling, gathered arbute fruits and wild strawberries on the mountain sides, and ripe blackberries clinging to the bush, and corners and sweet acorns on the ground, down fallen from the spreading tree of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>. Eternal Spring! Soft breathing zephyrs soothed and warmly cherished buds and blooms, produced without a seed. The valleys though unplowed gave many fruits; the fields though not renewed white glistened with the heavy bearded wheat: rivers flowed milk and nectar, and the trees, the very oak trees, then gave honey of themselves. </p>                        </div>

Clothed in a skin torn from a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>, he was armed, complete, with lance of glittering steel; and with a dart: but passing these he had a dauntless soul. When he explored the grove and there beheld the lifeless bodies, and above them stretched the vast victorious dragon licking up the blood that issued from their ghastly wounds; his red tongues dripping gore; then <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a> filled with rage and grief; 'Behold, my faithful ones! I will avenge your deaths or I will share it!' He spoke; and lifted up a mill-stone huge, in his right hand, and having poised it, hurled with a tremendous effort dealing such a blow would crush the strongest builded walls; yet neither did the dragon flinch the shock nor was he wounded, for his armour-scales, fixed in his hard and swarthy hide, repelled the dreadful impact. Not the javelin thus, so surely by his armoured skin was foiled, for through the middle segment of his spine the steel point pierced, and sank beneath the flesh, deep in his entrails. Writhing in great pain he turned his head upon his bleeding back, twisting the shaft, with force prodigious shook it back and forth, and wrenched it from the wound; with difficulty wrenched it. But the steel remained securely fastened in his bones. Such agony but made increase of rage: his throat was swollen with great knotted veins; a white froth gathered on his poisonous jaws; the earth resounded with his rasping scales; he breathed upon the grass a pestilence, steaming mephitic from his Stygian mouth. His body writhes up in tremendous gyres; his folds, now straighter than a beam, untwist; he rushes forward on his vengeful foe, his great breast crushing the deep-rooted trees. Small space gave <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a> to the dragon's rage, for by the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>'s spoil he stood the shock, and thrusting in his adversary's jaws the trusted lance gave check his mad career. Wild in his rage the dragon bit the steel and fixed his teeth on the keen-biting point: out from his poisoned palate streams of gore spouted and stained the green with sanguine spray. Yet slight the wound for he recoiled in time, and drew his wounded body from the spear; by shrinking from the sharp steel saved his throat a mortal wound. But <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a> as he pressed the spear-point deeper in the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>'s throat, pursued him till an oak-tree barred the way; to this he fixed the dragon through the neck: the stout trunk bending with the monster's weight, groaned at the lashing of his <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> tail. </p>                        </div>

Even the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>, the vultures and the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a> refuse to touch the putrid flesh, there in the sultry sun rotting upon the earth; emitting steams, and exhalations, with a baneful sweep increasing the dread contagion's wide extent. So spreading, with renewed destruction gained from its own poison, the fierce pestilence appeared to leap from moulding carcases of all the brute creation, till it struck the wretched tillers of the soil, and then extended its dominion over all this mighty city. Always it began as if the patient's bowels were scorched with flames; red blotches on the body next appeared, and sharp pains in the lungs prevented breath. The swollen tongue would presently loll out, rough and discolored from the gaping mouth, wide-gasping to inhale the noxious air — and show red throbbing veins. The softest bed. And richest covering gave to none relief; but rather, the diseased would bare himself to cool his burning breast upon the ground, only to heat the earth — and no relief returned. And no physician could be found; for those who ministered among the sick were first to suffer from the dread disease — the cruel malady broke out upon the very ones who offered remedies. The hallowed art of medicine became a deadly snare to those who knew it best. The only safety was in flight; and those who were the nearest to the stricken ones, and who most faithfully observed their wants, were always first to suffer as their wards. And many, certain of approaching death, indulged their wicked passions — recklessly abandoned and without the sense of shame, promiscuously huddled by the wells, and rivers and cool fountains; but their thirst no water could assuage, and death alone was able to extinguish their desire. Too weak to rise, they die in water they pollute, while others drink its death. A madness seizing on them made their beds become most irksome to their tortured nerves. Demented they could not endure the pain, and leaped insanely forth. Or if too weak, the wretches rolled their bodies on the ground, insistent to escape from hated homes — imagined sources of calamity; for, since the cause was hidden and unknown, the horrible locality was blamed. Suspicion seizes on each frail presence as proof of what can never be resolved. And many half-dead wretches staggered out on sultry roads as long as they could stand; and others weeping, stretched out on the ground, died in convulsions, as their rolling eyes gazed upwards at the overhanging clouds; under the sad stars they breathed out their souls. </p>                        </div>

I was tortured with a passionate desire to die the same death — And I hated life. No matter where my shrinking eyes were turned, I saw a multitude of gruesome forms in ghastly attitudes bestrew the ground, scattered as rotten apples that have dropped from moving branches, or as acorns thick around a gnarled oak. Lift up your eyes! Behold that holy temple! unto <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> long dedicated! — What availed the prayers of frightened multitudes, or incense burned on those devoted altars? — In the midst of his most fervent supplications, the husband as he pled for his dear wife, or the fond father for his stricken son, would suddenly, before a word prevailed, die clutching at the altars of his Gods, while holding in his stiffened hand, a spray of frankincense still waiting for the fire. How often sacrificial <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> have been brought to those temples, and while white-robed priest was pouring offered wine between their horns, have fallen without waiting for the stroke. While I prepared a sacrifice to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>, for my behalf, my country and three sons, the victim, ever moaning dismal sounds, before a blow was struck, fell suddenly beside the altar; and his scanty blood ran thinly from the knives that slaughtered him. His entrails, wanting all the marks of truth were so diseased, the warnings of the Gods could not be read — the baneful malady had penetrated to the heart of life. And I have seen the carcases of men lie rotting at the sacred temple gates, or by the very altars, where they fell, making death odious to the living Gods. And often I have seen some desperate man end life by his own halter, and so cheat by voluntary death his fear of death, in mad haste to outrun approaching fate. The bodies of the dead, indecently were cast forth, lacking sacred funeral rites as hitherto the custom. All the gates were crowded with processions of the dead. Unburied, they might lie upon the ground, or else, deserted, on their lofty pyres with no one to lament their dismal end, dissolve in their dishonored ashes. All restraint forgotten, a mad rabble fought and took possession of the burning pyres, and even the dead were ravished of their rest. — And who should mourn them wanting, all the souls of sons and husbands, and of old and young, must wander unlamented: and the land sufficed not for the crowded sepulchers: and the dense forest was denuded of all trees. </p>                        </div>

There was a billet in the room, and this they took and cast upon the wasting flames, and as they spun and drew the fatal threads they softly chanted, 'Unto you we give, O child new-born! only the life of this; the period of this billet is your life.' And having spoken so, they vanished in the smoke. <a href=/people/1122 target=_blank>Althaea</a> snatched the billet from the fire, and having quenched it with drawn water, hid it long and secretly in her own room, where, thus preserved, it acted as a charm to save the life of <a href=/people/315 target=_blank>Meleager</a>. This the mother now brought forth, and fetched a pile of seasoned tinder ready for the torch. She lit the torches and the ready pile, and as the flames leaped up, four times prepared to cast the fatal billet in the midst; and four times hesitated to commit the dreadful deed, — so long the contest veered between the feelings of a mother's breast and the fierce vengeance of a sister's rage. Now is the mother's visage pale with fear, and now the sister's sanguinary rage glows in her eyes. Her countenance contorts with cruel threats and in bewildered ways dissolves compassionate: And even when the heat of anger had dried up her eyes the conflict of her passion brought new tears. As when the wind has seized upon a ship and blows against a tide of equal force, the vexed vessel feels repellent powers, and with unsteady motion sways to both; so did <a href=/people/1122 target=_blank>Althaea</a> hesitate between the conflict of her passions: when her rage had cooled, her fury was as fast renewed: but always the unsatisfied desire of blood, to ease the disembodied shades of her slain brothers, seemed to overcome the mother-instinct; and intensity of conduct proved the utmost test of love. </p>                        </div>

When all his wealth at last was eaten up, his daughter, worthy of a fate more kind, alone was left to him and her he sold. Descendant of a noble race, the girl refusing to be purchased as a slave, then hastened to the near shore of the sea, and as she stretched her arms above the waves, implored kind <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a> with her tears, 'Oh, you who have deprived me of virginity, deliver me from such a master's power!' Although the master, seeking her, had seen her only at that moment, <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a> changed her quickly from a woman to a man, by giving her the features of a man and garments proper to a fisher-man: and there she stood. He even looked at her and cried out, 'Hey, there! Expert of the rod! While you are casting forth the bit of brass, concealed so deftly in its tiny bait, — gods-willing! let the sea be smooth for you, and let the foolish fishes swimming up, never know danger till they snap the hook! Now tell me where is she, who only now, in tattered garment and wind-twisted hair, was standing on this shore — for I am sure I saw her standing on this shore, although no footstep shows her flight.' By this assured the favor of the god protected her; delighted to be questioned of herself, she said, 'No matter who you are, excuse me. So busy have I been at catching fish, I have not had the time to move my eyes from this pool; and that you may be assured I only tell the truth, may <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a>, God of ocean witness it, I have not seen a man where I am standing on this shore — myself excepted — not a woman has stood here.' Her master could not doubt it, and deceived retraced his footsteps from the sandy shore. As soon as he had disappeared, her form unchanged, was given back to her. But when her father knew his daughter could transform her body and escape, he often sold her first to one and then another — all of whom she cheated — as a mare, bird, a <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>, or as a stag she got away; and so brought food, dishonestly, to ease his greed. And so he lived until the growing strength of famine, gnawing at his vitals, had consumed all he could get by selling her: his anguish burned him with increasing heat. He gnawed his own flesh, and he tore his limbs and fed his body all he took from it. </p>                        </div>

And I have struggled, wretched nights and days, to overcome the cruelties of love, too dreadful for a frail girl to endure, for they most surely are all <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Cupid</a>'s art. I have been overborne and must confess my passion, while with timid prayers I plead; for only you can save me. You alone may now destroy the one who loves you best: so you must choose what will be the result. The one who prays is not your enemy; but one most closely joined to you, yet asks to knit the tie more firmly. Let old men be governed by propriety, and talk of what is right and wrong, and hold to all the nice distinctions of strict laws. But <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a>, has no fixed law for those whose age is ours, is heedless and compliant. And we have not yet discovered what is right or wrong, and all we should do is to imitate the known example of the Gods. We have no father's harsh rule, and we have no care for reputation, and no fear that keeps us from each other. But there may be cause for fear, and we may hide our stolen love, because a sister is at liberty to talk with her dear brother — quite apart: we may embrace and kiss each other, though in public. What is wanting? Pity her whose utmost love compels her to confess; and let it not be written on her tomb, her death was for your sake and love denied.' </p>                        </div>

It would be better for me, if we were but strangers to each other; for I then, could wish to go, and leave my native land, and so escape temptation to this crime: but my unhappy passion holds me here, that I may see <a href=/people/976 target=_blank>Cinyras</a> face to face, and touch him, talk with him and even kiss him — the best, if nothing else can be allowed. But what more could be asked for, by the most depraved? Think of the many sacred ties and loved names, you are dragging to the mire: the rival of your mother, will you be the mistress of your father, and be named the sister of your son, and make yourself the mother of your brother? And will you not dread the sisters with black <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> for hair. Whom guilty creatures, such as you, can see brandish relentless flames before their eyes and faces? While your body has not sinned you must not let sin creep into your heart, and violate great Nature's law with your unlawful rovings. If you had the right to long for his endearment, it could not be possible. He is a virtuous man and is regardful of the moral law — oh how I wish my passion could be his!' </p>                        </div>

Her father, sure it all was of a virginal alarm, as he is telling her she need not weep dries her wet cheeks and kisses her sweet lips. Too much delighted with his gentle words and kind endearments, Myrrha, when he asked again, which one might be her husband, said, 'The one just like yourself.', And he replied not understanding what her heart would say, 'You answer as a loving-daughter should.'

The thought of death gave comfort to her heart. Resolved to hang herself, she sat upright; then, as she tied her girdle to a beam, she said, 'Farewell, beloved <a href=/people/976 target=_blank>Cinyras</a>, and may you know the cause of my sad death.'

The girl in stubborn silence only fixed her eyes upon the ground — sad that her first attempt at death, because too slow, was foiled. The old nurse-woman urged and urged, and showed her gray hair and her withered breasts, and begged her by the memory of her cradle days, and baby nourishment, to hide no more from her long-trusted nurse what caused her grief. The girl turned from her questions with a sigh. The nurse, still more determined to know all, promised fidelity and her best aid — 'Tell me,' she said, 'and let me give you help; my old age offers means for your relief: if it be frantic passion, I have charms and healing herbs; or, if an evil spell was worked on you by someone, you shall be cured to your perfect self by magic rites; or, if your actions have enraged the Gods, a sacrifice will satisfy their wrath.

Just like a mad girl, Myrrha sprang away, and with her face deep-buried in a couch, sobbed out, 'Go from me or stop asking me my cause of grief — it is a crime of shame — I cannot tell it!' Horrified the nurse stretched forth her trembling hands, palsied with age and fear. She fell down at the feet of her loved foster-child, and coaxing her and frightening her, she threatened to disclose her knowledge of the halter and of what she knew of her attempted suicide; and after all was said, she gave her word to help the girl, when she had given to her a true confession of her sad heart-love. The girl just lifted up her face, and laid it, weeping, on the bosom of her nurse. She tried so often to confess, and just as often checked her words, her shamed face hid deep in her garment: 'Oh', at last she groans, 'O mother blessed in your husband — oh!' Only that much she said and groaned. The nurse felt a cold horror stealing through her heart and frame, for she now understood it all. And her white hair stood bristling on her head, while with the utmost care of love and art she strove to use appropriate words and deeds, to banish the mad passion of the girl. Though Myrrha knew that she was truly warned, she was resolved to die, unless she could obtain the object of her wicked love.

What they have told is not an idle tale. — She did excel them all — and you could not have said whether her swift speed or her beauty was more worthy of your praise. When this maid once consulted with an oracle, of her fate after marriage, the god answered her: 'You, <a href=/people/697 target=_blank>Atalanta</a>, never will have need of husband, who will only be your harm. For your best good you should avoid the tie; but surely you will not avoid your harm; and while yet living you will lose yourself.' She was so frightened by the oracle, she lived unwedded in far shaded woods; and with harsh terms repulsed insistent throngs of suitors. 'I will not be won,' she said, 'Till I am conquered first in speed. <a href=/people/4053 target=_blank>Contest</a> the race with me. A wife and couch shall both be given to reward the swift, but death must recompense the one who lags behind. This must be the condition of a race.'

Were covered instantly with tawny manes; their fingers bent to claws; their arms were changed to fore-legs; and their bosoms held their weight; and with their tails they swept the sandy ground. Their casual glance is anger, and instead of words they utter growls. They haunt the woods, a bridal-room to their ferocious taste.

Before he went he told his faithful queen, his dear <a href=/people/2108 target=_blank>Halcyone</a>. She felt at once terror creep through the marrow of her bones, pallor of boxwood overspread her face, and her two cheeks were wet with gushing tears. Three times she tried to speak while tears and sobs delayed her voice, until at last she said: — 'What fault of mine, my dearest, has so changed your usual thoughts? Where is that care for me that always has stood first? Can you leave me for this long journey with no anxious fear — <a href=/people/2108 target=_blank>Halcyone</a>, forsaken in these halls? Will this long journey be a pleasant change because far from you I should be more dear? Perhaps you think you will go there by land, and I shall only grieve, and shall not fear the sea affrights me with its tragic face. Just lately I observed some broken planks upon our seashore, and I've read and read the names of seamen on their empty tombs! Oh, let no false assurance fill your mind because your father-in-law is <a href=/people/289 target=_blank>Aeolus</a>. Who in a dungeon shuts the stormful winds and smoothes at will the troubled ocean waves soon as the winds get freedom from his power, they take entire possession of the deep, and nothing is forbidden their attack; and all the rights of every land and sea are disregarded by them. They insult even the clouds of heaven and their wild concussions urge the lightnings to strike fires. The more I know of them, for I knew them in my childhood and I often saw them from my father's home, the more I fear. But, O dear husband! if this new resolve can not be altered by my prayers and fears, and if you are determined, take me, too: some comfort may be gained, if in the storms we may be tossed together. I shall fear only the ills that really come to us, together we can certainly endure discomforts till we gain that distant land.' </p>                        </div>

Reluctant to give up the voyage, even more to make <a href=/people/2108 target=_blank>Halcyone</a> his partner on the dangerous sea, he answered her complaints in many ways to pacify her breast, but could not comfort her until at last he said, 'This separation from your love will be most sorrowful; and so I swear to you, as witnessed by the sacred fire of my Star-father, if the fates permit my safe return, I will come back to you before the moon has rounded twice her orb.' These promises gave hope of his return. Without delay he ordered a ship should be drawn forth from the dock, launched in the sea, and properly supplied against the needs of travel. — Seeing this, <a href=/people/2108 target=_blank>Halcyone</a>, as if aware of future woe, shuddered, wept, and embraced him, and in extreme woe said with a sad voice, 'Ah — Farewell!' and then, her nerveless body sank down to the ground. While <a href=/people/1409 target=_blank>Ceyx</a> longed for some pretext to delay, the youthful oarsmen, chosen for their strength, in double rows began to draw the oars back towards their hardy breasts, cutting the waves with equal strokes. She raised her weeping eyes and saw her husband on the high-curved stern. He by his waving hand made signs to her, and she returned his signals. Then the ship moved farther from the shore until her eyes could not distinguish his loved countenance. Still, while she could, she followed with her gaze the fading hull; and, when that too was lost far in the distance, she remained and gazed at the white topsails, waving from the mast. But, when she could no longer see the sails, with anxious heart she sought her lonely couch and laid herself upon it. Couch and room renewed her sorrow and reminded her how much of life was absent on the sea. </p>                        </div>

Now the captain bade the idle oars be drawn up to the sides. They ran the pointed sailyards up the mast and with spread canvas caught the coming breeze. Perhaps the ship had not sailed half her course, on every side the land was out of sight in fact at a great distance, when, towards dark the sea grew white with its increasing waves, while boisterous east winds blew with violence. — prompt in his duty, the captain warns his crew, 'Lower the top sails — quick — furl all the sails tight to the yards!' — He ordered, but the storm bore all his words away, his voice could not be heard above the roaring of the sea. But of their own accord some sailors rushed to draw the oars in, others to secure the sides from danger, and some strove to pull the sails down from the wind. One pumps the waves up from the hold, and pours the rushing sea again into the sea; another takes the yards off. — While such things are being done without command or order, the wild storm increases, and on every side fierce winds wage a destructive warfare, which stirs up the furious waters to their utmost power. Even the captain, terrified, confessed he did not know the status of the ship, and could not order nor forbid the men — so great the storm, so far beyond his skill. Then he gave up control, while frightened men shouted above the rattled cordage shocks, and heavy waves were dashed against huge waves, and ail the sky reverberated with terrific thunders. The deep sea upturned tremendous billows, which appeared to reach so near the heaven they touched the heavy clouds with foam of their tossed waters. — At one time, while the great billows churned up yellow sand from off the bottom, the wild rolling waves were of that color.

Often the waves fell on the sides with crash as terrible as when a flying stone or iron ram shatters a citadel. As <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a>, mustering up their strength anew, might hurl their breasts against the spears and outstretched arms of huntsmen, so the waves, upon the rising of the winds, rushed forth against the battered sides of the tossed ship and rose much higher than the slanting masts. The ship-bolts lost their grip, the loosened planks, despoiled of covering wax, gave open seams, through which streamed water of the fatal waves. — vast sheets of rain pour from dissolving clouds, so suddenly, it seemed that all the heavens were flung into the deep, while swelling seas ascended to the emptied fields of heaven! The sails are drenched with rain, the salt sea waves are mingled with the waters of the skies. The firmament is black without a star, and night is doubly dark with its own gloom and blackness of the storm. Quick lightning makes the black skies glitter, and the waves are fired with flames of thunder-bolts. Now floods leap up into the very middle of the ship. Just as a soldier, more courageous than the rest of his brave fellows, after he has often charged against the embattled walls of a defended city, gains at length the place which he has fought for; all inflamed with his desire of glory, scales the wall and stands alone among a thousand foes; so, when destructive waves have beat against the ship's high sides, the tenth wave with known power, rushes more furious than the nine before, nor ceases to attack the failing ship, until dashed high above the captured walls it surges in the hold. Part of the sea is still attempting to get in the ship, and part is in it. All are panic stricken, like men within a doomed and shaken town; who see some foes attack the walls without, and others hold possession of the walls within the city. Every art has failed, their courage sinks. With every coming wave another death seems rushing in upon them. One sailor yields in tears; another falls down, stupefied; another calls those blest whom funeral rites await; another prays, addressing trusted gods, lifting his hands up to that heaven unseen, as vainly he implores some aid divine, and one in fright recalls his brothers and his parent, while another names his children and his home: each frightened sailor thinks of all he left. </p>                        </div>

Ah, how he tried to look back to the shore of his loved land, to turn his last gaze towards his wife and home. But he has lost direction. — The tossed sea is raging in a hurricane so vast, and all the sky is hidden by the gloom of thickened storm-clouds, doubled in pitch-black. The mast is shattered by the violence of drenching tempests, and the useless helm is broken.

King <a href=/people/1409 target=_blank>Ceyx</a> clung to a fragment of the wreck with that majestic hand which often before had proudly swayed the sceptre.

He longs to have his body carried by waves to her dear gaze and have at last, entombment by the hands of his loved friends. Swimming, he called <a href=/people/2108 target=_blank>Halcyone</a> — far off, as often as the billows would allow his lips to open, and among the waves his darling's name was murmured, till at last a night-black arch of water swept above the highest waves and buried him beneath engulfing billows. <a href=/people/11021 target=_blank>Lucifer</a> was dim past recognition when the dawn appeared and, since he never could depart from heaven, soon hid his grieving countenance in clouds. </p>                        </div>

In that form as one deprived of life, devoid of clothes, wan and ghastly, he stood beside the bed of the sad wife. The hero's beard seemed dripping, sea water streamed down from his drenching hair. Then leaning on the bed, while dropping tears were running down his cheeks, he said these words: 'Most wretched wife, can you still recognize your own loved <a href=/people/1409 target=_blank>Ceyx</a>, or have my looks changed: so much with death you can not? — Look at me, and you will be assured I am your own: but here instead of your dear husband, you will find only his ghost.

Why do you hurry from me? We will go together!' Agitated by her own excited voice; and by what seemed to be her own dear husband, she awoke from sleep. And first looked all about her to persuade herself that he whom she had lately seen must yet be with her, for she had aroused the servants who in haste brought lights desired. </p>                        </div>

Alas, I saw him pale and naked, with his hair still dripping — his ghost from the waves stood on this very spot:' and while she moaned she sought his footprints on the floor. 'Alas, this was my fear, and this is what my mind shuddered to think of, when I begged that you would not desert me for the wind's control. But how I wish, since you were sailing forth to perish, that you had but taken me with you. If I had gone with you, it would have been advantage to me, for I should have shared the whole course of my life with you and you would not have met a separate death. I linger here but I have met my death, I toss on waves, and drift upon the sea. My heart would be more cruel than the waves, if it should ask me to endure this life — if I should struggle to survive such grief. I will not strive nor leave you so forlorn, at least I'll follow you to death. If not the urn at least the lettered stone shall keep us still together. If your bones are not united with my bones, 'tis sure our names must be united.'Overcome with grief, she could not say another word — but she continued wailing, and her groans were heaved up from her sorrow-stricken breast. </p>                        </div>

At first even she could not be sure of what she saw. But presently although still distant — it was certainly a floating corpse. She could not see what man he might be, but because it seemed to her it surely was a shipwrecked body, she was moved as at an omen and began to weep; and, moaning as she stood there, said: — 'Ah wretched one, whoever it may be, ah, wretched is the wife whom you have left!' As driven by the waves the body came still nearer to her, she was less and less the mistress of herself, the more she looked upon it; and, when it was close enough for her to see its features, she beheld her husband.

And as he sought through the fierce battle's press, either for Cygnus or for <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>, he met Cygnus and engaged at once with him (<a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a> had preserved great <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a> from such foe till ten years from that day). Cheering his steeds, their white necks pressed upon the straining yoke, he steered the chariot towards his foe, and, brandishing the spear with his strong arm, he cried, 'Whoever you may be, you have the consolation of a glorious death you die by me, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=person long=22.3 lat=39.4>Haemonian</a> <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>!' His heavy spear flew after the fierce words. Although the spear was whirled direct and true, yet nothing it availed with sharpened point. It only bruised, as with a blunted stroke, the breast of Cygnus! 'By report we knew of you before this battle, goddess born.' The other answered him, 'But why are you surprised that I escape the threatened wound?' (<a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> was surprised). 'This helmet crowned, great with its tawny horse-hair, and this shield, broad-hollowed, on my left arm, are not held for help in war: they are but ornament, as <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> wears armor. All of them shall be put off, and I will fight with you unhurt. It is a privilege that I was born not as you, of a <a href=/people/590 target=_blank>Nereid</a> but of him whose powerful rule is over <a href=/people/428 target=_blank>Nereus</a>, his daughters and their ocean.'

Nor harp nor singing voice nor long pipe made of boxwood pierced with holes, delighted them.

What else could they admit or think of, while the great <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> spoke or listened to them? But especially the recent victory over Cygnus held them ardent. Wonderful it seemed to them that such a youth could be composed of flesh not penetrable by the sharpest spear; of flesh which blunted even hardened steel, and never could be wounded.

Conspicuous for his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> lance and sword and shield, facing both sides — each way, he insolently clashed his arms; and while he rode poured out these words in empty air. 'Shall I put up with one like you, O <a href=/people/1256 target=_blank>Caeneus</a>? For you are still a woman in my sight. Have you forgot your birth or that disgrace by which you won reward — at what a price you got the false resemblance to a man?! Consider both your birth, and what you have submitted to!

Not long ago I was a mortal man, yet even then my thought turned to the sea and all my living came from waters deep, for I would drag the nets that swept up fish, or, seated on a rock, I flung the line forth from the rod. The shore I loved was near a verdant meadow. One side were the waves, the other grass, which never had been touched by horned, grazing <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>. Harmless <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and shaggy <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> had never cropped it — no industrious <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a> came there to harvest flowers; no festive garlands had been gathered there, adornments of the head; no mower's hands had ever cut it. I was certainly the first who ever sat upon that turf, — while I was drying there the dripping nets. And so that I might in due order count the fish that I had caught, I laid out those which by good chance were driven into my nets, or credulous, were caught on my barbed hooks. It all seems like a fiction (but what good can I derive from fictions?) just as soon as any of my fish-prey touched the grass, they instantly began to move and skip as usual in sea water. While I paused and wondered, all of them slid to the waves, and left me, their late captor, and the shore. </p>                        </div>

What god had done this? Or perhaps the juice of some herb caused it? 'But,' I said, 'what herb can have such properties?' and with my hand I plucked the grass and chewed it with my teeth. My throat had hardly time to swallow those unheard of juices, when I suddenly felt all my entrails throbbing inwardly, and my entire mind also, felt possessed by passions foreign to my life before. I could not stay in that place, and I said with shouting, 'Farewell! dry land! never more shall I revisit you;' and with those words upon my lips, I plunged beneath the waves. The gods of that deep water gave to me, when they received me, kindred honors, while they prayed <a href=/people/527 target=_blank>Oceanus</a> and <a href=/people/832 target=_blank>Tethys</a> both to take from me such mortal essence as might yet remain. So I was purified by them and after a good charm had been nine times repeated over me, which washed away all guilt, I was commanded then to put my breast beneath a hundred streams. So far I can relate to you all things most worthy to be told; for all so far I can remember; but from that time on I was unconscious of the many things that followed. When my mind returned to me, I found myself entirely different from what I was before; and my changed mind was not the same as it had always been. Then, for the first time I beheld this beard so green in its deep color, and I saw my flowing hair which now I sweep along the spacious seas, and my huge shoulders with their azure colored arms, and I observed my leg extremities hung tapering exactly perfect as a finny fish. But what avail is this new form to me. Although it pleased the Ocean deities? What benefit, although I am a god, if you are not persuaded by these things?' </p>                        </div>

The other two devoid of weight, are air and — even lighter — fire: and, if these two are not constrained, they seek the higher regions. These four elements, though far apart in space, are all derived from one another. <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> dissolves as flowing water! Water, thinned still more, departs as wind and air; and the light air, still losing weight, sparkles on high as fire.

What is more wonderful, there are some waters which change not only bodies but the minds: who has no knowledge of the <a href=/people/4289 target=_blank>Salmacis</a> and of its ill famed waves? Who has not heard of the lakes of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Aethiopia</a>: how those who drink of them go raving mad or fall in a deep sleep, most wonderful in heaviness.

He does not live either on grain or herbs, but only on small drops of frankincense and juices of amomum. When this bird completes a full five centuries of life straightway with talons and with shining beak he builds a nest among palm branches, where they join to form the palm tree's waving top. As soon as he has strewn in this new nest the cassia bark and ears of sweet spikenard, and some bruised cinnamon with yellow myrrh, he lies down on it and refuses life among those dreamful odors. — And they say that from the body of the dying bird is reproduced a little <a href=/people/1543 target=_blank>Phoenix</a> which is destined to live just as many years. When time has given to him sufficient strength and he is able to sustain the weight, he lifts the nest up from the lofty tree and dutifully carries from that place his cradle and the parent's sepulchre.

Such effort might have checked the madness of my steeds, had not a wheel, striking the hub on a projecting stump, been shattered and hurled in fragments from the axle.

The sad sun's face gave to the frightened world a livid light; and in the night-time torches seemed to burn amid the stars, and often drops of blood fell in rain-showers. Then <a href=/people/11021 target=_blank>Lucifer</a> shone blue with all his visage stained by darksome rust. The chariot of the moon was sprinkled with red blood. The Stygian <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a> gave to the world ill omens. In a thousand places, tears were shed by the ivory statues. Dirges, too, are said to have been heard, and threatening words by unknown speakers in the sacred groves.
