Later a segment of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=ethnic long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthians</a> settled it and changed the name to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer class=place long=19.9156 lat=39.6063>Kerkyra</a>, and ruled over the sea around. When <a href=/people/2063 target=_blank>Phaiax</a>, who reigned on the island, died, his sons <a href=/people/10603 target=_blank>Alkinous</a> and <a href=/people/4000 target=_blank>Lokros</a> after quarreling came together again on the basis that <a href=/people/10603 target=_blank>Alkinous</a> would be king of Phaiakis, and <a href=/people/4000 target=_blank>Lokros</a> would take the heirlooms and part of the ethnos to make a colony. He sailed for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and was hosted by <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a> the king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>, who gave him his daughter Laurine in marriage.

Discovering this, <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Herakles</a> shot with his bow and killed him, and brought back the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a>. <a href=/people/4000 target=_blank>Lokros</a>, fearing <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Herakles</a> might suffer something terrible at the hands of <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a>, who was strong in body and spirit, had hastened to the aid of his guest, having put on military gear. <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Herakles</a> seeing him running and thinking he was someone rushing to support <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a>, loosed a shaft and killed him. After he learned he mourned loudly and conducted the rites for him. And when he had passed from among men he appeared to the people as a ghost and ordered them to establish a city by the tomb of <a href=/people/4000 target=_blank>Lokros</a>. And the city keeps the name in honor of <a href=/people/4000 target=_blank>Lokros</a>. So this is the third narrative.

He says that <a href=/people/7228 target=_blank>Amolios</a> plotted to kill his brother Nemetor and made his daughter <a href=/people/11007 target=_blank>Ilia</a> the priestess of <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Hestia</a> so she would not have a child or husband. <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> had sex with her and when their intercourse was over he declared who he was and that she would bear two sons from him and she should be brave. But <a href=/people/7228 target=_blank>Amolios</a> put her in prison as she was giving birth, and gave the newborns to a certain shepherd he trusted to kill them. But he who took them did not accept having the pollution on his own hands and cast them loose in a boat to be carried down the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>. After a long journey it was caught in the roots of a huge wild fig tree that grew where the bank jutted out. And there the boat dumped the children on the soft, sandy earth of the bank. A <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> that had just given birth came across the boys and straddling them offered her teats when they wailed and reached out their hands. She nursed them, and they relieved the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>'s distress. <a href=/people/10045 target=_blank>Phaistylos</a> a shepherd saw this and thought it supernatural. He took the children and raised them as his own. At a later time he meets the shepherd who was to expose them and learns all about the children, and he tells them, now adolescents already, that they are of royal lineage and offspring of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>, and what their mother and grandfather had suffered. They (both were handsome of appearance and of indomitable strength and brave in daring) immediately grabbed and concealed their daggers and left for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=place long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alba</a>. Meeting <a href=/people/7228 target=_blank>Amolios</a>, they exacted their punishment, killing him with swords, since it was unexpected and he took no precaution against a plot. They freed their mother from her bonds and were accepted by the crowd and reigned in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=place long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alba</a> and the lands around it. When a great crowd of people came to join them, they emigrate from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=place long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alba</a> and built a city naming it <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, meaning having dominance over humanity. There is on display among the Romans as witness of what happened then a sacred wild fig tree by the forum, fenced round by the bronze latticework of the council house, and a hut in the sanctuary of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, a testament to the way of life of <a href=/people/10045 target=_blank>Phaistylos</a>, which they preserve by incorporating new sticks and scraps. </p>                        </div>
