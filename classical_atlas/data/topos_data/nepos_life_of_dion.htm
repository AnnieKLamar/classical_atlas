He was familiar with the elder <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, not less on account of his character than his relationship; for though the cruelty of <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> offended him, yet he was desirous that he should be secure because of his family connexion with himself, and still more for the sake of his own relatives. He aided him in important matters, and the tyrant was greatly influenced by his advice, unless, in any case, some violent humour of his own interposed. But embassies, such at least as were of a more distinguished kind, were all conducted by <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a>; and by discharging them assiduously, and managing faithfully, he palliated the most cruel name of tyrant with his own benevolence. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> so much respected him, when he was sent thither by <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, that they never regarded any man that spoke the Greek tongue with more admiration. </p>                        </div>

When a report reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, too, that <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> was come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>, <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> could not refuse the young man leave to send for him, as <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a> was inflamed with a desire of hearing him. He accordingly granted him that permission, and brought <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> with great pomp to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a>; whom <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a> so greatly admired and loved, that he devoted himself wholly to his society; nor was <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> less delighted with <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a>. Although, therefore, <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> was cruelly insulted by <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> (for he ordered him to be sold ), yet he paid a second visit to the city, induced again by the entreaties of <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a>. <br />In the meantime <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> fell ill of some disease, and when he was labouring under the severity of it, <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a> inquired of the physicians how he was, and begged them, at the same time, if he should happen to be in extreme danger, to acquaint him of it; for he wished to speak to him about a division of the realm, as he thought that the sons of his sister by him ought to have a share in the dominions. This request the physicians did not keep secret, but reported the words to <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> the younger, who, taking alarm at it, compelled the physicians to give his father a sleeping potion, that <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a> might have no opportunity of addressing him. The sick man, having taken the draught, ended his life like one buried in deep sleep. </p>                        </div>

As many people were indignant at this proceeding, and as it was the cause of great hatred to the tyrant, <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> put on board some vessels all the property of <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a> that could be removed, and sent it after him; for he wished it to be thought that he had adopted that course, not from hatred of the man, but for the sake of his own safety. But when he heard that <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a> was levying troops in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a>, and endeavouring to raise a war against him, he gave <a href=/people/1501 target=_blank>Arete</a>, <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a>'s wife, in marriage to another man, and caused his son to be brought up in such a manner, that he might, through indulgence, be imbued with the most disgraceful propensities; for mistresses were brought him when but a boy, before he was full grown; he was overwhelmed with wine and luxuries, nor was any time allowed him to be sober. He was so little able to bear such a change in his way of life, which was altered after his father returned to his country (for keepers were set over him to draw him from his former mode of living), that he threw himself from the top of a house and so perished.

But <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a>, who trusted not so much to his troops as to the general hatred towards the tyrant, setting out, with the greatest courage, in two transport vessels, to attack a power of fifty years' growth, defended by five hundred ships of war, ten thousand cavalry, and a hundred thousand infantry, so easily made an impression upon it (what seemed wonderful to all people), that he entered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a> the third day after he touched the coast of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>.

In the first place she exercised her power over his son, of whom I have previously made mention; for after he had taken back his wife, who had been given to another, and wished to recall his son, from his abandoned course of sensuality, to habits of virtue, he received, as a father, a most severe affliction in the death of that son. A disagreement next arose between him and <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a>, who, refusing to yield the supremacy to <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a>, organized a party against him; nor had he indeed less influence than <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a> among the aristocracy, with whose sanction he commanded the fleet, while <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a> had the direction of the land forces. <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a> could not endure this opposition patiently, but retorted with that verse of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> in the second book of the <a href=/people/12111 target=_blank>Iliad</a>, in which is this sentiment, That a state cannot be managed well by the government of many. Much ill feeling, on the part of the people, followed this remark; for he appeared to have let it escape him that he wished everything to be under his own authority. This feeling he did not try to soften by conciliation, but to overcome by severity, and caused <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a>, when he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a>, to be put to death. </p>                        </div>

But after this division had taken place, money, as his daily expenses grew very great, began to fail him; nor was there anything on which he could lay his hands but the property of his friends; a circumstance which was attended with this effect, that while he gained the soldiery, he lost the aristocracy. At this state of things he was overcome with anxiety, and, being unaccustomed to be ill spoken of, he could not patiently endure that a bad opinion of him should be entertained by those by whose praises he had just before been extolled to the skies. The common people, however, when the feelings of the soldiers were rendered unfavourable towards him, spoke with less restraint, and said that he was a tyrant not to be endured. </p>                        </div>

But these proceedings, as many were privy to what was going on, became known, and were communicated to <a href=/people/658 target=_blank>Aristomache</a>, <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a>'s sister, and his wife <a href=/people/1501 target=_blank>Arete</a>; who, being struck with alarm, sought an interview with him for whose danger they were concerned. <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a> assured them that no plot was concerted against him by <a href=/people/710 target=_blank>Callicrates</a>, but that what was done, was done by his own directions.

These youths, as being well known, were admitted, but as soon as they had crossed the threshold, they bolted the door, seized him as he lay on his couch, and bound him. A great noise ensued, so that it was distinctly heard out of doors. And here it was easy to be understood, as has often been said before, how unpopular absolute power is, and how unhappy the life of those who had rather be feared than loved; for those very guards, if they had been favourably inclined towards him, might have saved him by breaking open the door, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378209PZak class=ethnic long=20.8921 lat=37.7872>Zacynthians</a>, who were unarmed, were holding him still alive, calling to those without for a weapon.
