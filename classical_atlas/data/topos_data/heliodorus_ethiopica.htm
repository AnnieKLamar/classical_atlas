Standing awhile they viewed the sea underneath them, and when they had looked a good season afar off into the same, and could see nothing which could put them in hope of prey, they cast their eyes towards the neighbouring shore, where a ship lay moored, without sailors but full freighted: which thing they who were afar off might easily conjecture, for the cargo brought the water up to the ship's third loading line. But on the shore every place was full of men newly-slain, some quite dead, some half dead, some whose bodies yet panted and plainly declared that there had been a battle fought of late. There could be seen no signs or tokens of any just quarrel, but only some poor confused remnants of an unlucky banquet which had ended so. For the tables were furnished with delicate dishes, some whereof lay in the hands of those that were slain, having served as weapons in the battle so suddenly begun. Others covered such as had crept under them to hide themselves, as they thought. Besides the cups were overthrown and fallen from the hands, either of them that drank, or those who had instead of stones used them. For that sudden mischief wrought new devices, and taught them instead of weapons to use their pots. Of those who lay there, one was wounded with an axe, another was hurt with the shells of fishes, whereof on the shore there was great plenty, another was battered with a club, many burnt by fire, and the rest by divers other means, but most of all were slain with arrows. To be brief, God showed a wonderful sight in so small a space, imbruing wine with blood, joining battle with banqueting, mingling indifferently slaughters with drinking, and killing with quaffings, providing such a sight for the thieves of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> to gaze at. For they, when they had looked upon these things a good while from the hill, could not understand what that sight meant, forasmuch as they saw some slain there, but the conquerors could they see nowhere, a manifest victory but no spoils taken away, a ship without mariners only but as concerning other things untouched, as if she had been kept with a guard of many men and lay at road in a peaceful harbour. </p>                        </div>

They were but a little way from the ship when they saw a sight more perplexing than the rest a great deal. A maid endowed with excellent beauty, who almost might be supposed a goddess, sat upon a rock, seeming not a little to be grieved with that present mischance, but for all that of excellent courage. She had a garland of laurel on her head, a quiver on her back; to her left shoulder a bow was fastened and her left arm hung carelessly down. Her right elbow she rested upon her thigh holding her cheek in her hand, looking downward, without moving her head, beholding a certain young man who lay before her, the which was sore wounded and seemed to lift up himself, as if he had been awakened out of a dead sleep, almost of death itself: yet was he in this case of singular beauty, and although his cheeks were besprinkled with blood, his whiteness did appear so much the more. He was constrained for grief to close his eyes, but the sight of the maiden drew them towards her, and they must needs see, because they saw her. As soon as he came to himself he heaved a deep sigh and uttered these words very faintly, 'And art thou safe indeed my sweetheart?' quoth he. 'Or hast thou by thy death augmented the slaughter? Canst thou not endure even after death to be separated from me that now a vision of thy spirit haunts this place of trouble?' 'Nay,' answered the maid, 'on you doth all my estate depend for good or ill, and for this cause, you see' — showing a knife in her hand — 'this has hitherto been waiting, and only by the chance of your recovery was restrained.' </p>                        </div>

For she seemed to them a thing of greater price, and more heavenly, when she stood upright, and her arrows with the sudden moving of her body gave a clash on her shoulders, her apparel wrought with gold glistered against the sun, and her hair under the garland, blown about with the wind, covered a great part of her back. The thieves were greatly afraid; and even more than what they saw did their ignorance of what had happened before terrify them. Some of them said indeed it was a goddess — <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, or <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> the lady of the land — others declared it was a priestess of the gods who, replenished with divine fury had made the great slaughter which there appeared. And they every man gave his verdict, because they knew not yet the truth. But she, hastily running to the young man, embraced him, wept for sorrow, kissed him, wiped away his blood, and made pitiful moan, scarcely believing that she held him in her arms. Which things when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> had seen they turned their opinions: 'And are these', said they, 'the works of a goddess? Would a goddess kiss a dead man with such compassion?' They determined therefore with themselves that it was best to take heart of grace, and draw near to find out the truth. When they had therefore encouraged each other a little, they ran down, and found the maid busy in dressing the young man's wounds, and coming behind her suddenly stood still, and durst neither speak nor do anything more for their lives. </p>                        </div>

Such is the force of earnest desire and true love; it despiseth all outwards chances, be they pleasant or otherwise, only beholding that which it loveth, and thereabout bestoweth all diligence and travail. But when the thieves passed by and stood before her, and seemed as though they would enterprise somewhat, she lifted herself up again, and beholding them black and ill favoured said: — 'If you be the spirits of those who are slain here, you trouble us wrongfully, for most of you were slain by your own hands: as for us, if we slew any, we did it but in our own defence to repel the violence which was proffered to my virginity. But if you be men alive, it seemeth you are thieves and you have come here in good season: rid us, I pray, from these present miseries and by death finish this our unhappy tragedy.' Thus did she sorrowfully lament. But they, not understanding what she said, left them there, accounting their weakness a sufficient guard, and hastened to the ship, and brought out that which was in the same, paying no regard to other things, whereof therein was great store, but every man bearing out as much as he could of gold, silver, precious stones, and silk. And when they thought they had enough, and there was such plenty as might satisfy even a thief's greed, laying their booty on the shore they fell to dividing it into portions such as they could carry, not according to the worth and value of what they had, but contenting themselves with equality of weight. As for the young man and the maid, they would take order for them afterward. </p>                        </div>

For they were in number but ten, and those who came upon them were three times as many. And so the maid and her companion, though not yet prisoners, were again in durance. But the robbers, although they were eager for the spoil, yet, partly because they knew not what these things signified which they saw, and partly also for fear, stayed themselves a while, thinking that the former slaughter had been made by the thieves that had been there before. But when they beheld the maid in her fine foreign dress, who despised the dangers that hung over her head as if they had been none, and altogether employed her care to ease the young man's wounds, taking his grief as heavily as her own sorrow, they not only marvelled at her beauty and high spirit, but were wonderfully moved by the comeliness of the wounded man's person. Such was the seemliness of his countenance and tallness of his stature, as he lay before them. For by this time he was a little mended and his person had recovered its old handsomeness again. At length after they had beheld them a good while, and he drew near who was their master, he laid hand on the maid and bade her arise and follow him. She, although she understood not what he said, conjecturing what he wished her to do, drew the young man with her himself holding her fast, and pointing with a knife to her breast threatened that she would kill herself if they carried them not away both together. Which thing when the master, partly by her talk but more plainly by her gestures understood, hoping also to use the young man's help in great affairs when he recovered, he alighted himself from his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and commanded is harness-bearer likewise so to do, and set his prisoners upon them. Then, ordering the rest when they had gathered up the prey to follow them, he himself like a lackey ran by their side and stayed them upright, if by reason of their infirmity they were likely to fall. Surely this deed was not without glory; for he who was their master now waited upon them, and he who took them prisoners was content to serve them. Such is the impression that nobility makes, and such the force of comeliness, which can subdue the disposition of thieves and bring under the wild and savage. </p>                        </div>

And having with difficulty gone over the top of the said hill, they hastened to a pool that lay on the other side thereof, the manner whereof was thus. The whole place is called by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> The Pasture Land, about the which is a low valley which receiveth certain exundations of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, by means whereof it becomes a pool, and is in the midst very deep, while about its brims are marshes or fens. For look, as the shore is to the sea, so are the fens to every great pool. In that place have the thieves of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, however many they be, their commonwealth. And as there is but little land above the water, some live in small cottages, others in boats, which they use as well for their house as for passage over the pool. In these do their women serve them and, if need require, be also brought to bed. When a child is born, they let him suck his mother's milk a while; but afterwards they feed him with fishes taken in the lake and roasted in the hot sun. And when they perceive that he begins to go, they tie a cord about his ankles and suffer him only to crawl the length of the boat or the cottage, teaching him even at the first after a new fashion to go by a halter. Many a herdsman is born and bred in the pool, which he accounts to be his country and a sufficient defence for the safety of the thieves. And for that cause all such people flock thither, for they all do use the water instead of a wall. Moreover the great plenty of weeds that groweth there in the moozy ground is as good as a bulwark unto them. For by devising many crooked and cumbrous ways, through which the passages to them by frequent use are very easy but to others hard, they have made it a sure defence, so that by no sudden invasion they may be endamaged. And thus much as touching the Lake, and those rogues that inhabit the same. </p>                        </div>

But when they considered the multitude of the spoils that they had won, and saw the beauty of the maid to be so heavenly a thing, they guessed that their companions had robbed some temple, and that they had brought away the priestess of the goddess, or rather the lively picture of the goddess herself. Thus in their simplicity did they conjecture from the maid. And therefore they congratulated their captain in hearty wise for his valiant exploit, and so escorted him to his own house, which was an island far from the rest, separated for his own use and for a few others who most commonly used to keep him company. Whither after he was brought, he commanded the others to depart, every man to his own house, charging them the next day all to wait upon him. He himself with a few others that tarried with him, after they had made a short supper, delivered the young folks to the custody of a Grecian whom he had taken a few days before, that he might be their interpreter, letting them have a corner of his own house not far from his lodging, with commandment as well diligently to see to the wounded young man as anxiously to look to the maid, that she by no means should be annoyed.

When therefore with herself secretly she had wailed alone (for she was by the captain's commandment separated from company and laid in a simple bed) and wept very bitterly — '<a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>', said she, 'how much more grievous punishment does thou take of us than we have deserved. Hast thou not been sufficiently revenged on us in the past? Forasmuch as we are far from our friends and kinsfolk, and that we were taken by <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> and subject to six hundred dangers more by sea, but that now again we must on the land fall into the hands of thieves and robbers: beside, who knoweth whether anything worse is like to light upon us? When wilt thou make an end? If it be in death that shall be void of injury, oh that death would like me well! But rather than any man should filthily know me, which <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> never did, surely with a halter I would end my life, reserving myself pure and chaste, as hitherto I have done, even unto death and thereby gain a beautiful epitaph for my singular virginity, and no judge shall be so cruel as thou.' While she spake thus <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> willed her to be content and said: 'Mine own dear heart and only joy, <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, cease your mourning. I know you have just cause to complain, but in your thus doing you displease God a great deal more than you think. Neither have we any need to provoke God to wrath, but rather to pray: for that which is mightier must with prayers and not with accusation be appeased.' 'You give me indeed good counsel,' quoth she, 'but I pray you, tell me how you fare.' 'Better,' said he, 'than I did yesternight, since this young man trimmed my wounds, whereby the burning heat of them is well cooled.' 'Yea,' quoth he who had the charge to look to them,' in the morning you shall see they shall be in better case, for I will provide such a herb for you that within three dressings your wound shall be healed. And this I have proved true by experience; for if any that were under this captain since I was taken prisoner in any conflict happened to be wounded, he never needed many days to be cured. You need not marvel that I am greatly moved with your estate, for you seem to be in as ill case as I; and I have the more compassion on you, since you are Grecians and I myself also am a Grecian born.' 'A Grecian, O immortal God,' cried they out suddenly for joy, 'a Grecian indeed both in tongue and country. Hereafter we trust to have some respite from our mishaps.' 'But what must we call you?' said <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>. '<a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>,' answered he.

He, after the decease of my mother, applied his mind to marry again, being loth to risk all his hopes of posterity on one only child. He doth therefore bring home a little woman somewhat fine, but passing malicious, named <a href=/people/1826 target=_blank>Demeneta</a>. As soon as she was married, she claimed my father all to her own lure and made him do what she list, enticing the old man with her beauty. In many other points too she was very curious, for if ever any woman knew how to make a man mad of her, she was better skilled in that art than any man would think. When my father went forth she would be sorrowful, and run to him when he came home and blame him much for his long tarrying, and not stick to tell him that she would have died if he had tarried never so little longer. At every word would she embrace him and moist her kisses with tears; with which means my father was so bewitched that he never was well but when he either had her in his arms or else was looking at her. Above all else, she would ever have me in her sight, as if I had been her own son; by this means also making <a href=/people/345 target=_blank>Aristippus</a> to love her the better. Sometimes she would kiss me, oftentimes she would wish that she might pastime herself with me, wherewith I was well content, mistrusting nothing less than what she intended, and marvelling that she bare such a motherly affection toward me. But when she came to me more wantonly and her kisses were more hot than beseemed an honest woman and her countenance passed modesty, then many things caused me to suspect her, so that I conveyed myself away and would not regard her fair words. I will let other things pass, which would be too long to tell, by what means she went about to win me, what proffers she made, how sometimes she would call me 'her pretty boy,' sometimes 'her sweet heart,' then 'her heir,' and then 'her own life,' and how to these fair names she would add many enticements with especial consideration to what I liked best: so that in grave affairs she would behave herself like my mother, but if she list to dally then would she manifestly declare her love. </p>                        </div>

I, for I was not then sixteen years old, had sung the usual hymn of her praise, and done other rites and ceremonies due to the same, and came home attired in my robes and my crown on my head. As soon as she saw me she was distraught of her wits and not able with policy to cover her love any longer, but for very desire ran to me and took me in her arms and said: 'O my young <a href=/people/560 target=_blank>Hippolytus</a> and my dear <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>.' In what case was I then, think you, who even now am ashamed to tell you the same. That night my father supped at the castle, and as often happened in such company and public resort he determined to lie there all night; that night she came to me and strived to have an unlawful thing at my hand. But I with all my power withstood her, and regarded neither her flattering words nor fair promises, no, nor her threatenings: wherefore, fetching a sigh from the bottom of her heart, for that time she departed; but within two nights after, like a mischievous quean, she sought all means possible to entrap me. First of all she kept her bed, and when my father came home and asked her how she fared, made no answer but said she was sick. When he became importunate and desired to know what she ailed — 'That goodly young man,' said she, 'son to us both, whom I — the gods know — loved even more than you, when he perceived by certain signs that I was great with child by you — which thing I concealed from you until I knew the certainty myself — and waiting for your absence, when I counselled him, as my manner was, and persuaded him to leave haunting of harlots and too much drinking — which things I knew well enough, but would never tell you of them, lest thereby I should incur the cruel suspicion of a stepmother with you — while, I say, I talked with him of these things, alone, no more but he and I, lest he should be ashamed — I will not tell the worst, for I am abashed so to do, nor in what manner he insulted both you and me — he lastly spurned me on the belly, and hath caused me to be in such case as you see.' </p>                        </div>

When his anger was cooled, I said to him: 'Father, now at length I pray you tell me why I have had thus many stripes.' At this the more incensed — 'O the dissembler,' he cried 'he wants to learn from me of his own misdeeds:' and with that he turned away and hastened back to <a href=/people/1826 target=_blank>Demeneta</a>. But she was not yet content, and devised this other trick against me. She had a maid called <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a> who could play well on the harp, and was otherwise fair, and a very proper wench. Her she made a stale for me and commanded her to love me, and by and by she did so indeed. Before this oftentimes, when I had attempted her, she had refused; but now she allured me with countenance, becks, and many other signs. In my foolishness I thought I had become beautiful of a sudden, and one night, when she came to my bed, thought no scorn to make her room. She liked her entertainment so well that she came again, and continually haunted my bed. At length when I gave her counsel to use circumspection in this matter, and take heed that her mistress found her not with me: '<a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>,' said she, 'you seem to be too simple: you count it a dangerous matter for me, a bond servant bought with money, to be taken abed with you; but what punishment, think you, does she deserve, who, professing herself a free woman and lawfully married to a husband and knowing that the penalty of her transgression is death, yet playeth the naughti-pack.' '<a href=/people/280 target=_blank>Peace</a>,' said I, 'I cannot believe that.' 'Nay,' said she, 'if you will, I will deliver the adulterer to you, even in the deed doing.' 'If you will do so,' quoth I, 'you shall do me a pleasure.' 'With all my heart,' said she, 'not only for your own sake who have been injured by her before, but for mine also who, since she hath me in jealousy, am used by her very extremely. Wherefore, if you be a man, apprehend him.' I promised her I would do so, and she for that time went her way. </p>                        </div>

We have done thee wrong indeed, yet not so great that therefore with death thou shouldest be revenged on me. Give not so much to thy wrath, neither by thy father's blood imbrue thy hands.'

As soon as he was born I brought him up gentlemanlike and set him to school, and when I had well placed him among our kinsfolk and written him in the number of other young men his equals, I made him one of our citizens according to the laws of this city. On him I have made all my doubtful hopes depend. But he has not only forgotten all these things but also diversely injured me, and beaten this woman who according to our law is my second wife.

I flee to you and tell you thereof. And although by the law I might with my own hand slay him, yet I would not: therefore remit I my whole cause to your discretion, thinking that I shall do better if I punish my son rather by public law than by private bloodshed.'

Not only did she lament but testified with tears, and as though her accusation had been true, with weeping she confirmed the same. When I craved license to speak for myself, the scribe came to me and propounded this straight question, whether I came to my father, or not, with a sword in my hand. 'I did,' quoth I, 'but I will tell you how.' Thereupon every man cried out and said that I ought not to speak for myself: some judged me worthy to be stoned to death, others to be hanged, others to be cast headlong down into the pit. All the while they were consulting of my punishment I was crying: 'O my cruel stepmother! Alas, for my stepmother's sake am I thus troubled. My stepmother killeth me without judgment:' and many marked my words very well and began to suspect the truth. But for all that, at the time I could not get a hearing: such was the tumult and noise of the people. When the votes were reckoned, those who condemned me to die were a thousand seven hundred, whereof the one half would have me stoned, the other cast into the pit: the rest, of whom there were about a thousand, crediting somewhat the suspicion they had conceived of my stepmother, gave sentence that I should be banished for ever. Yet these prevailed; for though they were fewer than the whole number of the others, yet since the others differed, on the reckoning a thousand was the greater number: and thus was I banished from my father's house and native country. But for all that the accursed woman <a href=/people/1826 target=_blank>Demeneta</a> did not go unpunished. How, you shall hereafter know; but now we must fall to sleep, for it is far into the night and you have need of rest in plenty! #8217; 'Nay,' said <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, 'you will vex us still more, if you leave the story with that mischievous creature unpunished.'

When I arrived there and had found those I sought for, at the first I lived pleasantly enough: about a twenty days after, roaming about as I was wont to do, I walked down to the haven, and behold, a barque was within kenning. I stayed there a little, and devised with myself whence that barque should come and what manner of people should be in her. The bridge was scarce down when one leaped out and ran and embraced me — his name was <a href=/people/4115 target=_blank>Charias</a> one of my companions — and said: '<a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, I bring thee merry tidings; now art thou well revenged upon thine enemy; <a href=/people/1826 target=_blank>Demeneta</a> is dead.' 'Welcome! <a href=/people/4115 target=_blank>Charias</a>,' said I; 'but why do you scant this joyful news, as though it were some disaster you were telling? Recount, I pray you, the manner of this revenge; for I fear much that she died as other folk do, and escaped the death she deserved.' '<a href=/people/194 target=_blank>Justice</a>,' quoth <a href=/people/4115 target=_blank>Charias</a>, 'hath not utterly forsaken us, as <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> imagined.

As for her, she was tormented by the <a href=/people/1744 target=_blank>Furies</a> and loved thee absent with a madder passion, neither at any time ceased she from sorrow, as though she lamented thy chance, but rather in truth her own mishap. Day and night she would cry — 'O <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, my pretty boy,' — calling thee her own life and soul in so much that when women of her acquaintance came to visit and comfort her, they wondered greatly that she, a stepmother, should bear such motherly affection toward thee. She would make them answer that it was a greater grief to her than any comfortable words could assuage, and that few of them knew what a cruel stab it was to her heart. Whenever she came to herself again, she would accuse <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a>, in that she had not served her well: 'Oh, how ready thou art to do mischief,' she would say, 'who hast not helped me now in my love, but rather caused me to lose, in the turning of a hand almost, my dearest joy, without giving me any time to change my mind:' and therewith she gave manifest tokens that she meant to do her some harm. </p>                        </div>

Wherefore she entered in to her and said: 'What ado is this, mistress? Why do you accuse thus your maid who for my part have always heretofore done, and even now also did as you commanded me. If anything happened not according to your mind, you must ascribe that to fortune, and if now also you will command me to devise some remedy for your present sorrow, you will easily perceive you shall not want my good will.' 'What remedy,' replied she, 'can be found, seeing that he would could give me comfort is by distance of place separated from me, while the unhoped for leniency of those that gave sentence on him hath brought me to destruction? If he had been stoned and quite done to death, then also in me had been quenched and dead the blazing flames of my burning desire. For that whose hope is past is taken from the heart, and that which is looked for no more causeth grieved minds to intermit all manner of sorrow. Now methinketh I see him and as though he were present hear him, how he casteth in my teeth the unjust guiles that I ensnared him with, as a thing shamefully done, so that I blush to speak to him. Sometimes methinketh he comes toward me, and I shall enjoy him: sometimes I determine to go toward him, in whatever coast of the world it be. These things set me on fire; these things make me mad. But, O ye gods, I have as I deserve. Why did I not rather with good will seek to win him than by craft to compel him? Why did I not humbly pray him rather than like an enemy persecute him? He would not take me at the first, and for good reason; I was another man's. He feared to defile his father's bed; but haply either by time or by fair words he might have been allured to be more gentle unto me. But I, savage and cruel that I am, as though I loved no man but had authority to compel him, because he obeyed me not at the first and despised <a href=/people/1826 target=_blank>Demeneta</a> whom in beauty he far excelled, have committed a heinous crime. But, O my sweet <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a>, what is this remedy that thou sayest is easy?' 'Mistress,' quoth the maid, 'many men think that <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> is gone out of the city and territory of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, as he was judged to do. But I know well enough, who have searched all things narrowly for your sake, that he keepeth himself secretly in a certain place near the city. You have heard doubtless of the flute-girl <a href=/people/509 target=_blank>Arsinoe</a>. With her he was acquainted before, and after his mishap the maid took him in, promised to go away with him, and keepeth him at her house until she can provide all things ready for her journey.' 'O happy <a href=/people/509 target=_blank>Arsinoe</a>,' said <a href=/people/1826 target=_blank>Demeneta</a>, 'both for the former acquaintance she had with <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> and for the banishment which she shall have with him! But how do these things touch us?' 'Greatly, mistress,' said she. 'I will say I love <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, and will desire <a href=/people/509 target=_blank>Arsinoe</a>, with whom by reason of her trade I have been long familiar, that she should in her stead suffer me to lie with him one night. Which if I shall obtain, it shall be yours, and he shall think you to be <a href=/people/509 target=_blank>Arsinoe</a>, and in her place shall you be with him. And I will provide also that when he goes to bed he shall have drunk a little; and if you get what you desire, then it may well be that your passion will be assuaged. For in many women the flame of love is quenched at the first experiment, and a full fruition brings with it satiety. And if your passion even then remain — which God forbid — then we will make, as the proverb says, a new voyage and seek a new way. In the meantime let us apply that which the present opportunity permitteth.' </p>                        </div>

She craved of her mistress but one day to bring it about, and went to <a href=/people/509 target=_blank>Arsinoe</a> and asked her if she knew not Teledemus. She answered, 'yes.' 'Let us have a chamber,' quoth the other, 'for I have promised him this night. He will come first and I will follow as soon as I have brought my mistress to bed.' This done, she went into the country to <a href=/people/345 target=_blank>Aristippus</a> and said to him thus: 'Master, I come to you to accuse myself, and am ready to take such punishment at your hand as your discretion shall think good. By me you have lost your son, not willing indeed so to do, yet of truth a helper in the same. For when I perceived that my mistress lived not well but was injurious to your bed, fearing not only that I myself should have some shrewd turn, if the matter came to light, for keeping her counsel, but especially sorrowful for your mishap, who for loving your wife so entirely should have such recompense, daring not myself to tell you of it I came one night, that no man should know thereof, and told my young master that there was one who used to play the harlot with my mistress. He thinking that there was a man with her in bed — for he was vexed before by her, as you know well enough — took his sword in his hand very angry, and not esteeming that I said that then there was no one but supposing rather that I had repented me of betraying her, ran like a madman to your bed's side: what followed you know. Today you have an opportunity, if you wish, to clear yourself as regards your son, though he be in banishment, and to take vengeance on her who has done you both wrong. I will show you this night <a href=/people/1826 target=_blank>Demeneta</a> lying with her paramour, and that too in another man's house outside the city.' 'If,' said <a href=/people/345 target=_blank>Aristippus</a>, 'thou wilt show me this, I will make thee free; and I myself may revive again, if I be revenged on mine enemy. I have been grieved about the same in my conscience a great while, yet for all that, though I suspected no less, because I could not convince it by manifest proofs, I held myself content. But what must I do?' 'You know,' quoth she, 'the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BGEp class=place long=23.717 lat=37.9847>garden</a> wherein remaineth the monument of the <a href=/people/10981 target=_blank>Epicureans</a>: come thither a little before night, and tarry for me.' When she had said this she returned, and coming again to <a href=/people/1826 target=_blank>Demeneta</a> — 'Make ready yourself,' said she; 'you must be fine; all that I have promised you is done.' She apparelled herself, and did as <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a> commanded her, and when the evening was come she carried her to the place as was appointed. When they came near the house, she told her to stay a while, and went in herself before, and desired <a href=/people/509 target=_blank>Arsinoe</a> to go aside into another house and let all things be quiet; for she said the young man was somewhat shamefast, being but of late inured to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>' sports. The other agreed, and returning she took <a href=/people/1826 target=_blank>Demeneta</a>, and brought her in, and laid her in bed, and took the light away — lest you, forsooth, should know her, who were then here in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig class=place long=23.425 lat=37.75>Aigina</a> — and told her to take her pleasure and say nothing; 'And I,' said she, 'will fetch the young man in to you, for he is making merry hereby.' Then she went forth and found <a href=/people/345 target=_blank>Aristippus</a> at the place appointed, and urged him now to catch the adulterer and bind him fast. He followed her, and when they were come to the house scarcely finding the bed by reason of the moon's faint light, he cried: 'I have thee now, O thou much hated of the gods.' While he spake thus, <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a> ran to the doors, and made them give as great a crash as she could, and cried out: 'O wonderful thing! The adulterer is fled. Master, take heed you be not deceived again.' 'Peace,' quoth he, 'and be of good cheer. I have this wicked and mischievous woman, which I most desired.' And thus, after he had taken her, he he brought her toward the city. But she, weighing with herself — as is likely — in what case she was; the beguiling of her expectation, the punishment decreed by the laws, and the shamefulness of her offence; moreover vexing herself because she was caught in such fashion, but especially taking it heavily that she was thus deluded and flouted; when she came to the pit which is in the compass of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s school — you know it I am sure — where the captains do celebrate the honour of our dead Heroes after the manner of our country, suddenly pulling herself out of the old man's hands leapt headlong into the same: and such an unhappy end had that mischievous woman. Then said <a href=/people/345 target=_blank>Aristippus</a>: 'Indeed thy punishment hath prevented the laws.' The next day he declared the whole matter to the people, and having scarcely obtained pardon for the deed, he went to divers of his friends and devised with them by what means he might obtain leave for you to come home again. Whether he has done anything or not I cannot tell; for, as you see, before anything could be finished I sailed hither about certain business of my own. Notwithstanding, you ought to be in good comfort that the people will consent easily to your return, and that your father shortly will come to seek you and fetch you home again; for that he declared openly that he would do.' Thus much <a href=/people/4115 target=_blank>Charias</a> told me. What followed, and how I came here, and what mischances I have met require both longer talk and time to tell.' </p>                        </div>

And for they very pleasure of tears they would not have ceased from weeping had not sleep flying down upon them assuaged their grief. So they fell to slumber. But <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>, — for thus was the master of the thieves called — after he had passed the grater part of the night quietly, was later troubled with certain dreams and therewith suddenly awakened lay wondering what the solution of them should be. For about the time that cocks crow — whether it be, as men say, that they naturally perceive the conversion of the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> as he approacheth near to us and so are moved to salute the god, or else from too much heat and a desire for movement and food they give such as dwell with them by their crowing a warning to rise to their work — a vision such as this, sent from God, appeared to him. As he entered into the temple of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a> in his own city, he thought that all was on fire, and that the altars filled with every kind of beast did swim with blood, and that all the place about was filled with the noise and tumult of men. When he came into the priviest place of the shrine, the goddess met him and gave <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> into his hands and said: '<a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>, I commit this maid to thee; yet, having her thou shalt not have her: thou shalt be unjust and kill the strange, but she shall not be killed.' After he had had this dream he was troubled in mind, casting this way and that way how that which was foreshowed to him might be interpreted. At length, being weary of beating his brains he drew the meaning thereof to his own will and construed it thus. 'Thou having shall not have her' — that is, a wife and not a maid any longer. By 'thou shalt kill' he conjectured 'thou shalt take her virginity'; whereof, for all that, <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> should not die. Thus did he interpret the dream, following therein his own lust and desire. </p>                        </div>

As they were being brought, 'Oh,' said they, 'what shall become of us.' And therewith they desired <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, if by any means he might, that he would help them. He promised so to do, and bade them be of good cheer, affirming that their captain was not altogether barbarously disposed but had in him some gentleness and courtesy, as one that was come of a noble stock but by necessity compelled to follow such a trade. After they were brought thither and the rest of the company assembled, <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>, being set in a higher place than the others in the island which he appointed the place of their meeting, commanded <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> — for he by this time understood the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> tongue perfectly but <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> was not very skilled in the Greek — to interpret what he said to the prisoners, and thus began: 'My mates, of what mind I have been ever toward you, you know very well. Although I was the son of the priest of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>, as you can bear me witness, I was frustrated of the priestly honour, since my younger brother by craft beguiled me of the same. I fled to you, the better to revenge my wrong and recover my ancient estate, and by all your voices made your captain have hitherto lived with you and not given any special honour to myself. If money was to be divided, I ever loved equality; if prisoners sold, I always brought the sum forth to you, accounting it the office of him who will rule well to do most himself but to take equal share with the others of that which is gotten. Such captives as were strong I enrolled among your company; the feeble sort I sold to make money of. I never did wrong to women; such as were of good parentage I suffered to depart, either redeemed with money or else for sheer pity of their ill hap; such as were of inferior condition, whom not only the law of arms made prisoners but also their continual use had taught to serve, I distributed among you severally to do you service. Today, of all the spoils I crave one thing only of you, this stranger maid, whom although I might give unto myself, yet I thought I should do better to take her with all your consents. For it would be foolish for me to force our prisoner and seem to be acting contrary to my comrades' pleasure. Wherefore I crave this good turn at your hands, not for naught, but rewarding you again in such sorts that of all the other booty I will have no part at all. For seeing that the prophetical sort of men despiseth the common sort of woman, I have decreed to make her my companion, not for pleasure so much as to have issue by her; and therefore I am content to rehearse to you the causes that move me thus to do. First, she seemeth to be of good parentage; which a man may easily guess both by the riches found about her, and for that she is nothing broken with these adversities, but even now is of a haughty stomach against fortune. Secondly, I infer she is of an excellent nature and good disposition; for if she doth surpass all others in beauty and by the modesty of her look doth move all those who gaze upon her to a certain kind of gravity, shall she not deservedly leave behind her a due estimation of herself? Lastly, and this is of more account than all I have said, she seemeth to be priestess to some god. For even in her adversity she accounteth it an intolerable and heinous offence to leave off her sacred stole and laurel garland. Can there be therefore, O you that be present, any marriage more meet than that a man being a prophet should marry one consecrated to some god?' </p>                        </div>

Which thing when he heard he said to them again: 'I thank you all: but in my opinion it will not be amiss if about this matter we enquire the maid's mind. For if I listed to use my own authority my will were sufficient, because it is a needless thing to ask their good will whom a man may constrain. But in this case, seeing we deal with a lawful marriage it is convenient to be done with both consents.' Then, turning his talk to them, he asked the maid how she liked that which was propounded as touching her marriage, and therewithal bade them to declare what they were and where they were born. But she for a long time cast her eyes to the ground, moving her head to and fro as though she were thinking what she should say. At last she looked up at <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> and with the brightness of her beauty abashed him more than ever she did before — for by the inward cogitation of her mind her cheeks became more red than accustomably they were and her eyes were very earnestly bent upon him — and by <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> her interpreter spake thus: 'It were more meet that my brother <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> here should have told this tale, for my opinion is that a woman ought to keep silence and a man amongst men should make answer. But seeing that you have given me leave to speak, and thereby an especial token of your courtesy, that you mean rather by persuasion to attempt that which is just than by force to compel; and the rather because that which hath been spoken most touches me, I am constrained to pass those bonds which I prescribed to myself and are proper for maidens, and to answer now the victor's question in so great an assembly of men. We were born in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a> and come of a noble house of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>. When we came to the age of fourteen years, by the law — which calleth such as us to the office of priesthood — I was maid priest to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, and this my brother of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>. But, as this honour lasts but for a year and our time was expired, we prepared to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a> with our sacred attire, and there to make certain games of music and gymnastic, and give over our priesthood according to the manner of our ancestors. For this cause was our ship laden with gold, silver, goodly apparel and other necessaries, as much as were necessary for the expenses of the same and to make the people a public feast; and thus we loosed out of the haven. Our parents, since they were old and feared the dangerousness of the voyage, tarried at home; but many of the other citizens, some in our ship, others in boats of their own, came to accompany us. After we had ended the greatest part of our voyage a tempest suddenly arose and a vehement wind with fearful blasts moving great waves of the sea. This caused us to leave our determined journey, for our steersman overcome by the greatness of the danger in the violence of the storm gave up the tiller and let fortune control our course. We were driven by the wind for seven days and seven nights, and at last we were cast upon the shore whereon you found us and saw the great slaughter. In that place the mariners, as we were banqueting for joy of our unlooked for delivery, attacked us and for our riches sought to destroy us. But they were all slain, not without the destruction of our friends and acquaintance — which would God had not happened — and we only poor miserable creatures were left as victors. But seeing it is thus, we have good cause in one respect to count ourselves happy, because some god has brought us into your hands, where those who feared death have now space to think on marriage. Which surely I shall not refuse. For that the captive should be judged worthy of the victor's bed doth not only pass all other felicity, but that a priest's son shall marry a woman consecrated to the gods seemeth not to be done without the singular foresight and providence of God. I therefore crave but one thing only at thy hand, <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>. Suffer me first, as soon as I shall come to any city or any place where is an altar or temple sacred to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, to surrender my priesthood and the tokens thereof. This might be done very commodiously at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>, when you have recovered the honour of your priesthood; for by that means it should come to pass that marriage joined with victory after good luck celebrated shall be much more merry. But whether this must be done before or after I leave to your discretion; only I beg that I may fulfil the rites of my country before. I know that you will hereunto agree, who have been brought up, as you said, from your childhood to holy offices and think also very well and reverently of the gods.' </p>                        </div>

This done, having first divided the booty and taken some of the best jewels, which of their own accord they gave him, he suffered every man to depart, with further commandment to be ready the tenth day after to go toward <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>. He let the Greeks have the tent that they had before; and with them was <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, not as a keeper now but as a companion; and <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> furnished them with as good victual as there might be gotten. Whereof <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> for his sister's sake had part. <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> determined not to look upon <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> very often, that her beauty might not move his hot desire to do something contrary to that which by common counsel was decreed, as was before rehearsed. For these causes he would not look upon the maid, thinking it an impossible thing that a man should both look upon a fair maid and keep himself within the bounds of temperance. But <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, after every man was quickly dispatched and were crept into the corners which they had in the marsh, went to seek the herb which the day before he promised <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>. </p>                        </div>

And when she asked him whether after his accustomed manner he deplored their common mishap, or had any new grief befallen him — 'What,' quoth he, 'can be more new or contrary to equity than to break an oath and final agreement? <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> hath forgotten me and is content to marry another man.' 'God forbid,' said the maid; 'I pray you be not more grievous to me than the miseries I have already, neither misdeem anything from my speech, applied to the time and perhaps to some purpose, seeing that before this by many proofs you have tried how I am affected toward you. Except perchance the contrary may happen, and that you sooner change your mind than I will depart from any the least jot of my promise. For I am content and take in good part all these calamities; but that I shall not live chastely there is no torment that may constrain me. In one thing only I know I have not ruled myself, that is in the love I have borne to you from the beginning. But my affection for you is both lawful and honest. I have not yielded to you as a lover, but from the first concluding marriage with you as a husband have committed myself to your care, and have lived chastely without copulation hitherto, not without refusing you often times proffering me such things, and have waited for occasion to be married, if anywhere it might lawfully be done, which thing at the first was decreed between us and by oath established. Besides, consider how foolish you are if you suppose that I esteem a barbarous fellow more than a Greek, a thief more than him whom with my heart I love.' 'What did those things then mean,' said <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, 'which in that goodly company were of you openly rehearsed? For in that you feigned me to be your brother, it was a very wise device, which caused <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> to be very far from jealousy of our love and made us to be together safely. I perceived also to what end that tended which you said of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a> and of wandering about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a>. For they were shadows that might easily cover the truth and deceive indeed the auditors. But so readily to approve the marriage, and openly to conclude the same, and to appoint the time therefore; what that should signify neither could I guess, nor would I. But I wished that the earth might have cloven and swallowed me up rather than that I should have seen such an end of the travail and hope that for your sake I undertook.' Herewithal <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> embraced <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, and kissed him a thousand times, and bemoistening his face with her tears — 'Oh in how good part,' said she, 'do I take these fears that for my sake you sustain, For hereby you declare that you quail not in your love toward me, although many miseries depend thereupon. But know for a truth, <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, that we should not be now talking together if I had not made him such a promise. For drawing back and opposition do much kindle the force of vehement desire; whereas yielding talk that coincided with a man's wishes quiets his burning love and with a pleasant promise puts to sleep his too keen appetite. For rude lovers think that such a promise is the first round in the battle and think therewith that they are victors, and after that are of quieter minds ever hovering in hope. All which things I foreseeing in word committed myself to him, commending what shall follow to the gods and to the angel, who at first obtained the tuition of our love. Often the space of a day or two has been very healthful, and fortune brings things to a happy pass such as no device of man could ensure: wherefore, weighing the sure against the uncertain, I have preferred this invention of mine before all others. We must then, sweet love, use this policy wisely, and keep it secret not only from all others but also from <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> too. For although he seem to favour our estate and is a Grecian, yet being at this time a prisoner he will perhaps, if occasion serve, be ready to do the captain a good turn. For neither this time of friendship nor his countrymanship is a sufficient pledge to us of his fidelity and truth. Wherefore if at any time by suspicion he gather anything touching our estate we must deny it. For that manner of a lie is tolerable, which profiteth the inventor and hurteth not the hearer.' </p>                        </div>

'<a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>,' quoth he, 'I bring you this herb, wherewith I pray you dress your own wounds. But I fear me you must prepare yourself to receive other as great wounds as these and shedding of blood.' <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> asked of him what the matter was and desired him to tell it more plainly. 'The time,' answered he, 'will not suffer me; for it is to be feared lest we should feel the stripes before I could tell you the circumstances.

It was made after this sort. It had a dark narrow entrance and was shut with privy doors, so that even the threshold was in stead of a gate, when need required, and would open and shut very easily. The inner part was countermined variously with divers slanting ways, the which would sometimes run along by themselves artfully for a while and sometimes would be entangled like the roots of trees; but in the end they all led to one level place which received a dim light from an opening made at the edge of the pool. <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, who was well experienced in the place, took <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> down and led her to the end of the den, comforting her in many ways, but especially in that he promised her that he with <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> would come to her that night, and that he would not suffer him to strike one stroke in the battle, but would privily convey him out of the same. Then he left her, who spake not one word, but was as stricken by that misfortune as though it had been by death, in that she was deprived of <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> whom she loved as her own soul.

This done, he ran back to <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>, whom he found very desirous to fight, and with him <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> well armed, making those that were with him almost mad by his earnest oration. For as he stood in the midst of them, he said thus: 'My mates, I see not to what end it should tend to use many words in exhorting you, who need no encouragement at all but have ever accounted war the pleasantest life, especially since the sudden approaching of our enemies will not permit us to use many words. For seeing that our enemies do now violently assault us, if we should not with like courage repulse their violence, we should seem void of counsel and at our wits' end. We know that we are fighting not for our wives and children — these words make men pluck up their hearts for battle, although indeed they are not of great value and we shall have all that the conquerors gain, if we get the victory — but rather for our own lives and safety. A war with thieves never ends with a composition nor is concluded by a truce: those who win survive, those who are beaten are slain. So let us now with all our hearts and hands hasten to meet our cruel enemies.' </p>                        </div>

For by this time the battle was begun, and a man even from afar might see that those who dwelt in the outer coasts of the fen were already in the enemies' hands. They who came upon them burned up the boats and cottages of such as either were slain or else fled out of the battle, whose eyes also were dazzled by the great and intolerable brightness of the fire that burned up the reeds, whereof there was great plenty, and their eyes filled with the great noise and tumult. A man might both see and hear the whole manner of the skirmish, whose who dwelt there maintaining the battle with all their power and strength, and their enemies, being more in number and taking them at a sudden, killing some of them on the earth while others they drowned in the pool with boats and houses too. From all these, from those who fought by land and lake, did kill and were killed, as also from those who were beset by fire and water, there arose a marvellous sound in the air. Which when <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> saw, he remembered his dream, wherein he saw <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> and her temple filled with fire and dead men, and supposing thereby to be meant that which he had now seen, he gathered thereof a contrary interpretation to that which he had made before, that — 'having thou shalt not have <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>' — she should be taken away by war, and that 'he should kill and not wound her,' that is with his sword and not with carnal copulation. So, upbraiding the goddess as though she had beguiled him, and thinking it not meet that any other should enjoy <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, he commanded his men to keep their places and maintain the battle as long as they might, by fighting stealthily round the island and making sallies from the marshes about, and thus to hold out against the greater numbers of the enemy. But he himself, pretending to seek <a href=/people/2123 target=_blank>Thermuthis</a> and do certain sacrifices to his privy gods, suffering no man to go with him, in haste went to the cave, like a madman. Surely a barbarous nature cannot be easily withdrawn or turned from that which it hath once determined. And if barbarous folk be in despair of their own safety they have a custom to kill all those by whom they set much, and whose company they desire after death, or else would keep them from the violence and wrong of their enemies. For that same cause <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>, forgetting all he had to do, being enclosed by the enemy army as if he had been caught in a net, almost enraged with love jealousy and anger, after he came in haste to the cave, going into the same and crying with a loud voice and speaking many things in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> tongue, as soon as he heard one speak Greek to him about the entry of the cave and was conducted to her by her voice, laid his left hand upon her head and with his sword thrust her through the body, a little beneath the paps. </p>                        </div>

But he, after he had come out and had shut the door and had cast a little gravel thereon with tears, said: 'These espousals hast thou at my hand.' Then, coming to his boats, he found a great many ready to run their way, as they saw the enemy now were near, and <a href=/people/2123 target=_blank>Thermuthis</a> also coming to do sacrifice. Him he chided sharply, for that he himself had offered the most acceptable victim already, and went with him into a boat with another to row them; for the boats that they use in the pool will carry no more than three, being but rudely hewed out of the rough wood. <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> also, and <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> took another boat, and so did all the rest. After they had gone a little way from the island, rather rowing about the banks than venturing into the deep, they stayed their oars and set their boats in line, as though they would have received their enemies face to face. But when the others approached they could not even abide the splashing of the water, and as soon as they saw them took to flight, not enduring the first clamour and noise of battle. <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> also and <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, but not for fear, by little and little withdrew themselves. Only <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> accounted it a shame to flee, or perhaps had no mind to live after <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, and thrust himself into the thickest press of his enemies. As soon as they were come to blows, one cried out: 'This is <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>; let every man do his part to take him alive.' And therewithal they compassed him about and held him inclosed, as in a ring, in the midst of them. He fought against them stoutly, and to see how he wounded some and killed other some, it was a worthy sight. For of so great a number there was none that either drew his sword against him, or else cast any dart; but every man laboured to take him alive. He fought against them a great while, but at length he lost his spear, by reason that many fell on him at once. He lost also his harness-bearer, who had done him very good service; for he being deadly wounded, as it seemed, despairing of his safety leapt into the pool and with much ado did swim to land, inasmuch as no man thought to pursue him. </p>                        </div>

Such is the nature of thieves: they esteem money more than their own lives, and only regard the name of friendship and affinity so far as lucre and gain shall extend. And this truth might easily be gathered from these men; for they were those same who at the mouth of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> called Heracleot fled for fear of <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> and his companions. Indignant at the loss of other men's goods as if they had been their own, they had got together their household friends and also those that dwelt near about them, and promising them an equal part of the booty had made themselves conductors and captains of the host. Now why they took <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> prisoner, this was the cause. He had a brother called <a href=/people/2340 target=_blank>Petosiris</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>, who, contrary to the manner and ordinance of the country — for he was a younger brother — had by craft beguiled him of his priesthood. And hearing now that his brother was become a captain of robbers, and fearing lest if he got occasion he would return, or lest time itself should detect his subtle dealing; and besides this considering the voice of many people who supposed that he had slain him, because he could no where be seen, he sent to the thieves' villages, and promised a great sum of money and <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> to those who would take and bring him alive. Wherewith the thieves being allured forgot not their gain even in the midst of war, and after one had recognised him took him alive, at the price of many deaths, and carried him to land and placed one half of them as a guard about him, casting in their teeth the clemency they had used towards him and misliking their bonds worse than death itself. The rest went to search the island, in hope to find other treasures that they sought for. But though they went over the same and left nothing unsearched that was there, they found nothing of that they hoped for, except a few things of little value left about the mouth of the cave when the rest had been hidden under the ground. So as it drew toward night, and they might tarry no longer in the island, for fear lest they should fall into an ambush at the hands of those that had escaped from the battle, they set fire to the tents and returned to their own company. </p>                        </div>

For vehement wind blowing the fire upon the cottages, which were made only of the slender reeds that grew on the marsh banks, burned them up everywhere and made them almost equal with the ground.

After a while <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> came somewhat to himself again and looked more advisedly on the woman lying there.

He, smiling a little, and willing to turn their minds to some mirth, said to them: 'In my opinion, or any man's else who hath before wrestled with love and hath pleasantly yielded in moderation to the necessary chance thereof, such falls as these are both inevitable and praiseworthy. But I could not commend you, <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, nay I was quite ashamed, when I saw you mournfully embrace a strange woman, one to whom you were bound by no bond of friendship, though I plainly affirmed your dearest friend was alive and safe.'

Then <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, after waiting a little, scratching her cheek under her ear, 'I judge her happy,' said she, 'whoever she was, whom <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> lamented and kissed also, as <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> reporteth; but if you would not think I was jealous, I would gladly know, if you can tell me, what happy woman that was who was worthy of <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>' tears, and by what error you kissed her instead of me.' 'Surely,' said he, 'you will wonder at it greatly; for <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> saith it was <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a>, that cunning player of the harp, the devisor of the wiles against him and <a href=/people/1826 target=_blank>Demeneta</a>.' Hereat <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> afraid asked <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>: 'How is it likely that she should come out of the midst of Greece as of set purpose into the farthest part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>?

He sayeth he is the captain's harness-bearer, and will not give me leave so much as to look abroad, and thus he punisheth me as he saith, for the love he hath toward me; but as far as I can gather, it is from fear lest some man else should take me from him. Yet for all that, by the benefit of some god I saw you, my master, passing by yesterday, and knew you, and have therefore sent this letter to you by an old woman my bedfellow, charging her to deliver it to a beautiful young man being a Grecian and the captain's friend. Redeem me, I pray you, out of the hands of the thief and entertain your handmaid. Preserve me, if you will it so; knowing this first, that whenever I offended against you I was constrained to do it, but in that I revenged you of your enemy I did it of my own free will.

But <a href=/people/2123 target=_blank>Thermuthis</a>, the harness-bearer of <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>, after being wounded had escaped the battle and swam to land; and when night came he got a loose boat and hastened to the island and to <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a> whom he had taken a few days before from the merchant <a href=/people/802 target=_blank>Nausicles</a>, setting an ambush for him in a narrow way by the side of the hill. After the broil began and the enemies approached, when <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> sent him to fetch the sacrifice to the gods, desiring to place her out of danger of weapons and to keep her for himself in safety, he put her privily into the cave, and for haste left her but in the entry thereof. In which place, as she sat at the first was left, she stayed, partly for fear of the present perils, partly since she knew not the ways that went into the bottom of the cave; and there <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> finding her instead of <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> slew her. To her then <a href=/people/2123 target=_blank>Thermuthis</a> made haste, after he had escaped from the battle, and as soon as he was landed in the island he ran to the tents, where beside ashes he found nothing. But finding at length the mouth of the cave by the stone, the reeds, if any were left, being still on fire, he ran down in great haste and called <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a> by name, so far at least using the Greek tongue. Whom after he found dead, he stood a good while without moving in a great study; and at length hearing out of the inner parts of the cave a certain noise — for <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> and <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> were yet in talk — he straightway deemed that they had slain her, and was thereat much troubled in his mind, and could not well tell what to do. For the barbarous anger and the fierceness which is natural in thieves, kindled the more since he was now beguiled of his love, moved him to set upon those he deemed the authors of that murder. But since he had neither armour nor weapon, he was constrained, whether he would or no, to be quiet. He determined therefore not to come upon them as an enemy at the first, but if he could get any armour, then to set on them after. When he had thus decided he came to <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> and looked about him with eyes frowning and terribly bent, so that with his countenance he plainly betrayed the inward cogitation of his mind. They seeing a man come in upon them suddenly, sore wounded, naked, and with a bloody face, behaved not themselves all alike, but <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> ran into a corner of the cave, fearing perhaps to look upon a man so unsightly and naked. <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> seeing <a href=/people/2123 target=_blank>Thermuthis</a>, contrary to his expectation, and knowing him well, mistrusting that he would enterprise somewhat, held his peace and stepped back. But that sight did not so much frighten <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> as move him to wrath, who drew his sword and made as he would strike him if he stirred, and bade him stand — 'Or else,' quoth he — 'thou shalt know the price of thy coming; which for the moment thou hast escaped, inasmuch as I recognise thee somewhat, although I know not the reason why thou comest.' <a href=/people/2123 target=_blank>Thermuthis</a> came near and spoke him fair, having respect rather to the present time than to his own habit, and desired <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> to be his friend, and said that he deserved his help because he had never done him wrong, and had been his companion the day before, and that he came to them as to friends. </p>                        </div>

He told him everything: how he fought with his enemies, how he went into the thickest press of them, neither caring for his own life nor theirs, how he slew every man that came within his reach, and himself was guarded and compassed about, and straight charge given that every man should forbear <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>. 'But what became of him at length,' quoth he, 'I cannot tell: I was grievously wounded and swam to land, and at this time am come unto the cave to seek <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a>.' Thereupon they asked him what he had to do with <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a>, or how he came by her. <a href=/people/2123 target=_blank>Thermuthis</a> then told them how he took her from certain merchants, and how he loved her wonderfully, and kept her privily in his own tent, and before the coming of the enemies put her into this cave, and that he now found her slain by some he knew not, but he would be glad to understand why and for what occasion it was done. <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> herewith, desirous to deliver himself quickly from all suspicion, said: '<a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> killed her.' And therewith for proof he showed him the sword which they had found by her when she was slain. Which as soon as <a href=/people/2123 target=_blank>Thermuthis</a> saw, bloody and almost warm with the late slaughter, and knew that it was <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>' sword indeed, fetching a great sigh from the bottom of his heart and at a loss to know how matters stood, he went out of the den overwhelmed with darkness and silent, and coming to the dead body — 'O <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a>,' — he said oft, but nothing else, repeating each syllable of the name.

But their manifold miseries past, and the greatness of their present calamity, and the uncertainty of that which was to come did hinder and darken the reasonable part of their mind, so that they gazed one upon the other and every one waited for what his fellow would say as touching their present state. After this, their hope failing them, they would cast their eyes to the ground and with sorrowful sighs lift them up again, relieving their grief with lamentation. At length <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> laid himself on the ground, <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> sat down on a stone, and <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> leaned on him. For a while they strove to overcome sleep, desiring to consider somewhat of their present affairs, but being by sorrow and labour much distressed they were constrained, although against their will, to obey the law of nature, and out of their great heaviness they fell into a pleasant sleep. Thus did the reasonable part of their mind endure to agree with the affection of the body. But after they had slumbered but a short while, so that their eyes were scarcely close shut, <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, who lay there with them, had this marvellous dream. A man with long rough hair, blood-shot eyes, and red dripping hands thrust his sword into the socket and tore away her right eye. Therewith she suddenly cried out, saying that she had lost one of her eyes, and called for <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>; who straight was at hand, and did bewail her harms, as if in his sleep he had felt the same. But she put her hand to her face, and felt everywhere for the eye which was lost, and as soon as she knew it was a dream: 'It is a dream,' said she, '<a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>: I have mine eye: come hither and fear not.' <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> herewith was well pleased and — 'As is meet,' quoth he, 'you have your eyes as bright as sunbeams. But what ailed you and why were you so afraid?' 'An ill-favoured froward fellow,' quoth she, 'nothing fearing your invincible strength, came to me as I leaned on your knees, with a sword in his hand, in such sort that verily I thought he had plucked out my right eye. And I would to God that it had been so indeed, rather than appeared to me in my sleep.' 'God forbid,' said he, 'but why do you speak thus?' 'I wish it,' said she, 'because it were better for me to lose both eyes than to be sorrowful for the loss of you. Surely I am sore afraid lest you be meant by this dream, whom I esteem as mine eye, my life, and all my riches.' 'Not so,' said <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> — for he had heard all, being awakened by the first cry of <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> — 'it seems to me that your dream should mean another thing. Tell me, are your parents alive?' 'Yes,' said she, 'if ever they were.' 'Then you must judge,' said he, 'that your father is dead; and that I gather from this, forasmuch as we know that our parents be the cause and authors of our life and that by them we see the light of day. Therefore with good reason do dreams liken our father and mother to a pair of eyes, since they give us the sensation of sight and help us to behold all things seen.' 'That is a hard saying,' replied <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, 'but God grant that it be true rather than mine, and that your interpretation prevail and I be called the false prophet.' 'These things shall thus no doubt come to pass,' said <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, 'and that you may believe.

You are skilled in these countries, and understand their tongue well; and besides we are not so fit to comprehend what is necessary, for we are drowned in a deeper sea of troubles.' <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> therefore after musing a little spake thus: 'Which of us is in greater misery I cannot tell, for I am sure that God hath laid calamities enough upon my back also. But since you bid me, as the elder, to give my advice as toughing the present case, this is my mind. This island, as you see, is deserted, and hath no man in it but us. Moreover of silver and gold and precious apparel here is great store. Of such things <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> and his companions have taken much, as well from you as also from others, and have laid it here. But as for corn, and other things whereby our life may be maintained, there is not one whit. We are in danger then, if we tarry here long, either to perish for lack of food, or because of the return of our enemies, or even of those who have been of this fellowship, if they come to fetch this money whereof they all know. In that case we could not escape without death; or even if they dealt more friendly with us we should be subject to their reproachful dealing and scornful behaviours. For while these herdsmen are always faithless, now they are so especially, since they lack a captain and ruler that might constrain them to be moderate. This island is to us but a snare and a prison, which we must now leave and forsake, first dispatching <a href=/people/2123 target=_blank>Thermuthis</a> away under pretence to inquire and seek to know some certainty of <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>.

And it is a point of wisdom to put out of our company a man by nature inconstant, enduded with rude and uncourteous manners, who distrusteth us also somewhat because of <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a>'s death, and will not rest till he have, if occasion serve, by fraud beguiled us.' </p>                        </div>

And when they had declared to him so much of their counsel as seemed good and had easily persuaded him, being a fickle fellow, and had cast <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a> into a little pit, and as much dust upon her as was left from the tents, and done to her as religiously as the time would suffer, and with tears and with weepings, instead of all other ceremonies buried her, they sent <a href=/people/2123 target=_blank>Thermuthis</a> about the pretended business, as they had arranged.

But <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, after he had forsaken <a href=/people/2123 target=_blank>Thermuthis</a>, left not running till dark night restrained his violent course, so that in the place where night overtook him he hid himself and laid as many leaves as he could upon him. Under which he lying was much troubled and slept but little, supposing every noise, and blast of wind, and wagging of each leaf to be <a href=/people/2123 target=_blank>Thermuthis</a>. If at any time sleep came over him, he thought that he still fled, and looked back for him that pursued him not. And when he had lust for sleep he would refrain, for the dreams that came to him were worse than the reality. Last of all, he seemed to be angry with the night and thought it was longer than any other was. And when, to his delight, he say the day dawn, first he cut off so much of his hair as he had let grow that he might be like the thieves, in order that those who met him now might not trouble nor suspect him. For the thieves, besides other things that they do, whereby they may seem more fearful, let their hair grow long over their eyes and shake it hanging on their shoulders; knowing well that long hair maketh lovers more acceptable but thieves more terrible. </p>                        </div>

As touching my trade of life, I am now a vagabond, who was not long ago a priest. I had a wife by the ordinance of the city, but lost her by the law of nature. After she had passed out of this body into another rest, I lived a while free from trouble, delighting myself with the two sons that I had by her. But after a few years the course of heaven prescribed by destiny altered all my estate and <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a> cast his eye upon my house, changing everything for the worse, a change which my own wisdom warned me of but showed me no means to escape. For a man can foresee the unchanging decrees of fate although he cannot avoid the same. Yet even in such matters foresight is gain, in so much as it blunts the keen edge of calamity. For those miseries, my son, that come on thee suddenly are intolerable, but such as are foreseen are borne with a tranquil mind; since the mind being occupied with fear is distressed by those and taketh them heavily, while familiarity with reason maketh these more endurable. Such a thing as this then it was that happened to me. A woman of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, of ripe years, and, except <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, the fairest woman in the world, whose name was <a href=/people/1758 target=_blank>Rhodopis</a>, I know not whence or how to her lovers' ill fortune leaving her own country, travelled over all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and came in very wanton wise to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>. She had a great sort of maids and servants waiting on her and was perfectly instructed in all the enticements of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> and wanton behaviour, so that it was possible for none that looked on her not to be entangled with her love: of such an unavoidable force was the whorish allurement that proceeded from her eyes. She entered into the temple of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> often, whose priest I was, and worshipped the goddess daily and offered divers sacrifices and gifts which cost many talents. At last — I am ashamed to tell it, yet I will — with often beholding of her she overcame me and that temperance also which in all my life with great study I had conserved. A great while I withstood the eyes of my body with the inward eyes of my mind, but overcome at length with this affection of love, as those who are heavy laden, I was constrained to yield. When therefore I understood that this woman was the beginning of all the ill luck which the gods had appointed for me, of which I was not ignorant before, and perceived that she was but a cloak for destiny, and that the god, whose turn it was then to rule, had taken upon himself her shape, I determined not to dishonest the priesthood, in which from my youth I had been brought up, nor yet to defile the temples and secret places of the gods. Therefore, not for doing the deed — which God forbid — but to punish my desire with convenient punishment I called my reason in to judgment, and passing upon myself sentence of banishment, unhappy man, I left my country, as well to yield to the necessity of the ladies of destiny and give them leave to determine of me what they would as also to escape from the accursed <a href=/people/1758 target=_blank>Rhodopis</a>. For I was afraid that if the evil star then in the ascendant pressed too hard upon me I should be forced to do some viler thing. But the chief cause above all others that banished me were my sons; for the secret wisdom, that I had of the gods, foreshowed to me that they would fight a bloody battle between themselves. That I might therefore remove such a cruel spectacle from my eyes — which I think the sun himself would not behold — and to acquit these fatherly eyes of the sight of my sons' death, I went my way to prevent these things, pretending as though I would go to great <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>, to see my elder son, who was then with his grandfather, his name being <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>.' <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> started when he heard the name of <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>; but he kept his counsel, as well as he could, the better to hear the rest: and the old man went on as followeth. 'I omit that which happened to me on the way, young sir, for it nothing appertaineth to that you ask for. But when I heard there was a certain city of Greece sacred to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, which was a temple of the gods and a college of wise men and far from the troublous resort of the common people, I went thither, thinking that a city which was dedicated to holiness and ceremonies was a meet place for a man being a prophet to resort unto. So when I had sailed through the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384225UKri class=place long=22.469 lat=38.4712>Crisaean Gulf</a> and was arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384225PKir class=place long=22.4455 lat=38.4296>Cirrha</a> I went in haste out of my ship to the town: whither after I was come I heard a divine voice in very truth address me; and for other reasons also it seemed a meet place for me to abide in, not the least whereof was the natural situation of the same. For <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385226LPar class=place long=22.6219 lat=38.5354>Parnassus</a> reacheth over it, like a natural defence or tower, inclosing the city as it were with a wall with his two tops.'

'What is your name?' '<a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>,' answered he; 'but you shall hear all my story later; now go on with your tale.' 'I will,' answered the other.

A great company of those that stood by me praised the god much for giving me such an answer at my first coming; they talked of my good fortune and paid me all manner of regard, saying that I was the welcomest man to the god that ever came there, save only one <a href=/people/78 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=person long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>. Wherefore, when I desired to dwell in the temple precinct, they gave me leave, and decreed that I should be nourished at their common charges. To be short, I wanted no good thing. Either I enquired into the causes and manner of the sacrifices, which were very many, offered both by the men who inhabit there and by strangers also; or else I conferred with philosophers, of whom no small number come hither, so that the city is in a manner a study dedicated to prophecy, under the god who is captain of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. And at first there were divers questions touching many matters moved among us. For some would ask after what fashion we <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> honoured our gods, and another, why divers countries worshipped divers kinds of beasts, and what was the reason in each case. Others enquired of the structures of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300311GPyr class=place long=31.1342 lat=29.9792>pyramids</a> and of those winding vaults in which our kings are buried. In a word they left nothing that appertaineth to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> unsearched. For Grecian ears are wonderfully delighted with tales of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. At last certain of the civilest sort fell in talk concerning the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, and asked me whence his sources came, and what special property he had above other rivers, and why he alone of all others in summer did rise. I told them what I knew, and was written in the holy books, and was lawful only for priests to read and know: how that this source was in the highest parts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> and furthest bounds of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, at the end of the east clime and beginning of the south. It floweth in the summer not, as some think, by reason of contrary blasts of the north-west winds, but because these same winds, blowing out of the north, gather together and drive all the clouds of the air about mid-summer into the south, till they come to the burning line. There their violence is abated, by reason of the incredible heat thereabouts, so that all the moisture, which was before gathered together and congealed, melteth and is resolved into abundance of water: wherewith the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> waxeth proud and will be a river no longer, but runneth over his banks and covereth <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> with his waters, as with a sea, and maketh the ground very fruitful. Wherefore too it giveth sweet waters to drink, since they come from heaven, and is pleasant to be touched, not now so hot as at the first but yet luke-warm, as one that riseth in such a place. For which cause from that flood, and none other, arise no vapours; for if there did, then were it likely that it received its increase from melted snow; of which opinion some learned men of the Greeks have been. </p>                        </div>

'Have you been there then, <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>?' said I. 'I have,' quoth he, 'wise <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>.' 'What business sent you thither?' I asked him then. 'The ill-luck that I had at home,' said he, 'which for all that turned to my great felicity.' I wondered at that, how it could be. 'You will not marvel,' quoth he, 'if you hear the whole process of the matter, which you shall do when you please.' 'Then,' quoth I, 'tell me now, for I am well pleased you should do so.' <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> then, when he had let the people depart, said: 'Know that for a certain cause I have desired a great while that you might be made privy to my estate. A long time after I was married I had no children. Yet at length, when I was old and had made earnest prayers to God, I had a daughter; the which God foreshadowed me should be born in an ill time. She became marriageable, and I provided her a husband of one of her suitors — for she had many — who, in my judgment, was the honestest man. The first night that she, unhappy wench, lay with her husband, she died, either from a thunderbolt, or else, for that by negligent handling her bed was set on fire. And thus the marriage song not yet ended was turned to mourning; and she was carried out of her bride bed into her grave; and the torches that gave her light at her wedding did now serve to kindle her funeral fire. Beside this unhappy fortune God gave me another tragical mishap, in that he took her mother from me also, being too sorrowful for her daughter's death. I therefore, unable to bear this great punishment at the god's hands, did not indeed banish myself from life — obeying herein those divines who say that this is unlawful — but rather banished myself from my native land and fled far from the solitude of my own home. For thus to blot out the memory of the past by a change of scene brings with it forgetfulness. </p>                        </div>

But I desire that you should know too the principal cause why I tell this tale. After I had travelled over many countries, I came at length into your <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and into the city of Catadupi to see the cataracts of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>. As I walked about in the city, as my leisure served, and did buy such things as are scarce in Greece — for now by continuance of time having well digested my sorrows I hastened to return into my own country — there came a sober man to me and such a one as by countenance appeared to be wise. He had lately passed his youthful years and was in colour very black and he saluted me and said — not speaking Greek very well — that he would talk with me about a certain matter. And when he saw that I was ready to go with him, he brought me into a certain temple, and by and by said: 'I saw you buy certain herbs and roots that grow in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, and if you are willing to purchase from me simply and without guile, I will show you what I have to sell.' 'Show me then, I pray you,' quoth I. 'I will,' said he, 'but do not be too stingy with your offers.' 'Nay,' I returned, 'do not you be too grasping in your price.' With that he took a little bag from under his arm and showed me certain precious stones of wonderful price. There were pearls among them as big as a little nut, perfect round; emeralds as green as grass in spring and shining smooth as oil; sapphires in colour like the sea bank that lieth under a hard rock which makes all that is beneath it to be of like purple colour; in few words, their mingled and diverse shining colour delighted and pleased the eyes wonderfully. Which as soon as I saw, 'You must seek other chapmen,' quoth I, 'good sir; for I and all my riches are scarce able to buy one of the stones I see.' 'Why,' said he, 'if you are not able to buy them, you will be able to take them if they are given to you.' 'I am able indeed,' said I, 'to receive them, but I know not what you mean so to mock me.' 'I mock you not,' quoth he, 'but mean good faith, and I swear by the god of this shrine that I will give you all those things if you will take them, and another gift beside which far excelleth them all.' I laughed when I heard this, and he asked me why I laughed. 'Because,' quoth I, 'it is a thing to be laughed at, seeing that you promise me things of so great price, and yet assure me to give me more.' '<a href=/people/2182 target=_blank>Trust</a> me,' said he; 'but swear that you will use this gift well and as I shall teach you.' I marvelled what he meant and stayed a while; yet, in hope of those greater rewards I took an oath. After I had sworn as he willed me, he brought me to his lodging and showed me a maid of excellent beauty who, he said, was only seven years old. Methought she was almost marriageable, such grace did excellent beauty give to the tallness of her stature. I stood in amazement, both because I knew not what he meant, and also for the insatiable desire I had to look upon her. Then spake he thus to me - </p>                        </div>

I by chance finding her took her up, for it is not lawful to despise and neglect a soul in danger, after it hath once entered into a human body. For this is one of the precepts of those wise teachers that are with us, to be whose scholar myself was once judged worthy. Besides, even in the infant's eyes there appeared something wonderful and divine; with such a steady and amiable countenance did she behold me as I looked upon her. With her was also found this bag of precious stones which I showed you of late, and a silken cloth wrought with letters in her mother's tongue, wherein was her whole history contained, her mother as I guess procuring the same. Which after I had read, I knew whence and what she was, and so I carried her into the country far from the city, and delivered her to certain shepherds to be brought up, charging them to tell no man. As for the things I found with her I kept them myself, lest because of them the maid should be brought into danger. Thus at the first the matter was concealed. But when in process of time the maid grew on and became more fair than other women were — for beauty in my opinion cannot be concealed even under the ground, but would thence also appear — fearing lest her estate should be known, and so she be killed, and I brought into trouble therefrom, I sued and obtained that I might be sent on embassy to the governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and have come now bringing her with me, desirous to set her business in good order. And now must I utter to him the cause of my embassy, for he hath appoint this day for the hearing of me. As touching the maid, I commend her to you and to the gods who have hitherto conserved her, upon such conditions as you are bound by oath to perform. That is, that you will use her as a free woman, and marry her to a free man, as you receive her at my hand, or rather of her mother who so hath left her. I trust that you will perform all things whereon we agreed, both by credit of your oath and the faith I have in your manners, which these many days I have experienced to be very Greekish indeed. Thus much I had to say to you, before I execute the commission of my embassy: as for the other secrecies belonging to the maid, I will tell you them tomorrow in more ample wise, if you will meet me about the temple of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>.' </p>                        </div>

The next day I went to the temple of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>, as I had appointed with the stranger, and after I had walked there a great while alone and saw him not, I went to the governor's house and asked whether any man had seen the legate of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>. There one told me that he was gone, or rather driven, home the day before at sunset; for the governor had threatened to kill him if he did not immediately depart. I asked him the cause. 'For that,' quoth he, 'by his embassy he willed our governor not to meddle with the mines out of which the emeralds are dug, as belonging to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>.'

I marvelled that even as good grey<a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> do fawn upon everyone, though they have but little acquaintance with them, so she quickly perceived my good will toward her and did embrace me as if I had been her father. I determined therefore not to tarry longer at Catadupi, lest some spite of the gods should deprive me of this other daughter too, and so coming by boat down the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> to the sea I got a ship and sailed home. And now is she my daughter with me here, my daughter I say, named by my name, and on her all my hopes depend. And beside other things, wherein she is better than I could wish, she has quickly learned the Greek tongue and has come to perfect age with such speed as if she had been a peerless branch, and so far doth she surpass every other in excellent beauty that all men's eyes, as well strangers as Greeks, are set on her. To be short, wherever she is, either at the temples, or at public exercises, or in the places of common resort, she turneth all men's minds and countenances unto her, as if she were the image of some god newly made. But although she be such a one, yet she grieveth me sore. She hath bidden marriage farewell, and determined to live a maiden life; and so, becoming <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a>'s servant, she for the most part applieth herself to hunting and doth practice shooting. For my part, I set little by my life. I hoped to marry her to my nephew, my sister's son, a courteous young man, well mannered and fair spoken; but I can neither by prayer nor promise nor force of argument persuade her thereto. But that which grieveth me most is that — as the proverb says — she useth my own feathers to wing her shafts. The wise arguments that I did once employ in guiding to the choice of a virtuous life she brings up against me, and commends virginity as a thing divine, placing it in heaven with the gods and calling it immaculate, unspotted, and incorruptible. As for love, the sport of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>, and all the ceremonies that pertain to marriage, she doth utterly reject them. In this matter I require your help, and therefore now having good occasion, which hath in a manner offered itself to me, I use a longer tale than need requireth. Do this much for me, good <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>: use your wisdom or some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> enchantment to persuade her, either by word or deed, to know her own nature and to consider that she is born a woman. This you can do, if you will. For she disdaineth not to talk with men, since she has been commonly brought up among them; and she dwelleth in the same house as you, here I mean within the circuit and compass of this temple. Despise not mine humble prayers, and suffer me not to live in mine old age without children and comfort and hope of any to succeed me. This I beseech you to do for <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>'s sake and all the gods of your own country.' I wept when I heard this, <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, because he himself not without tears thus humbly besought me, and promised to do what I could for him in this point. </p>                        </div>

And this present embassy is being done more honourably than any of the rest, because their captain says he is one of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>' line. By chance I met him two days ago and there seemeth verily to appear in him somewhat worthy of those that come of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>' blood. Such is the comeliness of his person and tallness of stature that it may easily prove he was born of some goddess.' I marvelled how they, being <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404229PAin class=ethnic long=22.8341 lat=40.4754>Aenians</a>, did say they came of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>' blood — because the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> poet <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> saith that <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> was born at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393223RPht class=place long=22.5 lat=39.2>Phthia</a> — but <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> replied: 'The young man and the rest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404229PAin class=ethnic long=22.8341 lat=40.4754>Aenians</a> say plainly that he is their progenitor, and that <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a> was married to <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a> out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388224RMal class=place long=22.4 lat=38.8>Malia</a>, and that in old time <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393223RPht class=place long=22.5 lat=39.2>Phthia</a> was the district round that gulf but that others now because of the glory of their hero do falsely claim that name for themselves. For his own part, he proveth himself to be of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>' blood by another reason: <a href=/people/4347 target=_blank>Menesthius</a> his ancestor was the son of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389225WSpe class=place long=22.467 lat=38.856>Spercheus</a> and <a href=/people/2962 target=_blank>Polydora</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a>, and went with <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> among the noble captains to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, and because he was his kinsman was one of the chiefest captains of the <a href=/people/3641 target=_blank>Myrmidons</a>. But although he himself be very near on every side to <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> so as to join him close to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404229PAin class=ethnic long=22.8341 lat=40.4754>Aenians</a>, yet he accounts these funeral offerings to <a href=/people/1965 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> as the most assured proof of all; which, as he says, all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> have yielded to them, bearing them witness that they be the next of his blood.' 'I envy them not, <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>,' quoth I, 'whether they claim this for themselves untruly or it be so indeed. But I pray you send for the captain in, for I desire much to see him.' <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> consented, and therewith entered a young man of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>' courage indeed, who in countenance and stomach appeared no less than he. With a straight neck, high foreheaded with his hair in comely sort rebending down, his nose and nostrils wide enough to take breath, which is a token of courage and strength: his eyes not very grey, but grey and black, which made him look somewhat fiercely, and yet very amiably, not much unlike the sea when it is new calmed after a boisterous tempest. After he had saluted us, as the manner is, and we him again: 'It is time,' said he, 'to do sacrifice to the god, that we may finish the hero's rites betimes and the pomp belonging thereto.' 'Let it be so,' said <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>; and as he rose, he said to me softly: 'You will see <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> today, if you have not seen her before; for she must by custom be present at the pomp and funerals of <a href=/people/385 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a>.' I in truth had seen the maid before, <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, and she used to enquire of me concerning our holy customs and ordinances; but I said nothing to him, waiting to see what would come hereof, and we went to the temple together. All things belonging to the sacrifice had already been prepared by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a>, and when we came to the altar and the young man, having leave from the priest began to do sacrifice, the <a href=/people/10998 target=_blank>Pythia</a> spoke thus: 'Ye men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> sing of her, <br />And God's own offspring praise: Who now in grace begins to grow <br />But fame shall end her days. </p>                        </div>

The Hecatomb went before, and such men as were but lately entered into the holy ministry, of rustic dress and life, led the same. Each one had a white robe girt about him, his breast and arm and right hand naked, and a poleaxe therein. All the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> were black and very lusty, wagging their heads and lifting them up a little, with horns both even and straight, whereof some were gilded and others had garlands of flowers upon them. Their legs were somewhat crooked, and their dewlaps hung below their knees, and there were just so many of them as would make an exact hecatomb in deed. After them followed a great sort of other offerings, every kind of beast being led by itself alone, with a pipe and flute to appoint when and with what they should begin. These beasts and their leaders were welcomed by certain virgins of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, arrayed in fair deep-girded robes, with their hair loose about their ears. The maids were divided into two companies, of which those who were in the first carried baskets full of flowers and fruit, the others bore trays of sweetmeats and perfumes and filled all the place with pleasant odour. They carried these things not in their hands but on their heads, and held hands together forward and backward in line, so that they might the more easily move in the dance. They received their song from another company, for it was the duty of these to sing the whole hymn. In this song was <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a> praised and <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a>, and then their son, and lastly his. After these maids, <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, — 'Nay,' quoth <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> breaking in, 'why do you rob me of the pleasantest part of the tale by not rehearsing me their song, as though I were only a spectator of what was done in their pomp and not a hearer also?'

And there was so good order in the song, and the measure of their dancing agreed so well with the sound of the music, that men's eyes neglected what they saw in comparison with what they heard, and those that stood by followed the maids as they passed on, as though they had been constrained with the pleasantness of their song, until the jolly lusty youths with their captain and ringleader appeared, the sight whereof was better than all description. The whole number of these youths was fifty, which was divided into twice five and twenty, each party arrayed about their captain, who rode in the midst of them. Their boots wrought of purple leather were folded finely a little above their ankles. Their cloaks were white, fastened with buckles of gold before their breasts, with a border of blue around the nethermost hem. Their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> all came out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, and by their pleasant countenances showed the good pasturage of their country. They foamed on their bits, as though they thought scorn of such as rode upon them, yet they turned very readily as the riders would have them. Their saddles and the rest of their harness was so beset with silver and gold that in this point the young men seemed to strive who should be bravest. But those who were present, <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, did so despise and pass by these men thus apparelled, and look on the captain <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, on whom was my care set, that all which showed before very bright was now darkened, as it had been by some passing lightning: such brightness did the sight of him bring to our eyes. He was on <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> back in heavy armour, a spear of ash pointed with bronze in his hand, bare-headed without a helmet. His cloak was of purple wrought with gold, wherein was the battle of the <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a> and the <a href=/people/721 target=_blank>Lapiths</a>; on the button of his cloak was <a href=/people/681 target=_blank>Pallas</a> pictured in electrum, bearing a shield before her breast whereon was <a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Gorgon</a>'s head. The comeliness and commendation of all that he did was somewhat increased by the easy blowing of the wind, which moved his hair about his neck, and parted it upon his forehead, and made his cloak wave so that the nether parts thereof covered the back and buttocks of his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. You would have said that his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> was moved by the beauty of his master and knew that he did bear upon him a passing seemly man: in so fine a sort did he rear his neck and with pricked up ears toss his head and roll his eyes fiercely and prance and leap from the ground. When he had the reins a little at his will, he would set forward courageously, and turn about on both sides and beat the ground with the tips of his hoofs lightly, and moderate his fierceness with the pleasantness of his pace. Each man was amazed thereat, and gave the young man the principal praise, as well for his courage, as for the beauty and comeliness of his person. As for the common sort of women and such as could not moderate their affections, they cast apples and flowers at him, by that means, as might be guessed, seeking to get his favour. For they were all of this opinion, that there could be no human shape which could surmount the seemliness of <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>. </p>                        </div>

She was carried in a chariot drawn by a yoke of white <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, and had on a purple gown down to her feet, spangled with gold. She was girded with a girdle, in making whereof the workman bestowed all his craft, in that he never made the like before nor was able to frame such another after. He tied two dragon's tails behind her back between her shoulders, bringing further their contrary necks under her paps with an artificial knot, suffering both their heads to hang down after it was fastened about her. You would have said the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a> did not seem to creep but crept indeed. They were not fearful with their terrible looks, but seemed as though they had been wantonly asleep. As touching their matter, they were gold, but in colour blue-black. For the gold by art was darkened that black and gold mingled together might represent the roughness and diversity of the scales. Such was the maid's girdle. Her hair was neither all bound up nor all loose. The most part thereof that grew behind hung over her shoulders; that which grew from the crown of her head downward to her forehead, being fair in colour and like to roses, was crowned with a garland of young laurel, which did not suffer the whole to be blown more than was seemly by the vehemence of the wind. In her left hand she bore a gilded bow, and a quiver of arrows hung on her right shoulder, while in her left hand was a burning taper, and, though she was so attired, there came a brighter light from her eyes than from the taper.' 'These same are <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> and <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> indeed,' said <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>. <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a> thinking he had spied them somewhere asked him: 'Where be they?

'I cannot tell,' quoth <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>, 'whether you saw them so attired as on that day all Greece and the sun himself did see them.

How thou didst comfort me, <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, when I hoped that you had seen my dear children and wouldest have shown them to me! But thou goest about utterly to deceive me.

'Be content,' quoth he, 'and fear not: they will come without doubt. Perhaps there is some let and hinderance that they come not so soon as was appointed between us; but even if they were here, I would not show you them until I had the whole reward you promised me. Wherefore if you desire to see them in haste, perform what you promised and make an end of your unfinished tale.' 'I am very unwilling,' quoth the other, 'to do that which bringeth me in mind of that which grieveth me much; and I supposed too that you were weary of this my so long prattling. But since you are so desirous to hear and can never be wearied with a good tale, go to, let us proceed whence we left off.

And when he had done all this, he went on with his tale thus — 'After the young men had gone three times around the tomb of <a href=/people/385 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a>, the women cried out piteously and the men made a strange noise. Therewith suddenly all the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, rams, and <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> were killed, as if they had been slain at one stroke. Last of all, when the altar, being of wonderful greatness, had very many cloven logs laid upon it, and all manners of lawful offerings were added thereto, they made request that <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>'s priest might begin the sacrifice and set fire to the altar. <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> said that the sacrifice indeed appertained to him, but that the captain of the holy legation should take the torch from her that was president of these ceremonies and set the altar on fire: for so was the fashion of the country. This he said, and did sacrifice, and <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> took the torch. Surely, <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, we may know by its deeds and workings that the mind is a heavenly thing and hath close affinity with the higher nature. For as soon as the young people saw each other, at the same moment they loved each other, as though the soul recognised its fellow and hastened towards its destined mate. At the first they stood still suddenly, as if in amaze. Then she slowly handed him the torch, and he likewise received it, viewing one another with steady eyes, as if either had seen or known the other before and was now trying to remember where. This done, they smiled a little, but secretly, so that it could hardly be perceived save by the softness of their glance. Afterwards, as though they were ashamed of what they did, they blushed; and then, within a while, when this affection, as I think, had gripped their hearts, they became pale. In a word, a thousand looks appeared on their faces in a short time, and the changing of all kind of colour and the rolling of their eyes plainly betokened the troubles in their mind. The people who were present, as may be guessed, perceived nothing of this, because every one was thinking of other matters; nor did <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>, who at that time repeated the usual prayer. But I did nothing but mark the young couple, for I was moved to suspect what should come to pass by conjecture of their names, after what the oracle had said of <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, when he was doing sacrifice in the temple. Yet I knew nothing exactly of what was signified in the latter part of the oracle. </p>                        </div>

For she dwelt not with her supposed father, but in her desire of chastity altogether separated herself from him. I being now made more curious by reason of that which I had heard and seen came of set purpose to meet <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>. 'Did you see <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>,' he asked, 'my joy and the honour of the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>?' 'This was not the first time,' I replied, 'I have met her often before in the temple, and that too not as a chance acquaintance. She has done sacrifice many times with me, and she has asked and learned from me of any point she doubted, either of divine or human matters.' 'How liked you her today?' quoth he. 'Did she give some fresh splendour to the pomp?' 'Marry, sir <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>,' said I, 'you seem to ask me whether the moon exceeds any whit the lesser stars.' 'Well,' he answered, 'some folk praised the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> youth also.' 'Yea,' said I, 'they gave him the second or third place; but all acknowledged your daughter to be the principal sight and the very eye of the pomp.' <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> was well pleased with this — and I began now to draw to my purpose, especially desiring that he should be of good heart and doubt nothing — and smiling a little he said: 'I go to her now: if it please you, come with me and let us see if this great company has been at all annoying to her.' I was very glad of this request; yet I made as though I had other business to do, but was content to leave that and go with him. </p>                        </div>

After she had embraced her father, as her manner was, he asked her what she ailed. She made him answer that her head did ache, and that she would fain sleep if she might. <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>, much grieved at this, went out of her chamber with me, and commanded the maids to make as little noise as might be, and when he came before his own house he said: 'What should this mean, good <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>? What disease hath my dear daughter? 'Marvel not,' quoth I, 'if she, having shewn herself in such a company, hath been spied by some spiteful eye.' He smiled at this and said in jesting wise: 'You then, as men commonly do, believe in witchcraft.' 'Yea marry,' quoth I, 'as much as I believe in anything that is true; and that for this reason. The air which is about us on every side, entering us by our eyes, nostrils, mouth and other pores, carrying with it such outward qualities as it is enduded withal, doth ingraft a like infection in them who have received it. For which cause, when man hath enviously looked upon any excellent thing, forthwith he hath filled the air with that pestilent quality, and sent forth also a poisoned breath to that which is near at hand. The same air, being a slender and subtle thing, pierceth even to the bones and very marrow, and by that means envy hath been cause to many of the disease which we call by its proper name 'bewitching.' Consider also, <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>, how many have gotten sore eyes, and the plague, though they neither touched those that had such diseases, nor ate at their table, nor lay in their beds, but only by being in the same air. Let love, if anything, be a proof of this, who taketh his beginning and occasion from something which is seen, and then his passion, as though wind borne, shoots through the eyes and into the heart. And this is like to be true. For seeing that of all our other pores and senses sight is the hottest and the most easily moved, it must needs receive such infections as are about it, and by its own hot spirit draw to itself the changing phases of love. If need be also I can bring for example's sake some reasons out of the holy books, gathered from the consideration of nature. The curlew healeth those that have the king's evil; which bird flieth away as soon as any that hath this disease hath spied her, and turneth her tail toward him, shutting her eyes. Not, as some say, because she would not help him, but that in looking upon him she draweth that evil disease unto her by nature, and therefore she declineth such sight as a present peril. Perhaps you have heard too how the basilisk, with his only breath and look, doth dry up and corrupt all that it passeth by. And it is no wonder if some do bewitch such as they hold most dear and wish best unto; for seeing that they be envious by nature, they do, not what they wish, but what by nature is appointed.' </p>                        </div>

The maker thereof is <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, and great <a href=/people/385 target=_blank>Neoptolemus</a> is the president of the same. Come then, neither let the banquet through your default be continued till night, seeing that none but you are now absent.' 'This fellow,' quoth <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> to me in mine ear, 'biddeth us with a cudgel in his hand. How little like the Bacchic god is he, albeit he is well soaked already. But let us go; for it is to be doubted lest, if we tarry, he will drive us forward with blows.' 'You jest,' said I; 'but let us go.' When we came, <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> placed <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> beside himself, and honoured me also somewhat for his sake. Why do I trouble you now with telling how the maids danced, and what instruments were there, and how the young youths danced the dance called Pyrrhica in armour, and other things also; wherewith <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> had mingled fine and delicate meats, ordering his banquet as if it had been a merry drinking party. But that which is needful for you to hear and pleasant for me to tell is this. <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> set a merry countenance on the matter, and strained himself wonderfully that he might entertain his guests courteously and make them good cheer. But I perceived whereto his mind was bent by the rolling of his eyes and sudden sighing without cause. Sometimes he was sad and in a muse; then straightway, as though he knew his own fault and would correct himself, he would be merry; to be short, he changed his countenance a thousand ways. For the mind of a lover, as of a drunken man, is flexible and can tarry in no certain state, both, as it were, swimming in a moist affection. And for this reason a lover will soon be drunk, and a drunken man soon in love. By his sorrowful gaping and careful countenance all those who were there presently saw that he was not well. Even <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> noticed his change of looks, and said to me softly: 'Hath some envious eye looked upon him also? Methinks that he and <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> have the same disease.' 'They have indeed, by <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>,' said I; 'and not without cause, since in the procession next to her he was the fairest person.' Thus talked we. But when the cups began to go about, <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> drank to every man, although against his will, for courtesy's sake. When he came to me, I said that I thanked him for his gentle offer, but did not drink. He, thinking I had despised him, looked at me angrily with burning eyes. Which as soon as <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> perceived he said: 'This man drinketh no wine nor eateth of the flesh of any living thing.' He asked: 'Why?' 'He is,' quoth he, 'an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a>, born at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>, a priest of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>.' When <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> heard that I was an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> and a priest, he conceived a wonderful pleasure and stretched himself for joy, as those who have found some great treasure, and called for water, and after he had drunk a good draught, he said: 'Right wise man, I have drunk to you of that which you like best, and I pray you let this table make a lasting league of amity between us.' 'May it be so, worthy <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>,' said I; 'I have a good while desired the same.' So receiving it from his hand I did drink, and with such talk we made an end of the banquet and went everyone to his own lodging. But <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> embraced me very lovingly and with kisses, both oftener and more familiarly than our former acquaintance suffered. After I came home I slept not the first part of the night, thinking of the young couple and studying diligently what the latter part of the oracle should mean. When it was midnight, I saw <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> and <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a>, as I thought — if indeed it was thought and not rather truth — and he delivered <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> to me and she <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>. Then calling me by my name: 'It is time,' they said, 'that you return to your country; for so the ladies of destiny command. Go therefore hence thyself and take these with thee, and love them as thine own children, and bring them out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> whither and how it shall please the gods.' When they had said this they went away, giving first a token that it was not a dream that I saw but a thing done in deed. I understood all the rest as I had seen it, but into what country or to what people they should be carried I could not tell.' 'You will tell me hereafter, father,' quoth <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, 'if you know yourself. But how mean you that the gods were shewn to you not in your sleep, but manifestly appeared.' 'Even so, my son,' quoth he, 'as wise <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> in a riddle did signify; although many let the hardness of the saying pass.

But although the rude and profane people know them not, yet can they not escape the wise man. He will know them either by their eyes, in that they look steadfastly and never shut their eyelids; or better still by their gait, in that they move not their feet nor set one foot before another, but are carried by some force and unchecked power through the air, rather sliding through than striding over the winds.

My man asked who called and what he would have, and he answered that <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=person long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> was there. I was glad of these tidings and bade him to be called in, thinking that this beginning did offer itself that I might learn how to bring to pass that which I was about. For I guessed that he came to crave my help to obtain his love, because he heard at the banquet that I was an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> and a priest, and thought, as many wrongly do, that the wisdom of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> is always one and the same thing. But of our wisdom there is one kind that is common and — as I may term it — creeps on the ground, which is concerned with ghosts and occupied about dead bodies, using herbs and addicted to enchantments, neither tending itself nor bringing such as use it to any good end. It often is deceived by its own practices and its success is of a vile and terrible sort; that is to say it gives visions of such things as are not, as though they were, and beguileth men of such things as they looked for, a deviser of mischief and a minister of foul and unlawful pleasures. The other, my son, which is the true wisdom, from whence the counterfeit has degenerated, we priests and holy men do practise from our youth. It is conversant with heavenly things, liveth with the gods, and partakes of the higher nature, considering the moving of the stars and gaining a knowledge of the future therefrom, far removed from these earthly evils and directing all things to the honesty and commodity of men. It was at the guidance of this wisdom that I left my country for a time, if by any means I could avoid the things that were foreshewn to me, as I told you before, and the battle between my sons. But let us leave these things to the gods, and especially to the ladies of destiny, in whose power it lies to do this or to refrain. For they decreed my banishment not more, it seems, for this reason than that I should find <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>.

After he had stroked his face a little, 'I am in great distress,' quoth he, 'and I am ashamed to tell you why.' I thought it then a fit time to glose with him, and to guess that that which I knew full well. Therefore, looking upon him cheerfully, I said: 'Although you be ashamed to tell me, yet nothing can be hidden from my wisdom and the knowledge of the gods.' And after I had lifted up myself a little, and made as though I would have cast some account with my fingers, and spread my hair about my ears like one that would have prophecied, I said: 'My son, thou art in love.' He started at my words, and when I added: 'with <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>,' — then supposing I knew it from God, he could scarce refrain from falling down and worshipping me. Which when I would not let him do, he came to me, and kissed my head oft, and gave God thanks that his hope had not failed him, and prayed me heartily that I would save him. For he could not live if he had not help, and that immediately: so great was the trouble that he felt and so vehemently did his heart burn; the more because he never was to love before. For he sware unto me many oaths that he never had to do with woman, and that he utterly refused marriage and love, if any were proffered him, until <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>'s beauty had overcome him. Not because he was chaste of nature, or could not do like other men, but because till then he had never seen a woman worthy to be loved. And as he said this he wept, in token that by force and against his will he was subdued by the maid. I took him up, and comforted him, and said: 'Be of good cheer, now that you have once come to me for help; she will not be stronger than my wisdom. It is true that she is somewhat austere and can hardly be made to love, utterly despising <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> and marriage, if she do but hear them named; but for your sake we must try all means. Art can break nature. Only you must be bold, and do whatsoever thing necessary I command you.'

He is in <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>'s temple hereby, and prayeth to the god; for he has been troubled, I know not how, by certain dreams.' Thereupon I rose; and when I had sent <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> away and was come to the temple, I found <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> sitting in a stall, very sad and sorrowful. I came to him and said: 'Why be you so sad?' He answered: 'Why should I not? Diverse visions in my sleep have troubled me, and my daughter, as I hear, is very sick and slept never a wink this night. For my part, although for many reasons her sickness grieves me, yet the greatest is that tomorrow is a day ordained for sport, and the custom is for the temple priestess to hold forth the torch to those who run in armour and be the judge of their race. Of two things then one must happen; either her absence will break this long accustomed order, or else by coming against her will she shall be more sick. Wherefore, even if before you could not, yet help her now, and do us this good turn, which shall well beseem our friendship and be besides an act of piety toward God. I know that it is easy for you, if you will, even to heal one who is, as you say, bewitched. For holy priests can bring wonderful things to pass.' I said, beguiling him also, that I had been careless hitherto, and asked for one day's liberty to make some medicine for her. 'At this present,' I went on, 'let us go to the maid, and consider her more diligently, and comfort her as much as we may. And I would also, <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>, that you should have some talk with the maid concerning me, and by your commendation bring me into better credit with her, that she being more familiar with me may the boldlier suffer me to heal her.'

Yet when she saw us she composed herself, and tried to regain her wonted looks and speech. <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> embraced and kissed her a thousand times, and omitting no kind of endearment — 'My child, my sweet daughter,' quoth he, 'wilt thou not tell thy father what thy sickness is? Seeing that thou hast been bewitched, why dost thou hold thy peace, as though thou wert the wrong-doer and wert not thyself injured by those eyes which so unluckily looked upon thee? But be of good heart.

'What ado is here?' said I. 'My daughter's sickness,' answered he, 'waxeth worse and worse; she hath had a worse night of this then any yet.' 'Get you hence,' quoth I, 'and all the rest avoid. Let some one set me a three-footed stool here, and a little laurel with fire, and frankincense. And let none come in to trouble me before I call.' <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> gave his orders and I having now gotten good occasion, began to play my pageant as if I had been upon a stage. I burned frankincense, and mumbled with my lips, and laid laurel on her from top to toe, and at length, after I had drowsily or old wife like gaped and played the fool a great while with myself and the maid, I made an end. She, while I was thus doing, wagged her head oft, and smiled, and told me that I was deceived and knew not her grief. Therewith I sat nearer to her and said: 'My daughter, be of good cheer. Thy grief is common and easily healed. Without doubt thou wert bewitched when you were at the pomp, or rather when you presided at the race which was run in armour. And he that hath thus bewitched you, I think, is <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>; for I perceived well that he often beheld you and cast many wanton looks at you.' 'Whether he did so or not,' said she, 'well fare he. But what countryman is he, and of what line is he descended? For I saw many wonder much at him.' 'You have heard already,' said I, 'that he is a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=person long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a>, by the herald who proclaimed his name, and he fetcheth his pedigree from <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, and in my judgment he may do so with good reason, considering his tall stature and comely personage, which manifestly confirm <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>' blood. Saving that he is not so arrogant and proud as that hero was, but doth moderate and assuage the haughtiness and fierceness of his mind with commendable courtesy. Which thing being so, although he have an envious eye and with his looks hath bewitched you, yet he himself hath more pain than he hath caused you to have.' 'O Father,' quoth she, 'I thank you that you be sorrowful for our mishap; but why do you speak evil without cause of him who hath done us no harm? For I am not bewitched, but have, as I guess, some other infirmity.' 'Then daughter,' said I, 'why do you conceal it and not frankly utter it, that we may with more ease find remedy thereto? Am I not in age, yea rather in good will, your father? Is not your father familiarly acquainted with me? Are we not of one profession? Tell me your disease and I will keep your counsel; yes, if you will, I will be bound by oath to you so to do. Speak boldly, and suffer not your infirmity to increase with silence. For sickness which is soon known can easily be cured; but that which by long time hath gotten strength is almost incurable. Silence doth much succour any disease; that which is uttered may by comfort easily be remedied.' Thereat she waited a little, declaring by her countenance many changes of her mind, and said: 'Let me alone today and you shall know it hereafter; if indeed you know it not before, since you profess yourself a soothsayer.' Therewith I rose and departed, giving her occasion to moderate the bashfulness of her mind. Then <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> met me and, 'Have you any good news to tell me?' quoth he. 'All shall be well,' said I, 'for tomorrow she shall be healed of her infirmity. And there shall be somewhat else happen also of a right pleasurable sort. In the meantime nothing hinders to call in a physician.' When I had said thus, I made haste to be gone, that he might ask me no more questions. </p>                        </div>

I turned a little aside and was for passing by, as though I had not seen him. But he cried out: 'God speed you, <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>: tarry, I pray you: for I waited for you.' I turned suddenly about, and said: 'Why, it is the beautiful <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>: I did not see you.' 'How am I beautiful,' quoth he, 'who do not please <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>?' I set a face on it as though I were angry and said: 'Will you not cease to speak evil of me and my skill, whereby she is now entrapped and compelled to love you, and doth desire to see you, as one that is mightier than herself.' 'What say you, father?' said he. 'Doth <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> desire to see me? Why do you not then carry me to her?' And therewith he started to run. But I caught him by the cloak and said: 'Stand still here, although you be very light footed. This is not a thing that can be snatched as booty nor is it easy for every man that list to get the same. It must be done with great counsel and performed with no small provision.

'We shall not prevail with him,' said I. 'Not that he can find any fault in you, but he hath long ago promised her in marriage to his sister's son.' 'He shall repent it,' said he, 'whoever he be. While I live, no other man shall wed <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>. This hand of mine is not yet benumbed, nor my sword so blunt.' 'Be content,' said I: 'we shall have no need of any of these things. Be only ruled by me, and do as I command you.

'But tell me, <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>,' quoth I, 'how you perceived that she was in love?' 'When I had gotten very trusty physicians,' replied he, 'as you gave me counsel, I brought them to her, promising them all the riches I had if they could cure her.

Acestinus, a wise man — perhaps you know him — took her wrist in his hand, although against her will, and seemed to judge her disease by the beating of her pulse, which declareth, I suppose, the state of the heart. After he had felt her pulse a good while, and had looked her carefully up and down, he said: <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>, you have brought us here in vain; physic can do her no good. O God, cried I: why say you so, must my daughter die without all hope of recovery? Make not such ado, said he, 'but listen to me. And then, when were in a corner, so that neither the maid nor any other could hear us, he said: Our art doth profess the caring of distempered bodies, and not principally of the diseased mind, but only when it is afflicted with the body, so that when that is healed, then is it also cured. The maid in truth is sick but not in body; for no humour aboundeth, the head ache vexeth her not, no ague burneth her, nor is any part or parcel of her body grieved. You may account this, and nothing else, to be true. I earnestly begged him, if he had noticed anything further in her, to tell me. Doth not even a child know, quoth he, that love is an affection of the heart and a sort of sickness? There is naught that ails her inward body, but do you not see that her eyes are swollen, her looks distraught, and that she is pale in her face? Besides, she raveth and uttereth whatsoever cometh into her mind, and lieth awake without a cause, and hath suddenly lost the just amplitude of her limbs. You must find her the man for whom she yearneth; he is the only one, <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>, who can cure her. When he had said this, he departed. So I have come in haste to you, my saviour and my god, whom both I and she acknowledge to be alone able to help us. For when I desired and often besought her to tell me what she ailed, she made me this answer, that she knew not what disease she had and that none but <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>, she was persuaded, could cure her; and therefore she begged me to call you to her. Whence I guessed that your wisdom it was that had brought her under.' 'Can you,' said I to <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>, 'tell whom she loveth, as well as that she is in love?' 'No, by <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>,' said he; 'for how or by what means should I know that? Marry, I would above all things that she loved <a href=/people/997 target=_blank>Alcamenes</a> my sister's son, whom, as much as lieth in me, I have appointed to be her husband.' 'You might try,' said I, 'and bring him in, and show him to her.' He liked my counsel well, and went his way. </p>                        </div>

My daughter seemeth to be out of her wits, such a strange infirmity hath she. I brought in <a href=/people/997 target=_blank>Alcamenes</a>, as you bade me, and showed him to her very freshly apparelled. But she, as though she had seen the <a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Gorgon</a>'s head or something yet more terrible, cried out with a loud voice, and turned her face to the other part of the chamber, and put her hand to her throat instead of a halter, and threatened that she would kill herself, and bound it with an oath too, if we dispatched not ourselves out of the chamber quickly. We went from her in less time than she spake the words: for what could we do, seeing so fearful a sight? Now I come to beseech you again, that you will neither suffer her to perish nor me to be frustrated of my desire.' 'O <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>,' said I, 'you said truly that your daughter was distraught. She is indeed distracted by those powers of no mean strength that I have sent upon her, which, as it seemeth, force her to do that which both by nature and determination of mind she abhorred. Some god, methinketh, has taken upon himself to hinder this business and to strive against my ministers. Wherefore it is time you showed me the wrapping which you said was found with her together with the other tokens. I fear that it be enchanted and wrought with such signs as do now vex her mind, by reason that some enemy did lay this snare for her at the beginning, that she should be estranged from all love and die without issue.' He agreed to what I said, and within a while brought me the wrapping. I asked him to give me a space, and when he agreed I took it to my lodging, and delaying not a whit began to read what was written thereon. It was in Ethiopian letters, not the common sort, but such as their princes use, like to those that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> call hieratic, and this was what I read therein - </p>                        </div>

But I read that which followed, which was this — My daughter, the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, who is author of our race, is witness that it was not because of any misdeed that I have cast thee forth and concealed thee from they father <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>' sight. Yet, my daughter, I would have myself excused to thee, if thou dost happen to live, and to him who shall find thee, if God do so provide, and to all men; and therefore now I declare the cause of thy exposure. Our ancestors are, among the gods, the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> and <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a>: among heroes, <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a>, <a href=/people/691 target=_blank>Andromeda</a> and <a href=/people/440 target=_blank>Memnon</a>. Those who built our royal palace at various seasons adorned the walls with paintings of their various exploits, and with their limned figures decked the guest chambers and the porticoes therein, while the king's bridal chamber is garnished with pictures containing the loves of <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a> and <a href=/people/691 target=_blank>Andromeda</a>. In that chamber, after <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> had been married to me ten years and we had never a child, we happened to be resting one summer day, for that we were drowsy with the fierce heat. And it was then that your father had to do with me, swearing that by a dream he was commanded so to do; and I by and by perceived myself to be with child. All the time after until I was delivered was kept as a public festival and sacrifices of thanksgiving were offered to the gods, for that the king hoped now to have one to succeed him in his kingdom. But thou wert born white, which colour is strange among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a>. I knew the reason, that it was because, while my husband had to do with me, I was looking at the picture of <a href=/people/691 target=_blank>Andromeda</a> brought down by <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a> naked from the rock, and so by mishap engendered presently a thing like to her. But counting it certain that thy colour would procure me to be accused of adultery, and that none would believe me when I told them the cause, I determined to rid myself of shameful death and to commit thee to the unstableness of fortune, which was a thing far to be preferred to present death or to be called a bastard. Telling my husband therefore that thou wert straightway dead, I have privily laid thee forth with the greatest riches that I had, as a reward for him who shall find thee and take thee up. And besides those other things I have wrapped thee in this band, wherein is contained the story of both our fortunes, which I have written with tears and blood that I have shed for thee, since I have thee and fell into much sorrow for thee at one and the same time. But oh my sweet child, that wert but for a small while my daughter, if thou live, remember thy noble parentage, and love chastity, which is the sure sign of womanly virtue and queenly mind, and follow thy parents by keeping the same. Above all things remember that thou seek for a certain ring among the jewels that are about thee, which thy father gave me when we were first betrothed, in the hoop whereof is the king's secret token and the stone is a <a href=/people/4645 target=_blank>Pantarbe</a> consecrated with secret virtues. These things I have said to thee, making this writing my messenger, since God has taken from me the power to tell thee them to thy face. It may perchance be useless and void of effect, but also it may be profitable hereafter: for no man knoweth what uncertain fortune will bring. To be short, what I have written, O my daughter, beautiful in vain, who by thy beauty hath brought me blame, if thou live, shall be a token to thee of thy birth. But if thou die — which God Grant I never hear — it shall serve as thy mother's lamentation at thy grave. </p>                        </div>

After I had sent them away who were with her and given them charge that they should make no noise, under pretence that I had some prayers and invocations to make about the maid, I said to her: 'Now is the time come, <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, — for so you promised me yesterday — to tell me your grief, and not to conceal it any longer from a man that loveth you heartily and can know it, even if you hold your tongue.' She took me by the hand and kissed it, and therewithal she wept, and said: 'Wise <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>, since you seem to know my disease, grant me one favour. Suffer me to hold my peace and be unhappy, gaining this much at least, that I hide my shame and conceal that which to suffer is evil but to utter is worse. Although my increasing disease doth much grieve me, yet this grieveth me more, that at the first I overcame it not but yielded to love, a thing which even to speak of doth defile the honorable name of virginity.' With that I comforted her and said: 'My daughter, you do well for two reasons to conceal your state. I have no need to be told that which by skill I knew already. And not without cause do you blush to utter that which it becometh women to keep secret. But because thou hast once tasted of love and <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> hath subdued thee — for thus am I by divine inspiration informed — know that neither art thou alone nor yet the first that hath been thus affected. Many other noble women and many maidens in all things very chaste have tasted hereof as well as you. For <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a> is the greatest of the gods, and is said even sometimes to overcome the gods themselves. Now you must consider how you may best order your business. Not to be in love at all is a kind of happiness; but when you are taken, to use it moderately is a point of excellent wisdom.

After she had waited a good while: 'Father,' said she, 'you speak of marriage and bid me embrace it, as though it were plain that either my father would be content therewith or mine enemy want it.' 'As for the young man,' said I, 'there is no doubt. He is more in love than you, being moved by the same reasons, since both your minds, as it seems, at the first sight knew one another's excellency and fell into a like affection, while I myself have made his love the greater to do you pleasure. But he who is supposed to be your father provides you with another husband, <a href=/people/997 target=_blank>Alcamenes</a>, whom you know well enough.' 'Let him,' quoth she, 'rather seek to lay him in his grave than marry him to me.

'How I came by it,' said I, 'you shall hear afterward. But tell me now, if you can, what is contained therein.' When she told me that she could not, 'It declareth,' said I, 'your parents, your country, and all your fortune.'

I told her plainly all my plan and made her privy to every point. 'I, my daughter,' said I, 'went once into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> to learn of their wisdom, and was well acquainted with your mother <a href=/people/1482 target=_blank>Persina</a>; for the king's court is a place where all wise men resort. Marry, I had a little praise the more, because I joined the wisdom of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> together, which made me of the more credit. When she understood that I was returning to my country, she told me all your affairs, binding me first by oath to keep it secret, and said moreover that she durst not tell the wise men of that country. She desired me to ask the gods, first, whether after your exposure you lived; then, in what country you were. For she could hear of none such as you in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, although she had made diligent inquiry. I learned all of the gods, both that you were alive and where you were living. Then she besought me that I would seek you out and urge you to return to your country. For she said, she lived without issue and children by reason of her great grief for you and she was now ready to confess all to your father, if you at any time came to light, and she knew that he would be persuaded, both because of the long experience he had of her and also of the great desire and joy he would have in one to succeed him contrary to his expectation. This she said and begged me to do, by the oath that I had sworn by the sun, which may not be violated by any of the wise men. To perform that oath I came hither, although I took not this voyage for that cause only, accounting it by the will of the gods an advantage gotten in my long journey. I have been busy about this for long and have left no convenient service to you undone. But I told you not of the matter since I was waiting for a just opportunity, and also by some means to get the wrapping that I might have due proof of my tale. Therefore, if you consent, you may go away now with us, before you suffer anything you would not from the violence of <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>, who is providing very busily to match you with <a href=/people/997 target=_blank>Alcamenes</a>. Then you will recover your kindred, your country, and your parents, and dwell with <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, who is ready to follow us into whatsoever country we will, and will leave a foreign bastard life for one that is natural and princely, ruling as queen together with your dear lover, if we may believe the gods, and especially the oracle of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>.' With that I brought the oracle into her remembrance and declared to her what it meant, she already knowing thereof before, inasmuch as it was in every man's mouth and hotly debated. At this she was moved and — 'Father,' quoth she, 'since you say the gods will it so and I believe no less, what must we do?' 'You must make,' said I, 'as though you were content to marry <a href=/people/997 target=_blank>Alcamenes</a>.' 'That is a hard thing,' she replied, 'and scarcely seemly, even in word to prefer any man before <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>. But inasmuch as I have put myself, father, into the hands of the gods and you, tell me now the purpose of this design, and how it may be undone before it be brought to effect.' 'The issue will teach you,' said I. 'Many things, told beforehand to women, have greatly hindered the matter in hand: which, being suddenly put into practise, are for the most part by them more boldly achieved. Only follow my counsel both now and at other times, and be content to allow the marriage that <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> provides for you, remembering that he will do nothing without my counsel and guidance.' She made promise so to do; and I went my way, and left her weeping. </p>                        </div>

But that I might withdraw him from this despair of mind and bring him far from suspicion of what should come to pass, I said: 'Sir priest, although you are the servant of the most prophetic of the gods, you seem to me to judge not aright respecting this vision. It foreshoweth to you the marriage of your daughter, and doth secretly signify by the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> that a husband shall take her, and that <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> will bring him to her with his own hand. And yet you seem to be angry and construe your dream worse than it is meant. Wherefore, <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>, let us be content and help the purpose of the gods by labouring in every way to persuade the maid.' He asked me what was best to be done, that the maid might be more obedient. 'If,' quoth I, 'you have any precious thing in store, or apparel wrought with gold, or jewels of price, bring them to her, as tokens from her spouse, and appease her with gifts; for gold and precious stones are for women like a magic charm. You must provide everything ready for the solemnity and perform the marriage at once, while her desire therefor, which is wrought by art against her will, remains stable and unchanged.' 'Think that I will omit nothing that I can do,' said <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>; and with that he went home rejoicing and made haste to put words into action.

'The maids,' quoth he, 'are gone away already that they may take the easier journey: the young men also will tarry no longer, but make much ado and prepare to return to their country.' When I heard this I told him what he should say to them and do himself, and gave him charge to wait until I showed him the time and the occasion. And so I left him and went to the temple of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, to pray the god that he would instruct me concerning my flight with the young couple. But the god was quicker than any man would think, who helpeth those that act according to his will, even though he be not called upon, and preventeth their prayers with the readiness of his good will: as even then it happened that he prevented my question with the answer and did in deed declare his help and guidance. For as I went to seek the prophetess, anxious for the performance of that which I had determined, a voice stopped me as I went by, which said: 'Come, good friend, quick and join us: we who are strangers here invite thee.' And indeed there was a company there making a sacrificial banquet with music in honour of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>. I stopped when I heard the words; for I might not go past when God had called me. I took some frankincense therefore and offered it, and made a libation of water, and although they seemed to wonder at the simplicity of my sacrifice, yet they desired me to take part in their banquet. I did so, and after I had sat down on a bench which they strewed with myrtle and laurel for strangers, and had eaten as I am accustomed to do, I said unto them: 'Good fellows, I thank you for this good cheer. But I am utterly ignorant of your estate: wherefore it is time that ye tell me who you are and whence you come. For it is an unseemly and very rude thing that those who have done sacrifice and banquetted together and made holy meat the beginning of friendship should depart without either knowing the other's affairs.' They told me then that they were merchants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a>, and that they were sailing to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> in Africa, their ship freighted with merchandise from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a>. At that moment they were making a feast to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=person long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrian</a> <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> for a victory just gotten, inasmuch as this young man, said they, pointing to one who sat beside me, has gained the prize for wrestling and proved that a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=demonym long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrian</a> may win the victory in the midst of Greeks. 'For he,' said they, 'after we had sailed past <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364232LMal class=place long=23.198 lat=36.436>Malea</a>, and by force of tempest were constrained to land at the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382206IKep class=place long=20.59 lat=38.2>Cephalenia</a>, swore unto us by our country's god that in his sleep it was told him that he should obtain the victory in these games of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>. And when he had persuaded us to turn from our intended course and land here, he made proof by his deeds that his prophecy was true, so that now he is proclaimed as a famous victor, who was but late a merchant, and is offering this sacrifice to the god who was his conductor, both as a thanksgiving for his victory and as a prayer for a prosperous voyage. And tomorrow, if the wind serve, we shall leave this coast.' 'Have you in truth determined this?' said I. 'Yea, verily,' answered they. 'You shall then, if you please,' I said, 'have my company. For I have a voyage to make to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> for a certain reason, and you sailing to Africa must pass by it.' 'You shall be welcome,' quoth they, 'if you will come; for we think we shall want for nothing good if we have with us a wise man, and a Grecian, and one who by experience is proved to be well beloved of the gods.' 'I would,' said I, 'that you will grant me one day, to make my provision.' 'You shall have tomorrow,' they said, 'on condition that by evening we be on the sea; for we commonly sail by night, since the winds that blow then from the land do calmly fill our sails.' I made bargain that I would do so, binding them first by oath that they should not depart before the promised time was expired. </p>                        </div>

I was moved hereat, and after I had wept over the young couple — rather with my heart than with mine eyes, so that they perceived it not and yet it eased my grief — I comforted and emboldened them, bidding them hope for a happy end, since the matter was begun by the will and counsel of the gods. 'As for me,' quoth I, 'I will go and dispatch the rest of our business. Tarry you for me in this place, and take diligent heed that no man espy you.' When I had said this I was going away, but <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> caught me by the coat, and held me fast, and said: 'Nay, father, this is an unfair, or rather a traitorous beginning, if you go away and leave me alone with <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, not considering how unmeet a lover is to lay the guardian, if it be in his power to enjoy that which he loveth, and there be no man there to make him ashamed thereof.

Wherefore I will not let you depart before I am assured, both for the present and the future, by an oath of <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> that he will not fleshly have to do with me until I have recovered my country and parents; or if the gods grant me not that, at least until by mine own free will I consent that he shall marry me.

I admired her words, and determined it should be so, and lit a fire upon the altar, and burned frankincense. <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> said that he was being wrongly used, since the faith which he had determined in his mind to keep was taken away by reason of his oath, and that he could not now show that he was acting willingly inasmuch as he would seem to be compelled by a stronger power.

In a word, for ignorance of what had been done and want of counsel as to what they should do now, they were at their wits' end. Then began I with my big voice to thunder and say: 'Ye unhappy people, how long will you sit still, dumb like stocks, as though your wits also were taken away by your ill fortune? Why do you not in armour pursue your enemies? Will you not take and punish those who have done you this wrong?' 'It is in vain perchance,' said <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>, 'to strive against this present fortune. I understand well that I am thus punished because of the anger of the gods, which was foreshowed me, since I went in an unlucky time into the privy chapel and saw there that which was not lawful to be seen. As a punishment therefor I was told that I should lose that which I set most store by. But there is no impediment, as the proverb has it, even against a god to fight, if only we knew whom to pursue or who hath done us this mischief.' 'That is <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=person long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a>,' said I, 'whom you praised so much and made my friend, and the young men who were with him. You may perhaps find some one of them still in the city, who hath waited here till this evening. Wherefore arise and call the people to council.' So was it done: the captains appointed a meeting, proclaiming the same by trumpet in the city; the people straightway came together; the theatre was made a court by night. <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> came forward and by his very aspect roused the multitude at once to lamentation; for he was clad in black raiment, and had poured dust and ashes over his head and face. 'Men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=person long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>,' said he, 'perhaps you suppose, considering the greatness of my miseries, that I have come hither and gathered this multitude of people to utter mine own mishaps unto you. But it is not so. I suffer indeed such things as may be compared with death itself, and at this present time my house is desolate and destroyed by the gods, solitary and robbed of what I held most dear. Yet the common frustration and vain hope of all doth comfort me a little and giveth me some courage suggesting that I may yet recover my daughter again. And our city moveth me even more, which I desire and look shall be victorious first and take revenge on those that have wronged her. Unless indeed these <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> youths have robbed us also of our lofty courage and the just indignation we should fell for our country and our country's gods. For it is altogether intolerable that a few dancing boys, sent on a sacred message, should go away after they have wasted the most noble city of Greece and taken out of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>'s temple the most precious jewel thereof, <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, which also was my life. O implacable and too obstinate anger of God against us! First, as you know, it killed my natural daughter on the day of her marriage, and then her mother also from sorrow at her death, and banished me from my native country. But all that was tolerable after I had found <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>. <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> was my life, my hope, and the stay of my stock. <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> was my only comfort, and, so to say, my anchor. And now this tempest and evil fortune — whatever it be that hath now come upon me — hath taken her from me. Neither hath it done this simply or by chance, but as it is wont to triumph over me with the utmost cruelty, it hath taken her almost from her marriage bed, inasmuch as the day of her wedding was already spread abroad among you all.' </p>                        </div>

But let us not be drowned by his sorrow, nor carried away, as with a great stream of water, by his tears, letting pass the due occasion, which, as in all things, so in war is of the greatest force. For if we leave this assembly now and pursue at once, there is some hope that we shall overtake our enemies, who now travel without care, knowing us to be unprovided. But if lamenting, or rather like women bewailing, by our tarrying we give them time to escape, we shall deserve nothing but to be scorned, and that even by these striplings themselves: who I say ought to be impaled as soon as they be taken and some of them ignominiously dealt with, so that their punishment redound also on their families. This may easily be done if we move the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> to displeasure against these that have fled, and their posterity, by forbidding them to take any part hereafter in their holy embassy and in the hero's funeral sacrifice, and by decreeing that it shall be done at the cost of our common treasury.' When this had been approved of the people and by their decree established: 'Let this also,' said the captain, 'if it please you, be ratified by your voices, that the temple priestess no longer give the torch to those that run in armour. For as I think, therefrom grew the beginning of this impiety in <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, who thought of this rape, it may be deemed, ever since he first saw her. It is well therefore to take away the occasion of such like attempts hereafter.' After this was ratified by the votes and hands of all that were present, <a href=/people/1748 target=_blank>Hegesias</a> gave the signal to go forth and proclaimed war by sound of trumpet, so that all the theatre was dissolved into battle, and every man ran from the council to arms, not only the strong men and such as were able to wear armour, but boys even and some that were scarce striplings, making good by readiness their lack of years and boldly venturing to take their share in the expedition. Many women also behaved themselves more stoutly than their nature allows, and snatching up any weapon that came next to hand, followed vainly with the rest, only recognising the weakness of their sex when they found themselves in action left behind. You might have seen old men too striving with their age, the mind drawing the body and in ardent desire for battle reproaching it for its weakness as a disgrace. So great grief took the city for the rape of <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, and all the people, as if moved by one sorrow, without waiting for the dawn hastened forth together in pursuit. </p>                        </div>

At length after with much ado he had gone up and down in one place as though it had been different, he heard a woman, like a nightingale in the spring, dolefully lamenting and with sorrowful tunes, so that by her mourning, as if one had taken him by the hand he was brought to her chamber, and laying his ear to the door heard her yet complaining in this fashion: 'I, poor wretch, supposed that I had been delivered out of the hands of thieves and escaped the death I always looked for, and that I should now lead a life with my dearest friend which, though wandering in a strange land, would have been to me most delectable. For there is nothing so troublesome and grievous that in his company is not tolerable. But the god that hath had charge of our business from the beginning and hath granted us but small pleasure, not yet satisfied, hath deceived us again. I thought I had escaped bondage; but now I am a captive again in prison. I was in an island and dark place before; this present state is like to it, or rather truly worse, for he who both could and would by comfort abate my sorrows is violently separated and taken from me. A den of thieves yesterday was my inn; and what was that habitation but a very hell or worse place? Yet my dear loveR being with me made it easy to be suffered. There he lamented me alive, and shed tears for me being as he thought, dead, and bewailed me as though I had been slain. Now I am deprived of all this; and he is gone, who was partaker of my calamities and wont to share them as a burden with me. I am left alone, a lamentable prisoner, objected to the arbitrament of cruel fortune; and do only retain my life for that I hope my most dear friend is alive. But, O my heart, where art thou? What fortune hast thou? Art thou also bound, who hast a free mind, not able to abide any servitude save that of love? Well, save thy life at least and return to behold thy <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a> again.

And so it was that <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> fled from what was most desirable, and supposed that to be fearful which was most delectable to him. The woman that wept was not <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a>, but <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>. For thus it was.

Then were <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> and <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> left in the den alone, who accounted even the extremity of their present dangers to be the height of joy. For this was the first time that ever they were by themselves, delivered from all who might trouble them. Wherefore they took their fill without hindrance of kisses and close embracings, forgetful of all else beside as they clung to one another as if they had been one body, but content still to satisfy themselves with chaste love, temperating their affection with tears and cleanly kisses. For <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, if at any time she perceived <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> to pass the bounds of seemliness and deal with her over wantonly, would rebuke him by telling him of his oath; and he would suffer himself to be reformed with little labour and brought again to temperateness, in as much as he could master his desires although he could not master his love. But at length, though it were long first, they remembered what they had to do and were constrained perforce to be satisfied, and then <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> began to speak thus: 'That we, <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, may enjoy one another and attain unto that which we have preferred before all other things and for which we have borne all our troubles, we both do wish and may the gods of Greece grant.

Sore dismayed at that terrible sight, they stood a great while astonished, as though by the greatness of their sorrow they were hardened against the injuries of fortune which still so raged against them. At length, when the men were just landing, <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> desired that they should retire back, and creep into some corner of the den, and there hide themselves; and therewith herself she started to run away. But <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> stopped her and said: 'How long shall we flee the fate that followeth us everywhere? Let us yield to fortune and withstand no longer the violence that is ready to assault us. What else shall we gain but fruitless travel, and a life of banishment, and the continued mockery of the gods? Do you not see how to our exile they join the robberies of <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>, and go about with great effort and diligence to bring us into greater dangers by land than erst we have found by sea? Not long ago they made a battle about us: then they brought down thieves: afterwards they made us prisoners: then they left us alone but at liberty making us believe that we might go whither we would: and now they have brought us into the hands of such as shall kill us. This war for their sport have they made against us, devising, as it were, a comedy out of our affairs. Why then should we not cut short this tragical poem of theirs and yield us to those who wish to slay us; lest perchance, if they mean to make an intolerable end to our tragedy, we be forced to kill ourselves.' <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> agreed not to all he said. Marry she thought that he justly accused fortune; but it was no point of wisdom to yield themselves willingly into the enemies' hands; they were not sure they would kill them as soon as they had them, nor had they to do with so gentle and friendly a god that would make a quick end of their miseries, but would reserve them perhaps for a further bondage. 'That,' quoth she, 'would be more grievous than any sort of death. If we submit ourselves to the injuries of these barbarous people, we shall be so shamefully handled as I am loth to imagine. Which thing by all means let us avoid as long as we can, measuring our hopes of the future by our experience of the past, how we have oftimes been preserved from dangers even more desperate than these.' </p>                        </div>

She went before and he followed her close, as if he had been tied to her. But for all their haste they came not to the den before their enemies. For while they were looking at those in front of them, they wist not that they were now compassed and enclosed behind by another band which had landed on the island in another place. Wherewithal sore abashed they stood still, and <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> ran under <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>' arm, that if she must needs die she should die in <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>' hands. Some of those who had landed made ready to shoot at them; but after the young folks had looked upon them, their hearts failed and their right hands quaked. For even barbarous hands, it seems, do fear beautiful personages, and a right cruel eye will be made gentle by a lovely look. So they seized them and carried them to their captain, desiring to take the fairest of their spoils to him first. They had indeed nothing else to bring; for though they compassed the island with their arms, as with a net, yet they could find nothing, seeing that all that was in the island was burned in the former skirmish, save only the den of which no man knew. And thus they were brought to the captain <a href=/people/2008 target=_blank>Mitranes</a>, leader of the watch to <a href=/people/985 target=_blank>Oroondates</a> deputy of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> under the great king; who being hired with a great sum of money by <a href=/people/802 target=_blank>Nausicles</a> to seek <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a>, as is aforesaid, had now come to this island. When <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> and <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> came into his presence, calling upon the gods to save them, <a href=/people/802 target=_blank>Nausicles</a> by a crafty merchant-like device stepped forth and cried with a great voice: 'This is that <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a> of whom I was robbed by the mischievous herdsmen, and now recover again, by benefit of you, <a href=/people/2008 target=_blank>Mitranes</a>, and favour of the gods.' Then he caught hold of <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, feigning to be very glad, and whispered in Greek to her privily in her ear, so that none who were by should hear them, that she should say her name was <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a>, if she desired to escape danger. And this policy took effect; for <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, when she heard him speak Greek, thought that he was planning something to her advantage, and ordered herself as he desired; and when <a href=/people/2008 target=_blank>Mitranes</a> asked what her name was, she said '<a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a>.' Then <a href=/people/802 target=_blank>Nausicles</a> ran to <a href=/people/2008 target=_blank>Mitranes</a> and kissed him on the cheeks, and with praise of his good fortune made the barbarous man proud, saying that not only had he achieved other wars well but had brought this also to a prosperous end; so that elated by his words and deceived by the name he thought that it was so. He was indeed amazed at the maid's beauty, which even in her simple apparel appeared, as if the brightness of the moon should shine out of a cloud; but the quickness of the trick prevented him from changing his mind and any chance to repent was taken from him. 'Well then,' quoth he, 'now the maid is recovered, seeing she is yours, take her with you.' And when he had said this, he delivered her to him, still looking back at her and plainly declaring that it was against his will, and because of the reward he had received before, that he suffered her to depart. 'As for this young man,' he said, pointing to <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, 'whoever he be, he shall be our booty and go with us, and be kept diligently to be sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>. For the comeliness of his body is such that he may wait at the king's table.'

But <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a> and <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>, hoping to learn what they were ignorant of, came to <a href=/people/802 target=_blank>Nausicles</a> before daybreak and asked him how he had sped. Then <a href=/people/802 target=_blank>Nausicles</a> told them all: how he came to the island and found it deserted and no man therein to meet them: how he had craftily beguiled <a href=/people/2008 target=_blank>Mitranes</a> and gotten a certain maid who was there instead of <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a>: and that he had sped better in getting her than if he had found <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a>. For there was no small difference between them, but as much as between goddess and mortal woman. Her beauty was such that none could surpass it; but it was not possible to set it forth justly in words. When they heard this they began to surmise the truth, and prayed him instantly to bid her come in straightway: for they knew that it was not possible in words to express <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>'s beauty. So she was brought in, and <a href=/people/802 target=_blank>Nausicles</a> — as she cast her eyes to the ground and had muffled all her face save her eyebrows — began to comfort her and bid her be of good cheer. She looked up a little and, contrary to her expectation she saw and was seen; so that they all three began to cry out together as if a sign or token had been given them, and you might have heard often these words — 'O my father,' and 'O my daughter,' and 'O <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> indeed not <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a>'s <a href=/people/828 target=_blank>Thisbe</a>.' <a href=/people/802 target=_blank>Nausicles</a> for wondering had almost forgotten himself, astonished to see <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a> weeping as he embraced <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>; for he knew not what this sudden recognition scene, as if it had been in a comedy, meant. But <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a> kissed him and said: 'May the gods give you, O best of men, the fill of all your desires, who have saved my daughter that I never looked for, and caused me to behold the dearest thing that I might possibly see. But, O my daughter, where hast thou left <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>?' She burst out weeping at that question, and after a while she answered: 'He that delivered me to this man led him away prisoner.' <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a> then besought <a href=/people/802 target=_blank>Nausicles</a> to tell him what he knew of <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, who it was that had taken him, and whither he would carry him. <a href=/people/802 target=_blank>Nausicles</a> told him all, perceiving not that these were the children of whom the old man had talked so often, and in hope to find them had led a wandering life in sorrow. But he added that the knowledge would be of scant service, since they were poor and needy folk, and it was doubtful whether <a href=/people/2008 target=_blank>Mitranes</a> would let him go even for a great sum of money. 'I have money,' said <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> softly to <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>. 'Promise him as much as you will.

While the fire yet burned upon the altar, he thrust in his hand and made as though he pulled out of the fire that which he already held in his hand, and said: 'This price of <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>'s redemption the gods proffer thee, <a href=/people/802 target=_blank>Nausicles</a>, by me.'

If you turn him about as you hold him he casteth forth a golden beam, which doth not hurt or dim the sight but maketh it much better and clearer. And his natural virtue is also more than that of the western stones, for he doth not bear his name without effect, but in truth will not let that man be drunk who weareth him but keepeth him sober at all feasts. </p>                        </div>

There were engraven also young <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> leaping up and down, and some by heaps went up the rock, other some danced round about the shepherd, insomuch that the top of the hill was made a shepherd's disport. Others skipped in the flame of the amethyst, as if they had been in the sun, and with the tips of their feet scraped the stone. Many of the young sort, being of greater courage, seemed as though they wished to go out of the circle, but were prevented by the workmanship which set a band of gold in the manner of a wall about the rock and them. And it was a rock in truth, not a counterfeit; for when the workman had wrought the gold about the outer part of the stone, he let it show here in its native truth what he desired, thinking it of no purpose to counterfeit one stone in another. </p>                        </div>

After he had said this he went, himself and the others, to the festal banquet, placing the women by themselves in the inner part of the temple and the men in the outer precinct. When they had their fill of eating and the cups were set upon the table, the men made libation to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a> and sang marching songs in his honour while the women danced a ditty made in praise of <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a>. But <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> went apart about her own business and prayed that <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> might be preserved and guarded safe for her. </p>                        </div>

So he told them all, briefly repeating the principal parts of what he had told <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> before, and of purpose passing over in silence what he thought was of little purpose for <a href=/people/802 target=_blank>Nausicles</a> to know. What had not yet been told, and did depend upon that which went before, he told after this fashion. 'When they came aboard the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> ship and were gone from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, they sailed at first as they would wish and had a very prosperous wind behind them. But when they came to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384215UKal class=demonym long=21.533 lat=38.372>Calydonian</a> Sea they were greatly troubled, since they had happened into a sea which of its own nature is disquiet and troublesome.' <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> at this desired him not to pass it by but to tell if he knew any reason for the raging of the waves in that place. 'The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Sea</a>,' said <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>, 'being brought from its great breadth into narrow waters, pours, as it were through a funnel, into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384225UKri class=place long=22.469 lat=38.4712>Crisaean Gulf</a> and then, hastening to mingle with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381253WAeg class=place long=25.3 lat=38.1>Aegean</a>, is checked in its course by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230SIst class=place long=22.9932 lat=37.9159>Isthmus</a> of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a>, whose hill by God's providence perhaps was placed there lest the violence of the water should overflow the land on the contrary coast. Wherefore it would seem that the water is beaten back and piles up more in this part of the sea than in any other place, since that which is flowing in strikes against that which is running backwards, so that the sea begins to boil and the waves rise boisterous, by their mutual clashings lifted up into mighty billows.' All those who were present praised and applauded this reasoning, declaring it to be true, and <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a> went on with his tale. 'When we had passed this sea and had lost sight of the Rugged Islands, we thought that we discovered the heights of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378209PZak class=place long=20.8921 lat=37.7872>Zacynthus</a>, lying like a dark cloud before our eyes. Therewith the master bade strike some of the sails, and when we asked him why he abated them and went more easily, seeing that the ship had a very good gale of wind — 'Because,' said he, 'if we went with a full sail, we should arrive at the island about the first watch and there would be danger lest in the dark we run upon the sharp rocks hidden beneath the sea. It is therefore wisdom to lie out all night and take the wind in such proportion as shall serve to bring us to land there in the morning.' Thus said the master, <a href=/people/802 target=_blank>Nausicles</a>, but we did not do so; for at the very rising of the sun we were casting anchor in harbour. The inhabitants of the island who dwelt about the haven, which was not far from the city, came flocking to look upon us, as if we had been some strange sight, admiring the handsomeness of the great ship, as it seemed, which was built very fair and high, and saying that they recognised therein the excellent workmanship of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a>, and that we had wonderful good luck, who made so good a voyage in the winter about the time the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiads</a> were ready to set. </p>                        </div>

But I — as I had heard by chance from the master that they would winter there — went to seek some lodging for us along the shore, eschewing the ship, for that it was unmeet by reason of the rudeness of the mariners, and also the city, for that it was not convenient for the flight of the young couple. After I had gone a little way, I saw an old man, which was a fisher, that sat mending his broken nets before his door. I came to him and said: 'Good man, God save you; tell me, I pray you, where a man may get lodging?' He answered me: 'It was rent about a promontory hereby, yesterday, being caught upon a jagged rock.' 'I asked not that,' quoth I; 'but you will do us great courtesy, if either you yourself will be our host or else show us some other lodging.' To that he answered: 'Not I: I was not aboard with them. God forbid that Tyrrhenus should do so much amiss or be so hampered by his age. It was my lads' fault, who knowing nothing of the rocks here in the sea cast their nets before they should.' As I now at length perceived that he was somewhat hard of hearing, I shouted at him loud, and said: 'God speed you, sir, and I pray you tell us where we may find an inn.' 'God speed you in return,' quoth he, 'and you are welcome, if it please you, to abide with me; unless indeed you are one of those who seek luxurious mansions and bring a great train of serving men after you.' 'I have but two children,' quoth I, 'and I am the third myself.' 'That makes a good proportion,' quoth he; 'we are one more, as you will find, for I have two sons who dwell with me — my eldest sons are married and keep house themselves — and the fourth is my children's nurse, because their mother died but a while ago. Wherefore, good man, come and doubt not that we will be glad of you, who are a man who seem to be some gentleman even by your talk.' I arranged with him, and shortly after came back with <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> and <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, and Tyrrhenus entertained us gladly, and let us have the warmer part of the house. Truly we passed that winter season very well conferring in the day time together, and when we would sleep, <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> went to bed with the nurse in one room by herself, and I with <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> lay in another, and Tyrrhenus and his children in a parlour, also alone took their rest. We did eat at one table all, and such thing as were needful we provided at our own cost, while Tyrrhenus gave his guests abundance of the fish he caught in the sea, sometimes fishing alone and sometimes at our leisure we would help him. For he had all manner of ways to fish and for all seasons, and the place was well supplied and very convenient to cast nets; so that many ascribed the gain he got by his skill to the benefit of fortune. </p>                        </div>

He talked much of himself, telling me of his noble stock and showing his riches, and said that the ship wherein we sailed was his own, and that the greater part of the merchandise in it, gold, precious stones of great value, and silk was his also. He added also his late obtained victory, as no small increase of his honour and name, and a thousand things besides these.

'Leave this talk, father,' quoth he; 'I count the maid herself to be a dowry worth many talents, even all the riches in the world.

But after I had by these means pacified him, God brought upon us one wave after the other, as the proverb has it. Tyrrhenus, not long after, took me to a secret place on a crooked shore and said thus to me: '<a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>, I swear by <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a> and all the other sea gods, that I have loved you as if you had been mine own brother, and your children as if they had been mine also. I will tell you of a thing that is preparing against you, very grievous and painful. It is not lawful for me to conceal it from you, since we both dwell in one house, and it is very necessary that you should know thereof. There is a <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirate</a> waiting for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> ship, who lieth secret under the side of this promontory, and sendeth out spies daily to inquire when your craft will sail. Wherefore look to yourself and take heed what you must do, since it is against you, or rather against your daughter, that their wonted savagery is now enterprised.' 'The gods,' quoth I, 'give you such thanks for these tidings as you deserve! But how came you to know this, Tyrrhenus?' 'By reason of my craft I am acquainted with these <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>,' said he, 'and when I bring them fish I get a greater price from them than from other folk. Therefore yesterday when I was drawing my pots about the cliff yonder, the master <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirate</a> came to me and asked whether I had heard when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a> would leave the harbour. When I perceived the subtlety of his talk: 'In faith, Trachinus,' quoth I, 'I can tell you no certainty, but I suppose that at the beginning of the next spring they will sail.' Will the maid then sail with them, quoth he, who lieth at your house? 'I cannot tell,' quoth I; 'but why do you ask that?' Because I love her in such sort, he replied, that I am scant in my wits. I never saw her but once, but I know not whether I ever saw so fair a woman before. And yet I have taken many prisoners, some of them very beautiful. That I might the better cause him privily to tell me all his plans, I said unto him; 'What need you to fight with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a>, and not rather without blood fetch her out of my house before they go away?' Even <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>, quoth he, use gentleness and courtesy to such as they are acquainted with. I am leaving her therefore for your sake, lest by taking her I should bring you into trouble; for the guests whom you entertained would be required again at your hand. Also I desire to have two things at once, the riches in the ship and the marriage of the maid. Whereof one I must needs forfeit, if I make the attempt by land; and beside it would be very dangerous if such a thing should be enterprised so near the city, lest the rape should be perceived and pursuit made after. 'When I had much commended him for his wisdom, I left him there and am come now to tell you of the snares which these villains have laid for you, desiring you heartily to devise how you may save you and yours.' </p>                        </div>

I concealed from him what suited me of that which Tyrrhenus had told me, and opened unto him only this: that one of the men of that country, whom he was not able to withstand, was planning to take the maid from me by violence. 'I had rather marry her to you,' quoth I, 'both for the knowledge I have of you, and also for your wealth; but especially for that you promised to dwell with us in our country, if you have her. Wherefore if you desire to have her, let us sail hence quickly before we be prevented or suffer somewhat against our will.' He was wonderfully glad when he heard this and said: 'Father, this is well devised.' And therewithal he came and kissed me, and asked when I would advise him to depart; for though it was unseasonable then, it was possible to get into some other port to avoid the snares laid against us, and there wait for the good weather of spring. 'Well,' quoth I, 'if you will be ruled by me, at the beginning of the next night we will depart.' He promised so to do and went his way. I came home, but told nothing of this to Tyrrhenus, although to my children I said that it would be needful in the evening to go aboard the ship. They marvelled somewhat at the suddenness of this and asked the reason; but I put them off, saying I would tell them afterward, and that it was to our advantage now so to do. </p>                        </div>

He had a hat on his head, and it seemed by his countenance that he had been a wise and subtle man; marry he halted a little as if he had gotten some wound in his thigh. He came near to me and smiling sourly said: 'My good sir, alone of all that have sailed by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382206IKep class=place long=20.59 lat=38.2>Cephalenia</a>, and looked upon my house, and counted it a great matter to know my renown, you have had no respect for me, but have held me so in scorn that you did not even pay me greeting, which every man doth, and that too though I dwell so near.

The spring gales were now blowing from the west, and as soon as we started we were driven on by them for a day and night, our master steering his course for the coast of Africa. For he said that if the wind continued blowing and we kept a straight course we might get quite across the main sea, and that he was making all haste possible to reach the mainland or some harbour, insomuch as he suspected the barque astern to be a <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirate</a>. 'Ever since we loosed from the promontory of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>,' said he, 'he has been following us, and never declined one jot from our course, but pursues our ship as if he went our voyage with us. Indeed I have noticed, when I of purpose turned our ship from the right course, that he also did the same.' </p>                        </div>

While these things were disputed on both sides, it was the time of day when the husbandman doth unyoke his <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> from the plough, and the vehement wind began to wax calm so that in a little while it was almost down and blew softly to no purpose on our sails, rather shaking them together than making any way for our ship. At length it ceased quite, as if at the sun-setting it had appointed to leave blowing, or rather — that I may speak more truly — to do them which followed us a good turn. For those that were in the barque, as long as we had wind, were left far behind our merchant ship, our greater sails, as is natural, receiving more wind. But when the sea grew calm and we were perforce compelled to row, the barque came upon us quicker than I can describe, for every one on board her, I think, was at the oars, while she was a light boat and answered better to the rowers' efforts. </p>                        </div>

All our ship was moved at this news, and was filled with stormy tumult in calm weather. Everywhere was noise, lamenting, and running up and down. Some fled into the nether parts of the ship, some stood upon the hatches and exhorted one another to fight, some were of opinion that it was best to go into the cock-boat and escape: until, before they had determined anything, the present danger appeased their ado, since every man must needs by that time put on his harness. I and <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> hung about <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, who desired sore to fight, and could scarcely make him refrain. She said to him that she would not be parted from him by death, but that with the same sword and a like wound she would share his fortune. I for my part, when I perceived that it was Trachinus coming against us thought of something which might benefit us; which indeed took effect. For when the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> drew near and ran across our bows, they did not cast any darts at us, but by going round prevented our ship from advancing, trying if by any means they could get her into their hands without a battle and bloodshed: in brief they were like to people besieging a town and desired to take the ship on conditions of surrender. 'Why be you so mad, unhappy folk.' they cried; 'why attempt to stir against such invincible strength which far surmounteth yours, thereby purchasing your certain destruction? We will use you friendly, and now give you leave to take your cock-boat and save your lives if you wish.' These were the conditions they propounded. </p>                        </div>

I have followed you ever since you sailed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378209PZak class=place long=20.8921 lat=37.7872>Zacynthus</a> and for you only have I adventured these perils by sea.

But she — for she is a very prudent maid and well skilled to have regard to the occasion — harkening also somewhat to my advice, put away from her face all sad looks and forced herself to an alluring smile: 'I thank the gods,' quoth she, 'who have given you a heart to deal more gently with us than the rest. But if you indeed wish me to be of good comfort and to stay here do this for me as a token of your good will. Save this my brother and my father, and do not let them leave this ship. For if they be separated from me I shall not live.' Saying this she fell at his knees and held him fast with supplications. Trachinus was well pleased with her so holding, and of purpose deferred his promise. At length, moved by her tears to compassion, he was by her countenance forced to fulfil her wish, and lifting up the maid said this: 'I give this your brother to you with all my heart: for I see he is a young man of stout courage who may do us good service.

The sea also suddenly, changing by reason of the hour or else by the will of fortune, began to wax rough, and a man might hear a great noise of the winds arising. Soon a fierce storm swept down upon us, whose valiant blasts did much abash the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>, by reason that they had all left their own barque, and were busy in our vessel plundering the merchandise, and knew not how to manage the greatness of the ship. Wherefore each part was ordered unadvisedly and each man began to practise what he had never done before. Some in confusion hauled at the sails, others laid hand clumsily to the ropes; one ignorant fellow took the rudder, another, as wise as he, was in the foreship. The thing that brought us most into peril was not the tempest, which was not yet very great, but the unskilfulness of the ship master, who stood to it as long as there was a gleam of daylight, but when it was dark gave over his charge. As they were therefore now in danger of drowning and almost sunk, some of the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> wished to return to their own barque. But they were dissuaded therefrom both by the force of the tempest and by the counsel of Trachinus, who told them that they could get six hundred such little barques, if they kept possession of the merchant ship and all the riches therein. At last he cut the rope whereby it was fastened to us, saying it would bring them into another storm and that it was well to consider their safety in the future; for that it was a suspicious thing to arrive in any place with two ships, seeing it must needs be that inquiry should be made concerning those that sailed in the other one. He seemed to them to speak with reason, and one thing gave him credit in both; for after he had cut the barque adrift the tempest somewhat abated. Still they were not at all out of danger, but rather tossed without ceasing by mountainous waves, so that they lost many parts of the ship and faced every kind of peril. That night at last was spent, and about sunset on the next day we landed on the beach by that mouth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> which is called Heracleot, coming thus to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> by chance, unhappy creatures, and against our wills. The others indeed were glad but we were very sorrowful, reproaching the sea for our escape, inasmuch as it had grudged us a death free from insult and committed us to land and the dangers we must expect there, now subject utterly to the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>' lawless will. What their will would be we could easily guess by that which the villains took in hand before they were scarcely ashore. Pretending to make a thank-offering to <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a> they brought wine of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a> and many other such things out of the ship and sent some of their mates with a great deal of money to buy <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> from the borders adjoining, and charged them to pay whatever was asked at the first word. </p>                        </div>

But Trachinus took me aside, so that none might hear, and said: 'Father, I am determined to take thy daughter to wife and marry her today, and I purpose to join that pleasant solemnity with our sacrifice to the gods. Wherefore lest you should be anything sad in the feast, if you heard not of this before, and that you might tell your daughter hereof and cause her to be of a cheerful courage, I have thought it good to tell you my mind. Not that I need your consent — for I have absolute power to do what I list — but because I count it more lucky and seemly also if the bride more cheerfully prepare herself being admonished thereof first by her father.' I praised his opinion, and made as though I were glad, and gave thanks to the gods that they had appointed my master to be my daughter's husband. But after I had left him I began to think on what was to come, and went back to him again and besought him that what he was doing might be performed more solemnly, and that he would appoint the ship to be the maid's bridal chamber, and give command that no man might go in and trouble her, so that she might at her leisure provide that which was meet to furnish and set forth a bride. For it were ill ordered if she, who was of good stock and rich, and what was most important shall be Trachinus' wife, should not be made as handsome as might be, even though time and place did not give her leave to be very trim. Trachinus was very glad at this and with all his heart promised that it should be so; and therewith he gave charge that all such things as they should need should be carried out, and after that none should come near the ship. They did as he commanded them and brought out tables, cups, carpets, tapestries, works of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/336354PSid class=place long=35.371 lat=33.56>Sidon</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>, and other such things as were expedient for the furniture of a feast: these things were carried out from the ship upon their shoulders without respect or order, which diverse men with great travail and thrifty usage had gathered together: but now fortune had prepared them to serve their prodigal banquet. </p>                        </div>

He answered me no. 'Well,' said I, 'you may, if you go privily to the ship; for you know Trachinus hath given contrary commandment. You will see <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a> herself sitting there. But take care for the moment not to look over boldly upon her, lest you purchase death for you both.' He tarried not, but, as if he had some very earnest business, arose and went privily to the ship. When he saw <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> there wearing a crown of laurel on her head and glistering garments garnished with gold — for she had put on the holy apparel which she brought from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, to be a grace to her victory or a glory to her burial — and such other things about her as might beseem a marriage well, he was set on fire by the sight, as it was likely he would be, and desire and emulation pricked him forward. When he returned, it was evident by his countenance that he meant to do some mischievous thing, for ere he had well sat down he said: 'Why have I not the reward due to him who first boarded the enemy's ship?' 'Because you have not asked for it,' said Trachinus, 'and what we have gotten is not yet divided.' 'Then I will have the maid,' quoth he, 'who was taken prisoner.' To that Trachinus answered: 'Except her, you may take what you will.' But <a href=/people/1862 target=_blank>Pelorus</a> said: 'Then do you disannul and abrogate the law of <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>, which giveth him that first boardeth the enemy's ship and faceth the most dangerous part of the skirmish leave to choose whatever liketh him best.' 'I break not that law, good sir,' quoth Trachinus; 'I rely rather on that other which biddeth underlings give place to captains. For my part I love the maid wonderful well, and mean to take her for my wife. And I say plainly that it is reason that I come first, and if you do not as I bid, you shall repent it with a blow of this pot.' Then said <a href=/people/1862 target=_blank>Pelorus</a> to those that were by: 'You see what is the reward of our labours. So shall any of you hereafter be put beside your due, and make trial of this tyrant law.' Ah, what a sight was there then, <a href=/people/802 target=_blank>Nausicles</a>. You might have compared those men suddenly moved to the sea: so blind and foolish a quarrel drew them to so great a broil, being with wine and anger almost stark mad. Some took this man's part, some this; one sort would have the honour given to the captain, another said that the law and ordinance might not be broken. At length Trachinus bent himself to cast a pot at <a href=/people/1862 target=_blank>Pelorus</a>, but he prevented him — for he was provided before — and thrust a dagger through his breast, and there lay he wounded to death. Between the rest there was a cruel battle, for as they met they spared not themselves, some to revenge the captain, others to defend <a href=/people/1862 target=_blank>Pelorus</a> his right, shouting all together and striking and being stricken with bats, stones, pots, torches and tables. I for my part went a great way off, and from the top of a little hill looked upon them free from all danger. But <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> and <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, doing as we had agreed upon, took their share in the fray. He came with a sword and joining one side fought as though in frenzy: she, when she saw the battle begun, shot with her bow from the ship in such fashion that she never missed one and spared none but <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>. She did not shoot blindly into the fray but marked down the man she went to kill, herself unseen and easily espying her enemies in the firelight.

Now could <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>'s shooting do no more service, and though she was in travail to help, yet she feared some mischance, since the two were come to hand blows. But at length <a href=/people/1862 target=_blank>Pelorus</a> was no longer able to stand against him, for though <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> could not help in act, yet with words she comforted, crying out: 'Now, my heart, play the man.' Then, as though her voice had made him strong and bold and declared what was the prize of that battle, <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> did begin to prove himself the better. Though he was sore wounded, he plucked up heart and leapt near <a href=/people/1862 target=_blank>Pelorus</a>, and with his sword struck a full blow at his head. That indeed he missed, since the other avoided the blow a little, but grazing the tip of the shoulder he cut off his arm at the elbow-joint; and therewith he fled and <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> pursued. </p>                        </div>

Thou hast deprived me of my kinsfolk and my father's house; thou hast banished me from country, city, and all I love; thou hast brought me to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> — and to say nothing of my mishaps on the way — hast brought me into the hands of the herdsmen robbers. There thou gavest me a gleam of hope by acquainting me with men who though they were in misery were yet Greeks, with whom I thought to live all the rest of my life.

Shall I leave <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> who hath not yet found <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>? That is intolerable and may not be done. Shall I go with her to seek him? If we were sure to find him, it were well done to take pains in hope of a happy end; but if that which is to come be uncertain, and we hap to fall into greater sorrow, no man can tell where my travels will end. What if, craving pardon of you and the gods of friendship, I now at length make mention of returning to my country and my kin? By the providence of the gods, as I think, a good occasion thereto hath now been offered, seeing that <a href=/people/802 target=_blank>Nausicles</a> says that he intends to sail to Greece, lest if my father die in mine absence our house be left without an heir. For though I shall live in penury, yet that there should be left some of our stock by me is a thing very honourable and in itself sufficient. But, <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, I would be excused to you especially, and I crave pardon at your hand, and pray you to show me this much favour: let me go with you to Bessa and I will beg <a href=/people/802 target=_blank>Nausicles</a> to tarry for me a little while, although he be in haste. Let me deliver you there to <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, and be counted one that has well guarded what was entrusted to him, leaving you, seeing we part so well, with better hopes myself to speed well afterwards.

And therewithal he gave him his hand, and <a href=/people/802 target=_blank>Nausicles</a> affianced and delivered his daughter to him, and commanding the marriage song to be sung by the homefolk began to dance first himself, making a sudden marriage of the banquet there prepared. </p>                        </div>

Let us sing to him with tears and dance with lamentations. Let the torch be cast to earth and the darkness resound, and let murky night rule the play. What a nuptial bower hath he made for me!

Alas for me! <a href=/people/372 target=_blank>Cnemon</a> is married, but <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> is roaming abroad, a prisoner perhaps and even held in chains.

She was abashed at the sudden call, and came as she was attired and unbolted the door to let the old man in. Seeing her hair disordered and her garments torn about her breasts and her eyes full of water, he understood the cause; and when he had brought her to her bed again, and caused her to attire herself, and cast a cloak upon her, he said: 'For shame, <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, what array is this? Why do you vex yourself so sore without ceasing? Why yield you to trouble without reason? Surely now I know you not, whom till now I ever knew to be of excellent courage and very modest. Will you not leave off from this wonderful madness? Will you not remember that you are born mortal; that is to say, an unsteady thing bending sundry ways on every light occasion? Have pity on us, my daughter, have pity: if not for your own sake, yet because of <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, who desireth to live with none but you, and accounteth it his greatest advantage that you are alive.' <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> blushed when she heard him speak thus; the more so thinking how she had been taken; and after she had held her peace a great while, and <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a> desired her to give him some answer, she said: 'Father, you have good cause to chide, but perhaps I deserve pardon. It is not any common or violent desire that hath forced me, unhappy creature, to do this, but the pure and chaste love that I bear to a man — although he has never touched me — and that is <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, who now maketh me sad, because he is not here with me, and even more afraid, in that I do not know if he is alive or not.' 'As touching that,' said <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>, 'be of good cheer. You may think that he is alive and by God's favour will one day be joined to you; since we must give credit to what the oracle foretold to us, and believe also him who told us yesterday that as he was being carried to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a> he was taken prisoner by <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>. If he was thus taken without doubt he is well; for there has been acquaintance and familiarity betwixt them before. Wherefore we ought not to delay but go to Bessa, and seek there, you for <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, and I besides for my son: for you have heard ere now that <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> is my son.' Then was <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> in great thought and said: 'If <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> indeed be your son, then are we in worse case than ever we were.' <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a> marvelled hereat and asked her why. 'You know,' quoth she, 'how I became prisoner to the herdsmen, where the unhappy beauty with which I am endowed forced <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> to love me. It is to be feared lest if he find us as we make inquiry and see me, remembering that I am she who dallied and drave off with divers deceitful promises the marriage which he meant to make with me, that he will take me and by force compel me to finish the same.' 'God forbid,' said <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>, 'that the vehemence of his lust should be such that he would disdain his father's countenance and not repress his licentious desire, if any such move him. But for all that, why cannot you invent some device to elude that which you so dread? You are very crafty, it seems, and skilful to make shifts, and delays against them that seek to have you.' <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> was somewhat merry at these words and answered: 'Whether you say this in earnest or in jest, let it pass for this time. But I will tell you the way that <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> and I devised, although fortune would not let us put it into practise, and I hope this time we may be more lucky. When we planned to escape from the herdsmen's island, we decided to change our apparel, and wander about in the villages and towns like ragged and dirty beggars. Wherefore if it please you, let us counterfeit this dress and play the beggar; for then we shall not be so much in danger from those we meet. To beggars poverty brings safety and it is commonly a cause for pity rather than envy. Moreover thus we shall get our daily sustenance more easily; for all things are more dearly sold to strangers who have need to buy and know not the manner of the country; but they will be freely given to such as beg.' </p>                        </div>

As touching the battle she told them thus: 'There was a strange young man, of goodly stature and of excellent beauty, carried to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a> to <a href=/people/985 target=_blank>Oroondates</a> the great king's deputy, a prisoner sent, they said, as a great present from <a href=/people/2008 target=_blank>Mitranes</a> the captain of the watch. Our men, who dwell in this village' — showing them a village hard by — 'came out and took the young man away, saying, whether in truth or for a pretext, that they were acquainted with him. When <a href=/people/2008 target=_blank>Mitranes</a> heard of this, being angry — and good cause why — he led his army hither two days ago. Now the people of this village are very warlike, and live ever by plunder, and set not a straw by death, and have taken therefore from me, as well as from other women at other times our husbands and our children. So, when they knew certainly of his coming, they placed their ambushment in places convenient for this purpose, and when their enemies came among them they easily subdued them, some attacking in front and others from the ambush, with clamour setting on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>' backs. <a href=/people/2008 target=_blank>Mitranes</a> was slain as he fought with the foremost, and the greater part of his men with him, for being inclosed they had no way to flee; and a few of our people were killed also. Of whom by the wrath of God, my son was one, who had a wound in his breast with a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> dart, as you see. For him thus slain do I, unhappy creature, sorrow; and shall I fear do the like hereafter for him who is still alive, because yesterday he went with the rest against the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>.' <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a> asked her why they took upon them that expedition. The old woman answered that she had heard her son who was still alive say that they knew that they were now in no small peril but rather in danger of all they had, since they had slain the king's soldiers and the captain of his host. Prince <a href=/people/985 target=_blank>Oroondates</a> had a great company of men with him at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>, and as soon as he heard thereof, would come and compass the village about, and revenge this injury by the destruction of all the inhabitants. Therefore they determined, seeing their danger, to redeem their great attempt with one still greater, if they could, and to anticipate <a href=/people/985 target=_blank>Oroondates</a>' attack; thinking that if they came on a sudden, either they would kill him in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>, or if he were not there, being busied, as report goes, with the Ethiopian war, they would the sooner force the city to yield, as being void of defenders. Thus they themselves would be safe afterwards, and moreover would do their captain <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> service by recovering the office of the priesthood which his younger brother by unjust violence withholdeth from him. And if all their hopes failed, then were they determined valiantly to die and not to come into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>' hands to be scorned and tormented by them. 'But,' quoth she, 'strangers, whither go ye?' 'To the village,' said <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>. 'It is not safe,' said she, 'to mingle with those of us that are left, seeing that you are not known and come at this unseasonable hour.' 'If you will vouchsafe to entertain us,' said <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>, 'we hope we shall be unharmed.' 'I cannot now,' she answered, 'for I must do certain night sacrifices. But if you can wait — and indeed there is no remedy; you must, whether you will or not — get you into some place away from these dead bodies to pass the night, and in the morning I promise I will entertain you and be your warrant.' </p>                        </div>

And having gone a little past those bodies, they chanced upon a little hill. There he laid him down with her quiver under his head, and <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> sat upon her scrip instead of a stool. The moon had just risen, lightening all things with her brightness, for she was now three days past the full; and <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>, being an old man and weary with his travels, fell fast asleep. But <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, by reason of the cares that troubled her, slept not that night but beheld a wicked and abominable play, such as the women of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> do commonly perform. The old woman thinking she had now gotten a time wherein she would neither be seen nor troubled of any, first digged a trench, then made a fire on both sides thereof, and in the midst laid her son's body. Then taking an earthen pot from a three-footed stool which stood thereby she poured honey into the trench; out of another pot she poured milk, and from the third a libation of wine. Lastly she cast into the trench a lump of dough hardened in the fire, which was made like a man and crowned with a garland of laurel and fennel. This done, she took up a sword which lay among the dead men's shields, and behaving herself as if she had been in a Bacchic frenzy, said many prayers to the moon in strange outlandish terms. Then she cut her arm and with a branch of laurel besprinkled the fire with her blood; and after doing many monstrous and strange things beside these, at length bowing down to her dead son's body and saying somewhat in his ear, she awakened him, and by force of her witchcraft made him suddenly to stand. <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, who hitherto had been looking not without fear, trembled with horror and was utterly discomforted by that wonderful sight, so that she awaked <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a> and caused him also the behold the spectacle. They could not be seen in their dark corner, but they saw easily what she did by the light of the fire, and heard also what she said, for they were not very far off, and the old woman spake very loud to the body. Her question was this: 'Would his brother, her son who was yet alive, return safe or no?' The body made no answer, but by nodding gave his mother a doubtful hope of success according to her wish, and then fell down upon its face again. But she turned it over on its back and ceased not to ask that question, with more earnest enforcements, it seemed, speaking in his ear. Sometimes she leapt, sword in hand, to the trench, sometimes to the fire, and at length she made the body stand upright again and asked the same question, compelling him to answer not by nods and becks but plainly by word of mouth. While this was doing, <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> begged <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a> earnestly that they might go near and ask the old woman some tidings of <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>. But he would not go, saying that the sight was wicked although they were compelled to endure it. It was not becoming for priests either to take delight or be present when such things were doing. Their prescience came from lawful sacrifice and virtuous prayer; the knowledge of sorcerers from traffic with dead bodies in the ground, such as this chance had allowed them to see the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> woman use. </p>                        </div>

For even dead men, in so far as they may, have reverence towards their parents.

As thou hast spent thy life in such wicked deeds as these, thou shalt soon meet the violent death that is appointed for all such. Thou hast endured not only to do these secret and hidden mysteries alone, but in the sight of others also, betraying to them the fortunes of the dead.

As he was doing sacrifice publicly on his first entry into the temple of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>, <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>, seeing him to be a proper young man and of good age — for he was the handsomest man in that company and the best attired — cast many wanton looks and dishonest countenances at him. Which <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> regarded no whit, for he was both by nature very honest and well instructed from a child: and perhaps he did not even suspect the purpose of her play, or thought that she did it for some other reason, because he was altogether intent upon his sacrifices. But his brother <a href=/people/2340 target=_blank>Petosiris</a>, who before had envied his brother the priesthood and had now well marked <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>'s allurements, took her unlawful enticements as a good occasion to endamage his brother.

It was therefore best first to go to the walls and see all their ordinances, and then provide such things as are possible and convenient. They thought she said well and went every man to the walls.

As for <a href=/people/2340 target=_blank>Petosiris</a>, he was thrust out of the gates by violence to do that which was commanded, although he used many prayers to entreat that he might not fight, and took his weapons in hand sore against his will. When <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> saw him he said: 'Do you not see, good <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, how <a href=/people/2340 target=_blank>Petosiris</a> quaketh for fear?' 'I see it well,' answered he; 'but how will you do this which you have taken in hand? He is not a plain enemy, but your own brother, that you must fight.' 'You say well,' quoth he, 'and as I myself thought. By the grace of God I mean to overcome him and not to kill him.

'You speak like a noble man,' said <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, 'and one that well understandeth the force of nature; but what will you have me do to help you?' He answered: 'As to this battle, it may be despised.

But <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> went against <a href=/people/2340 target=_blank>Petosiris</a>; who did not wait to strike one blow, but as soon as he saw him come turned to the gates and would have gone into the city again. But he lost his labour; for those who kept the gates would not let him in, and they who were on every part of the wall whereto he drew exhorted one another not to help him. He therefore cast away his weapons and fled as fast as he could about the city. <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> also ran, being both anxious for <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> and impatient to see all that was done. Marry he was not armed, lest men should think he meant to help <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>, but laid his shield and his spear at that side of the wall where <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> sat, giving her leave to look upon them in his absence, and then followed them. <a href=/people/2340 target=_blank>Petosiris</a> was neither quite caught nor yet very far in front, but always near to being overtaken, just so much ahead as would expect an unarmed man to outrun one in armour.

Then it was that some god, or else that fortune which doth govern human affairs, by a new scene augmented the play, and as though in rivalry introduced the beginning of another tragedy, bringing <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a> on that very day and hour, as it were from the machine, to be a sharer in that race and an unhappy witness of his sons' deadly strife. Although he had suffered much and tried every device, imposing upon himself exile and wanderings in strange lands, if at all he might escape that cruel sight, yet now overcome by destiny he was compelled to behold that whereof the gods by oracle gave him warning before. For seeing the pursuit afar off he knew by the past warnings that they were his children; wherefore he started running faster than his age permitted him, forcing his strength that he might come before the end of the battle. </p>                        </div>

Why are you so mad?' But they knew not their father, since he was still in his beggar's weeds, while their minds were set on the race, and went by him, supposing that he was a vagrant or one that was out of his wits. Of those that were on the walls some were amazed that he spared not himself but ran ever upon armed men, others laughed him to scorn as though he were mad. But the old man, seeing that he was not recognised by reason of his vile apparel, cast off the rags that were upon him, and let his hair fall unbound, and flinging away the burden on his shoulders and the staff in his hand, stood before them face to face, a reverend and a priest-like man. Then bending down and stretching forth his hands in suppliant fashion he cried out with tears: 'My sons, behold, I am <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>, your father. Make an end here, and refrain the rage which ill hap hath raised betwixt you, inasmuch as you have a father now and owe obedience to him.' Then they began to quail, and failing at their father's knees embraced him, looking at him with careful eyes that they might be sure it was he indeed. And when they perceived it was himself and no vision, there arose diverse, yea and contrary, thoughts in their minds. They were glad of their father, who contrary to their expectations was alive; but they were angry and sore ashamed of the case he found them in, and they were in doubt also of that which after should befall. And while the people of the city marvelled and neither said nor did anything but stood in a manner like dumb pictures, because they knew not what it meant, another act was interlaced into the play. <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, as she followed <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>, espied <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> afar off — for a lover's eye is quick of sight, so that oftentimes, though it be a great way off, it will judge a likeness by a movement or a gesture — and as if she had been stricken mad by the sight ran to him like one distraught, and hanging by her arms about his neck said nothing, but greeted him with tears and lamentations. He seeing her foul face, of purpose beblacked, and her apparel vile and all torn, supposing her belike to be one of the makeshifts of the city and a vagabond, cast her off and put her away, and at length, when she would not let him go, gave her a blow on the ear, for that she troubled him in seeing <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>. Then spake she to him softly: '<a href=/people/4284 target=_blank>Pythius</a>, have you quite forgotten the torch?' <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> was stricken by that word, as if he had been pierced with a dart, knowing that the torch was one of the tokens agreed on between them, and looking steadfastly upon her was enlightened by the beams from her eyes, as by the sun appearing through the clouds, and clasped her close within his arms. To be short, all the multitude on the wall, where <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> sat sore swollen and jealously looking upon <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, had their fill of such wondrous doings as commonly are but seen upon the stage. A wicked battle between two brothers was ended, and that which men thought would be finished with blood had of a tragical beginning a comical ending. A father saw his sons in armour one against the other come to that point that almost before his eyes he saw his children's death, and then made himself their love day and peace, not being able to escape the necessity of fate, but happy in that he came in due time to that which was determined before. Sons after ten years absence recovered their father, who had been the cause to them of bloody strife for his priesthood, and now adorning him with the emblems of that holy office escorted him home. But above all, <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> and <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, who played the lovers' parts in this comedy, were most talked of; and since they had found each other contrary to their hope they made the city to look upon them more than all the other sights that were then to be seen. For great companies of every age came out at the gates into the open fields, and such as were youthful and newly come to man's estate drew near to <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>. Those that were of riper years, grown men indeed, approached <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>, since they by reason of their age knew him well. The maidenly sort, who now thought upon husbands, flocked about <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>; while the old men and such as were of the holier kind surrounded <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>.

Nor was <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> behind, but with her train followed in brave wise and offered great chains of gold in <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>' temple, under pretence to do as others did in the city, but in truth her eyes were always upon <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, and she looked more on him than on any other.

But <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>, after he came to the inner part of the temple, fell upon his face, and held the feet of the god's image fast and lay there so long that he was almost dead; indeed he had much ado to arise when they who stood by called upon him. And when he had poured libations to the gods and made his prayers, taking the crown of priesthood from his own head he crowned therewith his son <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>, telling the people that he was old and saw that he should not live long, and that his eldest son by the law ought to succeed him, and that he had all things requisite, both in body and mind, to perform his holy duties. After the people by a great shout had declared that they approved what he did, he went himself to a certain part of the temple which is appointed for the priests, and remained there with his sons and <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> quietly; while all the other people went every man to his own house. </p>                        </div>

As soon as she came into the palace she went straight to her bed, and cast herself thereon, attired as she was, without speaking a word, being a woman otherwise very lasciviously bent, but then especially inflamed when she had seen <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>' excellent beauty, which far surpassed all that ever she had seen before. So lay she all that night, tossing her body from one side to another and lamenting sore. Sometimes she would rise up, sometimes lean upon her elbow, sometimes cast her clothes almost all from her.

The battle which this day was like to be fought before the walls, to all other folk was bloodless and concluded in peace. But to me it is the beginning of a worse fray, whereby I am like to lose, not one limb or member, but my wit and senses, because it shewed to me for my misfortune the young stranger who, when the two brothers fought, ran by <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>' side. You know well enough, mother, of whom I speak. There is no small difference between the brightness of his beauty and other men's, so that even a rustic who had never been enamoured of fairness would perceive it, and much more your manifold experience. Therefore, dear mother, seeing that now you know my grief, it is time for you to put in practice all manner of means and old women's tricks and flatterings, if you wish your nurseling to live; for there is no other way to keep me alive but to enjoy him.' 'I know the young man well,' said the old woman; 'he was broad breasted and large between the shoulders, straight necked and comely, taller than the rest; to make an end with one word, he far surpassed all other men. His eyes were a little fiery, so that he looked very lovingly and yet courageously also, his hair was smooth combed, and he had a little young yellow beard. To him a stranger woman, marry not uncomely but passing impudent, methought, ran suddenly and cast her arms about him and held him fast and would not go away. Do you not mean this man, mistress?' 'Yes, even this one, mother,' answered she; 'and you have done very well to remind me of that common impudent harlot with her painted beauty whereof she is so proud. Yet surely she is much more happy than I, seeing that she has gotten such a lover.' The old woman smiled a little at this and said: 'Mistress, take a good heart and be no longer sorrowful. The stranger counteth her beautiful for this day; but if I can bring it to pass that he have the fruition of you and your beauty, he will soon change gold for brass, as the proverb is, and set naught by the harlot who now maketh so much of herself.' 'If you do this, my dear <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>,' quoth she, 'you will heal at once in me two wounds, jealousy and love; delivering me from the one and satisfying me with the other.'

She came to the door and said that she must do sacrifice for her mistress <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>, who was troubled this night with certain dreams and wished to appease the goddess. But the verger would not let her in, but sent her away, telling her that the temple place was full of sorrow. '<a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a> the priest,' said he, 'after he came home from his long journey made a sumptuous feast in the evening with his children, and surrendered himself to mirth and merriment. When the banquet was done, he poured libations and prayed to the goddess, and after telling his sons that for this night at least they would see their father, and giving them charge concerning two young Greeks that came with him, that they should do what they were able for them, went to bed. Then either in the excess of his joy the passages of his breath became too relaxed and open, since his body was enfeebled by age; or else it was that the gods granted him that which he craved; but about cock-crow he was found dead, his sons by reason of his warning having watched near him all the night. So now we have sent for all the priestly crew in the city, to do his death rites according to the manner of our country. Wherefore you must now depart: for it is not lawful for any man, except he be a priest, to enter into the temple or to offer sacrifice for seven days.' 'How will the strangers then pass this time?' said <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>. 'The new priest <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>,' quoth he, 'hath commanded a house to be prepared for them outside the temple. You may see them now approaching, and in accordance with his order going out of the temple for this time.' <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>, taking this for a good occasion to get them away and make it the beginning of her policy, said: 'Most excellent verger, you may do both the strangers and us a good turn, and especially <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> the great king's sister; for you know how great favour she beareth to Greeks, and how courteously she entertaineth strangers. Tell the young folk that by <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>' command their lodging is prepared in our palace.' The verger did so, suspecting nothing of <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>'s deep designs but thinking that he would do the strangers a great pleasure, if by his means they procured their lodging in the prince's court, and also render those who asked it of him a good turn, without harm or detriment to any man. So coming to <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> and <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, who were very sorrowful and wept bitterly, he said: 'You are not doing as the laws and customs of our country enjoin, and that too although you had commandment that you should not mourn. You weep and wail for a priest, at whose departure hence our sacred doctrine biddeth you rather to be glad and rejoice, as one who hath gained a better estate and a quieter rest. You deserve pardon indeed, for you have lost, as you say, a father and a patron and one on whom all your hopes depended. Yet ought you not altogether to despair. <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>, it seems hath succeeded his father not only in the office of priesthood but in good will toward you, and hath given special charge for your welfare.

Yet for all that they followed <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a> who comforted them in many ways and bade them be of good cheer, calling them her children and her dearlings, and promised that they should have excellent good luck. At length, when she had brought them to her parlour, which was far from the noise of the court, sitting by them alone without more company, she said: 'My children, I know the cause of the grief and sorrow wherein you be now, namely the death of the priest <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a> who was to you in place of a father. Marry, tell me now also who you be and whence you come. That you are Greeks I understand, and by what I see I may guess that you are of good parentage; for a comely countenance and so elegant a beauty is a manifest token of high blood. I pray you, tell me of what country in Greece and city you be, and how you happened to travel hither. I desire to hear the same, both for your own advantage and that I may certify my mistress <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> thereof also, who is sister of the great king and wife of <a href=/people/985 target=_blank>Oroondates</a> chief governor, a lover of Greeks and all handsomeness, and very liberal to strangers, to the intent that you may come into her sight in such honourable fashion as your estate shall require. You will tell your story to a woman who is not altogether alien to you; for I myself am a Greek, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=demonym long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbian</a> by birth, brought hither captive, and yet more fortunate here than in mine own country. I serve my mistress in all matters, so that without me she does nothing, save breathe and live: I am her mind, I am her ears; to be short, I am all: I bring to her acquaintance good and honest men and I keep all her secrets.' <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> comparing that which <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a> said with that which <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> did the day before, and thinking how wantonly with fixed looks continually she beheld him so that her nods and becks declared scarce a chaste mind, gathered that small good would ensue to them from all this.

After we had been robbed of all our great riches, scarce escaping with our lives, by the good-will of God we met with the noble <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>, and came with him hither, in mind to pass the rest of our life here. But now we are, as you see, forsaken of all men and left quite alone, and have together with our other parents lost him, who seemed and was indeed a father to us. Such then is our estate. As for the courteous and gentle entertainment we have at your hand, we give you very hearty thanks, and you will do us even more pleasure if you procure us a dwelling apart from other company, deferring the courtesy whereof you talked, that is to acquaint us with <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>, nor bringing into her high fortunes our strange, banished restless life. For you know well that friendship and acquaintance ought to be between such as are of one condition.' When he had said thus, <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a> could not rule herself, but gave manifest tokens by the cheerfulness of her countenance that she was very glad to hear the words 'brother and sister,' thinking that <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> would surely be no impediment to <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>'s disports. 'O beautiful young man,' quoth she, 'you will not say this of <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>, when you have tried her fashions; she is conformable to all fortune and is ever ready to help those who are in undeserved mishaps. Though she be a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, yet in her nature she imitateth the Greeks, much rejoicing in those that come from thence, and is wonderfully delighted with their company and manners. Wherefore be you both of good cheer: you shall be adorned with all honour that may happen to a man, and your sister shall be of her familiar and near acquaintance. But what are your names that I must tell her?' After she had heard them say '<a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> and <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>' she bade them tarry there awhile and ran off herself to <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>, bidding the door-keeper — who was also an old woman — to let no man come in nor suffer the young folks to go any whither abroad. 'Not even if your son <a href=/people/942 target=_blank>Achaemenes</a> come?' asked the door-keeper; 'for he went out a little while after you were gone to the temple, to dress his eye which is yet somewhat sore.' 'No,' quoth <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>, 'open not, even for him. Lock the door and keeping the key with you say I have taken it away.'

She cried oft, 'O <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>'; 'O <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>,' oft said he. 'What fortune have we!' quoth he; 'In what case are we!' said she. And at every word they embraced each other; and when they had wept a while, they fell to kissing again. Last of all, when they thought of <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>, they bewailed him with tears; and especially <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, because for a longer time she had known his love and goodwill toward her. Wherefore with tears she cried out, 'O good <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a>; for I may not call him by the best of all names, 'father,' inasmuch as God hath every way cut me off therefrom. I know not the father who begot me. <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a>, who made me his child by adoption, alas! I have betrayed.

But surely, my nurse and saviour — yea and I will call thee father too though god refuse — here and now, where I may and as I may, I offer thee libations of my tears and do thee the death rights with my locks.' And therewith she pulled out a great handful of her hair. <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> tried to appease her and held her hands softly, but she lamented nevertheless saying: 'To what end shall we live any longer! To what hope may we look! He who conducted us through strange lands, the stay of our error, our guide to our country, the knowledge of our parents, our comfort in adversity, the case of our ill fortune, the anchor of all our affairs, <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a> is dead, and hath left us two, a miserable pair in a strange land, not knowing what is best to do. Now every journey by land, every voyage by water is by ignorance debarred us.

When he was told it was his mother's deed, he came near the door, and considering the cause thereof in his mind he heard <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> lament; then stooping down he looked through the openings, whereby the fastening of the bolts are opened, and saw all that was being done within. He asked the door-keeper again who these were; but she answered that she knew no more than that they were two strangers, a man and maid belike, whom his mother brought in a while ago. He kneeled down again to see if he might more plainly view them, and although he had never known <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> before he marvelled at her excellent beauty, and considered what a manner of one she would be if she were not in such sorrow and heaviness; and with this wondering he privily fell in love with her.

With many such words as these she set <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> on fire, so that she could scarce restrain her, in such haste was she to behold him. But yet she caused her to be content for a while, saying she would not have him see her while her eyes were swollen for lack of sleep, but a day after, when she had recovered her old beauty again. Thus she made her merry and full of hope that she would have her heart's desire, and took order with her what was best to do and how she should entertain the strangers. </p>                        </div>

And as he went, he said thus to himself: 'Is not this he whom <a href=/people/2008 target=_blank>Mitranes</a>, captain of the watch, delivered to me to be carried to <a href=/people/985 target=_blank>Oroondates</a>, and from him to be sent to the great king, that one whom the people of Bessa took from me, at what time I was in mortal danger, so that I almost alone of all that carried him escaped with my life?

'Our lady,' said they, 'sends you this as a first entertainment for honour's sake' — and setting down the dishes they straightway departed. The young folk at <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>'s bidding tasted a little of that which was set before them, lest they should seem to be scornful thereof; and this was done every evening for the days that followed.

As though he had quite forgotten that whereof he talked with <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, as touching worship and reverence, he neither bowed his knee nor fell down before her, but holding up his head aloft said: '<a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> of royal blood, God save thee.'

She praised too her manners, for that they were amiable and nothing coy and that she had great delight in fine and stalwart young men; the drift of all her talk being to see if he had any pleasure in the sports of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>. <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> commended the good will that she bare to the Greeks, and her friendly fashions, and whatever else of that sort she talked about, and further for the same gave hearty thanks. But he passed over that which contained any dishonest thing, as though he understood it not at all. Wherefore the old woman was sore grieved and nipped at the heart; for she thought he understood what she meant, but utterly despised and set at naught all her planning. She knew moreover that <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> would abide no longer, but began even now to be angry and tell her plainly she could no longer contain herself: wherefore she craved the performance of her promise, which <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a> had deferred by divers delays, sometimes saying that the young man would but was afraid, sometimes that one or other mischance fell in the way. </p>                        </div>

'For shame,' she cried, 'what lingering is this and refusal of love! How can so fair a young man of good age refuse to lie with a woman like himself that dieth for him, and doth not rather account it an advantage to have to do with her. Especially when he need fear nothing, seeing that her husband is out of the way, and I who brought her up and keep her secrets provide the opportunity. You have neither spouse nor wife to hinder you; although that is a thing which many men of sense have disregarded, knowing they would do no harm at home and would do themselves good by gaining great riches, and counting also the fruit of this pleasure a great reward.' At last she began to interlace threats with her talk, saying, 'Gentlewomen and such as long for men will not be appeased, but conceive great displeasure when they are cruelly deceived, and punish the stubborn as if they had done them great wrong, and that not without cause. Consider: she is a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> of the blood royal, as you confessed, and of great power and authority, so that she may honour whom she will, and punish such as withstand her pleasure, without controlment; you are a stranger, alone without any to help you. Wherefore spare yourself and her. She is worthy of your regard, who is so furiously inflamed with your love which she of right ought to enjoy. Take care for the wrath which proceedeth from love, and beware of the revenge which followeth contempt: I have known many men who have repented afterward of such a stomach as this. I have greater experience in these venerious affairs than you: this white head that you see hath been at many such contests, but I never knew any so violent and implacable as you.' Then turning to <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> — for necessity made her bold to speak thereof in her presence — she said: 'My daughter, help me to persuade this thy brother, whom I know not how to term. This will be for your profit also. You will not be loved a whit the less; you will receive the more honour; you will have riches in plenty; and she will provide you with a splendid marriage: which things are to be desired even by those who are in happy estate, much more by strangers and such as are now plainly in great distress.' </p>                        </div>

But seeing that such a human chance hath happened unto her and she is overcome as you say, I would counsel <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> myself not to refuse the act, if he may do it without danger.

When she heard this <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a> leapt for joy and embracing and kissing <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> said: 'My daughter, thou dost very well to have pity upon a woman like thyself and to seek thy brother's safety. Thou needest have no fear as to this matter: not even the sun, as the proverb is, shall know thereof.' 'Let me alone now,' said <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, 'and give me time to consider.' Thereupon <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a> went out; and as soon as she was gone <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> said thus: '<a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, even such good fortune as God sends us contains within it more adversity than felicity. Yet it is the part of wise men to turn their ill haps, as much as they may, to better issues. Whether you be in mind to do this deed or not I cannot tell; although I would not be greatly against it, if there were no other way to preserve us. But if — as you should do — you deem it a filthy act which is asked of you, then feign only to consent, and with fair words feeding the barbarous woman's desire soothe her hope, and by promises allay her hot passion, cutting her short by delays, lest in her rage she put some cruel device in practise against us. By the grace of God it is likely that time will provide a remedy for all this: but in any case, <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, beware lest you slip from thought into the filthiness of the act itself.' <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> smiled hereat a little and said: 'I perceive that even in trouble you are not without jealousy, which is woman's natural disease, But be sure that I cannot feign any such thing; to say and to do unhonest things are both alike dishonest. Furthermore, that <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> should give up hope bringeth another advantage with it; she will cease to trouble us any more. While, if I must suffer, fortune and my own mind have inured me now to bear whatever betides.'

Then she took him by the hand, and led him aside into a part of the orchard, said: 'I would never have declared mine own and my lady's troubles to any other man. But seeing that she is danger and I in peril of my life — for I know that <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>'s madness will fall into my neck — I am constrained to tell you, if haply you can help her who conceived and bare you into the world, and nourished you with these breasts. Our mistress doth love the young man who is in our house, not with tolerable or usual love, but so that she is almost mad therewith. Both she and I hoped that we should speed well, but we have lost our labour. Hence came all these courtesies toward the strangers and our manifold goodwill. But now, since the young man, like a fool and cruel fellow who will not be ruled, hath refused to do as we would have him, I think she will not live, while I shall be slain as having beguiled and cheated her with promises. In this case are we now. If thou canst help me with anything, do it; if not, when thy mother is dead, see that her death rites are duly performed.' 'What reward shall I have, mother?' said he. 'This is no time to boast myself, or with long circumstances to promise you help, seeing you be in such and so desperate a case.' 'Look for whatever reward you wish,' said <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>. 'She hath made you her chief cup bearer for my sake already, and if you have any higher office in mind, tell me. As for the riches you shall have in recompense, if you save her, unhappy creature, of them there shall be no counting.' 'Mother,' quoth he, 'I perceived as much a good while ago, but I said nothing and looked ever for what would come of it. I care for no honour, nor regard any riches: but if she will give me the maid who is called <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>' sister to wife, then she shall have her heart's desire. I loved the maid beyond all measure, mother. Wherefore, since our mistress knoweth by her own case what and how great a grief love is, she hath good reason to help him who is sick of that same disease, seeing also that he promises her such good fortune.' 'Have no doubt,' said <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>. 'Our mistress will requite you without delay, when you have done thus much for her and saved her in such distress. Besides perhaps we may persuade the maid ourselves without troubling her. But tell me how you will help.' 'I will not tell you,' said he, 'until I have a promise confirmed by our lady's oath.

At this <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> recovered some hope, and made no delay but came out of her chamber, and sitting in the seat where she was wont to hear and give judgment, she commanded <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> to be brought before her. As soon as he came she asked him if he knew <a href=/people/942 target=_blank>Achaemenes</a>, who stood near. He said yea. 'Were you not once his prisoner?' quoth she. <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> confessed that he was. 'Then are you my bondman,' said she, 'and shall do as my slaves, being ruled by my will whether you wish it or not.

'Let him be put among the waiters at our table,' quoth <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>, 'and learn from <a href=/people/942 target=_blank>Achaemenes</a> to pour out the wine, so that he may be inured beforehand to serve at the king's board.' </p>                        </div>

'<a href=/people/942 target=_blank>Achaemenes</a>' wedding.' said he, 'is defeated and a delay found for <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>'s lust. But chief of all, <a href=/people/942 target=_blank>Achaemenes</a> now will set all on a broil, being offended in that he is beguiled of what he hoped for, and also because he sees me in better favour with <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> than himself. He will know all this from his mother, since I provided that she should be there to hear what I said, wishing her to tell <a href=/people/942 target=_blank>Achaemenes</a> this, and also to be a witness of the familiarity which in words only passed between us. For although it is enough to have a clear conscience before God, yet it is well for a man in freedom so to lead his life — which lasteth here but a little while — that others also have good opinion of him. Moreover we may expect that <a href=/people/942 target=_blank>Achaemenes</a> will revenge himself on <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>, being a slave born — for almost always that which is under obedience is opposed to that which hath authority over it — and beside he has been wronged, and beguiled of an oath, and sees another now preferred above himself.

For that purpose she sent him costly apparel, a chain, bracelets of gold, and other rich jewels, part whereof willingly, part against his will, he put on. When <a href=/people/942 target=_blank>Achaemenes</a> began to teach him how he should serve her cup, he ran to a table nearby whereon stood much plate, and taking a precious goblet in his hand said: 'I need no teaching, but will of my own head serve my mistress: I make no ado of matter so easy as this. Your fortune, my good friend, hath forced such knowledge upon you; but nature and occasion can teach me what I have to do.' Then he poured in wine softly, and holding the cup finely with the tips of his fingers and going with a seemly and fit pace, delivered it to <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>. This draught set her on fire more than she was before; for drinking and looking upon <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> at the same time she supped more of his love than of the wine. Nor did she drink the goblet quite off, but on purpose by craft left a little to drink to <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>. On the other side <a href=/people/942 target=_blank>Achaemenes</a> was sore vexed and filled both with anger and jealousy, so that <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> saw him looking scornfully and whispering somewhat to those who stood by. When dinner was done, <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> said: 'Mistress, I pray you grant me this my first request, let none but me wear this dress and serve at your table.' <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> consented; but as he went out wearing the accustomed garb <a href=/people/942 target=_blank>Achaemenes</a> came out also, and reproached him for his forwardness, and told him that such rash ways were very childish, and that their mistress only winked at them because he was a stranger and without experience: 'If you continue to be so wanton,' said he, 'you will suffer for it. And this I tell you as a friend, and one who will soon be your kinsman; for your mistress has promised that I shall marry your sister.' Much more like this he said; but <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, with his eyes upon the ground, passed by him as though he heard him not, until <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a> came upon them, hastening to put her mistress to bed for the afternoon. Seeing her son looking gloomy she asked what he ailed. 'This strange younker,' he said, 'has been honoured before me both yesterday and today, slipping in and gaining the office of cup bearer. He has given us, her chief servitors, the go by, and standing near her royal person hands the cup, so that our honour, which is now but an honour in name, is utterly despised. It were ill enough that he should be preferred to us and admitted to greater and more secret privities, while we to our own hurt keep silence and aid him, but it would not be so grievous if he did not vent his insolence on us who serve with him and help him in his fine doings. But of that we will talk another time. For the moment mother, I would fain see my betrothed wife, my sweetest <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, if that by looking upon her I may somewhat abate the grief of my mind.' 'What wife, son?' quoth <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>; 'You seem to chafe at trifles and know not the greater matters. You are not to marry <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> now.' 'What say you mother,' cried he, am I not worthy to marry her, who is my fellow-servant? Why so, I pray you.' 'Because of our good will and unlawful service to <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>,' answered she. 'For though we set more by her than our own ease, and preferred her desire to our lives, doing all we could to pleasure her, yet as soon as this gentle and goodly lover of hers came into her chamber, the sight of him did so move her that it made her break her oath and give <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> up to him, in that he vowed that she was not his sister but his spouse.' 'Did she promise him, mother?' said he. 'Yea, son,' answered <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>, 'she promised him, while I was by and heard it, and meaneth within these few days to make them a sumptuous wedding, and will marry thee to some other.' Thereat <a href=/people/942 target=_blank>Achaemenes</a> groaned bitterly and clapping his hands said: 'I will make this a sorrowful wedding for them all. Only help me to defer it for a while, and if any man ask for me, say I am sore sick in the country. That fine gentleman calleth his sister his wife; as though we did not understand that he doth it only to disannul that which by promise was granted to me. Even if he embrace and kiss her as he doth now, yea even if he lie with her, it is no clear proof that she is his wife and not his sister. Nay, I will see to this, and with me the gods, whose religion is violated by the breaking of an oath.' </p>                        </div>

He thanked her for entertaining the young Greek strangers so courteously during the days when it was not lawful for any but priests to lodge in the temple; but marry now he desired to have them who had been entrusted to himself again. To this <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> made answer: 'I marvel at you, that while with your own mouth you commend us for our humanity and gentleness, you condemn us straightway again of incivility, making it appear that either we cannot or we will not provide for strangers and do for them as reason requires.' 'I mean not so,' said <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a>, 'for I know that they would fare better here with you than at my house, if they wished to stay.

The one is a tyrant's will, the other a monarch's decree. In a word, war and peace ought not to be regarded by their names, but by the meaning and intent of those that use them. Wherefore you will make a better definition of equity if you consent to this. As for what is honest and profitable there can be no question. For how is it seemly for you, or profitable, to appear so madly set on keeping these young strangers?' At that <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> could contain herself no longer; and that happened to her which is common to all lovers. So long as they think they are not spied, they blush; but when once they are perceived, they are past all shame. The secret lover hesitates; he that is detected becomes the more bold. Since then her guilty mind accused her and she thought that <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> suspected somewhat, she set not a rush by the priest nor by the honour of his office, but elbowing aside all womanly shame she said: 'You shall not go unpunished, you people, for what you did to <a href=/people/2008 target=_blank>Mitranes</a>. In due season <a href=/people/985 target=_blank>Oroondates</a> will take vengeance on those that slew him and his company. As for these strangers, I will not let them go. For the moment they are my slaves, and within a short space they will be sent according to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> custom to my brother the great king. Wherefore play the orator as long as you list, and lose your labour with defining of justice, and honour, and utility.

But <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> said: 'I care not for your priesthood: love's one holy office is happiness.' And therewith she went to her chamber, and sending for <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a> devised what they had to do. For by this time she began to suspect that <a href=/people/942 target=_blank>Achaemenes</a> was gone to <a href=/people/985 target=_blank>Oroondates</a>, because he came not into sight. If at any time she asked for him, <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a> made diverse and sundry excuses, to persuade her anything rather than that he was gone to Oroondate: but for all that she was not believed, and as time went on lost her credit quite. On this occasion then <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> said: 'What shall we do now, <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>? What way can we devise to rid me out of all these perils that I am in? My love abateth no whit, but rather waxeth fiercer and fiercer, finding fresh fuel in the young man. But he is cruel, and will not be ruled, and was more gentle even before than he is now; for then he comforted me with deceitful promises, but now he openly refuses to do my request. I am the more grieved for fear lest, as I suspect, he too has heard of <a href=/people/942 target=_blank>Achaemenes</a>, and therefore is more afraid than ever of the act. And in addition to all this there is the vexation of <a href=/people/942 target=_blank>Achaemenes</a>, who is gone with information to <a href=/people/985 target=_blank>Oroondates</a>, and is likely either to persuade him or at least to find him not altogether incredulous. But let me only see <a href=/people/985 target=_blank>Oroondates</a>; I know he will not be able to withstand my flattery and one tear from <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>'s eyes. For a wife's caresses and familiar looks have a wonderful charm to persuade her husband. But what grieveth me most is if haply I be accused, yea and punished even, if <a href=/people/985 target=_blank>Oroondates</a> believes the charge before I see him, ere I have had my way with <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>. Wherefore, <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>, turn every stone, devise every manner of means now, seeing that we are brought to our final extremity. And remember that if I despair myself I shall not spare others, and you shall be the first to taste the fruits of your son's attempts; whereof that thou are ignorant I cannot surmise.' 'As touching my son,' said <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>, 'and my fidelity to you, mistress, you will know in the end that you are deceived. That you so slackly handle your own love is no just reason why you should blame others who are blameless. You do not command the stripling like a mistress but flatter him like a servant. That perhaps was well enough at the first, when we deemed him to be of a weak and tender spirit; but now when he withstands his lover so stiffly, let him by experience learn that you are his mistress, and be glad after whips and torments to yield to your pleasure. For young men pay no heed to prayers, but when they are forced then they begin to stoop. Wherefore this one also, when he is chastised, will do that which he would not while he was flattered.' 'You seem to speak well' said <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>, 'but how could I abide to see with mine own eyes his body scourged or otherwise tormented?' 'You are too pitiful,' said <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>; 'it rests with him: a little pain will make him better advised, and you after a little grief will have all you desire. You need not vex your own yes with what shall be done to him. Deliver him to <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a>, and command him to punish him as it were for some other offence, so that you shall not see that which would pain you — for hearing is nothing so grievous as sight — and then, if we perceive that he has changed his mind, we may on his sufficient repentance release him from his pain.' </p>                        </div>

He, being afflicted with jealousy as are all eunuchs, and offended with <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> besides because of other things that he saw and surmised, laid him at once in irons, and locking him in a dark room tormented him with hunger and stripes. When <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, who knew the reason well enough but pretended to be ignorant, asked why he was thus handled, he gave him no answer; but every day augmented his pains and tormented him more than either <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> wished or had commanded, never suffering any man to go in to him save <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>: for so was he ordered. She came to him very often, pretending she brought him food privily, as being very sorry for his mishap because of their past acquaintance, but in truth trying him, to see if he relented a whit because of these pains, and how he was presently minded. But he played the man then all the more and withstood every trial, suffering his body to be afflicted, but keeping a lofty stomach by reason of his chastity. As for his ill fortune, he rejoiced therein, because though his greatest part was tormented, yet his best and most noble part was well pleased, since he had occasion now to show his love and faithfulness to <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>. He thought indeed that it went very well with him if only she might know thereof, and ever called upon her as his light and his life. <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a> seeing this, when, contrary to <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>'s mind — which was that he should be punished a little, until he relented, and not tormented to death — she had brought <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a> word to augment his punishment, began now to realise that her attempt had been useless and of no effect, and to understand in what danger she herself was. Sometimes she was afraid of the instant vengeance of <a href=/people/985 target=_blank>Oroondates</a>, if <a href=/people/942 target=_blank>Achaemenes</a> should have told him hereof; sometimes she feared lest <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> even before that should have her killed, as having been beguiled of the attainment of her love. She determined therefore to brave all risks, and by some surpassing stroke of mischief execute <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>'s pleasure and so avoid her present peril, or else to do away with every proof by killing of them all. In that mind she went to <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> and said: 'Mistress, we lose our labour. That obstinate fellow relenteth no whit, but is more wilful, and hath <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> always in his mouth, and comforteth himself with her name, as if it were the dearest thing in the world to him. Wherefore if it please you, let us cast our last anchor, as the proverb says, and make away with her who stands so in our way. For if he shall know that she is dead, it is likely that he will change his mind and do our pleasure, being out of all hope of her love.' </p>                        </div>

'For although you have all things in your hands, yet the laws will not let you kill any one without the judgment of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> magistrates. You will have need, at your own great trouble and annoyance, to invent a charge against the maid; and then it is doubtful whether we shall be able to prove it. But if you think good — for I am ready to do anything for your sake — I will dispatch this matter with poison, and by means of a subtle cup rid our adversary of her life.' <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> approved the plan and bade her put it into practise; and she went about it forthwith. She found <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> moaning and weeping and thinking of naught but how to devise some way of death — for by this time she suspected in what case <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> was, although at first <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a> had by diverse tricks deluded her and made sundry excuses for that she saw him not in the parlour as she was wont to do — and said to her: 'Good soul, wilt thou not cease thus to vex thyself and pine away to no purpose? Behold, <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> will be set at liberty this night and come to thee. Our mistress, who was somewhat angered with him because of a certain offence that he committed in serving her and commanded him to be kept in ward, hath promised this day — partly at my request — to set him at liberty and to celebrate a sumptuous feast according to the custom of this country. Wherefore arise and be merry and now at length eat somewhat with us.' 'How can I believe you?' said <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>. 'Your continual lying hath so often beguiled me that I cannot give credit to anything that you say.' Then said <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a>, 'I swear unto you by all the gods that your business shall be dispatched this day and you will never need to trouble hereafter; provided only you do not kill yourself before by refraining these many days from food. Wherefore eat some bit of that which is provided at this time.' <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> with much ado consented, although she doubted not that she would deceive her as she had done many times before; but partly because of her oath she agreed and partly she was glad to embrace the pleasure that she promised: for the mind doth quickly give credit to that which it earnestly desireth. So they sat down together and did eat. As the waiting maid served them to drink <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a> beckoned to her to bring <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> the first cup, and then she herself drank of another. But scarcely had she drank it off when she began to grow dizzy and spilling what was left on the ground and looking fiercely at the maid was torn with violent retchings and convulsions. </p>                        </div>

For the poison, it appeared, was swifter than an arrow in its force and strong enough to kill at once even a young and lusty man, while in her old dry body it made its way to the vital parts sooner than any one could tell the tale. Thus was the old woman consumed, and when the spasms were ended her limbs fell motionless, and all her body turned very black.

So the old woman died, and <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> was bound and brought straightway to <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>, who asked her whether she had provided the poison, and threatened to torment her on the rack if she would not confess the truth. Then was <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> a strange sight to those who looked upon her. She was not sad nor bare any countenance that might argue a faint heart, but came forward smiling and made no account of what she had in hand: either because she heeded not the slander as being guiltless, or else that if <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> were not alive, she wished also to die and thought it a gain to take upon her a deed which others had done.

She went sometimes into this side and sometimes into that, marvelling what it meant and hastening to die; but it prevailed not, for the fire always gave way and fled as it were from her. The tormentors for their part ceased not to lay on wood and reeds — <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> with threatening nods charging them so to do — to make it burn more fiercely: but it did no good, save that it troubled the people more, who supposing that she had help from heaven cried: 'The woman is clean, the woman is not guilty' and coming to the fire put the tormentors aside. The first that so did was <a href=/people/716 target=_blank>Thyamis</a> — for by this time he was come, being admonished of what was done by the great noise in the city — who encouraged the people to help her. They were fain to deliver her but durst not come near the fire, bidding her step out herself, for she that had been in the fire without harm need fear nothing if she list to come forth. Which when <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> saw and hard, thinking that God preserved her, she deemed it best not to be ungrateful nor make light of his benefit, and leapt out of the fire. Whereat the people for joy and wonder gave a great shout and thanked the gods.

Some of the people were angry and in mind to resist; others gave way because they were somewhat blinded by the tale of poisoning; but most had fear of <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> and her authority. So <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> was delivered to <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a> again, to be kept for another judgment, and had more irons laid upon her. The greatest comfort that she had in this adversity was that she had time to tell <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> of her affairs. For this was <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>'s invention too, to put them to more pain, thinking that the young people being prisoners together might behold each other's torments and griefs: since she knew that a lover is more distressed by his friend's pain than by his own. But this was to them a comfort, and they thought it gain to be afflicted alike, and if either had less torment than the other, each supposed himself vanquished and as it were more weak in love. Moreover they were together, and could encourage one another to bear in manly fashion whatsoever fortune came, and refuse no trial that might ensue of their unfeigned chastity and steadfast faith. After they had talked far into the night of such matters as it is likely they would — for they never hoped to talk together again — and had satisfied themselves as well as they might, they at last fell into communication of the miracle which happened about the fire. <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> referred the benefit thereof to God's goodness who had saved her, being guiltless, from <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>'s unjust slander.

The 'Land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>' seemeth to be that which is under the ground. 'With the <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Maid</a>,' that is, to dwell with <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Proserpine</a>: and the escape from <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>'s band signifies the departure of the soul from the body. But what should your verse mean, wherein are so many contraries? for '<a href=/people/4645 target=_blank>Pantarbe</a>' means 'all fearful;' and yet it bids you not be afraid of the fire.' Then said <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>: 'My dear heart <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, our long acquaintance with calamity maketh thee to take all things for the worse. For men commonly suit their thoughts to those things that befall them. I think that thy oracle doth foreshadow better luck than you suppose. Perhaps I am the maid, with whom it promises that, after you be delivered from <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a>'s chains, you shall journey to my country of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>. How this shall be done we know not; but it is neither incredible nor impossible for the gods to do; those who have given us these oracles will see thereto. As touching that which was foretold of me, it is fulfilled, as you yourself know; and I for whom there seemed no hope am still alive. I carried my safety upon me, although then I knew it not; but now, methinks, I understand. For whereas at all times before I carried with me the tokens that my mother laid forth with me, at that time above all others, looking for my last judgment I tied them about my body in a secret place, that if I were saved they might find me such things as were necessary for me to live by, but if I miscarried that they might be my last ornaments and furniture for my burial. Among these, <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, which are jewels of great value and very precious stones of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, there is a ring which my father gave my mother when he was ensured to her, wherein is set a stone called <a href=/people/4645 target=_blank>Pantarbe</a>, and about it are certain holy letters written. To be short, that ring hath some heavenly virtue in it which withstandeth fire, giving them that have it grace never to be hurt thereby: which perhaps by the will of the gods hath also preserved me. This may I think and know, because good <a href=/people/611 target=_blank>Calasiris</a> told me the same was written on that band which was then exposed with me and is now wrapped around my body.' 'That is probablye and like to be true,' said <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, 'because of your escape. But what second <a href=/people/4645 target=_blank>Pantarbe</a> shall we have to help us out of tomorrow's danger? It doth not promise immortality because of its avoidance of the fire — I would to God it might — and the most wicked <a href=/people/503 target=_blank>Arsace</a> methinks is now devising some new fashion of vengeance against us. I would that she might condemn us both at once to one kind of death; for verily I should not call that death but a rest from all our troubles.' 'Be of good comfort,' quoth <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>; 'we have another <a href=/people/4645 target=_blank>Pantarbe</a>, even the promise that was made us this night. Let us trust to God, and then we shall either have the more pleasure if we be saved, or die with better minds if need require.' Thus were they occupied, sometimes lamenting and weeping, more for the other's than their own fortune, sometimes taking their last leave and swearing by the gods and their present trouble that they would hold their faith in love inviolable to the death. </p>                        </div>

But when he was almost there he fell in with then Ethiopian scouts, a valiant crew of lusty soldiers, who were sent before to spy out the country that the main army might have safe passage. At that time because of the darkness and their ignorance of the country they had strayed too far away, and having hidden in the reeds by the river to protect themselves and to lay ambush for their enemies they stayed there all night and slept not. Early in the morning when they heard <a href=/people/957 target=_blank>Bagoas</a> and his horsemen ride by and saw that they were but a few, they suffered them to ride on, and when they knew certainly that none followed them, they broke out with a great noise and pursued them. <a href=/people/957 target=_blank>Bagoas</a> and the horsemen who were with him were startled by the sudden cry, as well for that by their colour they knew them to be <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a>, and being themselves not able to withstand their numbers — for there were a thousand of them sent to spy the country in light harness — they tarried not so much as to look them in their faces, but fled: yet not so fast at the first as they might, because they wished not their enemies to think they fled in fear. The others chased them, sending out about two hundred of the people called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195372RTro class=ethnic long=37.2 lat=19.5>Troglodytes</a>; who are a tribe of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a> who live by husbandry on the borders of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>. These <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195372RTro class=ethnic long=37.2 lat=19.5>Troglodytes</a> are very swift of foot by nature and practise the same from their youth. They never wear heavy armour but use slings in battle and attack their enemies suddenly and so endamage them. If they perceive they be too weak, they flee; and their enemies never pursue them, for they know they are too swift and will hide themselves in every corner. These people then overtook the horsemen, though they themselves were on foot, and casting with their slings wounded some of them. But when they turned upon them, they would not abide, but fled back little by little to their fellows. Which when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> perceived, despising their numbers they chased them as fast as they might, and after driving them back themselves rode forward with as much speed as they could, spurring their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and giving them the reins at will. By which means some escaped and fled to a turn of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> where they hid under the bank as a refuge that heir enemies might not see them.

There his spies found him and presented their prisoners. He took great pleasure to look upon the young couple, and had good affection to them in his mind, as those that should be afterward his own children, although he knew it not then, but especially he counted it good luck that when they were caught they were already in chains. 'Good,' he cried, 'the gods at the beginning deliver our enemies to us in chains.

Some digged, others carried the grit away, others raised up a counter-wall against that which was besieged. No man because of their great army durst come out of the town to hinder the work and prevent it being made round the town, while their slings and other engines served to no purpose, since <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> had arranged that the space between the two walls was so great that those who made the ditch were out of reach by their missiles. They soon finished the work by reason of the great number of the labourers, and then he began this other thing. He left between the two ends of the trench a space one hundred feet broad which he ditched to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, bringing the same ever from the lower ground to that which was more high.

Which when those who were in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/241329USye class=place long=32.898 lat=24.0811>Syene</a> saw and understood unto what danger they were brought, because he meant by so encompassing them about to drown their town so that none might escape, being inclosed both by the wall and the water; knowing that there was no safety in waiting they made good shift, as far as time allowed, to help themselves. First they caulked the chinks in the gates with tow and pitch, and then they underpinned the walls to make them stronger. Some brought earth, some stones, some timber, and anything that each had to hand. No man rested, but women, children, and even old man laboured hard; for danger of death refuses the help neither of any age or of any kind. The sturdier youths and the men at arms were set to make a countermine that should reach to the enemies earth work, the manner whereof was thus. They digged a pit first about five yards right down close to the wall and there laid a sure foundation. Then they digged forward, straight to the enemy's wall, by torchlight, those behind carrying away the earth dug by those before, and heaping it in that part of the city where their gardens were. And this they did, that if the water came into that place which was without earth it might have a path to break out and run away. But the danger came too quickly upon them despite their efforts. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> rushed down the long trench, fell very fast into the round ditch, and then flowing everywhere over the banks drowned all the space between the two walls and made it like a marsh. And thus was <a about=https://topostext.org/place/241329USye class=place long=32.898 lat=24.0811>Syene</a> made an island, and a city which stands in mid country was compassed about with water and beaten upon by the waves of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>. The wall of the town withstood the force of the water for one day. But as the water increased and rose high, and sinking through the cracks, which the heat of summer had made in the rich black ground, began to work down and reach the foundations, then the masonry above began to shake and seemed as though it would fall. Wherever the loose ground slipped away the wall tottered and threatened to come down, while the battlements trembled and by their shaking disturbed those that kept guard nearby. </p>                        </div>

Wherefore there arose a pitiful cry from all manner of folk that were in the city for the enemy to hear, who lifted up their hands to heaven and called to the gods for help, which was all their hope that was left, and humbly besought <a href=/people/985 target=_blank>Oroondates</a> to send messengers to <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> to ask for peace. He agreed thereto, being now made even against his will the servant of fortune; but how he should send to his enemies, thus surrounded by water, he knew not, until necessity taught him. For when he had written what he wanted and tied the letter to a stone, he cast the same with a sling instead of a messenger to his enemies, and by this means sent his humble prayers over the waves. But he lost his labour, since the strength of the sling could not overreach that space, but fell into the water. He cast again in the same fashion and again failed, as did all his archers and slingers, although they were zealous to surpass each the other and were shooting for their lives. At length they held up their hands to their enemies, who stood upon their mound and made a spectacle of their trouble, declaring by signs as well as they could what these throws meant. Sometimes they stretched out their hands with palms upturned, like suppliants; sometimes they put them behind their backs, in token that they were ready to receive chains and become their bondmen. <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> perceived that they craved mercy and was himself ready to grant it; for an enemy who yields forces a good man to be generous. But as he had no ready way thereto at that moment, he determined to test them more certainly. He had certain boats ready belonging to the river folk, which he had arranged should come down his trench from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, and had them hauled them up by the circular ditch. He chose ten of the newest of these, and furnishing them with archers and men-at-arms, he told them what to say and sent them to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, equipped with their weapons and ready to fight if those in the town attempted anything that they looked not for. Truly this was a strange sight, that a ship should sail from wall to wall, and a mariner practise his skill in the midst of dry land, and a boat be rowed where the plough was wont to work. And although the art of war ever deviseth novelties, yet then invented it the strangest thing of all, when it made men in ships fight against them that stood upon walls, and joined two armies by sea and land together. The people on the walls, seeing boats full of armed men approaching the walls, seeing boats full of armed men approaching that part of the wall that was fallen down, being themselves full of terror and dismay because of their present danger, suspected those who came to bring them safety — for in extremity everything is a cause of suspicion and of fear — and so began to cast stones and shoot arrows against the men in the boats. In such fashion men deal when they are in despair, accounting everything a gain that delays death.

If they are friends and bring us peace, then they are our saviours: but if they mean to deal like enemies, they may easily be overcome when they have landed. And what shall we be the better when we have slain them, seeing that so black a cloud hangeth over our heads both by water and by land? Why do we not rather let them come in and see what they have so say?' Every man thought that he said well, and the governor also commended him. Wherefore moving this way and that from the fallen part of the wall they stood still and laid down their arms. </p>                        </div>

Moreover the people in the city also sought all means they could to help themselves, despairing not of the safety that was offered them unlooked for. Some made a mine underneath the ground near to the enemies ditch, guessing the distance, although they could not see, by means of a line wherewith they took the measure. Others stayed up the wall by torch light; which thing they might easily do, because of the stones left when the wall fell inwards. But even when they had done all they could and thought themselves in safety, they were not free from alarms. About midnight a part of the enemies' mound, just where the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a> that evening had begun to dig through, gave way with a sudden crash. Either it was that the ground had been loosely heaped and was not thick enough, so that the foundation gave way when it was thoroughly wetted. Or else those who were digging the mine caused the lower earth to fall in and slip towards the empty space they made. Or else it was where the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a> had began and after they had ceased for the night the water ran in and once it had broken its way through grew deeper and deeper.

They who were in the tents kept themselves close, thinking that they were safe for the moment and would know in the morning what it was. But the citizens went round about their walls, and seeing that all was well there thought that their enemies had had some mishap, until the morning took away all this doubt, and the breach was espied and the water gone. For by this time the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a> were damming up the water channel, lowering wooden flood gates which they secured from outside with heavy baulks of timber, and throwing in baskets of earth and bundles of twigs which thousands of men brought up together either in boats or along the bank of the mound. And thus the water went away at length, although for a long time neither of them could come to the other. For the earth was covered with thick mud, and under that which seemed on the top to be dry there was much wetness, which served as a trap both for men and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> when they came. </p>                        </div>

And this is the common folk's opinion. The cause why they give him so divine honour is because they think that the mixture of moist and dry is the special cause of the beginning and continuance of man's life — for the other elements depend on these and are wherever they be — and they deem that moisture proceedeth from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> and dryness from the earth.

A picked fellow of great strength putteth upon him a close helmet made in one piece fitting as tightly as a mask. This covereth his head down to his shoulders, saving that there be holes left for him to look out of. In his right hand is a great staff, bigger than a spear; with his left hand he holds the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>'s reins; by his side hangeth a sword; and all his body is covered with a coat of mail. The mail is made thus. With pieces of brass and iron, as big as the palm of a man's hand, they make a coat, as it were, of scales, laying the end and sides of each piece upon another — so that the nether part of one goeth over the top of the other — and then they sew them together, and this coat lieth upon every part of the body without any ado. It covers every limb, and gives this way and that easily at each movement; for it hath sleeves and reacheth from the neck down to the knees, saving that necessity compels it to be cut between the thighs, that the man may sit upon his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. Such is their coat of mail, which beateth off all darts and keepeth off all manner of blows. Over their legs to their knees they pull on a boot which is tied to their jacket. They arm their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> also in the same fashion. About his legs they tie greaves and cover his head with a frontal of iron, while from his back down beneath his belly there hangeth a cloth with metal rings which doth both protect him and by reason of its looseness hindereth not his course at all. Being thus appointed and in a manner forced into his armour the man sitteth upon his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>: marry he leapeth not up himself, but others help him, so encumbered is he with the weight of his arms. When the time of battle comes, he gives his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> the reins and spurs him with his heels and rides upon his enemies at full speed like a man made of iron or a statue fashioned with hammers. His great staff at its pointed end is tied with a cord to the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>'s neck and the hinder end is made fast to its buttocks, so that in the conflict it does not yield but helps the horseman's hand, who does but guide the same aright. Thus it gives the greater blow and runs through every man it hits, and often carries away two men together pierced by one stroke. </p>                        </div>

They said indeed that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> was himself the year, approving this opinion by his name: for, if the letters thereof are taken as numbers, put together they make three hundred and sixty-five, and so many days are there in the year. But when they added to all this the properties of the plants and flowers and beasts that he breeds <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> said: 'These fine tales do not belong only to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> but to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> also.

'When you brought them to me before it was in a turmoil and I only looked upon them carelessly. Wherefore let some man bring them hither straightway, and the other prisoners also.' They were brought out of hand, for one ran immediately to the baggage train without the walls and told their keepers that they should bring them to the king forthwith. They asked one of their guards, whose father was a Greek, whither they should be taken. He answered that king <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> would see them. As soon as they heard the name <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>, they cried out: 'The gods be our comfort'; because till then they had been afraid lest another was king.

For it is necessary that the ends of those things should be done with many circumstances, whose beginnings the gods have made troublesome. Nor is it meet to reveal in a moment that which hath been long a working, especially when the head and principal point, whereon the business of our recognition dependeth, I mean my mother <a href=/people/1482 target=_blank>Persina</a>, is now away, although by the favour of the gods we hear that she also is alive.'

Wherefore you need not think that we shall either be given away or killed before we come there, seeing we are consecrated to the gods, which thing godly men will not undo. But if we yield too quickly to our joy and without consideration tell our story, when there is no one here to know and bear witness thereto, it is to be feared that we shall incense him that heareth us and make him deservedly angry. Perhaps also he will make a mock and jest of it, that we, being prisoners and appointed to slavery, shall be so bold as to say that we are the king's children, having no probable arguments to prove the same.' 'But the tokens,' said <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, 'which I know you received and keep upon you, will make for us, and declare that we use no fraud nor falsehood.' 'Tokens,' said <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, 'are tokens to those who know them and gave me them; but to those who know them not and cannot understand the whole matter they are but a vain treasure: and perhaps would make them lay theft and robbery to our charge.

As soon as the king saw them stand before him, he lifted himself up a little from his throne, and saying: 'The gods be merciful to me' said down again in a study. When his noblemen asked him what he ailed, he made answer: 'I thought this last night that I had a daughter who suddenly was grown to such a stature as this woman has, and though I took no regard to my dream before, yet now by the beauty of this maid who is like her I remember it again.' Those who were about him said that it was a fantasy of the mind, which oftentimes foreshadowed things to come; but for the moment he made no more account of it and asked the young folks who they were and whence they came. <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> held her peace and <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> said that they were brother and sister, born in Greece. 'O noble Greece,' cried the king, 'who at all times dost bring forth good and honest creatures, and now hast provided us with these auspicious victims to be sacrificed in honour of our victory. But why had I not a son also in my dreams?' he said smilingly to them that were by.

'In what country are they?' asked <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> again. 'They are here,' quoth she, 'and will surely be present when we are offered as sacrifice.'

Let these then be carried away and kept as well as they have been hitherto, to set forth and adorn our sacrifice. But who is he that standeth by them, so like an eunuch?' One of those who were there answered that he was an eunuch indeed, whose name was <a href=/people/957 target=_blank>Bagoas</a>. 'Let him go then with these others,' said the king, 'not as a sacrifice himself, but to watch and guard this maid, that she may be kept chaste until the time come that she be offered.

They asked her to stay a while, and went themselves into the temple to pray and seek counsel from the gods what was best to do. Returning by and by, <a href=/people/1908 target=_blank>Sisimithres</a>, who was chief of the king's council, said: 'We will come, <a href=/people/1482 target=_blank>Persina</a>; for the gods command us so to do: marry they foreshow that there will be a stir and business at the sacrifice, but it will have a good and delectable end, because that destiny will bring to light a member of your body for which you have sought, and a part of the kingdom which has long been lost.'

For as they were to sacrifice to the brightest and most pure of the gods, the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> and the Moon, it was not the custom for women to be present, lest the sacrifice should unknowingly be defiled. Only the priestess of the Moon might take part; which was <a href=/people/1482 target=_blank>Persina</a>, for by the custom of the country the king is the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>'s priest, and the queen the Moon's. <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> also was to be there, not as a looker on, but as a sacrifice to the moon. Then was there great ado in the city, and the people did not wait for the appointed day but that evening began to pass over the river <a href=/people/8905 target=_blank>Astabora</a>, some by the bridge, others who dwelled afar off in boats made of reeds, whereof many grow at the river's side. And these boats are very swift, both because of the stuff whereof they are made and also for their burden, since they never carry more than two or three persons. For the reed is cut into two parts and of either part they make a boat. </p>                        </div>

Then after prayers were ended and thanksgiving for his victory and safe return, they made them ready for the public sacrifice. The king sat in a tabernacle built before for the purpose, which was made of four reeds newly cut down, four square, so that at every corner stood a reed to stay it up instead of a pillar, while the top was round and covered with divers boughs, the fairest whereof were branches broken from the palm trees. In another tabernacle close by upon a high platform were set the images of the native gods and the pictures of their heroes, <a href=/people/440 target=_blank>Memnon</a>, <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a> and <a href=/people/691 target=_blank>Andromeda</a>, whom the kings of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> suppose to be the authors of their stock.

There were three altars made, of which the two appertaining to the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> and Moon were set together. The third, the altar of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a>, was erected a good way off, and thereon they sacrificed all manner of living things, because that the power of his divinity extends over all the people, I think, and pleases every man. Upon the other altars, they offered to the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> four white <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, the swiftest creatures to the most rapid of the gods; to the Moon a pair of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, giving her who is nearest to the earth those animals that work the earth. </p>                        </div>

I know not whether I ever saw so fair a creature. What a stout stomach and what a beautiful visage hath she! With how courageous a heart beareth she this misfortune! How doth she move my mind by reason of her flowering age! If the daughter I had by you, who was so cruelly lost, had lived, she would have been almost as old. I would to God, husband, you might deliver her by some means from this peril. Surely I should have great comfort if she served at my table and waited upon me. Perhaps also the unhappy creature is a Greek, for never was there such a face in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>.' 'She is a Greek,' answered he; 'and as to her parents she promised that she would shew them to us at this time; though how she can I know not. But that she should be delivered from this sacrifice is not possible; although I would fain it were, for I too am moved somewhat by the maid and feel compassion toward her. You know that our law requireth a man to be offered to the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> and a woman to the Moon, and as she was the first prisoner brought to me and ordained for this purpose, the people would be content with no excuse. Only one help is there, if she be found not to be a clean virgin when she shall go to the fire, seeing that the law willeth that she who is offered to the Moon shall be clean, and likewise he that is sacrificed to the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>; but as for <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a> it makes no great matter. But take heed that if she be found at the fire to have accompanied with men it will not be seemly to take her into your household.' Then said <a href=/people/1482 target=_blank>Persina</a>: 'Let her found to have done that, so only she be saved.

Then spake he softly to <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>: 'Is sacrificing the reward of such as live cleanly in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, and shall they be slain who keep their virginity? Why, <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, do you not now manifest yourself? What other time do you look for hereafter, or will you tarry till some one cut our throats? Utter, I pray you, and tell your estate. Perhaps when you are known you will save me; and if not, you yourself at least will escape from danger: which thing when I see I shall be content to die.' She answered him that the time was now at hand and that all their fortune was now at six and seven; and then, without tarrying for any command from those who had charge of that matter, she put upon her the holy garment that she had brought from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, which she always carried in a little fardell about her, wrought with gold and bright gleaming spangles. Then casting her hair abroad, like one taken with a divine fury, she ran and leapt into the fire and stood there a great while unharmed, her beauty shining the more, so that every man marvelled at her, and by reason of her dress thought her more like a goddess than a mortal woman. Thereat was every man amazed and muttered sore, but nothing they said plainly; and above all things they wondered that she, being more beautiful than any mortal woman and in her best youth, had not lost her virginity. So that many of the company were sorrowful that she was fit to be offered, and if they wist how would gladly have delivered her, even though they were very superstitious. But <a href=/people/1482 target=_blank>Persina</a> above all was sad, and spake to <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>: 'How unhappy is this wench who boasteth so of her virginity at this unseasonable time, and will pay with death for all her praise!

He answered: 'You trouble me to no purpose and vainly pity her who cannot be saved, but has been kept from the beginning, it seems, for the gods, because of the great excellency of her nature.' Then turning to the <a href=/people/12221 target=_blank>Gymnosophists</a> he said: 'Right wise men, seeing that all things are ready, why do you not begin the sacrifice?' 'God forbid,' said <a href=/people/1908 target=_blank>Sisimithres</a> speaking in Greek that the people might not understand: 'we have defiled our eyes and ears too much with this that is done already. As for us, we will go away hence to the temple, for this abominable sacrifice of men and women we do not ourselves allow, nor do we think the gods approve. I would that we might prevent indeed all sacrifice that is made with slaughter of living things, for in our opinion that sufficeth which is done with prayers and the sweet savour of incense. Do you tarry — for it is necessary beyond doubt at times for a king to bow to the desire of the multitude — and perform this unholy sacrifice, which because of the ancient law of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> cannot be avoided.

At that time he was but one of the <a href=/people/12221 target=_blank>Gymnosophists</a>, but now he was chief of all the rest. <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> knew him not by face, because she was separated from him very young when she was but seven years old; marry she remembered his name, and was the more glad for that, because she trusted he would be her advocate and help her to be known. Therefore she held her hands up to heaven and said aloud that all might hear: 'O <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, the founder of my ancestors' pedigree, and ye other gods and heroes, bear me witness that I say nothing but truth, and help me in this case, wherein of many just pleas I will begin with this: Doth the law command strangers, O king, or men of this country to be sacrificed?' 'Strangers,' quoth he. 'Then it is time,' she said, 'that you seek some other to be sacrificed; for you will find me to be one of this country born and your subject.' He marvelled at this and said she lied. 'Soft, quoth <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, 'you wonder at small things, but there be grater matters than this, for I am not only of this country but also of the blood royal.' <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> despised her words and turned away as though they were folly. 'Nay, father,' quoth she, 'leave off thus to despise and refuse your own daughter.' Thereon the king not only despised her but waxed very wroth, thinking this to be scorn and intolerable insolence, and said: '<a href=/people/1908 target=_blank>Sisimithres</a> and ye others, how long shall she abuse my patience? Is not the maid stark mad, with bold lies seeking to avoid death? She pretends that she is my daughter as though this were a scene in a comedy. For my part I never had so good luck as to have a child: once only it was told that I had one, but I lost her forthwith. Wherefore let some one carry her away, that she delay the sacrifice no longer.' 'No man shall carry me away,' cried <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, 'except the judges command it: you yourself are not judge now, you are being judged. The law perhaps suffereth you, O king, to kill strangers, but neither this law nor the law of nature allows you, father, to kill your own children. For the gods will prove this day that you are my father, though you say nay. Every controversy in law, O king, standeth upon two points especially; that is to say, on proof by writings and confirmation by witnesses; and I will bring both to prove that I am your daughter. For my witness I will bring none of the common sort but the judge himself — for the judge's knowledge is the surest proof methinks that a pleader can give — and for writings I will lay before you this, which shall tell you both of mine and of your estate.' </p>                        </div>

Besides she feared lest <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> should suspect somewhat now that this was discovered, and be too light of belief, or angry, or perhaps punish her.

You know that we may not lie. And I recognise the writing on the band, which is, as you see, in the royal Ethiopian characters, and you have good reason to know it too, for it was written by <a href=/people/1482 target=_blank>Persina</a>'s hand. But there were other tokens also which I gave to him who received her from me, a Greek and by seeming a good and honest man.' 'I have them also,' said <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>; and so showed them the jewels; with which sight <a href=/people/1482 target=_blank>Persina</a> was more astonished than she was before.

And why should I not seem to have pleaded for you as much as for the maid? By the help of Heaven I have shewn you to be her father. Was I to neglect the child whom I saved in her cradle, now that she has been preserved for you in the bloom of her youth? Think as you will of us, we care not at all. For we live not to please other men but to content our own conscience, following after right and equity. As touching your question of her colour, the writing on the band answereth you, for <a href=/people/1482 target=_blank>Persina</a> there allows that in her conception she drew somewhat from the figure of <a href=/people/691 target=_blank>Andromeda</a>, by looking upon her when you had to do with her.

'One point still is wanting,' quoth <a href=/people/1908 target=_blank>Sisimithres</a>: 'this is a question of the throne, and the true succession and above all of verity. Strip up your sleeve, maid. There was a black spot above your elbow. It is no shame to be stripped to testify to your parents and kindred.' <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> uncovered her left arm, and upon it there was a circle as of ebony staining the ivory of her skin. <a href=/people/1482 target=_blank>Persina</a> then could contain herself no longer. She leapt from her throne and embraced her and wept, and for the exceedingness of her joy which she could not conceal she broke into sobs and mutterings, and almost fell to the ground in <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>'s arms. <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> had pity upon his wife, when he saw her lament so, and himself was like affected in his mind too; but he kept the tears back from his eyes, as if they had been made of iron or horn, as he looked upon what was being done. His heart swelled with fatherly affection and with manly spirit, so that he was drawn both ways: but at length nature prevailed, which overcometh all things, and not only did he suffer himself to be persuaded that he was a father, but was also affected like a father, so that when he saw <a href=/people/1482 target=_blank>Persina</a> fall, he took her up, embraced <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, and with tears as with an offering made a fatherly league with her. Yet he did not forget what he had to do, but stood a while and looked upon the people, who were affected like himself and through joy and pity wept to see that strange hap and would not hear the heralds' cries which commanded silence. Wherefore he stretched out his hand and bade them be still, and when he had appeased them he said: 'Ye people that are present, contrary to all hope, as you see and hear, the gods have declared that I am a father, and that this is my daughter is proved by many arguments. Yet do I owe such good will to you and my country that without regard to the succession of my blood or the joy I have to be called father — both of which things by her are now like to ensue — I am ready on your behalf to offer her to the gods. I see that you are weeping and are affected like men, pitying the untimely age of the maid appointed to die, and pitying also my vain hope of succession hereafter; yet even though perhaps you say nay, I must needs perform the custom of our country, and rather have regard to the public utility than to my private profit. I know not whether it be the gods' will to give her to me and at once to take her away — as they did when first she was born and now are like to do again when she is found — but I leave that to be scanned by your discretion; nor can I determine whether they would have her sacrificed, whom they have banished into the farthest part of the world and by a wonderful chance brought to me again as a prisoner. I slew her not when she was my enemy, nor did I insult her when she was my captive, but now, when she has been shewn to be my daughter, I will sacrifice her, if you wish it, without more ado. I will not yield to affection, which in another father perhaps deserved pardon, nor hesitate, nor beg you to excuse me and justify this before the law, nor will I put the claims of nature first or think that in some other fashion we might appease the gods. Even as you have been like affected with me and have grieved for my sorrows as your own, so now I will make more account of your public weal than mine own, caring not for my loss or for poor <a href=/people/1482 target=_blank>Persina</a>'s tears, who now hath seen her first child and is at once made childless again. Wherefore, if you will, leave your weeping and fruitless pitying of me, and let us go to the sacrifice. As for thee, my daughter — for now for the first and last time I call thee by that pleasant name — whose beauty is peerless to no purpose, and hast found thy parents in vain, in an ill time happening upon thine own country worse to thee than any strange land, who hast been safe in other countries but art in danger of death in thine own, trouble not my mind with sorrowful weeping, but if ever thou didst show thyself to be of stout courage and princely mind, now pluck up thy heart and follow thy father, who cannot provide a marriage for thee nor bring thee to bed in any costly bowers, but makes thee ready for sacrifice and bears before thee not such tapers as are used for bridals but those appointed for sacrifice, and in place of a victim offers thine unspeakable beauty. And bear with me, O ye gods, if affection hath caused me to speak anything that is scarce godly or religious, who have both called this maid my daughter and am ready to take her life away.' </p>                        </div>

How can she have a husband when the fire declares that he neither is nor ever has been? Unless perchance in her case alone that doth err which with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a> is an unerring trial of chastity, and sent her away unburned when she trod upon it, and would give her grace falsely to play the virgin. I never saw any but her who made the same man her friend and her enemy in one minute of an hour, and feigned to have brothers and husbands who never were. Wherefore, wife, go you into the tabernacle and see if you can bring her to her wits again; whether she is made mad by the god who cometh to this sacrifice, or is beside herself with too much joy because of this unlooked for fortune. I will tell someone to look and find another maid in her place who must be sacrificed to the gods, and meanwhile I will go and deal with the embassies that have come from diverse foreign lands and receive the gifts that they have brought to welcome me home after my victory.' </p>                        </div>

Nor did <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> tarry in his seat, but arose to meet him, and embraced him with a fatherly affection, and set him beside him, and taking him by the right hand said: 'My son, you come in good time; for beside celebrating this solemn sacrifice with me for my victory you shall be royally married.

But I, because you have been valiant in battle and declared your excellent manhood in noble exploits, have though it good to give you a gift like thereunto. I bring you therefore a man so well practised in bloodshed and war that none can be found to face him, so sturdy in wrestling and in fighting with plummets of lead and in all manner of other exercises that no man is able to withstand his strength.'

After none came forth, though diverse proclamations were made, the king said: 'You shall have a gift from us like to yourself. And then he commanded to fetch an old elephant, which was very great.

His neck was slender, and although the rest of his body was great, his throat was long and thin like a swan. His head was after a <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camel</a>'s fashion and in size about twice as big as a Libyan ostrich, wherein he rolled his eyes terribly as though they were coloured beneath with red. In his gait he went like no beast either of the earth or water, but moved his legs on either side both at once, so that he moved his right legs and left legs not in order nor one after the other, but all his half body with either of them.

Moreover it threw all the gathering into confusion: for this is what befell. At the altar of the Moon stood two bullocks, and at the altar of the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> four white <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> ready to be sacrificed. When this monstrous strange foreign creature appeared they were as sore troubled and afraid as if they had seen a spirit, and the one of the two <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> who, it seems, saw him, and two of the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, broke away from those that held them, and ran about as fast as they could. They could not break out of the compass of the army, because all the soldiers with their shields had made as it were a wall round, but they ran here and there and overthrew all that came in their way, pots and pans and living creatures, so that there was a great shouting partly for fear from those on whom they came down, partly for joy and pleasure that others had to see them run over their mates and tread them under their feet. Wherefore <a href=/people/1482 target=_blank>Persina</a> and <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> could not be quiet in their tabernacle, but drew aside the curtain to see what was being done. Then <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, either moved by his own manly courage, or else stirred by an impulse from heaven, when he saw his keepers dispersed here and there in the tumult, started up suddenly — for before he kneeled at the altar and expected every minute to be slain — and took a cleft stick, whereof there lay a great many upon the altar, and leapt upon one of the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> that had not broken loose, and holding him by the mane instead of a bridle, and with his heels and the cleft stick making him to go, followed after the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>. At first every man thought that <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> was seeking to escape and they called one to the other not to let him go out from the compass of the soldiers. But by what he did next they learned that his was no act of cowardice to avoid the sacrifice. For when he had very quickly overtaken the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>, at first he drove him forward from behind, goading and stirring him on to a faster speed, following wherever he went and carefully avoiding his short horns so that they hurt him not. Then, after he had made the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> familiar with the sight of him and what he did, he rode his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> close to his side, so near that their skins touched and their breath and sweat were mingled together, and he kept them to such an equal course that those who were afar off deemed that their heads were joined together, and commended <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> to the heavens who had so strangely yoked a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> at one. The people looked in wonder, but when <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> saw it she trembled and quaked, because she knew not what he meant to do and was as sore afraid of any hurt to him as if she should have been slain herself. <a href=/people/1482 target=_blank>Persina</a> espied her and said: 'Daughter, what ailest thou? Thou seemest to be in every danger that this stranger is in. Truly I myself am somewhat moved and have pity for his youth, and I pray that he escape this peril and be kept for sacrifice, so that the service of the gods may not be altogether imperfect and neglected by us.' 'That is a jest indeed,' said <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, 'to wish that he may not die so that he may not live. If you can, mother, save the man and do me a pleasure.' <a href=/people/1482 target=_blank>Persina</a>, not suspecting the truth but thinking she was a little in love with him, said: 'It is not possible to save him; but be not afraid to tell thy mother what acquaintance thou hast with him that thou shouldest be so very anxious on his behalf. For though it be a youthful motion and scarce seemly for a maiden, a mother's nature knows how to conceal her daughter's weakness, and one woman another's plight, because perhaps they have the same feelings.' Thereat <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a> wept very sorrowfully and said: 'In this point above all am I unhappy, because even those that have understanding understand not my words, and when I tell them of my troubles they think that there is naught in my tale. So now I am forced to tell the bare truth and to accuse myself openly.' </p>                        </div>

So hanging he was carried along, moving lightly with the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>'s leaps, and at length, when he perceived that he was weary with the burden and his muscles faint with too much straining, coming to the place where <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> sat, he pulled his head sideways, and putting his own feet in front of the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>'s legs, while he pawed the ground with his hoofs, he made him stand still. The <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>, being thus hindered in his course and overcome by the youth's strength, fell down upon his head and shoulders, so that his horns stuck so fast in the ground that he could not move his head, and his feet stood upward, wherewith he sprawled in vain a great while and by his feebleness declared that he was overcome. <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> pressed him down, holding him with his left arm, while he lifted his right hand to heaven and looked merrily at <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> and all who were there, by his smiling face inviting them to share in his triumph, whose famousness was declared by the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>'s bellowing as well as if it had been declared by a trumpet. The noise was re-echoed by the people's shouting, who said nothing plainly in his praise but with wide throats and gaping mouths raised for a great while shouts of wonder to heaven. By <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>' command the servants ran and some brought <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> to him and others tied ropes about the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>'s horns, and took him with the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and fastened them to the altars again. <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> was about to say somewhat to <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, but the people, delighted with the young man, and singularly well minded to him ever since they saw him first, and marvelling at his strength, but even more for spite they had toward <a href=/people/4607 target=_blank>Meroebus</a>' Ethiopian champion, cried with one voice: 'Let this fellow be matched with <a href=/people/4607 target=_blank>Meroebus</a>' man: let him that received the elephant contend with him that overcame the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>.' As they were very insistent, <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> agreed and the Ethiopian was brought forth straightway, who looked proudly and fiercely about him and with slow steps shook his elbows broadways in very insolent fashion. </p>                        </div>

'I am pleased to do as they will have me,' said <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>; 'but in what fashion must we be matched?' 'In wrestling,' quoth <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>. 'Why should we not rather fight with swords?' said he. 'Then either I might do some glorious deed or else in death be slain and so content <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>, who till now hath endured to conceal our estate or rather given me my last farewell.' 'What you mean by this talk of <a href=/people/171 target=_blank>Chariclea</a>,' said <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>, 'I know not. But you must wrestle and not fight with swords, because it is not lawful to see any blood shed before the time of the sacrifice.' Then <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> perceived that <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a> feared lest he should be slain before the offering, and said: 'You do well to keep me for the gods, and they will have regard for me.' So first he took dust and cast it upon his arms and shoulders, that were yet sweaty with chasing the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>, and shook that off which stuck not fast to his body. Then he stretched out both is arms and got a firm footing for his feet, and bending his knees and bowing his back inclined his neck forward with body taut awaiting for the grip at the close. The Ethiopian seeing him laughed scornfully and with disdainful gestures seemed to mock his adversary and ran suddenly forward and with his elbow hit <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> in the neck, as sore as if he had stricken him with a bar, and then drew back and laughed again at his own foolish conceit. But <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a>, like a man from his cradle brought up in wrestling and thoroughly instructed in <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a>'s art, thought it good to give way at first and make trial of his adversary's strength, and not to withstand so rude a violence, but by art to delude the same. Therefore he stooped lower, and made semblance as though he had been very sorrowful, and laid the other side of his neck to receive the next blow, and when the Ethiopian struck gave way, and feigned to fall flat upon his face. The Ethiopian was now full of courage and despised his enemy and came on for the third time unadvisedly and prepared to strike him with his elbow again. But <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> avoiding his attack stooped and suddenly gripped him, pinning his left arm with his right elbow, and thus held fast made him bend forward, inasmuch as because of his vain blow he was already inclining to the ground. Next getting him under the armpits and with much ado twining his hands about his back and great gorbelly, he forced him off his feet by working his heel over his ankles and compelled him to sink on to his knees. Then he straddled over him and driving his legs apart with his feet he knocked away the Ethiopian's wrists, wherewith he stayed himself from the ground, and bringing his forearms tight about his forehead and straining backwards constrained him to lay his belly flat upon the earth. </p>                        </div>
