HERMES: So gay, <a href=/people/537 target=_blank>Charon</a>? What makes you leave your ferry to come up here? You are quite a stranger in the upper world. <br />CHARON: I thought I should like to see what life is like; what men do with it, and what are these blessings of which they all lament the loss when they come down to us. Never one of them has made the passage dry-eyed. So I got leave from <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Pluto</a> to take a day off, like that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> lad, you know; and here I am, in the light of day. I am in luck, it seems, to fall in with you. You will show me round, of course, and point out all that is to be seen, as you know all about it. <br />HERM: I have no time, good ferryman. I am bound on certain errands of the Upper <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, certain human matters. He is short-tempered: any loitering on my part, and he may hand me over to you Powers of Darkness for good and all; or treat me as he did <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a> the other day — hurl me down headlong from the threshold of Heaven; there would be a pair of lame cupbearers then, to amuse the gods. <br />CH: And you would leave an old messmate wandering at large on the face of the earth? Think of the cruises we have sailed together, the cargoes you and I have handled! You might remember one thing, son of <a href=/people/525 target=_blank>Maia</a>; I have never set you down to bale or row. You lie sprawling about the deck, you great strong lubber, snoring away, or chatting the whole trip through with any communicative shade you can find; and the old man plies both oars at once. Come, stand by me, like a true son of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> as you are, and show me all the ins and outs, there's a dear lad. I want to see something of life before I go back, and if you leave me in the lurch, I shall be no better off than a blind man: he comes to grief because he is always in the dark, and, contrariwise, I can make nothing of it in the light. Do me this good turn, and I'll not forget it. <br />HERM: Clearly this is to be a flogging matter for me. There </p>                        </div>

However, I must give you a helping hand. What is one to do, when a friend is so pressing? Now, as to going over everything thoroughly, it is out of the question; it would take us years. Meanwhile, I should have the hue-and-cry out after me, you would be neglecting your ghostly work, <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Pluto</a> would lose the shades that you ought to be shipping over all that time, and <a href=/people/255 target=_blank>Aeacus</a> would never take a single toll, and would be proportionately furious. We have only to think, therefore, of contriving you a general view of what is going on. <br />CH: You must do the best you can for me. I know nothing of the matter, being a stranger up here. <br />HERM: The main thing is to get an elevation from which you may see in every direction. If you could come up to Heaven, we should be saved any further trouble; you would then have a good bird's-eye view of everything. But it would be sacrilege for one so conversant with phantoms to set foot in the courts of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>.

But there is work for two here; I shall want your assistance. <br />CH: Give your orders, I'll bear a hand, to the best of my ability. <br />HERM: <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> tells us how the sons of <a href=/people/1864 target=_blank>Aloeus</a> (they were but two, like ourselves) took it into their heads, when they were yet children, to drag up <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398227LOss class=place long=22.6869 lat=39.7969>Ossa</a> from its foundations, and plant it on the top of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a>, and then <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394230LPel class=place long=23.046 lat=39.437>Pelion</a> on the top of all; they thought that would serve as a ladder for getting into heaven. The two boys were rightly punished for their presumption. But we have no design against the Gods: why should not we take the hint, and make an erection of mountains piled one on the top of another? From such a height we should get a better view. <br />CH: What, shall we two be able to lift <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394230LPel class=place long=23.046 lat=39.437>Pelion</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398227LOss class=place long=22.6869 lat=39.7969>Ossa</a>? </p>                        </div>

Every man keeps a sting for his neighbour's service; and a few, like <a href=/people/10963 target=_blank>wasps</a>, make spoil of their weaker brethren. But what are all these misty shapes that beset them on every side? <br />HERM: Hopes, Fears, Follies, Pleasures, Greeds, Hates, Grudges, and such like. They differ in their habits. The Folly is a domestic creature, with vested rights of its own. The same with the Grudge, the Hate, the <a href=/people/1036 target=_blank>Envy</a>, the Greed, the Know-not, and the What's-to-do. But the Fear and the <a href=/people/1068 target=_blank>Hope</a> fly overhead. The Fear swoops on its prey from above; sometimes it is content with startling a man out of his wits, sometimes it frightens him in real earnest. The <a href=/people/1068 target=_blank>Hope</a> hovers almost within reach, and just when a man thinks he is going to catch it, off it flies, and leaves him gaping — like <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a> in the water, you know.
