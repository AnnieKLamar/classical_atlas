Yes, there are many marvels, and yet I suppose the speech of mortals beyond the true account can be deceptive, stories adorned with embroidered lies; [30] and <a href=/people/1505 target=_blank>Grace</a>, who fashions all gentle things for men, confers esteem and often contrives to make believable the unbelievable. But the days to come are the wisest witnesses. [35] It is seemly for a man to speak well of the gods; for the blame is less that way. Son of <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a>, I will speak of you, contrary to earlier stories.

For me it is impossible to call one of the blessed gods a glutton. I stand back from it. Often the lot of evil-speakers is profitlessness. If indeed the watchers of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a> ever honored a mortal man, [55] that man was <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a>. But he was not able to digest his great prosperity, and for his greed he gained overpowering ruin, which the Father hung over him: a mighty stone. Always longing to cast it away from his head, he wanders far from the joy of festivity. He has this helpless life of never-ending labor, a fourth toil after three others, because he stole from the gods nectar and ambrosia, with which they had made him immortal, and gave them to his drinking companions. If any man expects that what he does escapes the notice of a god, he is wrong. [65] Because of that the immortals sent the son of <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a> back again to the swift-doomed race of men. And when he blossomed with the stature of fair youth, and down darkened his cheek, he turned his thoughts to an available marriage, [70] to win glorious <a href=/people/1389 target=_blank>Hippodameia</a> from her father, the lord of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376217PPis class=place long=21.653 lat=37.6395>Pisa</a>. He drew near to the gray sea, alone in the darkness, and called aloud on the deep-roaring god, skilled with the trident; and the god appeared to him, close at hand. </p>                        </div>

May you grant a welcome achievement. So he spoke, and he did not touch on words that were unaccomplished. Honoring him, the god gave him a golden chariot, and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> with untiring wings. He overcame the might of <a href=/people/901 target=_blank>Oenomaus</a>, and took the girl as his bride. She bore six sons, leaders of the people eager for excellence.
