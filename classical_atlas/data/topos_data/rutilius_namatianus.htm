Nothing is ever too long that never fails to please. How greatly and how often can I count those blest who have deserved birth in that happy soil! Those high born scions of Roman nobility crown their honourable birth with the lustre of the Capital! On no other land could the seeds of virtues have been more worthily let fall by heaven's assignment. Happy they too who, winning meeds next to the first, have enjoyed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> homes! The Senate-house, though fenced with awe, yet stands open to foreign merit, nor deems those strangers who are fittingly its own. They share the power of their colleagues in the senatorial order, and possess part of the sacred Genius which they revere, even as from ethereal pole to pole of the celestial vault we believe there abideth the council of the Deity Supreme. </p>                        </div>

Disfigured they are by wars immeasurably long, yet the less their charm, the more they earn pity. 'Tis a lighter crime to neglect our countrymen when at their ease: our common losses call for each man's loyalty. Our presence and our tears are what we owe to the ancestral home: service which grief has prompted ofttimes helps. 'Tis sin further to overlook the tedious tale of disasters which the delay of halting aid has multiplied: now is the time after cruel fires on ravaged farms to rebuild, if it be but shepherd's huts. Nay, if only the very springs could utter words, if only our very trees could speak, they well might spur my laggard pace with just complaints and give sails to my yearning wishes. Now that the dear city slackens her embrace, my homeland wins, and I can scarce feel patient with a journey deferred so late. </p>                        </div>

The god who found the olive-tree is worshipped, the deity too who discovered wine, and the youth who first drove the ploughshare in the soil; the healing art through the skill of the god <a href=/people/3497 target=_blank>Paeon</a> won altars: <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> by his renown was made divine: thou, too, who hast embraced the world in triumphs fraught with law, dost make all things live under a common covenant. Thee, O goddess, thee every nook of the Roman dominion celebrates, beneath a peaceful yoke holding necks unenslaved. The stars, which watch all things in their unceasing motion, never looked upon a fairer empire. What like unto thy power did it fall to <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> arms to link in one? The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> only subdued neighbours of their own.

It was not that at thy birth thou hadst more souls and hands: but more prudence and more judgement were thine. By wars for justifiable cause and by peace imposed without arrogance thy renowned glory reached highest wealth. That thou reignest is less than that thou deservest to reign; thy deeds surpass thine exalted destiny. To review thy high honours amid crowded trophies were a task like endeavouring to reckon up the stars. The glittering temples dazzle the wandering eyes: I could well believe such are the dwelling-places of the very gods. What shall I say of streams suspended on airy arches, where scarce the Rainbow-Goddess could raise her showery waters? You might rather call them mountains grown up to the sky: such a structure Greece would praise, as giant-wrought. Rivers diverted are lost sight of within thy walls: the lofty baths consume whole lakes. No less are thy dewy meads filled also with their own rivulets, and all thy walls are a-babble with springs from the soil. Hence a breath of coolness tempers the summer air, and the crystal well relieves a harmless thirst. Nay, once a sudden torrent of waters seething hot broke forth, when thine enemy trod the roads by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>: had it lasted for ever, mayhap I had deemed this mere chance; but it was to save thee that it flowed; for it came only to vanish. Why speak of woods enclosed amid thy panelled palaces, where native birds sport with varied song? In the spring that is thine never does the year fail in its mildness: baffled winter respects thy charms. </p>                        </div>

The honour done to my lost parent made me weep: tears of a saddened joy wet my cheeks with their flow. For my father once was governor of the land of Tuscany and administered the jurisdiction assigned to the six fasces. After he had passed through many offices, he used to tell, I can recall, that his governorship of Tuscany had been more to his liking than any: for neither the management of the Sacred Largesses, important though it be, nor the authority of a quaestor had brought him more pleasure. His affection, inclining more towards the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscans</a>, did not hesitate to give an inferior place, if piety lets it be said, even to his prefecture in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. Nor was he mistaken, being an equal favourite with those whom he esteemed: their mutual regard inscribes in verse undying gratitude, and old men who can remember him make known to their sons how firm of purpose he was and at the same time how kindly. They are glad that I myself have not fallen off from my parent's honours, and eagerly give me a warm welcome for his sake and for my own. Often as I traversed the lands near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPFl class=place long=12.4759 lat=41.9115>Flaminian Way</a> I have found the same proof of my father's renown; the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a> worships Lachanius' fame like some divinity among the natives of her soil. A favourite with the good, this province keeps its old-world ways and deserves always to have good governors, like <a href=/people/869 target=_blank>Decius</a>, the noble offspring of Lucillus, who among the peoples of Corytus rules o'er these happy lands. Small wonder it is that the sire, reproduced in the character of his great son, feels blest in a descendant so like himself. His satire, sportive in its mordant poetry, neither <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> nor Juvenal shall surpass. The censorious file has restored old-fashioned modesty: in attacking the bad, it teaches to be good. Did not that most upright dispenser of the Sacred Largess repel in his days the <a href=/people/1202 target=_blank>Harpies</a> who gathered round it? — <a href=/people/1202 target=_blank>Harpies</a>, whose claws rend asunder the world, their sticky talons dragging off whatever they touch; creatures who make <a href=/people/2816 target=_blank>Argus</a> one-eyed and <a href=/people/6078 target=_blank>Lynceus</a> blind; public thieves, they flit among the guardians; but their hundred-handed pillaging did not escape Lucillus, whose single hand checkmated all their hands together. </p>                        </div>

We stopped; who 'neath a spiteful storm would dare to go on seas which threatened madness? The respite from our voyage we spend in the neighbouring forests, delighted to exercise our limbs in the pursuit of game. Our innkeeper supplies the implements for the chase, and <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> trained to discover a strongly scented lair.
