What cares have not gnawed at my heart and how few have been the pleasures in my life! Four, to be exact, while my troubles have been as countless as the grains of sand on the shore! Let me see of what value to me have been these few pleasures? Ah! I remember that I was delighted in soul when <a href=/people/285 target=_blank>Cleon</a> had to disgorge those five talents; I was in ecstasy and I love the Knights for this deed; 'it is an honour to Greece.' But the day when I was impatiently awaiting a piece by <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a>, what tragic despair it caused me when the herald called, <a href=/people/1029 target=_blank>Theognis</a>, introduce your Chorus! Just imagine how this blow struck straight at my heart! On the other hand, what joy <a href=/people/5608 target=_blank>Dexitheus</a> caused me at the musical competition, when he played a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=demonym long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotian</a> melody on the lyre! But this year by contrast! Oh! what deadly torture to hear <a href=/people/6344 target=_blank>Chaeris</a> perform the prelude in the <a href=/people/3222 target=_blank>Orthian</a> mode! — Never, however, since I began to bathe, has the dust hurt my eyes as it does today. Still it is the day of assembly; all should be here at daybreak, and yet the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BPny class=place long=23.7193 lat=37.9715>Pnyx</a> is still deserted. They are gossiping in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237XAgo class=place long=23.723 lat=37.975>Agora</a>, slipping hither and thither to avoid the vermilioned rope. The <a href=/people/1337 target=_blank>Prytanes</a> even do not come; they will be late, but when they come they will push and fight each other for a seat in the front row. They will never trouble themselves with the question of peace.

But let us prepare for the recital of the parabasis. Never since our poet presented Comedies, has he praised himself upon the stage; but, having been slandered by his enemies amongst the volatile <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, accused of scoffing at his country and of insulting the people, today he wishes to reply and regain for himself the inconstant <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>. He maintains that he has done much that is good for you; if you no longer allow yourselves to be too much hoodwinked by strangers or seduced by flattery, if in politics you are no longer the ninnies you once were, it is thanks to him. Formerly, when delegates from other cities wanted to deceive you, they had but to style you, the people crowned with violets, and, at the word violets you at once sat erect on the tips of your bums. Or, if to tickle your vanity, someone spoke of rich and sleek <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, in return for that 'sleekness' he would get all, because he spoke of you as he would have of anchovies in oil. In cautioning you against such wiles, the poet has done you great service as well as in forcing you to understand what is really the democratic principle. Thus, the strangers, who came to pay their tributes, wanted to see this great poet, who had dared to speak the truth to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. And so far has the fame of his boldness reached that one day the Great King, when questioning the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonian</a> delegates, first asked them which of the two rival cities was the superior at sea, and then immediately demanded at which it was that the comic poet directed his biting satire.Happy that city, he added, if it listens to his counsel; it will grow in power, and its victory is assured. This is why the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> offer you peace, if you will cede them <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig class=place long=23.425 lat=37.75>Aigina</a>; not that they care for the isle, but they wish to rob you of your poet. As for you, never lose him, who will always fight for the cause of justice in his Comedies; he promises you that his precepts will lead you to happiness, though he uses neither flattery, nor bribery, nor intrigue, nor deceit; instead of loading you with praise, he will point you to the better way. </p>                        </div>

You see how, since he has concluded peace, he buys what is useful in the household and good to eat hot. All good things flow towards him unsought. Never will I welcome the god of war in my house; never shall he chant the '<a href=/people/600 target=_blank>Harmodius</a>' at my table; he is a sot, who comes feasting with those who are overflowing with good things and brings all sorts of mischief at his heels. He overthrows, ruins, rips open; 'tis vain to make him a thousand offers, be seated, pray, drink this cup, proffered in all friendship, he burns our vine-stocks and brutally pours out the wine from our vineyards on the ground. This man, on the other hand, covers his table with a thousand dishes; proud of his good fortunes, he has had these feathers cast before his door to show us how he lives. <br />DICAEOPOLIS: Oh! <a href=/people/280 target=_blank>Peace</a>! companion of fair <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> and of the sweet <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a>, how charming are your features and yet I never knew it!

Perhaps I seem somewhat old to you, but I am yet able to make you a threefold offering; despite my age, I could plant a long row of vines for you; then beside these some tender cuttings from the fig; finally a young vine-stock, loaded with fruit and all round the field olive trees, which would furnish us with oil, wherewith to anoint us both at the New Moons. <br />HERALD: List, ye people! As was the custom of your forebears, empty a full pitcher of wine at the call of the trumpet; he, who first sees the bottom, shall get a wine-skin as round and plump as <a href=/people/231 target=_blank>Ctesiphon</a>'s belly. </p>                        </div>
