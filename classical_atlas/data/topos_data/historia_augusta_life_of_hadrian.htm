He was further delayed by the fact that his travelling-carriage had been designedly broken, but he nevertheless proceeded on foot and anticipated <a href=/people/2783 target=_blank>Servianus</a>' personal messenger. 7 And now he became a favourite of <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>'s, and yet, owing to the activity of the guardians of certain boys whom <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> loved ardently, he was not free from . . . which <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a> fostered. 8 Indeed, at this time he was even anxious about the Emperor's attitude towards him, and consulted the Vergilian oracle. This was the lot given out: But who is yonder man, by olive wreath Distinguished, who the sacred vessel bears? I see a hoary head and beard. Behold The Roman King whose laws shall stablish <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> Anew, from tiny <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422127UCur class=place long=12.6806 lat=42.1845>Cures</a>' humble land Called to a mighty realm. Then shall arise . . . Others, however, declare that this prophecy came to him from the <a href=/people/12187 target=_blank>Sibylline</a> Verses. 9 Moreover, he received a further intimation of his subsequent power, in a response which issued from the temple of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360390UNik class=place long=39.021 lat=35.9517>Nicephorium</a> and has been quoted by <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=person long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, the <a href=/people/3071 target=_blank>Platonist</a>. 10 Finally, through the good offices of Sura, he was instantly restored to a friendship with <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> that was closer than ever, and he took to wife the daughter of the Emperor's sister — a marriage advocated by <a href=/people/3457 target=_blank>Plotina</a>, but, according to Marius <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, little desired by <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> himself. </p>                        </div>

He thereupon gave attention to the study of Latin until he attained the utmost proficiency and fluency. 2 After his quaestorship he served as curator of the acts of the senate, and later accompanied <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=demonym long=25 lat=44.5>Dacian</a> war on terms of considerable intimacy, 3 seeing, indeed, that falling in with <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>'s habits, as he says himself, he partook freely of wine, and for this was very richly rewarded by the Emperor. 4 He was made tribune of the plebs in the second consulship of <a href=/people/7430 target=_blank>Candidus</a> and Quadratus, 5 and he claimed that he received an omen of continuous tribunician power during this magistracy, because he lost the heavy cloak which is worn by the tribunes of the plebs in rainy weather, but never by the emperors. And down to this day the emperors do not wear cloaks when they appear in public before civilians. 6 In the second <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=demonym long=25 lat=44.5>Dacian</a> war, <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> appointed him to the command of the First Legion, the Minervia, and took him with him to the war; and in this campaign his many remarkable deeds won great renown. 7 Because of this he was presented with a diamond which <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> himself had received from <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a>, and by this gift he was encouraged in his hopes of succeeding to the throne. 8 He held the praetorship in the second consulship of <a href=/people/6960 target=_blank>Suburanus</a> and <a href=/people/2783 target=_blank>Servianus</a>, and again received from <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> two million sesterces with which to give games.9 Next he was sent as praetorian legate to Lower <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=place long=19 lat=45>Pannonia</a>, where he held the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490315RSar class=ethnic long=31.5 lat=49>Sarmatians</a> in check, maintained discipline among the soldiers, and restrained the procurators, who were overstepping too freely the bounds of their power. 10 In return for these services he was made consul. While he was holding this office he learned from Sura that he was to be adopted by <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>, and thereupon he ceased to be an object of contempt and neglect to <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>'s friends. 11 Indeed, after Sura's death <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>'s friendship for him increased, principally on account of the speeches which he composed for the Emperor. </p>                        </div>

But more than any other emperor he made it a point not to purchase or maintain anything that was not serviceable. And so, having reformed the army quite in the manner of a monarch, he set out for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>, and there he corrected many abuses and was the first to construct a wall, eighty miles in length, which was to separate the barbarians from the Romans. 3 He removed from office Septicius <a href=/people/12125 target=_blank>Clarus</a>, the prefect of the guard, and <a href=/people/2667 target=_blank>Suetonius</a> <a href=/people/4323 target=_blank>Tranquillus</a>, the imperial secretary, and many others besides, because without his consent they had been conducting themselves toward his wife, <a href=/people/11083 target=_blank>Sabina</a>, in a more informal fashion than the etiquette of the court demanded. And, as he was himself wont to say, he would have sent away his wife too, on the ground of ill-temper and irritability, had he been merely a private citizen. 4 Moreover, his vigilance was not confined to his own household but extended to those of his friends, and by means of his private agents he even pried into all their secrets, and so skilfully that they were never aware that the Emperor was acquainted with their private lives until he revealed it himself. 5 In this connection, the insertion of an incident will not be unwelcome, showing that he found out much about his friends. 6 The wife of a certain man wrote to her husband, complaining that he was so preoccupied by pleasures and baths that he would not return home to her, and <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> found this out through his private agents. And so, when the husband asked for a furlough, <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> reproached him with his fondness for his baths and his pleasures. Whereupon the man exclaimed: What, did my wife write you just what she wrote to me? 7 And, indeed, as for this habit of <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>'s, men regard it as a most grievous fault, and add to their criticism the statements which are current regarding the passion for males and the adulteries with married women to which he is said to have been addicted, adding also the charge that he did not even keep faith with his friends. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi2331.phi001:25'><b>&sect; 25</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;About this time there came a certain woman, who said that she had been warned in a dream to coax <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> to refrain from killing himself, for he was destined to recover entirely, but that she had failed to do this and had become blind; she had nevertheless been ordered a second time to give the same message to <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> and to kiss his knees, and was assured of the recovery of her sight if she did so. 2 The woman then carried out the command of the dream, and received her sight after she had bathed her eyes with the water in the temple from which she had come. 3 Also a blind old man from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=place long=19 lat=45>Pannonia</a> came to <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> when he was ill with fever, and touched him; whereupon the man received his sight, and the fever left <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>. 4 All these things, however, Marius <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> declares were done as a hoax. 5 After this <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> departed for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PBai class=place long=14.0699 lat=40.8178>Baiae</a>, leaving <a href=/people/12361 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to carry on the government. 6 But he received no benefit there, and he thereupon sent for <a href=/people/12361 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, and in his presence he died there at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PBai class=place long=14.0699 lat=40.8178>Baiae</a> on the sixth day before the Ides of July. 7 Hated by all, he was buried at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a> on an estate that had belonged to <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>. 8 Just before his death, he compelled <a href=/people/2783 target=_blank>Servianus</a>, then ninety years old, to kill himself, as has been said before, in order that <a href=/people/2783 target=_blank>Servianus</a> might not outlive him, and, as he thought, become emperor. He likewise gave orders that very many others who were guilty of slight offences should be put to death; these, however, were spared by <a href=/people/12361 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. 9 And he is said, as he lay dying, to have composed the following lines: O blithe little soul, thou, flitting away, Guest and comrade of this my clay, Whither now goest thou, to what place Bare and ghastly and without grace? Nor, as thy wont was, joke and play. 10 Such verses as these did he compose, and not many that were better, and also some in Greek. 11 He lived 62 years, 5 months, 17 days. He ruled 20 years, 11 months. </p>                        </div>

And in order not to omit anything, he even made a <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>. 6 The premonitions of his death were as follows: On his last birthday, when he was commending <a href=/people/12361 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> to the gods, his bordered toga fell down without apparent cause and bared his head. 7 His ring, on which his portrait was carved, slipped of its own accord from his finger. 8 On the day before his birthday some one came into the senate wailing; by his presence <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> was as disturbed as if he were speaking about his own death, for no one could understand what he was saying. 9 Again, in the senate, when he meant to say, after my son's death, he said, after mine. 10 Besides, he dreamed that he had asked his father for a soporific; he also dreamed that he had been overcome by a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>. </p>                        </div>
