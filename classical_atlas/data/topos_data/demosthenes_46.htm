For this is the very reason why the testators leave a will — that no man may know how they are disposing of their property. How, then, do you people know that what is written in the document is a copy of <a href=/people/765 target=_blank>Pasio</a>'s will? I beseech and implore you all, men of the jury, to come to my aid and to punish those who thus without scruple have given false testimony, for your own sakes, for mine, for the sake of justice and the laws. </p>                        </div>
