                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0555.tlg001:1.1'><b>&sect; 1.1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;BOOK I [abridged] <br />AMPHION of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a> and <a href=/people/777 target=_blank>Arion</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394262PMet class=person long=26.1769 lat=39.3692>Methymna</a> were both minstrels. Both are celebrated in legend, and to this day the story is sung by a chorus of Greeks how their musical skill enabled the one to lure a fish and the other to build the walls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>. There was also a Thracian wizard [<a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>], — so runs another Greek legend, — who used to tame wild beasts simply by his song, yes, and to transplant trees, oaks, by music. I can also tell you of another legend and another minstrel akin to these, namely, <a href=/people/1182 target=_blank>Eunomus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384222ROzo class=person long=22.2 lat=38.4>Locrian</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> grasshopper. A solemn assembly of Greeks, held in honour of a dead <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>, was gathering at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pytho</a>, and <a href=/people/1182 target=_blank>Eunomus</a> sang a funeral ode for the reptile. Whether his song was a hymn in praise of the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a>, or a lamentation over it, I cannot say; but there was a competition, and <a href=/people/1182 target=_blank>Eunomus</a> was playing the lyre in the heat of the day, at the time when grasshoppers, warmed by the sun, were singing under the leaves along the hills. They were singing, you see, not to the dead <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pytho</a>, but to the all-wise God, a spontaneous natural song, better than the measured strains of <a href=/people/1182 target=_blank>Eunomus</a>. A string breaks in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384222ROzo class=demonym long=22.2 lat=38.4>Locrian</a>'s hands; the grasshopper settles upon the neck of the lyre and begins to twitter there as if upon a branch: whereupon the minstrel, by adapting his music to the grasshopper's lay, supplied the place of the missing string. So it was not <a href=/people/1182 target=_blank>Eunomus</a> that drew the grasshopper by his song, as the legend would have it, when it set up the bronze figure at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pytho</a>, showing <a href=/people/1182 target=_blank>Eunomus</a> with his lyre, and his ally in the contest. No, the grasshopper flew of its own accord, and sang of its own accord, although the Greeks thought it to have been responsive to music. </p>                        </div>

For my own part, mere legend though they are, I cannot bear the thought of all the calamities that are worked up into tragedy; yet in your hands the records of these evils have become dramas, and the actors of the dramas are a sight that gladdens your heart. But as for the dramas and the Lenaean poets, who are altogether like drunken men, let us wreathe them, if you like with ivy, while they are performing the mad revels of the Bacchic rite, and shut them up, satyrs and frenzied rout and all, — yes, and the rest of the company of daemons too, — in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384228LHel class=place long=23.0154 lat=38.3207>Helicon</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233LCit class=place long=23.2506 lat=38.185>Cithaeron</a> now grown old; and let us bring down truth, with wisdom in all her brightness, from heaven above, to the holy mountain of God and the holy company of the prophets. Let truth, sending forth her rays of light into the farthest distance, shine everywhere upon those who are wallowing in darkness, and deliver men from their error, stretching out her supreme right hand, even understanding, to point them to salvation. And when they have raised their heads and looked up let them forsake <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384228LHel class=place long=23.0154 lat=38.3207>Helicon</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233LCit class=place long=23.2506 lat=38.185>Cithaeron</a> to dwell in <a href=/people/3694 target=_blank>Sion</a>; for out of <a href=/people/3694 target=_blank>Sion</a> shall go forth the law, and the Word of the Lord from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, that is, the heavenly Word, the true champion, who is being crowned upon the stage of the whole word.

Some men were deceived from the first about the spectacle of the heavens. Trusting solely to sight, they gazed at the movements of the heavenly bodies, and in wonder deified them, giving them the name of gods from their running motion [derived from <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, <a href=/people/3010 target=_blank>Cratylus</a> 397]. Hence they worshipped the sun, as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> do, and the moon, as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a> do.

Thereupon a certain man, <a href=/people/12512 target=_blank>Prosymnus</a> by name, promises to tell him; though not without reward. The reward was not a seemly one, though to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> it was seemly enough. It was a favour of lust, this reward which <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> was asked for. The god is willing to grant the request; and so he promises in the event of his return, to fulfil the wish of <a href=/people/12512 target=_blank>Prosymnus</a>, confirming the promise with an oath.

As a mystic memorial of this passion phalloi are set up to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> in cities.

If there are wounds there is also blood; for the ichor of the poets is a more disgusting thing even than blood, the word ichor meaning putrefaction of the blood. It is necessary, therefore, to supply the gods with attendance and nourishment, of which they are in need; so they have feasts, carousings, bursts of laughter and acts of sexual intercourse, whereas if they were immortal, and in need of nothing, and untouched by age, they would not partake of the pleasures of human love, nor beget children, nor even go to sleep. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> himself shared a human table among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a> [Iliad 1.423], and an inhuman and unlawful table when feasting with <a href=/people/717 target=_blank>Lycaon</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=person long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a> set before him, as a dainty dish, his own child, <a href=/people/3110 target=_blank>Nyctimus</a> by name, whom he had slaughtered.

Why then is it, O men, wisest of all living creatures, that we fly from savage wild beasts and turn aside if perchance we meet a bear or a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>, and As in a mountain glade when the wayfarer spieth a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>, swiftly turning his steps, his weak limbs trembling beneath him, backward he maketh his way; [Il 3.33] yet when faced by deadly and accursed daemons, you do not turn aside nor avoid them, although you have already perceived and know quite well that they are plotters and man-haters and destroyers? What possible truth could evil beings utter, or whom could they benefit? At any rate, I can at once prove to you that man is better than these gods of yours, the daemons; that <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> and <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> are better than <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> the prophet. Your <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a> is a lover of gifts but not of men. He betrayed his friend <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> [historical <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> king], and, forgetful of the reward he had received (such was his love of honour), led the king across the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416359WHal class=place long=35.883 lat=41.569>Halys</a> to his funeral pyre. This is how the daemons love; they guide men to the fire! But do thou, O man of kinder heart and truer speech than <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, pity him who lies bound upon the pyre. Do thou, <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>, utter an oracle of truth. Do thou, <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, bid the flaming pyre be quenched. Come to thy senses at the eleventh hour, <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a>, when suffering has taught thee better. Ungrateful is the whom thou dost worship. He takes the reward of gold, and then deceives thee once again. Mark! it is not the daemon, but the man who tells thee the issue of life. Unlike <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> utters no double-meaning prophecies. This oracle alone shalt thou find true, O barbarian. This shalt thou prove upon the pyre. </p>                        </div>

He says that <a href=/people/1486 target=_blank>Sesostris</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> king, having subdued most of the nations of Greece, brought back on his return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> a number of skilful craftsmen. He gave them personal orders, therefore, that a statue of <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> his own ancestor should be elaborately wrought at great expense; and the statue was made by the artist <a href=/people/2499 target=_blank>Bryaxis</a>, — not the famous <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, but another of the same name, — who has used a mixture of various materials in its construction. He had filings of gold, silver, bronze, iron, lead, and even tin; and not a single <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> stone was lacking, there being pieces of sapphire, hematite, emerald, and topaz also. Having reduced them all to powder and mixed the, he stained the mixture dark blue (on account of which the colour of the statue is nearly black), and, mingling the whole with the pigment left over from the funeral rites of <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> and <a href=/people/360 target=_blank>Apis</a>, he moulded <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Sarapis</a>; whose very name implies this connexion with the funeral rites, and the construction out of material for burial, Osirapis being a compound form <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> and <a href=/people/360 target=_blank>Apis</a>. </p>                        </div>

He consecrated <a href=/people/673 target=_blank>Antinous</a> in the same way that <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> consecrated <a href=/people/1283 target=_blank>Ganymedes</a>. For lust is not easily restrained, when it has no fear; and today men observe the sacred nights of <a href=/people/673 target=_blank>Antinous</a>, which were really shameful, as the lover who kept them with him well knew. Why, I ask, do you reckon as a god one who is honoured for fornication? Why did you order that he should be mourned for as a son? Why, too, do you tell the story of his beauty? <a href=/people/1588 target=_blank>Beauty</a> is a shameful thing when it has been blighted by outrage. Be not a tyrant, O man, over beauty, neither outrage him who is in the flower of his youth. Guard it in purity, that it may remain beautiful. Become a king over beauty, not a tyrant. Let is remain free. When you have kept its image pure, then I will acknowledge your beauty. Then I will worship beauty, when it is the true archetype of things beautiful.

As your instructor I will quote the prophetic <a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibyl</a>, Whose words divine come not from <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a>' lips, that prophet false, by foolish men called god, but from great God, whom no man's hands have made, like speechless idols framed from polished stone.

They are blackened by the cloud of smoke which is meant to honour them, but they heed neither the honour nor the insult. There is not a single living creature that is not more worthy of honour than these statues; and how it comes to pass that senseless things have been deified I am at a loss to know, and I deeply pity for their lack of understanding the men who are thus miserably wandering in error. For even though there are some living creatures which do not possess all the senses, as worms and caterpillars, and all those that appear to be imperfect from the first through the conditions of their birth, such as moles and the field-<a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mouse</a>, which <a href=/people/300 target=_blank>Nicander</a> calls blind and terrible; yet these are better than those images and statues which hare entirely dumb. For they have at any rate some one sense, that of hearing, let us say, or of touch, or something corresponding to smell or taste; but these statues do not even partake of one sense. There are also many kinds of living creatures, such as the oyster family, which possess neither sight nor hearing nor yet speech; nevertheless they live and grow and are even affected by the moon. But the statues are motionless things incapable of action or sensation; they are bound and nailed and fastened, melted, filed, sawn, polished, carved. The dumb earth is dishonoured when sculptors pervert its peculiar nature and by their art entice men to worship it; while the god-makers, if there is any sense in me, worship not gods and daemons, but earth and art, which is all the statues are. For a statue is really lifeless matter shaped by a craftsman's hand; but in our view the image of God is not an object of sense made from matter perceived by the senses, but a mental object. God, that is, the only true God, is perceived not by the sense but by the mind. </p>                        </div>

And if while at heart despising the statues they are unwilling to show themselves utterly contemptuous of them, their folly is exposed by the impotence of the very gods to whom the statues are dedicated. For instance, the tyrant <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> the younger stripped the statue of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> of its golden cloak and ordered it to be clothed with a woolen one, with the witty remark that this was better than the golden one, being both lighter in summer and warmer in winter. <a href=/people/1362 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404279UCyz class=person long=27.8878 lat=40.3895>Cyzicus</a>, when he was in want of money, ordered the golden statue of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, fifteen cubits high, to be melted down, and a similar statue of cheaper material covered with gold leaf to be set up in its place. Swallows also and most other birds settle on these very statues and defile them, paying no heed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=person long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympian</a> <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376232PEpi class=person long=23.1602 lat=37.6335>Epidaurian</a> <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>, no, nor yet to <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> <a href=/people/2067 target=_blank>Polias</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Sarapis</a>; and even their example does not bring home to you how destitute of feeling the statues are.

Now if <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a> or <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> or some other put his hands to such deeds in a fit of madness; and if one of them [<a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a>] slew the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> god <a href=/people/360 target=_blank>Apis</a>, while I laugh at the thought of him slaying their god, I am indignant when gain is the motive of the offence. I will therefore willingly forget these evil deeds, holding them to be works of covetousness and not an exposure of the helplessness of the idols. But fire and earthquakes are in no way intent on gain; yet they are not frightened or awed either by the daemons or by their statues, any more than are the waves by the pebbles strewn in heaps along the seashore.

For their forms are unmistakably stamped with the characteristic marks of the daemons. At least, if one were to go round inspecting the paintings and statues, he would immediately recognize your gods from their undignified figures; <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> from his dress, <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a> from his handicraft, <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a> from her woe, <a href=/people/311 target=_blank>Ino</a> from her veil, <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> from his trident, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> from his swan. The pyre indicates <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, and if one sees a woman represented naked, he understands it is golden <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>. So the well-known <a href=/people/2015 target=_blank>Pygmalion</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=person long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a> fell in love with an ivory statue; it was of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> and was naked. The man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a> is captivated by its shapeliness and embraces the statue. This is related by <a href=/people/2916 target=_blank>Philostephanus</a>. There was also an <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=place long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidus</a>, made of marble and beautiful. Another man fell in love with this and has intercourse with the marble, as <a href=/people/2540 target=_blank>Poseidippus</a> relates. The account of the first author is in his book on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>; that of the second in his book on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=place long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidus</a>. Such strength had art to beguile that it became for amorous men a guide to the pit of destruction. Now craftsmanship is powerful, but it cannot beguile a rational being, nor yet those who have lived according to reason. It is true that, through lifelike portraiture, pigeons have been known to fly towards painted doves, and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> to neigh at well-drawn mares. They say that a maiden once fell in love with an image, and a beautiful youth with a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=demonym long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidian</a> statue; but it was their sight that was beguiled by the art. For no man in his senses would have embraced the statue of a goddess, or have been buried with a lifeless paramour, or have fallen in love with a daemon and a stone. But in your case art has another illusion not to be in love with the statues and paintings, yet to honour and worship them. The painting, you say, is lifelike. Let the art be praised, but let it not beguile man by pretending to be truth. The <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> stands motionless; the dove flutters not; its wings are at rest. Yet the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a> of <a href=/people/310 target=_blank>Daedalus</a>, made of wood, infatuated a wild <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>; and the beast, led astray by the art, was constrained to approach a love-sick woman. Such insane passion did the arts, by their vicious artifices, implant in creatures without sense. Even monkeys know better than this. They astonish their rearers and keepers, because no manner of waxen or clay figures or girls' toys can deceive them. But you, strange to say, will prove yourselves inferior even to monkeys through the heed you pay to statues of stone and wood, gold and ivory, and to paintings. Such are the pernicious playthings made for you be marble-masons, sculptors, painters, carpenters and poets, who introduce this great multitude of gods, <a href=/people/185 target=_blank>Satyrs</a> and Pans in the fields, mountain and tree <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> in the woods, as well as <a href=/people/952 target=_blank>Naiads</a> about the lakes, rivers and springs, and <a href=/people/590 target=_blank>Nereids</a> by the sea.

For the prophet says, Thou shalt not make a likeness of anything that is in heaven above or in the earth beneath.

But as for you, while you take great pains to discover how a statue may be shaped to the highest possible pitch of beauty, you never give a thought to prevent yourselves turning out like statues owning to want of sense. Any way, with the utmost plainness and brevity the prophetic word refutes the custom of idolatry, when it says, All the gods of the nations are images of daemons; but God made the heavens, and the things in heaven. Some, it is true, starting from this pint, go astray, — I know not how, — and worship not God but His handiwork, the sun, moon, and the host of stars besides, absurdly supposing these to be gods, though they are but instruments for measuring time; for by His word were they firmly established; and all their power by the breath of His mouth. But while human handiwork fashions houses, ships, cities, paintings, how can I speak of all that God creates? See the whole universe; that is His work. Heaven, the sun, angels and men are the works of His fingers. How great is the power of God! His mere will is creation; for God alone created, since He alone is truly God. By a bare wish His work is done, and the world's existence follows upon a single act of His will. Here the host of philosophers turn aside, when they admit that man is beautifully made for the contemplation of heaven, and yet worship the things which appear in heaven and are apprehended by sight. For although the heavenly bodies are not the works of man, at least they have been created for man. Let none of you worship the sun; rather let him yearn for the maker of the sun. Let no one deify the universe; rather let him seek after the creator of the universe. It seems, then, that but one refuge remains for the man who is to reach the ages of salvation, and that is divine wisdom. From thence, as from a holy inviolate temple, no longer can any daemon carry him off, as he presses onward to salvation. </p>                        </div>

Perchance we may find philosophy herself, through vanity, forming her conceptions of the godhead out of matter; or else we may be able to show in passing that, when deifying certain divine powers, she sees the truth in a dream. Some philosophers, then, left us the elements as first principles of all things. Water was selected for praise by <a href=/people/263 target=_blank>Thales</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=person long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a>; air by <a href=/people/666 target=_blank>Anaximenes</a> of the same city, who was followed afterwards by <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424277PApo class=person long=27.693 lat=42.421>Apollonia</a>. Fire and earth were introduced as gods by <a href=/people/581 target=_blank>Parmenides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402152PEle class=person long=15.155 lat=40.1608>Elea</a>; but only one of this pair, namely fire, is god according to the supposition of both <a href=/people/1834 target=_blank>Hippasus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404168PMet class=person long=16.824 lat=40.383>Metapontum</a> and <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heracleitus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=person long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>. As to <a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373136PAkr class=person long=13.5855 lat=37.2906>Acragas</a>, he chooses plurality, and reckons love and strife in his list of gods, in addition to these four elements. </p>                        </div>

They did not, it is true, honour stocks or stones, but they made a god out of earth, which is the mother of these. They do not fashion a <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, but they adore water itself. For what in the world is <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, except a kind of liquid substance named from posis, drink? Just as, without a doubt, warlike <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> is so called from arsis and anairesis, abolition and destruction; which is the chief reason, I think, why many tribes simply fix their sword in the ground and then offer sacrifice to it as if to <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>. Such is the custom of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, as <a href=/people/670 target=_blank>Eudoxus</a> says in his second book of Geography, while the Sauromantians, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> tribe, worship a dagger, according to <a href=/people/1291 target=_blank>Hicesius</a> in his book on Mysteries. This too is the case with the followers of <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heracleitus</a> when they worship fire as the source of all; for this fire is what others named <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a>. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=person long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magi</a> and many of the inhabitants of Asia have assigned honour to fire; so have the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, as <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> says in the first volume of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> History. Why need I instance <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490315RSar class=ethnic long=31.5 lat=49>Sauromatians</a>, whom <a href=/people/2060 target=_blank>Nymphodorus</a> in Barbarian Customs reports as worshipping fire; or the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> and <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magi</a>? <a href=/people/2046 target=_blank>Dinon</a> says that these <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magi</a> sacrifice under the open sky, believing that fire and water are the sole elements of divinity. Even their ignorance I do not conceal; for although they are quite convinced that they are escaping the error of idolatry, yet they slip into another delusion. They do not suppose, like Greeks, that stocks and stones are emblems of divinity, nor ibises and ichneumons, after the manner of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>; but they admit fire and water, as philosophers do. It was not, however, till many ages had passed that they began to worship statues in human form, as <a href=/people/4093 target=_blank>Berosus</a> shows in his third book of <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldaean</a> History; for this custom was introduced by <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a> the son of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> and father of <a href=/people/748 target=_blank>Ochus</a>, who was the first to set up the statue of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> <a href=/people/3756 target=_blank>Anaitis</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus class=place long=48.247 lat=32.191>Susa</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348485UEcb class=place long=48.5166 lat=34.8054>Ecbatana</a>, and to enjoin this worship upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=ethnic long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrians</a>, upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335363UDam class=place long=36.311 lat=33.509>Damascus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=place long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardis</a>. Let the philosophers therefore confess that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490315RSar class=ethnic long=31.5 lat=49>Sauromatians</a>, and <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magi</a> are their teachers, from whom they have learnt the atheistic doctrine of their venerated first principles. The great original, the maker of all things, and creator of the first principles themselves, God without beginning, they know not, but offer adoration to these weak and beggarly elements, as the apostle calls them, made for the service of men. </p>                        </div>

Some of them celebrated the praises of the Infinite, as <a href=/people/1151 target=_blank>Anaximander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=person long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a>, <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384268PKla class=person long=26.7703 lat=38.3614>Clazomenae</a>, and <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. The two latter agreed in placing Mind above the Infinite; while on the other hand <a href=/people/935 target=_blank>Leucippus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=person long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a> and <a href=/people/435 target=_blank>Metrodorus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=person long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a> also left, as it seems, a pair of first principles, fullness and void. <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410250PAbd class=person long=24.9833 lat=40.95>Abdera</a> took these two and added to them images. Nor was this all; <a href=/people/564 target=_blank>Alcmaeon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391171PCro class=person long=17.129 lat=39.081>Croton</a> thought that the stars were endowed with life and therefore gods. I will not refrain from mentioning the audacity of these others. <a href=/people/365 target=_blank>Xenocrates</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=person long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a> intimates that the planets are seven gods and that the ordered arrangement of the fixed stars is an eighth. Nor will I omit the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoics</a>, who say that the divine nature permeates all matter, even in its lowest forms; these men simply cover philosophy with shame. At this point there is, I think, nothing to hinder me from mentioning the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetics</a> also. The father of this sect [<a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>], because he did not perceive the Father of all things, thinks that he who is called the Highest is the soul of the universe; that is today, he supposes the soul of the world to be God, and so is pierced with his own sword. For he first declares that providence extends only as far as the moon; then by holding the opinion that the universe is God he contradicts himself, asserting that that which has no share in God is God. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>'s disciple, the celebrated <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391259PEre class=person long=25.9348 lat=39.1341>Eresus</a>, suspects in one place that God is heaven, and elsewhere that God is spirit. <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> alone I will banish from memory, and that willingly, for he, pre-eminent in impiety, thinks that God has no care for the world. What of <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=person long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>?
