If you are inclined to explore the ocean, everything, with the god's help, will be provided for you as you would wish, unless you dread the boorishness of the Gauls and the winter climate. This, however, will turn out as the god sees fit; but I swear to you by him who is the giver and preserver of all my good fortune that I desire to live only that I may in some degree be of use to you. When I say you, I mean the true philosophers, and convinced as I am that you are one of these, how much I have loved and love you you well know, and how I desire to see you. May Divine Providence preserve you in health for many a year, my dearest and best beloved brother! I salute the admirable Hippia and your children. </p>                        </div>

Hunt up for me all the writings of <a href=/people/5048 target=_blank>Iamblichus</a> to his namesake. Only you can do this, for your sister's son-in-law owns a thoroughly revised version. And, if I am not mistaken, while I was writing this sentence, a marvellous sign was vouchsafed me. I entreat you not to let <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a> and his followers deafen you too by their assertions that <a href=/people/5048 target=_blank>Iamblichus</a>, that truly godlike man, who ranks next to <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> and <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, was worldly and self-seeking. But if it be rash to declare my own opinion to you, I may reasonably expect you to excuse me, as one excuses those who are carried away by a divine frenzy. You are yourself an ardent admirer of <a href=/people/5048 target=_blank>Iamblichus</a> for his philosophy and of his namesake for his theosophy. And I too think, like <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a>, that the rest are not worth mentioning compared with those two. As for your collection of the works of <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, so much I will say, you have made me style myself your pupil, though I have no right to the title. For while <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=person long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a> in six books was able to initiate me to some little extent into <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s logic, you, with one book, have made me, perhaps I may even say, a complete initiate in the philosophy of <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, but at any rate a thyrsus-bearer. When you join me I can prove the truth of my words by the great number of works that I wrote in my spare time, during last winter. </p>                        </div>

But if your old-time zeal still abides in you and has not been swiftly quenched like a brilliant flame, then I regard you as peculiarly blest. Four years have already passed, yes and almost three months besides, since we parted from one another. It would give me pleasure to observe how far you have progressed in this period. As for my own progress, if I can still so much as speak Greek it is surprising, such a barbarian have I become because of the places I have lived in. Do not despise the study of mere words or be careless of rhetoric or fail to read poetry. But you must devote still more attention to serious studies, and let your whole effort be to acquire understanding of the teachings of <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> and <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>. Let this be your task, the base, the foundation, the edifice, the roof. For all other studies are by the way, though they are completed by you with greater zeal than some bestow on really important tasks. I call sacred <a href=/people/194 target=_blank>Justice</a> to witness that I give you this advice because I love you like brothers. For you were my fellow-students and my very good friends. If therefore you follow my advice I shall love you the more, but if I see that you disregard it I shall grieve. And grief, if it lasts, usually results in something that, for the sake of a happier augury, I forbear to mention. </p>                        </div>

But I think that this time, if ever before, you have seen clearly into the future; for I too this very day saw a vision of the same sort. I thought that in a certain very spacious room a tall tree had been planted, and that it was leaning down to the ground, while at its root had sprouted another, small and young and very flourishing. Now I was very anxious on behalf of the small tree, lest someone in pulling up the large one should pull it up as well. And in fact, when I came close I saw that the tall tree was lying at full length on the ground, while the small one was still erect, but hung suspended away from the earth. Now when I saw this I said, in great anxiety, Alas for this tall tree! There is danger that not even its offspring will be preserved. Then one who was altogether a stranger to me said: </p>                        </div>

For since the root still remains in the earth, the smaller tree will be uninjured and will be established even more securely than before. So much then for my dreams. God knows what they portend. <br />As for that abominable eunuch, I should be glad to learn when he said these things about me, whether it was before he met me, or since. So tell me whatever you can about this. <br />But with regard to my behaviour towards him, the gods know that often, when he wronged the provincials, I kept silence, at the expense of my own honour; to some charges I would not listen, others I would not admit, others again I did not believe, while in some cases I imputed the blame to his associates. But when he thought fit to make me share in such infamy by sending to me to sign those shameful and wholly abominable reports, what was the right thing for me to do? Was I to remain silent, or to oppose him? The former course was foolish, servile and odious to the gods, the latter was just, manly and liberal, but was not open to me on account of the affairs that engaged me. What then did I do? In the presence of many persons who I knew would report it to him I said: </p>                        </div>

When he heard this, he was so far from behaving with discretion that he did things which, by heaven, no tyrant with any moderation would have done, and that too though I was so near where he was. In such a case what was the proper conduct for a man who is a zealous student of the teachings of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> and <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>? Ought I to have looked on while the wretched people were being betrayed to thieves, or to have aided them as far as I could, for they were already singing their swan-song because of the criminal artifices of men of that sort? To me, at least, it seems a disgraceful thing that, while I punish my military tribunes when they desert their post—and indeed they ought to be put to death at once, and not even granted burial— I should myself desert my post which is for the defence of such wretched people; whereas it is my duty to fight against thieves of his sort, especially when God is fighting on my side, for it was indeed he who posted me here. And if any harm to myself should result, it is no small consolation to have proceeded with a good conscience. But I pray that the gods may let me keep the excellent <a href=/people/926 target=_blank>Sallust</a>! If, however, it turns out that because of this affair I receive his successor, perhaps it will not grieve me. For it is better to do one's duty for a brief time honestly than for a long time dishonestly. The <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a> teachings are not, as some say, less noble than the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a>. In my judgement, there is only this difference between them; the former are always more sanguine and not so much the result of deliberate thought, while the latter have a greater claim to practical wisdom, and are more rigidly consistent with the rules of conduct that they have laid down. </p>                        </div>

Your letters I read at once, though I was not very well able to do so, but those of <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> I stored up for the next day.

Then <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> prided himself greatly on this, because he considered that he had given much for little; though after all it proved a grievous gift for <a href=/people/1719 target=_blank>Syloson</a>. Now consider my conduct compared with that of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>. In the first place I think that I have behaved better than he in one point at any rate, I mean that I did not wait to be reminded by another. But after preserving the memory of your friendship so long undimmed, the first moment that the god granted me power I summoned you, not among the second but among the very first. So much for the past. Now with reference to the future, will you allow me—for I am a prophet—to foretell something? I think that it will be far more prosperous than in the case I spoke of, only let not <a href=/people/1436 target=_blank>Adrasteia</a> take offence when I say so! For you need no king to help you to conquer a city, while I on the other hand need many to help me to raise up again what has fallen on evil days. Thus does my Gallic and barbarian <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> jest for your benefit. But be of good cheer and come, and may the gods attend you. <br />Added with his own hand.

In fact the gift is such as no doubt it well became you to give, while to me it is most agreeable to receive. With regard to your administration of affairs, inasmuch as you study to act in all cases both energetically and humanely, I am well pleased with it. For to blend mildness and moderation with courage and force, and to exercise the former towards the most virtuous, and the latter implacably in the case of the wicked for their regeneration, is, as I am convinced, a task that calls for no slight natural endowment and virtue. I pray that you may ever hold fast to these ambitions and may adapt them both solely to what is fair and honourable. Not without reason did the most eloquent of the ancient writers believe that this is the end and aim set for all the virtues.

But let me arrange what I have to tell in chronological order, though not till I have first offered thanks to the all-merciful gods, who at this present have permitted me to write, and will also perhaps permit us to see one another.

Then I approached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/472060UVes class=place long=6.0304 lat=47.2337>Vesontio</a>. It is a little town that has lately been restored, but in ancient times it was a large city adorned with costly sanctuaries, and was fortified by a strong wall and further by the nature of the place; for it is encircled by the river Doubis. It rises up like a rocky cliff in the sea, inaccessible, I might almost say, to the very birds, except in those places where the river as it flows round it throws out what one may call beaches, that lie in front of it. Near this city there came to meet me a certain man who looked like a <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynic</a> with his long cloak and staff. When I first caught sight of him in the distance, I imagined that he was none other than yourself. And when I came nearer to him I thought that he had surely come from you. The man was in fact a friend of mine though he fell short of what I hoped and expected. This then was one vain dream I had! And afterwards I thought that, because you were busied with my affairs, I should certainly find you nowhere outside of Greece. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> be my witness and great <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Helios</a>, mighty <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athene</a> and all the gods and goddesses, how on my way down to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a> from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a> I trembled for your safety! </p>                        </div>

Above all, it is right that you should learn how I became all at once conscious of the very presence of the gods, and in what manner I escaped the multitude of those who plotted against me, though I put no man to death, deprived no man of his property, and only imprisoned those whom I caught red-handed. All this, however, I ought perhaps to tell you rather than write it, but I think you will be very glad to be informed of it. I worship the gods openly, and the whole mass of the troops who are returning with me worship the gods. I sacrifice <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> in public.

CONSTANTINOPLE] <br />When I received your letter I was delighted, of course. How could I feel otherwise on learning that my comrade and dearest friend is safe? And when I had removed the fastening from it and perused it many times, I cannot convey to you in words my feelings and state of mind. I was filled with serenity and felicity and welcomed the letter as though I beheld in it an image, so to speak, of your noble disposition. To try to answer it point by point would take too long and perhaps I could not avoid excessive garrulity; but at any rate I shall not hesitate to say what it was that I especially approved. In the first place, the fact that the insolent behaviour to you of the Governor of Greece, if indeed a man of that sort can be called a Governor and not a tyrant, did not provoke your resentment, because you considered that none of these things had to do with you. Then again, that you are willing and eager to aid that city in which you had spent your time is a clear proof of the philosophic mind; so that in my opinion the former course is worthy of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, the latter, I should say, of <a href=/people/1297 target=_blank>Musonius</a>. For <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> declared that heaven would not permit a righteous man to be harmed by anyone inferior to him and worthless, while <a href=/people/1297 target=_blank>Musonius</a> concerned himself with the welfare of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376247IGya class=place long=24.732 lat=37.602>Gyara</a> when <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> decreed his exile. These two points in your letter I approve, but I am at a loss how to take the third. For you write to urge me to warn you whenever I think that you yourself do or say anything out of tune. For my part I could give you many proofs that I believe myself to be more in need than you are of such advice at the present time, but I will put that off till later. However the request is perhaps not even suitable for you to make; for you have abundant leisure, excellent natural gifts, and you love philosophy as much as any man who ever lived. And these three things combined sufficed to make <a href=/people/393 target=_blank>Amphion</a> known as the inventor of ancient music, namely, leisure, </p>                        </div>

For not even the lack of instruments avails to offset these gifts, but one who had these three for his portion could easily invent instruments also. Indeed, have we not received the tradition by hearsay that this very <a href=/people/393 target=_blank>Amphion</a> invented not only harmonies, but besides these the lyre itself, by employing either an almost godlike intelligence or some gift of the gods in a sort of extraordinary co-operation with them? And most of the great ones of old seem to have attained to genuine philosophy by setting their hearts on these three things above all, and not to have needed anything else. Therefore it is you who ought to stand by me and in your letters show your willingness to advise me what I ought to do and what not. For we observe in the case of soldiers that it is not those of them who are at peace who need allies, but, I should say, those who are hard pressed in war, and in the case of pilots those who are not at sea do not call to their aid those who are at sea, but those who are navigating call on those who are at leisure. Thus it has from the very first seemed right that men who are at leisure should help and stand by those who are occupied with tasks, and should suggest the right course of action, that is whenever they represent the same interests.

Though absent, you are winning to your cause the whole city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>. So keen a sting, like a <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>'s, have you left in her. This is natural; for I think that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> was right when he said One physician is worth many other men. And you are not simply a physician, but also a teacher of that art for those who desire to learn, so that I might almost say that what physicians are as compared with the mass of men, you are, compared with other physicians. This is the reason for putting an end to your exile, and with very great distinction for yourself.

CONSTANTINOPLE] <br />. . .is it not right to pay to human beings this respect that we feel for things made of wood? For let us suppose that a man who has obtained the office of priest is perhaps unworthy of it. Ought we not to show forbearance until we have actually decided that he is wicked, and only then by excluding him from his official functions show that it was the overhasty bestowal of the title of priest that was subject to punishment by obloquy and chastisement and a fine? If you do not know this you are not likely to have any proper sense at all of what is fitting. What experience can you have of the rights of men in general if you do not know the difference between a priest and a layman? And what sort of self-control can you have when you maltreated one at whose approach you ought to have risen from your seat? For this is the most disgraceful thing of all, and for it in the eyes of gods and men alike you are peculiarly to blame. Perhaps the bishops and elders of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Galilaeans</a> sit with you, though not in public because of me, yet secretly and in the house; and the priest has actually been beaten by your order, for otherwise your high-priest would not, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, have come to make this appeal. But since what happened in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> seems to you merely mythical, listen to the oracular words of the Lord of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374273SDid class=place long=27.2561 lat=37.3848>Didymus</a>, that you may see clearly that, even as in bygone days he nobly exhorted the Hellenes in very deed, so too in later times he admonished the intemperate in these words: Whosoever with reckless mind works wickedness against the priests of the deathless gods and plots against their honours with plans that fear not the gods, never shall he travel life's path to the end, seeing that he has sinned against the blessed gods whose honour and holy service those priests have in charge. Thus, then, the god declares that those who even deprive priests of their honours are detested by the gods, not to mention those who beat and insult them! But a man who strikes a priest has committed sacrilege. Wherefore, since by the laws of our fathers I am supreme pontiff, and moreover have but now received the function of prophecy from the god of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374273SDid class=place long=27.2561 lat=37.3848>Didymus</a>, I forbid you for three revolutions of the moon </p>                        </div>

This is the penalty that I award for your rash conduct. As for curses from the gods, men of old in days of old used to utter them and write them, but I do not think that this was well done; for there is no evidence at all that the gods themselves devised those curses.

Pegasius came to meet me, as I wished to explore the city,—-this was my excuse for visiting the sanctuaries,—and he was my guide and showed me all the sights. So now let me tell you what he did and said, and from it one may guess that he was not lacking in right sentiments towards the gods. <br /><a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a> has a hero's shrine there and his bronze statue stands in a little naiskos. Opposite this they have set up a figure of the great <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> in the unroofed court. If you have seen the spot you will certainly recognise my description of it. You can learn from the guides the story that accounts for the fact that great <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> was set up opposite to him and takes up the whole of the unroofed court. Now I found that the altars were still alight, I might almost say still blazing, and that the image of <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a> had been anointed till it shone. So I looked at Pegasius and said: What does this mean? Do the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a> offer sacrifices? This was to test him cautiously to find out his own views. He replied: Is it not natural that they should worship a brave man who was their own citizen, just as we worship the martyrs? Now the analogy was far from sound; but his point of view and intentions were those of a man of culture, if you consider the times in which we then lived. Observe what followed.

For these two things are the quintessence of their theology, to hiss at demons and sketch the sign of the cross on their foreheads. <br />These are the two things that I promised to tell you. But a third occurs to me which I think I must not fail to mention. This same Pegasius went with me to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399262UAch class=place long=26.1525 lat=39.915>Achilleion</a> as well and showed me the tomb in good repair; yet I had been informed that this also had been pulled to pieces by him.

Should I have appointed Pegasius a priest if I had any evidence of impiety towards the gods on his part?

For I certainly am not one of those who believe that the soul perishes before the body or along with it, nor do I believe any human being but only the gods; since it is likely that they alone have the most perfect knowledge of these matters, if indeed we ought to use the word likely of what is inevitably true; since it is fitting for men to conjecture about such matters, but the gods must have complete knowledge. <br />What then is this office which I say I now entrust to you? It is the government of all the sanctuaries in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, with power to appoint the priests in every city and to assign to each what is fitting. Now the qualities that befit one in this high office are, in the first place, fairness, and next, goodness and benevolence towards those who deserve to be treated thus. For any priest who behaves unjustly to his fellow men and impiously towards the gods, or is overbearing to all, must either be admonished with plain speaking or chastised with great severity.

You have good reason to obey me in such matters. Indeed in such a case I very seldom act offhand, as all the gods know, and no one could be more circumspect; and I avoid innovations in all things, so to speak, but more peculiarly in what concerns the gods. For I hold that we ought to observe the laws that we have inherited from our forefathers, since it is evident that the gods gave them to us. For they would not be as perfect as they are if they had been derived from mere men. Now since it has come to pass that they have been neglected and corrupted, and wealth and luxury have become supreme, I think that I ought to consider them carefully as though from their cradle. Therefore, when I saw that there is among us great indifference about the gods and that all reverence for the heavenly powers has been driven out by impure and vulgar luxury, I always secretly lamented this state of things. For I saw that those whose minds were turned to the doctrines of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> religion are so ardent in their belief that they would choose to die for it, and to endure utter want and starvation rather than taste pork or any animal that has been strangled or had the life squeezed out of it; whereas we are in such a state of apathy about religious matters that we have forgotten the customs of our forefathers, and therefore we actually do not know whether any such rule has ever been prescribed. </p>                        </div>

Come then, show it by your deeds and hasten to me, for you will come as friend to friend. It is true that continuous attention to public business is thought to be a heavy burden on men who pursue it with all their energy; but those who share the task of administration with me are, I am convinced, honest and reasonable men, intelligent and entirely capable for all they have to do. So they give me leisure and the opportunity of resting without neglecting anything. For our intercourse with one another is free from that hypocrisy of courts of which alone you have hitherto, I think, had experience, that hypocrisy which leads men to praise one another even while they hate with a hatred more deadly than they feel for their worst enemies in war. But we, though we refute and criticise one another with appropriate frankness, whenever it is necessary, love one another as much as the most devoted friends. Hence it is that I am able—if I may say so without odium— to work and yet enjoy relaxation, and when at work to be free from strain and sleep securely.

Accordingly I remit for you, down to the third assessment, the whole sum that is in arrears for the period preceding. But thereafter you will contribute as usual.

Thus by their actions they refute the reproaches brought against philosophy, and disprove the common opinion that those who pursue philosophy are useless to the state. For their country employs them for these tasks and they are now endeavouring to aid her to obtain justice by my assistance, as I in turn by yours. For this is indeed the only hope of safety left for the oppressed, that they may obtain a judge who has both the will and ability to give a fair decision. For if either of these qualities be lacking, so that he is either imposed on or faithless to his trust, then there is no help for it—the right must perish. But now, since we have judges who are all that we could wish, and yet are not able to plead because they did not appeal at the time, they beg that this disability may first of all be removed for them, and that the lack of energy of the man who at that time was the city's advocate and had the suit in charge may not be the cause of so great detriment to her for all time to come. <br />And we ought not to think it irregular that the case should again be brought to trial. For, though in the affairs of private persons it is expedient to forego a little one's advantage and the more profitable course, and thereby purchase security for the future—since in their little life it is pleasant, even for a little, to enjoy peace and quiet; moreover it is a terrible thought that one may die while one's case is on trial before the courts </p>                        </div>

Yet I do not deny that what he wrote to you was annoying and full of every kind of insolence and arrogance; but you must put up with it. For it becomes a good and great-souled man to make no counter charge when he is maligned. For, just as missiles that are hurled against hard, well-built walls, do not settle on them, or penetrate them, or stay where they strike, but rebound with increased force against the hand that throws them, just so every aspersion directed against an upright man, slander, calumny, or unmerited insolence, touches him not at all, but recoils on the head of him who made the aspersion. This is my advice to you, but the sequel will be for the law to decide, With regard, however, to the letters which he asserts you made public after receiving them from me, it seems to me ridiculous to bring them into court. For I call the gods to witness, I have never written to you or any other man a word that I am not willing to publish for all to see.

And if my letters did give emphatic proof of the kindly feeling that you and I have towards one another, did I wish this to be unknown or concealed? For what purpose? I call all the gods and goddesses to witness that I should not have resented it, even if someone had published abroad all that I ever wrote to my wife, so temperate was it in every respect. And if this or that person has read what I wrote to my own uncle, it would be fairer to blame the man who ferreted it out with such malevolence, rather than me, the writer, or you, or any other who read it. Nevertheless, concede this to me, do not let it disturb your peace of mind, only look at the matter thus—if <a href=/people/9675 target=_blank>Lauricius</a> is really dishonest get rid of him in a dignified way. But if he is a well-meaning person of average honesty, and has treated you badly, forgive him. For when men are honest in public life we must be on good terms with them, even though they do not behave properly to us in their private capacity. On the other hand, when men are dishonest in public affairs, even though they have won our favour, we must keep them under control; I do not mean that we must hate or avoid them, but keep careful watch on them, so that we may not fail to detect them when they misbehave, though if they are too hard to control in this way, we must not employ them at all.

So consider the fact that I did not write a proof of my goodwill. For it is often impracticable to make one's language harmonise with one's real sentiments. Then, too, letters from the Emperor to private persons might well lead to their display for bragging and making false pretences when they come into the hands of persons with no sense of propriety, who carry them about like seal-rings and show them to the inexperienced. Nay, genuine friendship is produced first and foremost by similarity of disposition, but a second kind is, when one feels true and not pretended admiration, and a humane, moderate and virtuous man is cherished by one who is his superior in fortune and intelligence. Moreover letters of this sort are full of conceit and nonsense, and, for my part, I often blame myself for making mine too long, and for being too loquacious when I might discipline my tongue to <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagorean</a> silence. <br />Yes, I received the tokens, namely, a silver bowl weighing one mina and a gold coin.

Well then, are the gods to be less honoured than our friends? You must use the same argument with reference to them, you must consider that they are our masters and we their slaves. It follows, does it not, that if one of us who call ourselves servants of the gods has a favourite slave who abominates the gods and turns from their worship, we must in justice either convert him and keep him, or dismiss him from the house and sell him, in case some one does not find it easy to dispense with owning a slave? </p>                        </div>

Nay, see to it that you and I do not introduce this tiresome convention of expecting the same ceremony from our friends as from mere chance acquaintances. At this point will somebody or other raise the question how we come to be friends when we have never seen one another? I answer: How are we the friends of those who lived a thousand, or, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, even two thousand years ago? It is because they were all virtuous, of upright and noble character. And we, likewise, desire to be such as they, even though, to speak for myself, we completely fail in that aspiration. But, at any rate, this ambition does in some degree rank us in the same category as those persons. But why do I talk at length about these trifles?

Therefore, when a man thinks one thing and teaches his pupils another, in my opinion he fails to educate exactly in proportion as he fails to be an honest man. And if the divergence between a man's convictions and his utterances is merely in trivial matters, that can be tolerated somehow, though it is wrong. But if in matters of the greatest importance a man has certain opinions and teaches the contrary, what is that but the conduct of hucksters, and not honest but thoroughly dissolute men in that they praise most highly the things that they believe to be most worthless, thus cheating and enticing by their praises those to whom they desire to transfer their worthless wares.

For these claim to teach, in addition to other things, not only the use of words, but morals also, and they assert that political philosophy is their peculiar field. Let us leave aside, for the moment, the question whether this is true or not. But while I applaud them for aspiring to such high pretensions, I should applaud them still more if they did not utter falsehoods and convict themselves of thinking one thing and teaching their pupils another. What! Was it not the gods who revealed all their learning to <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a>, <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>, <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a>, <a href=/people/222 target=_blank>Isocrates</a> and <a href=/people/142 target=_blank>Lysias</a>?1 Did not these men think that they were consecrated, some to <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, others to the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>? I think it is absurd that men who expound the works of these writers should dishonour the gods whom they used to honour. Yet, though I think this absurd, I do not say that they ought to change their opinions and then instruct the young. But I give them this choice; either not to teach what they do not think admirable, or, if they wish to teach, let them first really persuade their pupils that neither <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> nor <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> nor any of these writers whom they expound </p>                        </div>

It is true that, until now, there were many excuses for not attending the temples, and the terror that threatened on all sides absolved men for concealing the truest beliefs about the gods. But since the gods have granted us liberty, it seems to me absurd that men should teach what they do not believe to be sound. But if they believe that those whose interpreters they are and for whom they sit, so to speak, in the seat of the prophets, were wise men, let them be the first to emulate their piety towards the gods. If, however, they think that those writers were in error with respect to the most honoured gods, then let them betake themselves to the churches of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Galilaeans</a> to expound <a href=/people/3629 target=_blank>Matthew</a> and <a href=/people/6626 target=_blank>Luke</a>, since you <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Galilaeans</a> are obeying them when you ordain that men shall refrain from temple-worship.

Indeed, I have subjoined to this my decree the very words which he dared to write in his report: Although the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> are a match for the Hellenes in numbers, they are restrained by our admonition that no one disturb the peace in any place. For these are the very words of the bishop about you. You see how he says that your good behaviour was not of your own choice, since, as he at any rate alleged, you were restrained against your will by his admonitions! Therefore, of your own free will, seize your accuser and expel him from the city, but do you, the populace, live in agreement with one another, and let no man be quarrelsome or act unjustly. </p>                        </div>

In any case there are many of his pupils who can comfort well enough those itching ears of yours that yearn to hear impious words. I only wish that, along with <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a>, the wickedness of his impious school had been suppressed. But as it is you have a fine crowd of them and need have no trouble. For any man whom you elect from the crowd will be in no way inferior to him for whom you crave, at any rate for the teaching of the scriptures. But if you have made these requests because you are so fond of the general subtlety of <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a> —for I am informed that the man is a clever rascal —then you must know that for this very reason he has been banished from the city. For a meddlesome man is unfit by nature to be leader of the people. But if this leader is not even a man but only a contemptible puppet, like this great personage who thinks he is risking his head, this surely gives the signal for disorder.

For this obelisk <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> of blessed memory had a freight-boat built, because he intended to convey it to my native place, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>. But since by the will of heaven he has departed from this life to the next on that journey to which we are fated, the city claims the monument from me because it is the place of my birth and more closely connected with me than with the late Emperor. For though he loved the place as a sister I love it as my mother. And I was in fact born there and brought up in the place, and I cannot ignore its claims. Well then, since I love you also, no less than my native city, I grant to you also permission to set up the bronze statue in your city. A statue has lately been made of colossal size. If you set this up you will have, instead of a stone monument, a bronze statue of a man whom you say you love and long for, and a human shape instead of a quadrangular block of granite with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> characters on it. Moreover the news has reached me that there are certain persons who worship there and sleep at its very apex, and that convinces me beyond doubt that on account of these superstitious practices I ought to take it away. For men who see those persons sleeping there and so much filthy rubbish and careless and licentious behaviour in that place, not only do not believe that it is sacred, but by the influence of the superstition of those who dwell there come to have less faith in the gods. Therefore, for this very reason it is the more proper for you to assist in this business and to send it to my native city, which always receives you hospitably when you sail into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>, and to contribute to its external adornment, even as you contribute to its sustenance.

For when men fall under the displeasure of princes, the lightest consequence—and, as one might say, the most agreeable to a man of sense—is that they are at once relieved from the cares of business; and if they have to pay a small fine as well, their stumbling block is merely money; while the culmination of the prince's wrath, and the fate beyond all remedy as the saying is, is to lose their lives. Disregarding all these dangers, because, as you say, you had come to know me in my private capacity for the man I am —and in my common and generic capacity for the human being I am, though unknown to myself, late learner that I am!—why, in heaven's name, did you say that you were careful to avoid incurring displeasure </p>                        </div>

But if this is not the reason, perhaps there is a different one. Perhaps you do not wish to satirise them because they cannot feel it. But among the living is there anyone so foolish or so cowardly as to demand that you should take any notice of him at all, and who will not prefer if possible to be altogether ignored by you; but if that should be impossible, to be abused by you, as indeed I am now abused rather than honoured?

Of this I used to see many instances with my own eyes, and I have learned of more, by finding the records which are preserved against you. Moreover, when a tax was about to be levied on you again I prevented it, and compelled the impiety of such obloquy to cease here; and I threw into the fire the records against you that were stored in my desks; so that it is no longer possible for anyone to aim at you such a reproach of impiety. My brother <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> of honoured memory was not so much responsible for these wrongs of yours as were the men who used to frequent his table, barbarians in mind, godless in soul. These I seized with my own hands and put them to death by thrusting them into the pit, that not even any memory of their destruction might still linger amongst us. And since I wish that you should prosper yet more, I have admonished my brother <a href=/people/1160 target=_blank>Iulus</a>, your most venerable patriarch, that the levy which is said to exist among you should be prohibited, and that no one is any longer to have the power to oppress the masses of your people by such exactions; so that everywhere, during my reign, you may have security of mind, and in the enjoyment of peace may offer more fervid prayers for my reign to the Most High God, the Creator, who has deigned to crown me with his own immaculate right hand. For it is natural that men who are distracted by any anxiety should be hampered in spirit, and should not have so much confidence in raising their hands to pray; but that those who are in all respects free from care should rejoice with their whole hearts and offer their suppliant prayers on behalf of my imperial office to Mighty God, even to him who is able to direct my reign to the noblest ends, according to my purpose.

For after such a sight it is not permitted to approach the gods who are the cause of life and of all things least akin to decay. And I have still to mention what is worse than this. And what is that? The sacred precincts and temples of the gods lie open; and it often happens that in one of them someone is sacrificing or pouring libations or praying, at the moment when men carrying a corpse are passing close by the sanctuary itself, and the voice of lamentations and speech of ill omen is carried even to the altars. <br />Do you not understand that the functions belonging to the day and the night have been separated more than all other things? With good reason, therefore, has burial been taken out of the day and would be reserved for the night. For it is not right to deprecate the wearing of white for mourning and yet to bury the dead in the daytime and sunlight. The former was better, at least if it was not offensive to any of the gods, but the latter cannot escape being an act of impiety towards all the gods. For thereby men wrongly assign burial to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=demonym long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympian</a> gods and wrongly alienate it from the gods of the underworld, or whatever else the guardians and lords of souls prefer to be called. And I know that those who are thoroughly versed and punctilious in sacred rites think it right to perform at night the ritual to the gods below or in any case not till after the tenth hour of the day. </p>                        </div>

The road, I may say, was partly swamp, partly hill, but the whole of it was rough, and in the swamp lay stones which looked as though they had been thrown there purposely, as they lay together without any art, after the fashion followed also by those who build public highways in cities and instead of cement make a deep layer of soil and then lay the stones close together as though they were making a boundary-wall.

Also I conversed briefly with the senate about the worship of the gods. But though they all applauded my arguments very few were converted by them, and these few were men who even before I spoke seemed to me to hold sound views. But they were cautious and would not strip off and lay aside their modest reserve, as though afraid of too frank speech. For it is the prevailing habit of mankind, Ο ye gods, to blush for their noble qualities, manliness of soul and piety, and to plume themselves, as it were, on what is most depraved, sacrilege and weakness of mind and body. <br />Next, Batnae entertained me, a place like nothing that I have ever seen in your country, except <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361361UDap class=place long=36.1442 lat=36.13>Daphne</a>; but that is now very like Batnae, though not long ago, while the temple and statue were still unharmed, I should not have hesitated to compare <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361361UDap class=place long=36.1442 lat=36.13>Daphne</a> with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398227LOss class=place long=22.6869 lat=39.7969>Ossa</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394230LPel class=place long=23.046 lat=39.437>Pelion</a> or the peaks of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a>, or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399227LTem class=place long=22.576 lat=39.877>Tempe</a>, or even to have preferred it to all of them put together.

Its name is barbarous but the place is Hellenic; I say so because through all the country round about the fumes of frankincense arose on all sides, and I saw everywhere victims ready for sacrifice. But though this gave me very great pleasure, nevertheless it looked to me like overheated zeal, and alien to proper reverence for the gods. For things that are sacred to the gods and holy ought to be away from the beaten track and performed in peace and quiet, so that men may resort thither to that end alone and not on the way to some other business. But this matter will perhaps before long receive the attention that is appropriate. <br />Batnae I saw to be a thickly wooded plain containing groves of young cypresses; and among these there was no old or decaying trunk, but all alike were in vigorous leafage. The imperial lodging was by no means sumptuous, for it was made only of clay and logs and had no decorations; but its garden, though inferior to that of <a href=/people/10603 target=_blank>Alcinous</a>, was comparable to the garden of <a href=/people/520 target=_blank>Laertes</a>. In it was a quite small grove full of cypresses and along the wall many trees of this sort have been planted in a row one after the other. Then in the middle were beds, and in these, vegetables and trees bearing fruits of all sorts. What did I do there, you ask? I sacrificed in the evening and again at early dawn, as I am in the habit of doing practically every day. And since the omens were favourable, we kept on to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365379UHie class=place long=37.9477 lat=36.527>Hierapolis</a> where the inhabitants came to meet us.

But as regards the military or political arrangements, you ought, I think, to have been present to observe and pay attention to them yourself.

For not only do I seem to be with you continually and to converse with you, but I pay attention to my duties now just as zealously as when you were here to guide me. But if you do wish me to write to you, just as though you were not here, then take care that you do not yourself create the impression of not being with me all the more by your very wish that I should write. However, if you do really find pleasure in it I am willing to obey you in this also. At any rate, by your request, you will, as the proverb says, lead a galloping <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> into the plain. Come then, see that you return like for like, and in answer to my counter-summons do not grow weary of the unbroken series of letters exchanged between us. And yet I have no wish to hinder the zeal that you display on behalf of the public welfare, nevertheless, in proportion as I keep you free for the pursuit of noble studies, I shall be thought, far from injuring it, to benefit the whole body of Hellenes at once, that is to say, if I leave you like a young and well-bred <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> without interference, free to give all your time to tracking down, with a mind wholly free from all else, the art of writing discourses; but if you possess such swiftness that you need neither neglect your friends nor slacken in those other pursuits, come, take both courses and run at full speed! </p>                        </div>

And the wise <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> calls silver shining, and gives to water the epithet silvery because it gleams with the very brightness of the reflected image of the sun, as though under its direct rays. And <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a> the fair says that the moon is silvery, and that because of this it dims the radiance of the other stars. Similarly one might imagine silver to be more appropriate to the gods than gold; but that to man, at any rate, silver is more precious than gold and more familiar to them because it is not, like gold, hidden under the earth and does not avoid their eyes, but is both beautiful to the eye and more serviceable in daily life,— this, I say, is not my own theory but was held by men of old. If, therefore, in return for the gold coin sent by you I give you a piece of silver of equal value, think not that the favour is less and do not imagine that, as with <a href=/people/1197 target=_blank>Glaucus</a>, the exchange is to your disadvantage; for perhaps not even <a href=/people/1525 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> would have exchanged silver armour for golden, seeing that the former is far more serviceable than the latter, and like lead well fitted to turn the points of spears.

For it is possible for much to be revealed in little. Nay even <a href=/people/402 target=_blank>Pheidias</a> the wise artist not only became famous for his statue at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a> or at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, but he knew also how to confine a work of great art within the limits of a small piece of sculpture; for instance, they say that his grasshopper and <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>, and, if you please, his fly also, were of this sort; for every one of these, though naturally composed of bronze, through his artistic skill became a living thing. In those works, however, the very smallness of the living models perhaps contributed the appearance of reality to his skilful art; and do you, please, look at his <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> hunting on horseback, for its whole measurement is no larger than a fingernail. Yet the marvellous skill of the workmanship is so lavished on every detail that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> at one and the same time strikes his quarry and intimidates the spectator, scaring him by his whole bearing, while the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, reared on the very tips of his hoofs, is about to take a step and leave the pedestal, and by creating the illusion of vigorous action is endowed with movement by the artist's skill. This is exactly the effect that you have on me, my excellent friend. For after having been crowned often, already, as victor over the whole course, so to speak, in the lists of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, the God of <a href=/people/736 target=_blank>Eloquence</a>, you now display the highest pitch of excellence in a few written words.

But if even from me you require some of what you call friendly smoke, I shall not begrudge it. Surely the <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mouse</a> who saved the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> in the fable is proof enough that something useful may come even from one's inferiors. </p>                        </div>

For not only does the event in itself call for sorrow, when a young and virtuous wife, the joy of her husband's heart, and moreover the mother of precious children, is prematurely snatched away like a torch that has been kindled and shines brightly, and in a little while its flame dies down, but over and above this, the fact that it is you to whom this sorrow has come seems to me to make it still more grievous. For least of all men did our good <a href=/people/7767 target=_blank>Himerius</a> deserve to experience any affliction, excellent orator that he is, and of all my friends the best beloved. Moreover, if it were any other man to whom I had to write about this, I should certainly have had to use more words in dealing with it; for instance, I should have said that such an event is the common lot, that we must needs submit, that nothing is gained by excessive grief, and I should have uttered all the other commonplaces considered appropriate for the alleviation of suffering, that is if I were exhorting one who did not know them. But since I think it unbecoming to offer to a man who well knows how to instruct others the sort of argument by which one must school those who are too ignorant for self-control, see now, I will forbear all such phrases; but I will relate to you a fable, or it may be a true story, of a certain wise man, which perhaps is not new to you, though it is probably unfamiliar to most people; and if you will use this and this alone, as though it were a drug to relieve pain, you will find release from your sorrow, as surely as from that cup which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a> woman is believed to have offered to <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a> when his need was as great as your own. Now the story is that when <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> was in great grief for the death of a beautiful wife, <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410250PAbd class=person long=24.9833 lat=40.95>Abdera</a> could not by any argument succeed in consoling him; and so he promised him that he would bring back the departed to life, if <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> were willing to undertake to supply him with everything necessary for the purpose. <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> bade him spare no expense but take whatever he needed and make good his promise. After waiting a little, <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> said that he was provided with everything else for carrying out his task, but still needed one thing only, which he himself did not know how to obtain; <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, however, as King of all <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, would perhaps find it without difficulty. And when the King asked him what it might be, this great thing which it was possible for only a king to know of, they say that <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> in reply declared that if he would inscribe on his wife's tomb the names of three persons who had never mourned for anyone, she would straightway come to life again, since she could not disobey the authority of this mystic rite. Then <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> was in a dilemma, and could not find any man who had not had to bear some great sorrow, whereupon <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> burst out laughing, as was his wont, and said: Why, then, Ο most absurd of men, do you mourn without ceasing, as though you were the only man who had ever been involved in so great a grief, you who cannot discover a single person of all who have ever lived who was without his share of personal sorrow? But though it was necessary to say these things to <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, a barbarian and a man of no education, the slave both of pleasure and of grief, you, on the other hand, are a Greek, and honour true learning, and you must find your remedy from within; for surely it would be a disgrace to the reasoning faculty if it had not the same potency as time. </p>                        </div>

For it is right that the inferior, in so far as it is inferior, should yield to the superior, that is if it is to know what is appropriate to itself and what is not. But he who has conceived the hope of matching his mortal song with inspired music has surely never heard of the sad fate of <a href=/people/2464 target=_blank>Marsyas</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=person long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a>, or of the river which is named after him and bears witness to the punishment of that insane flute-player, nor has he heard of the end of <a href=/people/1343 target=_blank>Thamyris</a>, the Thracian who, in an evil hour, strove in song against the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. Need I mention the <a href=/people/605 target=_blank>Sirens</a>, whose feathers the victorious <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> still wear on their brows? But each one of those that I have named is still even now paying in the tradition the fitting penalty for his boorishness and temerity, and I, as I said, ought to have stayed within my own boundaries and held my peace while I enjoyed my fill of the music uttered by you, like those who receive in silence the oracle of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> when it issues from the sacred shrine. But since you yourself furnish me with the keynote of my song, and by your words, as though with the wand of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, arouse and wake me from sleep, lo now, even as when <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> strikes his thyrsus his followers rush riotous to the dance, so let me too in response to your plectron make answering music, like those who accompany the choirmaster, keeping time to the call of the rhythm. And in the first place let me make a first-offering to you, since this is your pleasure, of the speeches which I recently composed at the Emperor's command in honour of the glorious bridging of the strait, though what I offer you is returning small for great and in very truth bronze for gold; yet I am entertaining our <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> with such fare as I have. Surely <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a> did not disdain the plain meal that <a href=/people/11069 target=_blank>Hecale</a> provided, but knew how to content himself with humble fare when the need arose. Nor was <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a>, the god of shepherds, too proud to set to his lips the pipe of the boy neat-herd. Then do you also in your turn accept my discourse in a gracious spirit and do not refuse to lend your mighty ear to my humble strain. But if it has any cleverness at all, then not only is my discourse itself fortunate but so too is its author, in that he has obtained the testimony of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athene</a>'s vote. And if it still needs a finishing touch to complete it as a whole, do not refuse to add to it yourself what it needs. Before now the god in answer to prayer has stood by the side of a bowman and set his hand to the arrow, and again, when a bard was playing the cithara and singing a high and stirring strain, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> god, when the string failed, assumed the guise of a cicada and uttered a note of the same tone. </p>                        </div>

And you demand one of two things, that I should go to you or that you yourself should come to me. To my mind one of these alternatives is both desirable and expedient, I mean that I should go to you and benefit by the blessings that you bestow, while the other surpasses all my prayers. But since this is impossible for you and inexpedient, do you remain at home and prosper and preserve the tranquillity that you enjoy, while I will endure with a brave spirit whatever God may send.

But though I have undergone the alarms of war, the rigour of a siege, the wandering of exile and all sorts of terrors, and moreover the extreme cold of winter, the dangers of disease and countless mischances of many kinds in my journey from Upper <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=place long=19 lat=45>Pannonia</a> till I crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=demonym long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedonian</a> straits, I may say that nothing so painful or so distressing has happened to me as the fact that after I left the East I have not, for so long a time, seen you, the universal blessing of the Hellenes. So do not be surprised if I say that a sort of mist and thick cloud overshadows my eyes. For only then will a clear atmosphere and the brilliant light of the sun, and, so to speak, the fairest and truest springtime of my life, encompass me when I can embrace you, the delight and glory of the whole world, and, like the true son of a noble father who when hope is given up is seen returning from war, it may be, or from the stormy billows of the sea, can proceed to recount to you all that I have suffered and what dangers I have been through, and as I, so to speak, ride safely on a sacred anchor, can find at last a sufficient consolation for my misfortunes. For naturally it is a consolation and lightens the weight of sorrow when one unburdens one's experiences to others and shares with them the knowledge of one's sufferings in the intercourse of speech. Meanwhile, however, with what means I have I will, so far as I can approach you; and indeed I shall not cease, for the whole period of our separation, to conciliate you with letters by way of a token. And if I only receive the like from you, I shall be somewhat more submissive and shall hold converse with your letters, regarding them as a sort of symbol that you are safe and well. Do you, then, graciously accept what arrives from me, and show yourself still more gracious in making requital, since every noble utterance of yours, every written word, is reckoned by me as equivalent to the voice of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> the god of eloquence, or to the hand of <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>. </p>                        </div>

You have indeed come, even though absent, by means of your letter—And I was yearning for thee, and thou didst set ablaze my heart, already aflame with longing for thee. Nay, I neither refuse the love-philtre nor do I ever leave you at all, but with my soul I behold you as though you were present, and am with you when absent, and nothing is enough to quench my insatiate desire. Moreover, you also never slacken, but without ceasing you benefit those who are present with you and by your letters not only cheer but even heal those who are absent. At any rate, when someone not long ago gave me the news that a friend had come and brought letters from you, it happened that for three days I had been suffering from a disorder of the stomach, and in fact I was in acute physical pain, so that I was not even free from fever. But, as I said, when I was told that the person who had the letters was at my door I jumped up like one possessed, who has lost control of himself, and rushed out before what I wanted could arrive. And the moment that I merely took the letter in my hands, I swear by the very gods and by the love that burns in me for you, that instant my pains forsook me and at once the fever let me go, as though it were abashed by some manifest saving presence. But when I broke the seal and read the letter, can you imagine what feelings took possession of my soul at that moment or with what delight I was filled, or how I praised to the skies that dearest of winds, to quote your words, the lover's wind in very truth, the messenger of glad tidings—and loved it with good reason, since it had done me this service of bringing a letter from you, and like a winged thing had guided straight to me, with a fair and hurrying blast, that letter which brought me not only the pleasure of hearing good news of you but also salvation at your hands in my own illness? But how could I describe my other sensations when first I read the letter, or how could I find adequate words to betray my own passion? How often did I hark back from the middle to the beginning? How often did I fear that I should finish it before I was aware? How often, as though I were going round in a circle in the evolutions of a strophe, did I try to connect the contents of the last paragraph with the first, just as though in a song set to music I were making the leading note of the beginning the same as the closing bars of the measure? Or how describe what I did next—how often I held the letter to my lips, as mothers embrace their children, how often I kissed it with those lips as though I were embracing my dearest sweetheart, how often I invoked and kissed and held to my eyes even the superscription which had been signed by your own hand as though by a clear cut seal, and how I clung to the imprint of the letters as I should to the fingers of that sacred right hand of yours! I too wish thee joy in full measure, as fair <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a> says, and not only  for just so long as we have been parted from one another, but may you rejoice evermore, and write to me and remember me with kindly thoughts. For no time shall ever pass by me in which I shall forget you, in any place, at any hour, in any word I speak. But if ever <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> permits me to return to my native land, and once more I humbly approach that sacred hearth of yours, do not spare me hereafter as you would a runaway, but fetter me, if you will, to your own beloved dwelling, making me captive like a deserter from the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, and then discipline me with such penalties as suffice for my punishment. Assuredly I shall submit to your jurisdiction not unwillingly, but with a good will and gladly, as to a kind father's provident and salutary correction. Moreover, if you would consent to trust me to sentence myself and allow me to suffer the penalty that I prefer, I would gladly fasten myself to your tunic, my noble friend, so that I might never for a moment leave your side but be with you always and closely attached to you wherever you are, like those two-bodied beings invented in the myths. Unless, indeed, in this case also the myths, though they tell us the story in jest, are describing in enigmatical words an extraordinary sort of friendship and by that close tie of a common being express the kinship of soul in both beings. </p>                        </div>

This, then, you ought to do also, as though you were the physician of souls endowed with eloquence, and you ought to keep up on all occasions the preaching of virtue, like a skilled archer who, even though he have no opponent, keeps training his hand by every means in view of future need. For in truth we two have not the same ambition, since mine is to secure the wise teachings that flow from you and yours is to read letters sent by me. But as for me, though I should write ten thousand times, mine is still mere child's play, and I am like the boys in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> who on the sea-shores model something in wet sand and then abandon it all for the sea to wash away; whereas even a short letter from you is more potent than any fertilising flood, and for my part I would rather receive one letter from <a href=/people/10860 target=_blank>Iamblichus</a> than possess all the gold of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a>. If, then, you care at all for your fond admirers—and you do care if I am not mistaken—do not neglect me who am like a fledgling constantly in need of sustenance from you, but write regularly, and moreover do not be reluctant to feast me on the good things that come from you. And if I prove to be remiss, do you take on yourself to provide both things, not only what you yourself give but equally what you furnish in my place. For it befits you as a pupil of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, the god of eloquence, or, if you prefer, his nursling, to desire to imitate his use of the wand, not by putting men to sleep, but by rousing and awakening them. </p>                        </div>

Why then do you liken me to the immortals? But I might say that I do not exist at all among men so long as I am not with <a href=/people/10860 target=_blank>Iamblichus</a>. Nay, I admit that I am your lover, even as <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> that he was the father of <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a>. For even though someone should say that I am unworthy, not even so shall he deprive me of my longing. For I have heard that many men have fallen in love with beautiful statues and far from injuring the art of the craftsman they have by their passion for them imparted to the workmanship the added delight in what lives and breathes. But as for the wise men of old among whom you are pleased to reckon me in jest, I should say that I fall as far short of them as I believe that you are to be ranked among them. And indeed you have succeeded in combining with yourself not only <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> or <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> or most ancient <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>, but also that whole genius of the Hellenes which is on record as having attained to the summit of philosophy, even as in a lyre by the harmonious combination of various notes the perfection of music is achieved. And just as the myths give <a href=/people/2816 target=_blank>Argus</a>, <a href=/people/389 target=_blank>Io</a>'s guardian, an encircling ring of ever-wakeful eyes as he keeps watch over the darling of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, so too does true report endow you, the trusted guardian of virtue, with the light of the countless eyes of culture. They say that <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> used to change himself into various shapes as though he feared being taken unawares and showing those who needed his aid that he was wise. But for my part, if <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a> was really wise and the sort of man to know the truth about many things, as <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> says, I applaud him for his talent, but I cannot admire his attitude of mind, since he played the part, not of one who loves mankind, but of an impostor by concealing himself in order to avoid being of service to mankind. But who, my noble friend, would not genuinely admire you, since though you are inferior in no way to wise <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a> if not even more fully initiated than he in consummate virtues, you do not begrudge mankind the blessings that you possess, but, like the bright sun, you cause the rays of your pure wisdom to shine on all men, not only by associating, as is natural, with those near you, but also as far as possible by making the absent proud through your writings. And in this way by your achievements you surpass even charming <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>; for he squandered on the ears of wild beasts his own peculiar musical gift, but you, as though you had been born to save the whole human race, emulate everywhere the hand of <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a> and pervade all things with the saving power of your eloquence. Wherefore I think that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, too, if he were to return to life, would with far more justice allude to you in the verse: <br />One is still alive and is detained in the wide world. <br />For, in very truth, for those of us who are of the antique mould, a sacred spark, so to speak, of true and life-giving culture is kindled by your aid alone. And grant, Ο <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the saviour, and <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, god of eloquence, that this blessing which is the common property of the whole world, even the charming <a href=/people/5048 target=_blank>Iamblichus</a>, may be preserved for the longest possible period of time! Indeed, there is no doubt that in the case of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> and <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> and <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> and others who were worthy to be of that company, the prayers of the just were successful and did avail men of old, and thus increased and prolonged the natural term of those great men's lives. So there is no reason why in our day, also, a man who in his eloquence and virtuous life is the peer of those famous men, should not by means of similar prayers be conducted to the extreme limit of old age for the happiness of mankind. </p>                        </div>

But I am sending you a hundred long-stalked, dried, homegrown figs as a sweet token of this pleasant festal season. If you measure the gift by its size, the pleasure I offer you is trifling, but if measured by its beauty it will perhaps suffice. It is the opinion of <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> that figs are sweeter than anything else except honey, and on second thoughts he does not allow that even honey is sweeter than figs. <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> the historian also, in order to describe a really barren desert thought it enough to say: They have no figs or anything else that is good; as though to say that among the fruits of the earth there is none to be ranked above figs, and that where men had figs they did not wholly lack something good. Again, the wise <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> praises other fruits for their size or colour or beauty, but to the fig alone he allows the epithet sweet. And he calls honey yellow, for fear he should inadvertently call sweet what is in fact often bitter; accordingly, to the fig alone he assigns this epithet for its own, just as he does to nectar, because alone of all things it is sweet. Indeed <a href=/people/197 target=_blank>Hippocrates</a> says that honey, though it is sweet to the taste, is quite bitter to the digestion, and I can believe his statement; for all agree that it produces bile and turns the juices to the very opposite of its original flavour, which fact even more surely convicts it of being in its origin naturally bitter. For it would not change to this bitterness if in the beginning this quality had not belonged to it, from which it changed to the reverse. </p>                        </div>

And it is so beneficial to mankind that <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> even says that it is an antidote for every deadly poison, and that for no other reason than this is it served before other food as a first course at meals and then at the end for dessert, as though we embraced it in preference to any other sacred means of averting the injury caused by the things we eat. Moreover, that the fig is offered to the gods also, and is set on the altar in every sacrifice, and that it is better than any frankincense for making fragrant fumes, this is a statement not made by me alone, but whoever is acquainted with its use knows that it is the statement of a wise man, a hierophant. Again, the admirable <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> in his precepts of agriculture, when he is describing the kinds of grafted trees and what sorts admit of being grafted on one another, commends the fig tree above all other plants, if I am not mistaken, as being able to receive various and different kinds, and as the only one of them all that easily bears a growth of any other sort, if you cut out every one of its boughs and then break off and insert a different engrafted stock into each of the cleft stumps; hence to look at it is often equivalent to a complete garden, since it returns you the variegated and manifold splendours of other fruits, as happens in the loveliest orchard.

Hence <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> also says that in the garden of <a href=/people/10603 target=_blank>Alcinous</a> the fruits wax old on one another. Now in the case of other fruits this might perhaps seem to be a poetic fiction, but for the fig alone it would be consistent with the plain fact, because alone of all fruits it lasts for some time. Such, I think, is the nature of the fig in general, but the kind that grows with us is much better than others; so that in proportion as the fig is more valuable than other plants, our fig is more admirable than the fig in general; and while the latter in its kind surpasses all other fruits, it is in its turn excelled by ours, and again holds its own by comparison in both respects, first in being plainly superior, and secondly, in points where it seems to be inferior it wins on the general count. And it is quite natural that this should be so in our country alone. For it was fitting, I think, that the city which in very truth belongs to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and is the eye of the whole East,—I mean sacred and most mighty <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335363UDam class=place long=36.311 lat=33.509>Damascus</a>,— which in all other respects bears the palm, for instance, for the beauty of its shrines and the size of its temples and for its exquisitely tempered climate and the splendour of its fountains, the number of its rivers and the fertility of its soil— I say it is fitting that she alone should keep up her reputation by the possession of a plant of this excellence and thus excite an excess of admiration. Accordingly our tree does not brook transplanting, nor does it overstep the natural boundaries of its growth, but as though by a law that governs the indigenous plant refuses to grow in colonies abroad.

Moreover it even adorns the imperial table and is the boast and ornament of every feast; and there is no cake or roll or pastry or any kind of confectionery to match it as a sweetmeat wherever it comes; so far does it surpass in admirable qualities all other dainties, and moreover all figs from any other place. Again, other figs are either eaten in autumn, or are dried and go to the store-room, but the fig of our country alone can be used in both ways, and though it is good while on the tree it is far better when it has been dried. And should you see with your own eyes their beauty while they are still on the trees, and how from each one of the branches they hang by long stalks like flower-buds, so to speak, or again, how with their fruit they completely encircle the tree, then you would say that by this circular series one above another they compose a splendid and varied picture even as a neck in its necklace. </p>                        </div>

For they are not, like other kinds of figs, thrown together in one place, nor are they dried in the sun in heaps or promiscuously; but first they are gathered carefully by hand from the trees, then they are hung-on walls by means of sticks or thorny twigs, so that they may be bleached by exposure to the direct rays of the sun while they are also safe from the attacks of animals and small birds, since the protection of the prickles furnishes them with a sort of bodyguard. So far my letter to you deals with their origin, sweetness, beauty, confection, and use, and is in lighter vein. <br />Now to consider the number one hundred, which is more honourable than any other and contains in itself the perfection of all numbers, as one may learn from the following considerations. I am indeed well aware that there is a saying of wise men of old that an odd number is to be preferred to an even, and they declare that the source of increase is that which does not couple. For in a pair the one term being equal to the other remains of the same quality, but when there are two numbers the third produces oddness. But for my part, even though the statement is somewhat bold, I would nevertheless say this: Numbers surely depend on a generative principle, and can carry on consecutive increase through the whole series. But I hold that it is far more just to assign the cause of that increase to the even than to the odd number. </p>                        </div>

But its coupling with two produces twofold oddness, and the number three, coming from the two, naturally proceeds as increase. Then again when we add two to two, the result is the higher stage of the number four, and, in a word, their conjunction, while making oddness clear in each of their two elements, is constituted in the number two. This being granted, I should say, of course, that when the first decad is revolving on itself in a circle, the whole series progresses to the number one hundred, so that by the number one the increase amounts to ten, and the decad in turn is added each time to itself, and the total is reached in the number one hundred. And starting again from this point, with the hundreds, the whole series of numbers derive their power, by the activity of the number one, except that it is the number two when combined with it that ever produces the odd and again recalls it to itself, until again it concludes with a second hundred the sum of all the numbers, and, making it complete, proceeds again from it to another and under the denomination of hundreds continually carries forward the sum to the conception of infinity. So I think that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> too in his poems does not lightly or idly assign to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the hundred-tasselled aegis, but in a lofty and obscure saying he hinted at this that </p>                        </div>

Again, on the same principle he makes <a href=/people/1609 target=_blank>Briareus</a> with his hundred hands the assessor of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and allows him to rival his father's might, as though he expressed the perfection of his strength by means of the perfect number.

For it gave me comfort when I was troubled and pained at the first reports that came to me. You will understand what I mean. It came to my ears that you had abandoned your former mode of worship which was handed down by our ancestors, and goaded by some evil kind of madness that incited you to this, had betaken yourself to that vain superstition. What pain should I not have suffered? For just as whenever I learn by public rumour of any noble quality in you I regard it as a personal gain, so too if I hear of anything disturbing, which, however, I do not think I shall, in the same way I consider it even more my personal loss. Therefore when I was troubled about these matters, the presence of our father <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a> cheered me, for he reported the very contrary, which was what I prayed to hear. Moreover he said that you were zealous in attendance at the houses of prayer, and that you are not being drawn away from pious remembrance of the martyrs, and he affirmed that you entirely adhere to the religion of our family. So I would say to you in the words of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, Shoot on in this wise, and rejoice those who love you by being spoken of in such terms, remembering that nothing is higher than religion. For supreme virtue teaches us to hate a lie as treachery and to cling to the truth, which truth is most clearly made manifest in the worship of the Divine Being. For a crowd is wholly contentious and unstable; but the Deity, ministering alone with but one other, rules the universe, not by division or lot, like the sons of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronos</a>, but existing from the beginning and having power over all things, not having received it from another by violence, but existing before all.

For just as those who are in agreement with their masters about their friendships and ambitions and loves are more kindly treated than their fellow slaves, so we must suppose that God, who naturally loves human beings, has more kindness for those men who love their fellows. Now philanthropy has many divisions and is of many kinds. For instance it is shown when men are punished in moderation with a view to the betterment of those punished, as schoolmasters punish children; and again in ministering to men's needs, even as the gods minister to our own. You see all the blessings of the earth that they have granted to us, food of all sorts, and in an abundance that they have not granted to all other creatures put together.

Now the crowd when they see such men blame the gods. However it is not the gods who are to blame for their poverty, but rather the insatiate greed of us men of property becomes the cause of this false conception of the gods among men, and besides of unjust blame of the gods.

And of the present time I will say nothing, for it would be altogether irrational of me to compare the expenditure of private persons with that of an Emperor; but when I was myself still a private person I know that this happened to me many times. My grandmother's estate for instance was kept for me untouched, though others had taken possession of it by violence, because from the little that I had I spent money on those in need and gave them a share. <br />We ought then to share our money with all men, but more generously with the good, and with the helpless and poor so as to suffice for their need. And I will assert, even though it be paradoxical to say so, that it would be a pious act to share our clothes and food even with the wicked. For it is to the humanity in a man that we give, and not to his moral character. Hence I think that even those who are shut up in prison have a right to the same sort of care; since this kind of philanthropy will not hinder justice. For when many have been shut up in prison to await trial, of whom some will be found guilty, while others will prove to be innocent, it would be harsh indeed if out of regard for the guiltless we should not bestow some pity on the guilty also, or again, if on account of the guilty we should behave ruthlessly and inhumanly to those also who have done no wrong.

It follows therefore that we are all kinsmen, whether, many men and women as we are, we come from two human beings, or whether, as the gods tell us, and as we ought to believe, since facts bear witness thereto, we are all descended from the gods. And that facts bear witness that many men came into the world at once, I shall maintain elsewhere, and precisely, but for the moment it will be enough to say this much, that if we were descended from one man and one woman, it is not likely that our laws would show such great divergence; nor in any case is it likely that the whole earth was filled with people by one man; nay, not even if the women used to bear many children at a time to their husbands, like <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>. But when the gods all together had given birth to men, just as one man came forth, so in like manner came forth many men who had been allotted to the gods who rule over births; and they brought them forth, receiving their souls from the Demiurge from eternity. <br />It is proper also to bear in mind how many discourses have been devoted by men in the past to show that man is by nature a social animal.

For our fathers established images and altars, and the maintenance of undying fire, and, generally speaking, everything of the sort, as symbols of the presence of the gods, not that we may regard such things as gods, but that we may worship the gods through them. For since being in the body it was in bodily wise that we must needs perform our service to the gods also, though they are themselves without bodies; they therefore revealed to us in the earliest images the class of gods next in rank to the first, even those that revolve in a circle about the whole heavens. But since not even to these can due worship be offered in bodily wise—for they are by nature not in need of anything—another class of images was invented on the earth, and by performing our worship to them we shall make the gods propitious to ourselves. For just as those who make offerings to the statues of the emperors, who are in need of nothing, nevertheless induce goodwill towards themselves thereby, so too those who make offerings to the images of the gods, though the gods need nothing, do nevertheless thereby persuade them to help and </p>                        </div>

For zeal to do all that is in one's power is, in truth, a proof of piety, and it is evident that he who abounds in such zeal thereby displays a higher degree of piety; whereas he who neglects what is possible, and then pretends to aim at what is impossible, evidently does not strive after the impossible, since he overlooks the possible. For even though God stands in need of nothing, it does not follow that on that account nothing ought to be offered to him. He does not need the reverence that is paid in words. What then? Is it rational to deprive him of this also? By no means. It follows then that one ought not to deprive him either of the honour that is paid to him through deeds, an honour which not three years or three thousand years have ordained, but all past time among all the nations of the earth. <br />Therefore, when we look at the statues of the gods, let us not indeed think they are stones or wood, but neither let us think they are the gods themselves; and indeed we do not say that the royal likenesses (eikones) are mere wood and stone and bronze, but still less do we say they are the emperors themselves, but rather likenesses of the emperors. He therefore who loves the emperor delights to see the emperor's statue, and he who loves his son delights to see his son's statue, and he who loves his father delights to see his father's statue. It follows that he who loves the gods delights to gaze on the statues of the gods, and their likenesses, and he feels reverence and shudders with awe of the gods who look at him from the unseen world.

But those beings which were fashioned by the gods as the living images of their invisible nature, I mean the gods who revolve in a circle in the heavens, abide imperishable for all time. Therefore let no man disbelieve in gods because he sees and hears that certain persons have profaned their statues and temples. Have they not in many cases put good men to death, like <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> and <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a> and the great Empedotimus? And yet I am very sure that the gods cared more for these men than for the temples. But observe that since they knew that the bodies even of these men were destructible, they allowed them to yield to nature and to submit, but later on they exacted punishment from their slayers; and this has happened in the sight of all, in our own day also, in the case of all who have profaned the temples. <br />Therefore let no man deceive us with his sayings or trouble our faith in a divine providence. For as for those who make such profanation a reproach against us, I mean the prophets of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, what have they to say about their own temple, which was overthrown three times and even now is not being raised up again?

In my opinion there is no reason why their god should not be a mighty god, even though he does not happen to have wise prophets or interpreters. But the real reason why they are not wise is that they have not submitted their souls to be cleansed by the regular course of study, nor have they allowed those studies to open their tightly closed eyes, and to clear away the mist that hangs over them. But since these men see as it were a great light through a fog, not plainly or clearly, and since they think that what they see is not a pure light but a fire, and they fail to discern all that surrounds it, they cry with a loud voice: Tremble, be afraid, fire, flame, death, a dagger, a broad-sword! thus describing under many names the harmful might of fire. But on this subject it will be better to demonstrate separately how much inferior to our own poets are these teachers of tales about the gods. <br />It is our duty to adore not only the images of the gods, but also their temples and sacred precincts and altars. And it is reasonable to honour the priests also as officials and servants of the gods; and because they minister to us what concerns the gods, and they lend strength to the gods' gift of good things to us; for they sacrifice and pray on behalf of all men.

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a>, for instance, enjoined on their king to reverence the priest, though he was one of the enemy, whereas we do not even reverence the priests who are our friends, and who pray and sacrifice on our behalf. <br />But since my discourse has come back again to the beginning as I have so long wished, I think it is worth while for me to describe next in order what sort of man a priest ought to be, in order that he may justly be honoured himself and may cause the gods to be honoured. For as for us, we ought not to investigate or enquire as to his conduct, but so long as a man is called a priest we ought to honour and cherish him, but if he prove to be wicked we ought to allow his priestly office to be taken away from him, since he has shown himself unworthy of it. But so long as he sacrifices for us and makes offerings and stands in the presence of the gods, we must regard him with respect and reverence as the most highly honoured chattel of the gods. For it would be absurd for us to pay respect to the very stones of which the altars are made, on account of their being dedicated to the gods, because they have a certain shape and form suited to the ritual for which they have been fashioned, and then not to think that we ought to honour a man who has been dedicated to the gods.

Then indeed I answer that we ought to convict a man of that sort, so that he may not by his wickedness offend the gods; but that we ought not to dishonour him until he has been convicted. Nor indeed is it reasonable that when we have set our hands to this business, we should take away their honour not only from these offenders but also from those who are worthy to be honoured. Then let every priest, like every magistrate, be treated with respect, since there is also an oracle to that effect from the Didymaean god: As for men who with reckless minds work wickedness against the priests of the deathless gods and plot against their privileges with plans that fear not the gods, never shall such men travel life's path to the end, men who have sinned against the blessed gods whose honour and holy service those priests have in charge. And again in another oracle the god says: All my servants from harmful mischief .....; and he says that on their behalf he will inflict punishment on the aggressors. <br />Now though there are many utterances of the god to the same effect, by means of which we may learn to honour and cherish priests as we ought, I shall speak on this subject elsewhere at greater length. But for the present it is enough to point out that am not inventing anything offhand, since I think that the declaration made by the god and the injunction expressed in his own words are sufficient.

But I do so in order that you may be able from what I say to instruct the other priests, not only in the cities but in the country districts also, more convincingly and with complete freedom; since not of your own self do you alone devise these precepts and practise them, but you have me also to give you support, who by the grace of the gods am known as sovereign pontiff, though I am indeed by no means worthy of so high an office; though I desire, and moreover constantly pray to the gods that I may be worthy. For the gods, you must know, hold out great hopes for us after death; and we must believe them absolutely. For they are always truthful, not only about the future life, but about the affairs of this life also. And since in the superabundance of their power they are able both to overcome the confusion that exists in this life and to regulate its disorders and irregularities, will they not all the more in that other life where conflicting things are reconciled, after the immortal soul has been separated from the body and the lifeless body has turned to earth, be able to bestow all those things for which they have held out hopes to mankind?

For it is fitting that we should perform our service to the gods as though they were themselves present with us and beheld us, and though not seen by us could direct their gaze, which is more powerful than any light, even as far as our hidden thoughts. And this saying is not my own but the god's, and has been declared in many utterances, but for me surely it is sufficient, by bringing forth one such utterance, to illustrate two things in one, namely how the gods see all things and how they rejoice in god-fearing men: On all sides extend the far-seeing rays of <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a>. His swift gaze pierces even through sturdy rocks, and travels through the dark blue sea, nor is he unaware of the starry multitude that passes in returning circuit through the unwearied heavens for ever by the statutes of necessity; nor of all the tribes of the dead in the underworld whom <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a> has admitted within the misty dwelling of <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>, beneath the western darkness.

Wherefore we ought by all means to hold fast to deeds of piety, approaching the gods with reverence, and neither saying nor listening to anything base. And the priests ought to keep themselves pure not only from impure or shameful acts, but also from uttering words and hearing speeches of that character. Accordingly we must banish all offensive jests and all licentious intercourse.

We ought to learn by heart the hymns in honour of the gods—and many and beautiful they are, composed by men of old and of our own time—though indeed we ought to try to know also those which are being sung in the temples. For the greater number were bestowed on us by the gods themselves, in answer to prayer, though some few also were written by men, and were composed in honour of the gods by the aid of divine inspiration and a soul inaccessible to things evil. <br />All this, at least, we ought to study to do, and we ought also to pray often to the gods, both in private and in public, if possible three times a day, but if not so often, certainly at dawn and in the evening. For it is not meet that a consecrated priest should pass a day or a night without sacrifice; and dawn is the beginning of the day as twilight is of the night. And it is proper to begin both periods with sacrifice to the gods, even when we happen not to be assigned to perform the service. For it is our duty to maintain all the ritual of the temples that the law of our fathers prescribes, and we ought to perform neither more nor less than that ritual; for eternal are the gods, so that we too ought to imitate their essential nature in order that thereby we may make them propitious. <br />Now if we were pure soul alone, and our bodies did not hinder us in any respect, it would be well to prescribe one sort of life for priests. But since what he should practise when on duty concerns the individual priest alone, not priests absolutely, what </p>                        </div>

I think that a priest ought to keep himself pure from all contamination, for a night and a day, and then after purifying himself for another night following on the first, with such rites of purification as the sacred laws prescribe, he should under these conditions enter the temple and remain there for as many days as the law commands. (Thirty is the number with us at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, but in other places the number varies.) It is proper then, I think, that he should remain throughout all these days in the sacred precincts, devoting himself to philosophy, and that he should not enter a house or a marketplace, or see even a magistrate, except in the precincts, but should concern himself with his service to the god, overseeing and arranging everything in person; and then, when he has completed the term of days, he should retire from his office in favour of another. And when he turns again to the ordinary life of mankind, he may be allowed to visit a friend's house, and, when invited, to attend a feast, but not on the invitation of all but only of persons of the highest character. And at this time there would be nothing out of the way in his going occasionally to the market-place and conversing with the governor or the chief magistrate of his tribe, and giving aid, as far as lies in his power, to those who have a good reason for needing it. <br />And it is in my opinion fitting for priests to wear the most magnificent dress when they are within the temple performing the services, but when they are outside the sacred precincts to wear ordinary dress, </p>                        </div>

For it is not rational that we should misuse, in empty conceit and vain ostentation, what has been given to us for the honour of the gods. And for this reason we ought in the market place to abstain from too costly dress and from outward show, and in a word from every sort of pretentiousness. For consider how the gods, because they admired the perfect moderation of <a href=/people/284 target=_blank>Amphiaraus</a>, after they had decreed the destruction of that famous army—and he, though he knew that it would be so, went with the expedition and therefore did not escape his fated end,—the gods I say transformed him completely from what he had been, and removed him to the sphere of the gods. For all the others who were in the expedition against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a> engraved a device on their shields before they had conquered the enemy, and erected trophies to celebrate the downfall of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Cadmeans</a>; but he, the associate of the gods, when he went to war had arms with no device; but gentleness he had, and moderation, as even the enemy bore witness. Hence I think that we priests ought to show moderation in our dress, in order that we may win the goodwill of the gods, since it is no slight offence that we commit against them when we wear in public the sacred dress and make it public property, and in a word give all men an opportunity to stare at it as though it were something marvellous. For whenever this happens, many who are not purified come near us, and by this means the symbols of the gods are polluted. Moreover </p>                        </div>

However, of this too I shall speak more particularly in another place; and what I am writing to you at the moment is only a mere outline of the subject. <br />No priest must anywhere be present at the licentious theatrical shows of the present day, nor introduce one into his own house; for that is altogether unfitting. Indeed if it were possible to banish such shows absolutely from the theatres so as to restore to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> those theatres pure as of old, I should certainly have endeavoured with all my heart to bring this about; but as it is, since I thought that this is impossible, and that even if it should prove to be possible it would not on other accounts be expedient, I forebore entirely from this ambition. But I do demand that priests should withdraw themselves from the licentiousness of the theatres and leave them to the crowd. Therefore let no priest enter a theatre or have an actor or a chariot-driver for his friend; and let no dancer or mime even approach his door. And as for the sacred games, I permit anyone who will to attend those only in which women are forbidden not only to compete but even to be spectators. With regard to the hunting shows with <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> which are performed in the cities inside the theatres, need I say that not only priests but even the sons of priests must keep away from them? <br />Now it would perhaps have been well to say earlier from what class of men and by what method priests must be appointed; but it is quite appropriate that my remarks should end with this.

And in this matter let there be no distinction whatever whether they are unknown or well known. For the man who by reason of his gentleness has not won notice ought not to be barred by reason of his want of fame. Even though he be poor and a man of the people, if he possess within himself these two things, love for God and love for his fellow men, let him be appointed priest. And a proof of his love for God is his inducing his own people to show reverence to the gods; a proof of his love for his fellows is his sharing cheerfully, even from a small store, with those in need, and his giving willingly thereof, and trying to do good to as many men as he is able. <br />We must pay especial attention to this point, and by this means effect a cure. For when it came about that the poor were neglected and overlooked by the priests, then I think the impious <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Galilaeans</a> observed this fact and devoted themselves to philanthropy. And they have gained ascendancy in the worst of their deeds through the credit they win for such practices. For just as those who entice children with a cake, and by throwing it to them two or three times induce them to follow them, and then, when they are far away from their friends cast them on board a ship and sell them as slaves, and that which for the moment seemed sweet, proves to be bitter for all the rest of their lives—by the same method, I say, the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Galilaeans</a></p>                        </div>
