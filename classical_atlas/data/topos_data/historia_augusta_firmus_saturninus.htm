For <a href=/people/2667 target=_blank>Suetonius</a> <a href=/people/4323 target=_blank>Tranquillus</a>, a most accurate and truthful author, has said nothing of <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> or <a href=/people/1489 target=_blank>Vindex</a>, content with having touched on them in passing, and <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> treated of Avidius in the time of Marcus and of <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> and <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> under <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a> in no special books of their own but merely joined them to the lives of others. 2 Now in regard to <a href=/people/2667 target=_blank>Suetonius</a> we feel no wonder, for he was naturally a lover of brevity. But what of <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, the wordiest man of all, who involved himself in pseudo-historical works? Did he descend to such accuracy of detail? 3 But, on the other hand, <a href=/people/3093 target=_blank>Trebellius</a> <a href=/people/701 target=_blank>Pollio</a>, in writing of the emperors, both good and bad, showed such industry and care that he also included, though briefly and in a single book, the thirty pretenders of the time of <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> and <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> and the emperors who lived shortly before or after them. 4 Wherefore we also, even though we may show no such diligence as his, will yet make it by no means our smallest care, after telling of <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a>, <a href=/people/3256 target=_blank>Tacitus</a> and <a href=/people/11058 target=_blank>Florian</a>, and <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a>, too, that great and peerless prince, and having further to tell of <a href=/people/3552 target=_blank>Carus</a>, <a href=/people/11052 target=_blank>Carinus</a> and <a href=/people/11056 target=_blank>Numerian</a>, to see to it that <a href=/people/758 target=_blank>Saturninus</a> and <a href=/people/11064 target=_blank>Bonosus</a> and <a href=/people/2438 target=_blank>Proculus</a> and <a href=/people/1535 target=_blank>Firmus</a>, who revolted under <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a>, be not passed over in silence. </p>                        </div>

For example, it is said that he fitted his house with square panes of glass set in with pitch and other such substances and that he owned so many books that he used often to say in public that he could support an army on the paper and glue. 3 He kept up, moreover, the closest relations with the <a href=/people/6295 target=_blank>Blemmyae</a> and <a href=/people/11026 target=_blank>Saracens</a>, and he often sent merchant-vessels to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> also.a 4 He even owned, it is said, two elephant-tusks, ten feet in length, to which <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> planned to add two more and make of them a throne on which he would place a statue of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, made of gold and decked with jewels and clad in a sort of bordered toga, to be set up in the Temple of the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>; and, after asking advice of the oracle in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425136LApe class=place long=13.567 lat=42.47>Apennines</a>, he purposed to call him <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> the Consul or the Consulting. 5 These tusks, however, were later presented by <a href=/people/11052 target=_blank>Carinus</a> to a certain woman, who is said to have made them into a couch; her name, both because it is known now and because future generations will have no profit from knowing it, I will leave unmentioned. 6 So under a most evil prince the gift of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, consecrated to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> Best and Greatest, seems to have become both the instrument and the reward of lust. </p>                        </div>

He drank little wine but very much water. He was most resolute in spirit, and in sinews most strong, so that he surpassed even Tritannus, of whom <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> makes mention. 3 For he would hold out resolutely when an anvil was placed on his chest and men struck it, while he, leaning backward face up, supporting his weight on his hands, seemed to be suspended rather than to be lying down.b In drinking, moreover, he would compete with <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a>'s generals whenever they wished to test him. 4 For example, when a certain fellow named Burburus, one of the standard-bearers and a notable drinker, challenged him to a contest in drinking, he drained two buckets full of wine and yet remained sober throughout the whole banquet; and when Burburus asked, Why did you not drink up the dregs? he replied, You fool, one does not drink earth.

A sword suspended by a hair hangs over your head, on all sides there are spears, on all sides arrows. You fear your very guards, you dread your very attendants. Your food brings you no pleasure, your journeys no honour, your wars do not meet with approval, your arms call forth no enthusiasm. 3 Remember, moreover, that they find fault with a man of any age as ruler.

This came about through what was almost a game and a jest, as Onesimus tells, though I know that I have not found it in any other writer. 2 For when once at a banquet they were playing a game of Brigands and <a href=/people/2438 target=_blank>Proculus</a> had ten times come out as King, a certain well-known wit cried out, Hail, Augustus, and bringing in a garment of purple wool he clasped it about <a href=/people/2438 target=_blank>Proculus</a>' shoulders and then bowed in adoration. Then fear fell upon all who had had a part in the deed, and so an attempt was then made to gain both the army and the imperial power. 3 He was, nevertheless, of some benefit to the Gauls, for he crushed the <a href=/people/775 target=_blank>Alamanni</a> — who then were still called Germans — and not without illustrious glory, though he never fought save in brigand-fashion. 4 He was forced by <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a>, however, to flee to distant lands, and when he attempted to bring aid to the Franks, from whom he said he derived his origin, <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a> conquered and slew him; for the Franks themselves betrayed him, whose custom it is to break faith with a laugh. 5 His descendants still live at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440082UAlI class=place long=8.211 lat=44.0437>Albingauni</a>, and they are wont to say in jest that they do not desire to be either princes or brigands. <br />6 This is all that I remember having learned about <a href=/people/2438 target=_blank>Proculus</a> that is worthy of mention.

This he held longer than he deserved, 2 for he was finally defeated by <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a> only after a lengthy and difficult struggle, and he put an end to his life by the noose, which gave rise to the jest that it was not a man that was being hanged but a wine-jug. <br />3 He left two sons, both of whom were spared by <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a>, and his wife, too, was treated with honour and given an allowance as long as she lived. 4 She was in fact, as my grandfather also used to declare, a woman of unequalled excellence and also of noble family, though by race a <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goth</a>; for <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> had given her to him as wife in order that through his help he might learn all the plans of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, for she was a maiden of royal blood. 5 There is still in existence a letter addressed to the governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> concerning this marriage and the gifts which <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> wished <a href=/people/11064 target=_blank>Bonosus</a> to receive on the occasion of his wedding, and this letter I have inserted: <br />6 From <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> Augustus to Gallonius <a href=/people/5493 target=_blank>Avitus</a>, greeting. In a previous letter I wrote you to establish the Gothic noblewomen at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410280UPer class=place long=27.953 lat=40.971>Perinthus</a>, and I assigned them rations, which they were not to receive singly, but seven of them together sharing one meal. For when they receive them singly, they get too little and the state loses too much. 7 Now, however, since it is our wish that <a href=/people/11064 target=_blank>Bonosus</a> take Hunila to wife, you will give her all we have ordered in the subjoined list, and you will celebrate the marriage at the expense of the state. <br />8 The list of gifts was as follows: Violet tunics of part-silk provided with hoods, one tunic of part-silk with a golden stripe, to weigh a pound, two double-striped under-tunics, and all the other things that are befitting a matron. To <a href=/people/11064 target=_blank>Bonosus</a> himself you will give one hundred Philips of gold, one thousand silver Antonines, and ten thousand bronze sesterces. <br />9 This is what I remember having read about <a href=/people/11064 target=_blank>Bonosus</a>. I might, indeed, have omitted the lives of these men, concerning whom no one has ever inquired, but, in order that there may be no lack of accuracy, I have taken care to make known what I have learned about these also. 10 There still remain for me <a href=/people/3552 target=_blank>Carus</a>, <a href=/people/11052 target=_blank>Carinus</a> and <a href=/people/11056 target=_blank>Numerian</a>; for <a href=/people/1446 target=_blank>Diocletian</a> and those who came after him must be described in a grander style. </p>                        </div>
