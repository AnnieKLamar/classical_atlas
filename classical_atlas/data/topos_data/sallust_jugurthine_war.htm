Even the new men,8 who in former times already relied upon worth to outdo the nobles, now make their way to power and distinction by intrigue and open fraud rather than by noble practices; 8 just as if a praetorship, a consulship, or anything else of the kind were distinguished and illustrious in and of itself and were not valued according to the merit of those who live up to it. 9 But in giving expression to my sorrow and indignation at the morals of our country I have spoken too freely and wandered too far from my subject.

In return for this, after the defeat of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> and the capture of <a href=/people/301 target=_blank>Syphax</a>, whose dominion in Africa was great and extensive, the Roman people gave <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Masinissa</a> as a free gift all the cities and territories that he had taken in war. 5 Consequently <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Masinissa</a> was ever our true and loyal friend. But his reign and his life ended together. 6 His son <a href=/people/3893 target=_blank>Micipsa</a> then became sole ruler, since his brothers Mastanabal and <a href=/people/4160 target=_blank>Gulussa</a> had fallen ill and died. 7 <a href=/people/3893 target=_blank>Micipsa</a> begot <a href=/people/2581 target=_blank>Adherbal</a> and <a href=/people/3187 target=_blank>Hiempsal</a>, and brought up in the palace, in the same manner as his own children, a son of his brother Mastanabal called <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a>, whom <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Masinissa</a> in his will had allowed to remain a commoner because he was the offspring of a concubine.</p>                        </div>

He declared that if I did this, I should find in your friendship an army, and wealth, and bulwarks for my kingdom. 2 As I was following these injunctions of my father, <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a>, wickedest of all men on the face of the earth, in despite of your power robbed me, the grandson of <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Masinissa</a> and hereditary friend and ally of the Roman people, of my throne and all my fortunes. <br />3 And for myself, Fathers of the Senate, since I was doomed to such a depth of wretchedness, I could wish that I might ask your help rather because of my own services than those of my ancestors; I could wish above all that favours were due to me from the Roman people which I did not need; and failing this, that if they were needed I might accept them as my due. 4 But since virtue alone is not its own protection, and since it was not in my power to mould the character of <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a>, I have had recourse to you, Fathers of the Senate, to whom (and this is greatest part of my wretchedness) I am compelled to be a burden before I have been an aid. 5 All other kings have been admitted to your friendship when they were vanquished in war, or have sought your alliance in their time of peril; our family established friendly relations with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> during the war with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, at a time when the plighted word of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was a greater inducement to us than her fortune. 6 Therefore do not allow me, their descendant and the grandson of <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Masinissa</a>, to implore your aid in vain. <br />7 If I had no other reason for asking the favour than my pitiable lot — of late a king, mighty in family, fame and fortune; now broken by woes, destitute and appealing to others for help — it would nevertheless be becoming to the majesty of the Roman people to defend me against wrong and not to allow any man's power to grow great through crime. 8 But in fact I am driven from the lands which the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> gave to my forefathers and from which my father and grandfather helped you to drive <a href=/people/301 target=_blank>Syphax</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>.

After Africa had been freed from that pestilence, we enjoyed the delights of peace, since we had no enemy, unless haply at your command. 11 But lo! on a sudden, <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a>, carried away by intolerable audacity, wickedness and arrogance, after killing my brother, who was also his kinsman, first made <a href=/people/3187 target=_blank>Hiempsal</a>'s realm the spoil of his crime; then, when he had failed to outwit me by the same wiles, and when under your sovereignty I was looking for anything rather than violence or war, he has made me, as you see, an exile from home and country, a prey to want and wretchedness, and safer anywhere than in my own kingdom. <br />12 I always used to think, Fathers of the Senate, as I had heard my father maintain, that those who diligently cultivated your friendship undertook an arduous duty, indeed, but were safe beyond all others. 13 Our family has done its best to aid you in all your wars; that we may enjoy peace and safety, Fathers of the Senate, is in your power. 14 Our father left two of us brothers; a third, <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a>, he hoped to add to our number by his favours. One of the three has been slain; I myself have barely escaped the sacrilegious hands of the other. 15 What shall I do, or to what special protection shall I appeal in my troubles? All the defences of my house are destroyed. My father, as was inevitable, has paid the debt of nature. My brother has lost his life through the crime of a kinsman, the last man who ought to have raised a hand against him. Relatives, friends, and others who were near to me have fallen by one blow or another. Of those taken by <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> some have been crucified, others thrown to wild beasts; a few, whose lives were spared, in gloomy dungeons amid sorrow and lamentation drag out an existence worse than death. 16 But if all that I have lost, or all that has turned from affection to hostility, remained untouched, even then, if any unexpected misfortune had befallen me, I should appeal to you, Fathers of the Senate, whom it befits, because of the extent of your dominion, to take under your care all matters of right and wrong everywhere. 17 As it is, however, an exile from home and country, alone, and stripped of all that becomes my station, where shall I take refuge or to whom shall I appeal? To nations or kings, all of whom are hostile to our family because of our friendship for you? To what land can I turn and not find there many a record of my ancestors' acts of hostility? Can anyone feel compassion for us who was ever your enemy? 18 Finally, Fathers of the Senate, <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Masinissa</a> instructed us to attach ourselves to none save the Roman people and to contract no new leagues and alliances; he declared that in your friendship there would be for us all an ample protection, and that, if the fortune of your empire should change, we must fall with it. <br />19 Through valour and the favour of the gods you are mighty and powerful, all things are favourable and yield obedience to you; hence you may the more readily have regard to the wrongs of your allies.</p>                        </div>

Then of a truth that wretch, who now exults and glories in his crimes, will be tortured by ills of every kind and pay a heavy penalty for his treachery to our father, for the murder of my brother, and for my unhappiness. <br />22 At last, brother dearest to my heart, although life has been taken from you untimely by the last hand that should have been raised against you, yet your fate seems to me a cause for joy rather than for sorrow. 23 For when you lost your life it was not your throne you lost, but it was flight, exile, want and all these woes which weigh me down.

Accordingly, he began to covet <a href=/people/2581 target=_blank>Adherbal</a>'s kingdom, spurred on besides by the promises of those whom he had shortly before loaded with presents. 2 He himself was active and warlike, while his intended victim was quiet, peaceful, of a tranquil disposition, open to attack and rather inclined to fear than an object of fear. 3 Therefore when <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> suddenly invaded <a href=/people/2581 target=_blank>Adherbal</a>'s territory with a large force, he took many prisoners, as well as <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and other plunder, set fire to buildings, and raided several places with his cavalry. 4 He then withdrew with his entire force into his own kingdom, supposing that <a href=/people/2581 target=_blank>Adherbal</a> would be led by resentment to resort to force in order to avenge the wrongs which had been done him, and that this would furnish a pretext for war. 5 <a href=/people/2581 target=_blank>Adherbal</a>, however, realizing that in arms he was no match for his rival and putting more trust in the friendship of the Roman people than in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a>, sent envoys to <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> to protest against the outrages; and although they brought back an insulting answer, he resolved to put up with anything rather than resort to war, which he had already tried with so little success. 6 This, however, did not diminish the ardour of <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a>, who in his mind's eye had already seized all <a href=/people/2581 target=_blank>Adherbal</a>'s realm. 7 He therefore began to wage war, not as before with a predatory band, but with a great army which he had got together, and to lay claim openly to the sovereignty of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a>. 8 Wherever he went he laid waste cities and fields and drove off booty, thus inspiring his own followers with confidence and striking the enemy with fear.</p>                        </div>

They must go to ruin their own way. 7 After the murder of Tiberius <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a>, whom they accused of trying to make himself king, prosecutions were instituted against the Roman commons. Again, after Gaius <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a> and Marcus <a href=/people/152 target=_blank>Fulvius</a> were slain, many men of your order suffered death in the dungeon. In both cases bloodshed was ended, not by law, but by the caprice of the victors. <br />8 But let us admit that to restore their rights to the commons was the same thing as to aspire to royal power, and that whatever cannot be avenged without shedding the blood of citizens was justly done. 9 In former years you were silently indignant that the treasury was pillaged, that kings and free peoples paid tribute to a few nobles, that those nobles possessed supreme glory and vast wealth. Yet they were not satisfied with having committed with impunity these great crimes, and so at last the laws, your sovereignty, and all things human and divine have been delivered to your enemies. 10 And they who have done these things are neither ashamed nor sorry, but they walk in grandeur before your eyes, some flaunting their priesthoods and consulships, others their triumphs, just as if these were honours and not stolen goods. <br />11 Slaves bought with a price do not put up with unjust treatment from their masters; will you, Roman citizens born to power, endure slavery with patience? 12 But who are they who have seized upon our country? Men stained with crime, with gory hands, of monstrous greed, guilty, yet at the same time full of pride, who have made honour, reputation, loyalty, in short everything honourable and dishonourable, a source of gain. 13 Some of them are safeguarded by having slain tribunes of the commons, others by unjust prosecutions, many by having shed your blood. 14 Thus the more atrocious the conduct, the greater the safety. They have shifted fear from their crimes to your cowardice, united as they are by the same desires, the same hatred, the same fears. 15 This among good men constitutes friendship; among the wicked it is faction. 16 But if your love of freedom were as great as the thirst for tyranny which spurs them on, surely our country would not be torn asunder as it now is, and your favours would be bestowed on the most virtuous, not on the most reckless. 17 Your forefathers, to assert their legal rights and establish their sovereignty, twice seceded and took armed possession of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LAve class=place long=12.4792 lat=41.8835>Aventine</a>; will you not exert yourself to the utmost in order to retain the liberty which they bequeathed to you? And will you not show the greater ardour, because it is more shameful to lose what has been won than never to have won it? <br />18 I seem to hear someone say, 'What then do you advise?' I reply, 'Let those who have betrayed their country to the enemy be punished, not by arms or by violence, which it is less becoming for you to inflict than for them to suffer, but by the courts and <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a>'s own testimony. 19 If he is a prisoner of war, he will surely be obedient to your commands; but if he scorns them, you may well ask yourself what kind of peace or surrender that is from which <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> has gained impunity for his crimes and a few powerful men immense wealth, while our country suffers damage and disgrace.</p>                        </div>

For which of you dared to refuse slavery? <br />21 For my own part, although I consider it most shameful for a true man to suffer wrong without taking vengeance, yet I could willingly allow you to pardon those most criminal of men, since they are your fellow citizens, were it not that mercy would end in destruction. 22 For such is their insolence that they are not satisfied to have done evil with impunity, unless the opportunity for further wrong-doing be wrung from you; and you will be left in eternal anxiety, because of the consciousness that you must either submit to slavery or use force to maintain your freedom. <br />23 Pray, what hope have you of mutual confidence or harmony? They wish to be tyrants, you to be free; they desire to inflict injury, you to prevent it; finally, they treat our allies as enemies and our enemies as allies. 24 Are peace and friendship compatible with sentiments so unlike? 25 They are not, and therefore I warn and implore you not to let such wickedness go unscathed. It is not a matter of plundering the treasury or of extorting money from our allies — serious crimes, it is true, but so common now-a-days as to be disregarded. Nay, the senate's dignity has been prostituted to a ruthless enemy, your sovereignty has been betrayed, your country has been offered for sale at home and abroad. 26 Unless cognizance is taken of these outrages, unless the guilty are punished, what will remain except to pass our lives in submission to those who are guilty of these acts? For to do with impunity whatever one fancies is to be king. 27 I am not urging you, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, to rejoice rather in the guilt than in the innocence of your fellow citizens; but you should not insist upon ruining the good by pardoning the wicked. 28 Moreover, in a republic it is far better to forget a kindness than an injury. The good man merely becomes less active in well doing when you neglect him, but the bad man grows more wicked. 29 Finally, if there should be no wrongs, you would not often need help.58</p>                        </div>

Finally, when the opportunity came, he set his trap. 6 Thereupon one of those who had been hired to do the murder attacked Massiva somewhat incautiously; he slew his victim, but was himself caught, and at the solicitation of many, in particular of <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> the consul, he made a full confession. 7 <a href=/people/2843 target=_blank>Bomilcar</a> was brought to trial rather from the demands of equity and justice than in accordance with the law of nations, inasmuch as he was in the company of one who had come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> under pledge of public protection. <br />8 <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a>, however, although he was clearly responsible for so flagrant a crime, did not cease to resist the evidence, until he realized that the indignation at the deed was too strong even for his influence and his money. 9 Therefore, although in the first stage of the trial he had given fifty of his friends as sureties, yet having an eye rather to his throne than to the sureties, he sent <a href=/people/2843 target=_blank>Bomilcar</a> secretly to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a>, fearing that if he paid the penalty, the rest of his subjects would fear to obey his orders.

Thus the community was split into two parties, and between these the state was torn to pieces. <br />6 But the nobles had the more powerful organization, while the strength of the commons was less effective because it was incompact and divided among many. 7 Affairs at home and in the field were managed according to the will of a few men, in whose hands were the treasury, the provinces, public offices, glory and triumphs. The people were burdened with military service and poverty. The generals divided the spoils of war with a few friends. 8 Meanwhile the parents or little children of the soldiers, if they had a powerful neighbour, were driven from their homes. 9 Thus, by the side of power, greed arose, unlimited and unrestrained, violated and devastated everything, respected nothing, and held nothing sacred, until it finally brought about its own downfall. 10 For as soon as nobles were found who preferred true glory to unjust power, the state began to be disturbed and civil dissension to arise like an upheaval of the earth.</p>                        </div>

Moreover he broke camp every day for cross-country marches, fortified it with a palisade and moat just as if the enemy were near, and set guards at short intervals and inspected them in person attended by his lieutenants. On the march too he was now with those in the van, now in the rear, often in the middle of the line, to see that no one left the ranks, that they advanced in a body about the standards, and that the soldiers carried food and arms. 3 In this way, rather by keeping them from doing wrong than by punishing them, he soon restored the temper of his army.</p>                        </div>

Accordingly, he sent envoys to the consul with tokens of submission, merely asking that his own life and those of his children be spared and leaving all else to the discretion of the Roman people. 3 But <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> had already learned from experience that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a> were a treacherous race, of fickle disposition, and fond of a change. He therefore separated the envoys and approached them one by one. 4 When by gradually sounding them he found that they could be used for his design, he induced them by lavish promises to deliver <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> into his hand, alive if possible; or dead, if he could not be taken alive. But publicly he bade them take back a reply in accordance with the king's wishes. <br />5 A few days later the consul with his army alert and ready for battle invaded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a>, where he found nothing to indicate a state of war; the huts were full of men, and <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and farmers were to be seen in the fields. The king's officers came out to meet him from the towns and villages, offering to furnish grain, transport provisions — in short, to do everything that they were ordered. 6 None the less, exactly as if the enemy were close at hand, <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> advanced with his line protected on all sides, and reconnoitred the country far and wide, believing that these indications of submission were a pretence and that the enemy were seeking an opportunity for treachery. 7 Accordingly, he himself led the van with the light-armed cohorts as well as a picked body of slingers and archers, his lieutenant Gaius <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> with the cavalry had charge of the rear, while on both flanks he had apportioned the cavalry of the auxiliaries to the tribunes of the legions and the prefects of the cohorts. With these the light-armed troops were mingled, whose duty it was to repel the attacks of the enemy's horsemen, wherever they might be made. 8 For <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> was so crafty, so well acquainted with the region and so versed in military science, that it was not certain whether he was more dangerous when absent or when present, at peace or making war.</p>                        </div>

From about the middle of this range an elevation branched off and extended for a long distance, clothed with wild olive, myrtles, and other varieties of trees which grow in a dry and sandy soil. 4 The intervening plain was uninhabited from lack of water except the parts along the river, which were covered with shrubs and frequented by <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and farmers.</p>                        </div>

They were to fight, he said, with men whom they had already vanquished and sent under the yoke; their leader was changed but not their spirit. For his own part, he had provided for his men everything that a leader ought: that on higher ground and prepared for action they might fight against men taken by surprise; that they might not have to fight few against many nor untrained against better soldiers. 3 Therefore they must be ready and eager to attack the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> when the signal was given, for that day would either crown all their toil and victories, or would be the beginning of the utmost wretchedness. 4 He also addressed them individually and recalled his favours to the mind of every soldier whom he had ever rewarded with money or honour for any deed of arms, and pointed out the recipient to his comrades. Finally, by promises, threats or entreaties he incited one man after another, each in a different way according to his disposition, when meanwhile <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, unaware of the enemy and coming down the mountain with his army, caught sight of them. 5 At first the Roman wondered what the unusual appearance of things meant, for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a> with their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> had taken their places amid the woods, and while because of the lowness of the trees they were not entirely covered, yet it was difficult to make out just what they were, since the men and their standards were concealed both by the nature of the place and by disguise. But the consul soon detected the ambuscade, halted his army for a space, and then made a change in its formation. 6 His right flank, which was nearest the enemy, he strengthened with three lines of reserves. Between the maniples he placed the slinger and archers, while on the wings he stationed all the cavalry. Then after exhorting the soldiers briefly, as the time demanded, he led his army down into the plain, just as he had drawn it up, with those who had been in the van now forming the flank.</p>                        </div>

He therefore sent his lieutenant <a href=/people/1250 target=_blank>Rutilius</a> with the light-armed cohorts and a part of the cavalry towards the river, with instructions to occupy in advance a position for the camp; for he thought that the enemy would try to delay his progress by frequent assaults on the flank, and since they put little trust in their arms, that they would try the effect of fatigue and thirst upon his soldiers. 2 Then, as the circumstances and situation demanded, he advanced slowly in the same order in which he had come down from the mountain, keeping <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> behind what had been the front line, while he himself was with the cavalry on the left wing, which had now become the van. <br />3 As soon as <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> saw that <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>' rear had passed by the first of his own men, he stationed a force about two thousand infantry on the mountain at the point from which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had just come, so that if his opponents should give ground, they might not have this refuge and protection in their rear.

He urged them to have like courage for the easy tasks which remained; their fight for victory was at an end, the rest of their efforts would be for booty. 2 Meanwhile, however, he sent deserters and other available spies to find out where in the world <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> was and what he was about, whether he had but few followers or an army, how he conducted himself in defeat. 3 As a matter of fact, the king had retreated to a wooded district of natural strength and was there recruiting an army which in numbers was larger than before, but inefficient and weak, being more familiar with farming and grazing than with war. 4 The reason for this was, that except for the horsemen of his bodyguard not a single <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=demonym long=3 lat=36>Numidian</a> follows his king after a defeat, but all disperse whithersoever they choose, and this is not considered shameful for soldiers. Such are their customs. <br />5 Accordingly, when <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> saw that the king was still full of confidence, and that a war was being renewed which could be carried on only as his opponent chose, he realized that his struggle with the enemy was an unequal one, since defeat cost them less than victory did his own men. He accordingly decided that he must conduct the campaign, not by pitched battles, but in another fashion. 6 He therefore marched into the most fertile parts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a>, laid waste the country, captured and burned many strongholds and towns which had been hurriedly fortified or left without defenders, ordered the death of all the adults and gave everything else to his soldiers as booty. In this way he caused such terror that many men were given to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> as hostages, grain and other necessities were furnished in abundance, and garrisons were admitted wherever <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> thought it advisable. <br />7 These proceedings alarmed the king much more than the defeat which his men had suffered; 8 for while all his hopes depended upon flight, he was forced to pursue, and when he had been unable to defend favourable positions, he was obliged to fight in those which were unfavourable. 9 However, he adopted the plan which seemed best under the circumstances and ordered the greater part of the army to remain where it was, while he himself followed <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> with a select body of cavalry. Making his way at night and through by-paths he suddenly fell upon the Roman stragglers when they least expected it; 10 the greater number of them were killed before they could arm themselves, many were taken, not one escaped unscathed. Before aid could be sent from the camp, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a>, as they had been ordered, scattered to the nearest hills.</p>                        </div>

He thought that as a matter of course <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> would come to the aid of his subjects in distress and that a battle would be fought in that place. 2 But <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a>, learning from deserters what was on foot, by forced marches outstripped <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>; he encouraged the townspeople to defend their walls, and gave them the help of a band of deserters, who formed the strongest part of the king's forces because they dared not be treacherous. He promised too that he would come himself in due season with an army. 3 Having made these arrangements, the king withdrew to places as secluded as possible, and presently learned that <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> had been ordered to leave the line of march and go with a few cohorts to forage at <a href=/people/1907 target=_blank>Sicca</a>, which was the very first town to revolt from the king after his defeat. 4 Thither <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> hastened by night with the best of his cavalry and engaged the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> at the gate just as they were coming out.

Thus engrossed in wholesome pursuits his unspoiled nature soon matured. 4 The result was that when he first sought the office of military tribune from the people, the greater number did not know him by sight; yet his deeds were familiar and he was elected by the vote of all the tribes. 5 Then, after that success, he won office after office, always so conducting himself in each of them as to be regarded worthy of a higher position than that which he was holding. 6 Nevertheless, although he had up to that time shown himself so admirable a man (for afterwards he was driven headlong by ambition), he did not venture to aspire to the consulship; for even as late as that time, although the commons could bestow the other magistracies, the nobles passed the consulate from hand to hand within their own order. 7 No new man was so famous or so illustrious for his deeds, that he was not considered unworthy of that honour, and the office, so to speak, sullied by such an incumbency.</p>                        </div>

Now, although <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> possessed in abundance valour, renown, and other qualities to be desired by good men, yet he had a disdainful and arrogant spirit, a common defect in the nobles. 2 At first then he was astonished at the unusual request, expressed his surprise at <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>' design, and with feigned friendship advised him not to enter upon so mad a course or to entertain thoughts above his station. All men, he said, should not covet all things; <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> should be content with his own lot and finally, he must beware of making a request of the Roman people which they would be justified in denying. <br />3 After <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> had made this and other similar remarks without shaking <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>' resolution, he at last replied that as soon as the business of the state allowed he would do what he asked. 4 Later, when <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> often repeated the same request, <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> is said to have rejoined: Don't be in a hurry to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; it will be soon enough for you to be a candidate when my son becomes one.

He declared that if but half the army were put in his charge, he would have <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> in fetters within a few days. His commander, he said, was purposely protracting the war, because he was a man of extravagant and tyrannical pride, and enjoyed too much the exercise of power. 6 And all this talk appealed the more strongly to the traders, because they had suffered pecuniary loss from the long duration of the war, and for greedy spirits nothing moves fast enough.</p>                        </div>

He was making or buying arms, weapons and other things which he had sacrificed to his hope of peace, tempting the Roman slaves to revolt, and trying to bribe even those who formed the Roman garrisons.

Bursting into tears, he begged the king by his friendship and his own faithful service of old not to suspect him of such a crime.</p>                        </div>

There was neither river nor hill to mark the frontiers, a circumstance which involved the two peoples in bitter and lasting strife. <br />4 After many armies and fleets had been beaten and put to flight on both sides, and the long struggle had somewhat wearied them both, they began to fear that presently a third party might attack victors and vanquished in their weak state. They therefore called a truce and agreed that on a given day envoys should set out from each city and that the place where they met should be regarded as the common frontier of the two peoples. 5 Accordingly, two brothers were sent from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, called Philaeni, and these made haste to complete their journey. Those from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a> went more deliberately. Whether this was due to sloth or chance I cannot say, 6 but in those lands a storm often causes no less delay than on the sea; for when the wind rises on those level and barren plains, it sweeps up the sand from the ground and drives it with such violence as to fill the mouth and eyes. Thus one is halted because one cannot see. 7 Now when the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a> realized that they were somewhat belated and feared punishment for their failure when they returned, they accused the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> of having left home ahead of time and refused to abide by the agreement; in fact they were willing to do anything rather than go home defeated. 8 But when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> demanded other terms, provided they were fair, the Greeks gave them the choice, either of being buried alive in the place which they claimed as the boundary of their country, or of allowing the Greeks on the same condition to advance as far as they wished. 9 The Philaeni accepted the terms and gave up their lives for their country; so they were buried alive. 10 The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> consecrated <a about=https://topostext.org/place/302190SAPh class=place long=18.966 lat=30.266>altars</a> on that spot to the Philaeni brothers, and other honours were established for them at home.

It was always easy to begin a war, but very difficult to stop one, since its beginning and end were not under the control of the same man. Anyone, even a coward, could commence a war, but it could be brought to an end only with the consent of the victors.

He boasted that he had wrested the consulship from them as the spoils of victory, and made other remarks calculated to glorify himself and exasperate them. 2 All the while he gave his first attention to preparation for the war. He asked that the legions should be reinforced, summoned auxiliaries from foreign nations and kings, besides calling out the bravest men from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=place long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latium</a> and from our allies, the greater number of whom he knew from actual service but a few only by reputation.

But such a desire of following <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> had seized almost everyone, that the hopes of the senate were disappointed. 4 Each man imagined himself enriched by booty or returning home a victor, along with other visions of the same kind. <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> too had aroused them in no slight degree by a speech of his; 5 for when all the decrees for which he had asked had been passed and he wished to enrol soldiers, in order to encourage men to enlist and at the same time, according to his custom, to bait the nobles, he called an assembly of the people.

To prepare for war and at the same time to spare the treasury; to force into military service those whom one would not wish to offend; to have a care for everything at home and abroad — to do all this amid envy, enmity and intrigue, is a ruder task, fellow citizens, than you might suppose. 4 Furthermore, if others make mistakes, their ancient nobility, the brave deeds of their ancestors, the power of their kindred and relatives, their throng of clients, are all a very present help. My hopes are all vested in myself and must be maintained by my own worth and integrity; for all other supports are weak. <br />5 This too I understand, fellow citizens, that the eyes of all are turned towards me, that the just and upright favour me because my services are a benefit to our country, while the nobles are looking for a chance to attack me. 6 Wherefore I must strive the more earnestly that you may not be deceived and that they may be disappointed. 7 From childhood to my present time of life I have so lived that I am familiar with every kind of hardship and danger. 8 As to the efforts, fellow citizens, which before your favours were conferred upon me I made without recompense, it is not my intention to relax them now that they have brought me their reward. 9 To make a moderate use of power is difficult for those who from interested motives have pretended to be virtuous; for me, who have spent my entire life in exemplary conduct, habit has made right living a second nature. 10 You have bidden me conduct the war against <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a>, a commission which has sorely vexed the nobles. I pray you, ponder well whether it would be better to change your minds and send on this or any similar errand one of that ring of nobles, a man of ancient lineage and many ancestral portraits — but no campaigns; in order, no doubt, that being wholly in ignorance of the duties of such an office, he might hurry and bustle about and select some one of the common people to act as his adviser. 11 In fact, it very often happens that the man whom you have selected as a commander looks about for someone else to command him. 12 I personally know of men, citizens, who after being elected consuls began for the first time to read the history of our forefathers and the military treatises of the Greeks, preposterous creatures! for though in order of time administration follows election, yet in actual practice it comes first. <br />13 Compare me now, fellow citizens, a 'new man,' with those haughty nobles. What they know from hearsay and reading, I have either seen with my own eyes or done with my own hands. What they have learned from books I have learned by service in the field; 14 Think now for yourself whether words or deeds are worth more. They scorn my humble birth, I their worthlessness; I am taunted with my lot in life, they with their infamies. 15 For my part, I believe that all men have one and the same nature, but that the bravest is the best born; 16 and if the fathers of <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> and <a href=/people/3782 target=_blank>Bestia</a> could now be asked whether they would prefer to have me or those men for their descendants, what do you suppose they would reply, if not that they desired to have the best possible children? <br />17 But if they rightly look down on me, let them also look down on their own forefathers, whose nobility began, as did my own, in manly deeds. 18 They begrudge me my office; then let them begrudge my toil, my honesty, even my dangers, since it was through those that I won the office. 19 In fact, these men, spoiled by pride, live as if they scorned your honours, but seek them as if their own lives were honourable.</p>                        </div>

The more glorious was the life of their ancestors, the more shameful is their own baseness. 23 Assuredly the matter stands thus: the glory of ancestors is, as it were, a light shining upon their posterity, suffering neither their virtues nor their faults to be hidden. 24 Of such glory I acknowledge my poverty, fellow citizens; but — and that is far more glorious — I have done deeds of which I have a right to speak. 25 Now see how unfair those men are; what they demand for themselves because of others' merit they do not allow me as the result of my own, no doubt because I have no family portraits and because mine is a new nobility. And yet surely to be its creator is better than to have inherited and disgraced it. <br />26 I am of course well aware that if they should deign to reply to me, their language would be abundantly eloquent and elaborate. But since after the great honour which you have done me they take every opportunity to rend us both with their invectives, I thought it best not to be silent, for fear that someone might interpret my reticence as due to a guilty conscience. 27 In point of fact, I am confident that I can be injured by no speech; for if they tell the truth, they cannot but speak well of me, and falsehood my life and character refutes. 28 But since it is your judgment in giving me your highest office and a most important commission which they criticize, consider again and yet again whether you ought to regret those acts. 29 I cannot, to justify your confidence, display family portraits or the triumphs and consulships of my forefathers; but if occasion requires, I can show spears, a banner, trappings and other military prizes, as well as scars on my breast. 30 These are my portraits, these my patent of nobility, not left me by inheritance as theirs were, but won by my own innumerable efforts and perils. <br />31 My words are not well chosen; I care little for that. Merit shows well enough in itself. It is they who have need of art, to gloss over their shameful acts with specious words. 32 Nor have I studied Grecian letters. I did not greatly care to become acquainted with them, since they had not taught their teachers virtue. 33 But I have learned by far the most important lesson for my country's good — to strike down the foe, to keep watch and ward, to fear nothing save ill repute, to endure heat and cold alike, to sleep on the ground, to bear privation and fatigue at the same time. 34 It is with these lessons that I shall encourage my soldiers; I shall not treat them stingily and myself lavishly, nor win my own glory at the price of their toil. 35 Such leadership is helpful, such leadership is democratic; for to live in luxury oneself but control one's army by punishments is to be a master of slaves, not a commander. 36 It was by conduct like this that your forefathers made themselves and their country famous; 37 but the nobles, relying upon such ancestors though themselves of very different character, despise us who emulate the men of old, and claim from you all honours, not from desert, but as a debt. <br />38 But those most arrogant of men are greatly in error. Their ancestors have left them all that they could — riches, portrait busts, their own illustrious memory; virtue they have not left them, nor could they have done so; that alone is neither bestowed nor received as a gift. 39 They say that I am common and of rude manners, because I cannot give an elegant dinner and because I pay no actor or cook higher wages than I do my overseer. This I gladly admit, fellow citizens; 40 for I learned from my father and other righteous men that elegance is proper to women but toil to men, that all the virtuous ought to have more fame than riches, and that arms and not furniture confer honour. <br />41 Well then, let them continue to do what pleases them and what they hold dear; let them make love and drink; let them pass their old age where they have spent their youth, in banquets, slaves to their belly and the most shameful parts of their body. Sweat, dust, and all such things let them leave to us, to whom they are sweeter than feasts. 42 But they will not; for when those most shameless of men have disgraced themselves by their crimes, they come to rob the virtuous of their rewards. 23 Thus, most unjustly, their luxury and sloth, the most abominable of faults, in no wise injure those who practise them, but are the ruin of their blameless country. <br />44 Now that I have replied to them to the extent that my character — but not their crimes — demanded I shall say a few words about our country. 45 First of all, be of good cheer as to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a>, citizens; for you have put away everything which up to this time has protected <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> — avarice, incompetence, and arrogance. Furthermore, there is an army in Africa familiar with the country, but by heaven! more valiant than fortunate; 46 for a great part of it has perished through the greed or rashness of its leaders. 47 Therefore do you, who are of military age, join your efforts with mine and serve your country, and let no one feel fear because of disasters to others or the arrogance of generals. I, <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, shall be with you on the march and in battle, at once your counsellor and the companion of your dangers, and I shall treat myself and you alike in all respects. 48 And surely with the help of the gods everything is ripe for us — victory, spoils, glory; but even though these were uncertain or remote, yet all good men ought to fly to the aid of their fatherland. 49 Truly, no one ever became immortal through cowardice, and no parent would wish for his children that they might live forever, but rather that their lives might be noble and honoured. 50 I would say more, citizens, if words could make cowards brave. For the resolute I think I have spoken abundantly.</p>                        </div>

Moreover, the venom of <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a>, which is always deadly, is especially aggravated by thirst. 6 <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> was inspired with a great desire of taking this town, not only from its military importance, but also because the undertaking seemed hazardous and because <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> had gained great renown by the capture of Thala. For Thala was similar in its situation and defences, except that there were some springs not far from the town, whereas the people of Capsa had but one flowing spring, which was within the walls, otherwise depending upon rain water. 7 This condition was the more readily endured there and in all the less civilized part of Africa remote from the sea, since the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a> lived for the most part on milk and game, making no use of salt and other whets to the appetite; for in their opinion the purpose of food was to relieve hunger and thirst, not to minister to caprice and luxury.</p>                        </div>

The situation was impracticable for mounds, towers, and other siege works, while the path to the fortifications was extremely narrow and had precipices on either side. 8 Mantlets were pushed forward with extreme danger and to no purpose; for when they had gone but a short distance they were ruined by fire or by stones. 9 The soldiers could not keep their footing before the works because of the steepness of the hill nor operate within the mantlets without peril; the bravest of them were killed or wounded, and the rest gradually lost courage.</p>                        </div>

Picking up one or two of these and then looking for more, in his eagerness to gather them he gradually made his way almost to the top of the mountain. 3 When he found that he was alone there, the love of overcoming difficulties which is natural to mankind seized him. 4 It happened that a great oak tree had grown up there among the rocks; it bent downward for a little way, then turned and grew upward, as is the nature of all plants. With the help, now of the branches of this tree and now of projecting rocks, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=demonym long=8.3 lat=44.3>Ligurian</a> mounted to the plateau about the fortress, while all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a> were intent upon the combatants. 5 After examining everything that he thought would be useful later, he returned by the same way, not heedlessly, as he had gone up, but testing and observing everything. 6 Then he hastened to <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, told him what he had done, and urged him to make an attempt on the fortress at the point where he himself had mounted, offering himself as a guide for the ascent and leader in the dangerous undertaking. <br />7 <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> thereupon ordered some of his staff to go with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=demonym long=8.3 lat=44.3>Ligurian</a> and look into his proposal, and each of them, according to his temperament, pronounced the attempt difficult or easy; on the whole, however, the consul was somewhat encouraged. 8 Accordingly, out of all his horn-blowers and trumpeters he chose the five who were most agile, and with them four centurions as a protection.

Those who were going to make the ascent, following the previous instructions of their guide had changed their arms and accoutrements, baring their heads and feet so as to be able to see better and climb among the rocks more easily. They carried their swords and shields on their backs, but took <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=demonym long=3 lat=36>Numidian</a> shields of hide, because they were lighter and would make less noise when struck. 2 Then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=demonym long=8.3 lat=44.3>Ligurian</a> led the way, fastening ropes to the rocks or to old projecting roots, in order that with such help the soldiers might more easily make the ascent. Sometimes he lent a hand to those whom the unusual nature of the route alarmed, and where the ascent was unusually difficult, he would send men ahead one by one unarmed and then follow himself, bringing the arms. He was first to try the places which it seemed dangerous to attempt, and by often climbing up and returning the same way, and then at once stepping aside, he lent courage to the rest. 3 In this way, after a long time and great exertion, they at last reached the fortress, which was deserted at that point because all the men, as on other days, were face to face with the enemy. <br /><a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> had devoted the whole day to keeping the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a> intent upon the battle; but as soon as he heard that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=demonym long=8.3 lat=44.3>Ligurian</a> had accomplished his purpose, he began to urge on his soldiers. He himself went outside the mantlets, formed the tortoise-shed, and advanced to the wall, at the same time trying to terrify the enemy at long range with artillery, archers and slingers. 4 But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a>, since they had often before overturned the mantlets of the enemy and set fire to them, no longer protected themselves within the walls of the fortress, but spent day and night outside, reviling the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and taunting <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> with madness.

Then the women and children, who had come out to look on, were the first to flee, followed by those who were nearest the wall, and finally by all, armed and unarmed alike. 6 Upon this the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> pressed on with greater vigour, routing the enemy, but for the most part only wounding them.

His only effort was not to suffer anyone to outdo him in counsel or in action, and as a matter of fact he surpassed almost all.

Then the kings united their forces and attacked <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> just as he was going into winter quarters, when scarcely a tenth part of the day was left; for they thought that the approaching night would be a protection to them if they were unsuccessful and would be no hindrance if they conquered, because of their familiarity with the region; while to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> darkness would be more dangerous in either victory or defeat. 4 Then, at the very moment that the consul learned from many of his scouts of the coming of the enemy, the foe themselves appeared, and before the army could be drawn up or the baggage piled, in fact before any signal or order could be given, the Moorish and <a href=/people/12044 target=_blank>Gaetulian</a> cavalry fell upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, not in order or with any plan of battle but in swarms, just as chance had brought them together. <br />5 Our men were all bewildered by the unlooked-for danger, but nevertheless did not forget their valour. Some took arms, while others kept off the enemy from their comrades who were arming; a part mounted their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and charged the foe. The combat was more like an attack of brigands than a battle. Without standards and in disorder <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and foot massed together, some gave ground, others slew their opponents; many who were bravely fighting against their adversaries were surrounded from the rear. Valour and arms were no sufficient protection against a foe who were superior in numbers and attacked on every side. At last the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, both the raw recruits and the veterans (who as such were skilled in warfare), if the nature of the ground or chance brought any of them together, formed a circle, thus at once protecting themselves on every side and presenting an orderly front to the attacks of the enemy.</p>                        </div>

He directed the soldiers by gestures, since in the general confusion his orders could not be heard. 2 And now the day was spent, yet the barbarians did not at all relax their efforts, but thinking that darkness would favour them, as the kings had declared, they attacked with greater vigour. 3 Then <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, adapting his tactics to the situation and wishing to provide a place of refuge for his men, took possession of two neighbouring hills, one of which was too small for a camp but had a large spring of water, while the other was adapted to his purpose because it was for the most part high and steep and required little fortification. 4 But he ordered <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> to pass the night with the cavalry beside the spring, while he himself gradually rallied his scattered forces and the enemy were in no less disorder, and then led them all at the double quick to the hill. 5 Thus the kings were compelled by the strength of his position to cease from battle. However, they did not allow their men to go far away, but encompassing both hills with their huge army, they bivouacked in loose order. <br />6 Then, after building many fires, the barbarians, as is their usual habit, spent the greater part of the night in rejoicing, in exultation and in noisy demonstrations, while even their leaders, who were filled with confidence because they had not been put to flight, acted as if they were victorious. 7 Now, all this was clearly visible to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> from their higher position in the darkness and encouraged them greatly.</p>                        </div>

At the same time the consul was as careful as if he had no officers, looking out for everything, being everywhere present, and distributing praise or blame where each was deserved. 4 He himself was armed and alert, and he compelled the soldiers to follow his example. With the same care that he showed in making his march he fortified his camp, sent cohorts from the legions to keep ward at the gate and the auxiliary cavalry to perform the like duty before the camp, and in addition stationed others on the ramparts above the palisade. He personally inspected the guards, not so much because he feared that his orders would not be executed, as to make the soldiers willing to endure labour of which their commander did his full share. 5 Obviously <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> at that time, and at other times during the war with <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> controlled his army rather by appealing to their sense of shame than by punishment.

And with these words he displayed a sword smeared with blood, which he had made gory during the battle by valiantly slaying one of our foot-soldiers. 7 When our men heard this, they were shocked rather by the horror of the deed than because they believed the report, while at the same time the barbarians were encouraged and charged upon the appalled <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> with greater vigour. 8 And our men were just on the point of flight, when <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, who had routed his opponents, returned and fell upon the flank of the Moors. <a href=/people/1442 target=_blank>Bocchus</a> at once gave way. 9 As for <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a>, while he was trying to hold his men and grasp the victory which he had all but won, he was surrounded by the cavalry; but though all on his right and left were slain, he broke through alone, escaping amid a shower of hostile weapons. 10 <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> in the meantime, after putting the cavalry to flight, was hastening to the aid of his men, of whose imminent defeat he had now heard. Finally the enemy were everywhere routed. 11 Then there was a fearful sight in the open plains — pursuing, fleeing, killing, capturing, <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and men dashed to the ground, many of the wounded unable either to flee or to remain quiet, now making an effort to rise and at once collapsing; in short, wherever the eye could reach, the ground was soaked in blood and strewn with weapons, arms, and corpses.</p>                        </div>

In that event, the favours which by this time you would have received from the Roman people would far outnumber the misfortunes which you have suffered. 9 But since <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> has the chief control of human destiny, and since it seems to have been her pleasure that you should experience both our power and our kindness, make haste now that she allows it and follow the course which you have begun. 10 You have many good opportunities easily to atone for your mistakes by good offices. 11 Finally, let this thought sink into your heart, that the Roman people has never been outdone in kindness; its prowess in war you know by experience. <br />12 To these words <a href=/people/1442 target=_blank>Bocchus</a> made a conciliatory and courteous reply, at the same time offering a brief defence of his conduct, declaring that he had taken arms, not in a spirit of hostility, but to protect his kingdom; 13 for the part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=place long=3 lat=36>Numidia</a> from which he had driven <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a>, he said, was his by right of conquest and he could not allow it to be laid waste by <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>. 14 Furthermore, he had previously sent envoys to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, but his friendship had been rejected. 15 He waived the past, however, and if <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> would allow him, he would again send ambassadors to the senate. But after the consul had granted his request, the barbarian's purpose was changed by some of his friends, whom <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a> had bribed; for he knew of the embassy of <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> and <a href=/people/215 target=_blank>Manlius</a> and feared its effects.</p>                        </div>
