For a long time, <a href=/people/1430 target=_blank>Polycles</a>, I have been a student of human nature; I have lived ninety years and nine; I have associated, too, with many and diverse natures; and, having observed side by side, with great closeness, both the good and the worthless among men, I conceived that I ought to write a book about the practices in life of either sort. <br />I will describe to you, class by class, the several kinds of conduct which characterise them and the mode in which they administer their affairs; for I conceive, <a href=/people/1430 target=_blank>Polycles</a>, that our sons will be the better if such memorials are bequeathed to them, using which as examples they shall choose to live and consort with men of the fairest lives, in order that they may not fall short of them. <br />And now I will turn to my narrative; be it your part to come along with it and to see if I speak rightly. In the first place, then, I will commence my account with those who have studied Irony, dispensing with preface or many words about the matter. I will begin with Irony and define it; next I will set forth, in like manner, the nature of the Ironical man, and of the character into which he has drifted; and then I will try, as I proposed, to make the other affections of the mind plain, each after its kind.</p>                        </div>

He will praise to their faces those whom he attacked behind their backs, and will sympathise with them in their defeats. He will show forgiveness to his revilers, and excuse things said against him; and he will talk blandly to persons who are smarting under a wrong. When people wish to seem him in a hurry, he will desire them to call again. He will never confess to anything that he is doing, but will always just say that he is thinking about it. He will pretend that he has just arrived, or that he was too late, or that he was unwell. To applicants for a loan or a subscription he will say that he has no money; when he has anything for sale, he will deny that he means to sell; or, when he does not mean to sell, he will pretend that he does. Hearing, he will affect not to have heard, seeing, not to have seen; if he has made an admission, he will say that he does not remember it. Sometimes he has been considering the question; sometimes he does not know; sometimes he is surprised; sometimes it is the very conclusion at which he once arrived himself. And, in general, he is very apt to use this kind of phrase: I do not believe it; I do not understand it; I am astonished. Or he will say that he has heard it from some one else: This, however, was not the story that he told me. The thing surprises me; Dont tell me; I do not know how I am to disbelieve you, or to condemn him; Take care that you are not too credulous. <br />[Such the speeches, such the doublings and retractions to which the Ironical man will resort. Disingenuous and designing characters are in truth to be shunned more carefully than vipers.]</p>                        </div>

This happens to no man in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> but you. A compliment was paid to you yesterday at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BSPo class=place long=23.72265 lat=37.97635>Stoa</a>. More than thirty persons were sitting there; the question was started, Who is our foremost man? Everyone mentioned you first, and ended by coming back to your name. With these and the like words, he will remove a morsel of wool from his patron's coat; or, if a speck of chaff has been laid on the other's hair by the wind, he will pick it off; adding with a laugh, Do you see? Because I have not met you for two days, you have had your beard full of white hairs; although no one has darker hair for his years than you. Then he will request the company to be silent while the great man is speaking, and will praise him, too, in his hearing, and mark his approbation at a pause with True; or he will laugh at a frigid joke, and stuff his cloak into his mouth as if he could not repress his amusement. He will request those whom he meets to stand still until his Honour has passed. He will buy apples and pears, and bring them in and give them to the children in the father's presence; adding, with kisses, Chicks of a good father. Also, when he assists at the purchase of slippers, he will declare that the foot is more shapely than the shoe. If his patron is approaching a friend, he will run forward and say, He is coming to you; and then, turning back, I have announced you. He is just the person, too, who can run errands to the women's market without drawing breath. He is the first of the guests to praise the wine; and to say, as he reclines next the host, How delicate is your fare! and (taking up something from the table) Now this — how excellent it is! He will ask his friend if he is cold, and if he would like something more; and, before the words are spoken, will wrap him up. Moreover he will lean towards his ear and whisper with him; or will glance at him as he talks to the rest of the company. He will take the cushions from the slave in the theatre, and spread them on the seat with his own hands. He will say that his patron's house is well built, that his land is well planted, and that his portrait is like. <br />[In short the Flatterer may be observed saying and doing all things by which he conceives that he will gain favour.]</p>                        </div>

Then, warming to the work, he will remark that the men of the present day are greatly inferior to the ancients; and how cheap wheat has become in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237XAgo class=place long=23.723 lat=37.975>Agora</a>; and what a number of foreigners are in town; and that the sea is navigable after the <a href=/people/651 target=_blank>Dionysia</a>; and that, if <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> would send more rain, the crops would be better; and that he will work his land next year; and how hard it is to live; and that <a href=/people/4962 target=_blank>Damippus</a> set up a very large torch at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235SEle class=place long=23.538 lat=38.0411>Mysteries</a>; and How many columns has the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BOdP class=place long=23.7282 lat=37.9706>Odeum</a>? and that yesterday he was unwell; and What is the day of the month?; and that the Mysteries are in Boëdromion, the <a href=/people/4855 target=_blank>Apaturia</a> in <a href=/people/2658 target=_blank>Pyanepsion</a>, the rural <a href=/people/651 target=_blank>Dionysia</a> in <a href=/people/2923 target=_blank>Poseideon</a>.

He vows that thyme smells sweeter than any perfume; he wears his shoes too large for his feet; he talks in a loud voice. He distrusts his friends and relatives, but talks confidentially to his own servants on the most important matters; and recounts all the news from the Ecclesia to the hired labourers working on his land. Wearing a cloak which does not reach the knee, he will sit down. He shows surprise and wonder at nothing else, but will stand still and gaze when he sees an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> or an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> or a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> in the streets. He is apt also to take things out of the store-room and eat them; and to drink his wine rather strong. He will help the bakery-maid to grind the corn for the use of the household and for his own; he will eat his breakfast while he shakes down hay for his beasts of burden; he will answer a knock at the door himself, and call the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> to him, and take hold of his nose, saying This fellow looks after the place and the house. When he is given a piece of money, he will reject it, saying that it is too smooth, and thereupon will take another instead; and, if he has lent his plough, or a basket or sickle or bag, and remembers it as he lies awake, he will ask it back in the middle of the night. On his way down to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> he will ask the first man that he meets how hides and salt-fish were selling, and whether the archon celebrates the New Moon to-day; adding immediately that he means to have his hair cut when he gets to town, and at the same visit to bring some salt-fish from <a href=/people/437 target=_blank>Archias</a> as he goes by.

He will attend you a little way, and ask when he is to see you, and will take his leave with a compliment upon his lips. Also, when he is called in to an arbitration, he will seek to please, not only his principal, but the adversary as well, in order that he may be deemed impartial.

He will not tread upon a tombstone, or come near a dead body or a woman defiled by childbirth, saying that it is expedient for him not to be polluted. Also on the fourth and seventh days of each month he will order his servants to mull wine, and go out and buy myrtle-wreaths, frankincense, and smilax; and, on coming in, will spend the day in crowning the Hermaphrodites. When he has seen a vision, he will go to the interpreters of dreams, the seers, the augurs, to ask them to what god or goddess he ought to pray. Every month he will repair to the priests of the Orphic Mysteries, to partake in their rites, accompanied by his wife, or (if she is too busy) by his children and their nurse. He would seem, too, to be of those who are scrupulous in sprinkling themselves with sea-water; and, if ever he observes anyone feasting on the garlic at the cross-roads, he will go away, pour water over his head, and, summoning the priestesses, bid them carry a squill or a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>puppy</a> around him for purification.

Of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s poetry he has mastered only this line, — <br />No good comes of manifold rule; let the ruler be one: <br />of the rest he is absolutely ignorant. It is very much in his manner to use phrases of this kind: We must meet and discuss these matters by ourselves, and get clear of the rabble and the Agora; we must leave off courting office, and being slighted or graced by these fellows; either they or we must govern the city. He will go out about the middle of the day with his cloak gracefully adjusted, his hair daintily trimmed, his nails delicately pared, and strut through the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BOdP class=place long=23.7282 lat=37.9706>Odeum</a> Street, making such remarks as these: There is no living in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> for the informers; we are shamefully treated in the courts by the juries; I cannot conceive what people want with meddling in public affairs; how ungrateful the people are — always the slaves of a largess or a bribe; and how ashamed I am when a meagre, squalid fellow sits down by me in the Ecclesia! When, he will ask, will they have done ruining us with these public services and trierarchies? How detestable that set of demagogues is! <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a> (he will say) was the beginning of mischief to the State. It was he who reduced it from twelve cities to one, and undid the monarchy. And he was rightly served, for he was the people's first victim himself. <br />And so on to foreigners and to those citizens who resemble him in their disposition and their politics.</p>                        </div>

He will take lessons from his son in Right Wheel, Left Wheel, Right-about-face. At the festivals of heroes he will match himself against boys for a torch-race; nay, it is just like him, if haply he is invited to a temple of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, to throw off his cloak and seize the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> in order to bend its neck back. He will go into the palaestras and try an encounter; at a conjuror's performance he will sit out three or four audiences, trying to learn the songs by heart; and, when he is initiated into the rites of <a href=/people/3685 target=_blank>Sabazius</a>, he will be eager to acquit himself best in the eyes of the priest. Riding into the country on another's <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, he will practise his horsemanship by the way; and, falling, will break his head. On a tenth-day festival he will assemble persons to play the flute with him. He will play at tableaux vivants with his footman; and will have matches of archery and javelin-throwing with his children's attendant, whom he exhorts, at the same time, to learn from him, — as if the other knew nothing about it either. At the bath he will wriggle frequently, as if wrestling, in order that he may appear educated; and, when women are near, he will practise dancing-steps, warbling his own accompaniment.</p>                        </div>

This person's father was originally called <a href=/people/3254 target=_blank>Sosias</a>; in the ranks he came to rank as <a href=/people/2122 target=_blank>Sosistratus</a>; and, when he was enrolled in his deme, as Sosidemus. His mother, I may add, is a noble damsel of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> — at least she is called “my life” in the language of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a> — and they say that such ladies are esteemed noble in their own country. Our friend himself, as might be expected from his parentage, is — a rascally scoundrel. He is very fond, also, of saying to one: Of course — I understand that sort of thing; you do not err in your way of describing it to our friends and me. These women snatch the passers-by out of the very street…That is a house which has not the best of characters…Really there is something in that proverb about the women... in short, they have a trick of gossiping with men, — and they answer the hall-door themselves. <br />It is just like him, too, when others are speaking evil, to join in: — And I hate that man above all men. He looks a scoundrel — it is written on his face; and his baseness — it defies description. Here is proof — he allows his wife, who brought him six talents of dowry and has borne him a child, three copper coins for the luxuries of the table; and makes her wash with cold water on <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>'s day. When he is sitting with others, he loves to criticise one who has just left the circle; nay, if he has found an occasion, he will not abstain from abusing his own relations. Indeed, he will say all manner of injurious things of his friends and relatives, and of the dead; misnaming slander plain speaking, democratic, independence, and making it the chief pleasure of his life. <br />[Thus can the sting of ill temper produce in men the character of insanity and frenzy.]</p>                        </div>

Speaking of honest men, he will add so-so, and will remark that no one is honest, — all men are alike; indeed, one of his sarcasms is, What an honest fellow! Again, he will say that the rascal is a frank man, if one will look fairly at the matter. Most of the things that people say of him, he admits, are true; but some things (he adds) they do not know; namely that he is a clever fellow, and fond of his friends, and a man of tact; and he will contend in his behalf that he has never met with an abler man. He will show him favour, also, when he speaks in the Ecclesia or is at the bar of a court; he is fond, too, of remarking to the bench, The question is of the cause, not the person. The defendant, he will say, is the watch-<a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> of the people, — he keeps an eye on evil-doers. We shall have nobody to take the public wrongs to heart, if we allow ourselves to lose such men. Then he is apt to become the champion of worthless persons, and to form conspiracies in the law-courts in bad causes; and, when he is hearing a case, to take up the statements of the litigants in the worst sense. <br />[In short, sympathy with rascality is sister to rascality itself; and true is the proverb that Like moves towards like.]</p>                        </div>

He will borrow from a guest staying in his house. When he makes a distribution, he will say that the distributor is entitled to a double share, and thereupon will help himself. When he sells wine, he will sell it watered to his own friend. He will seize the opportunity of taking his boys to the play, when the lessees of the theatre grant free admission. If he travels on the public service, he will leave at home the money allowed to him by the State, and will borrow of his colleagues in the embassy; he will load his servant with more baggage than he can carry, and give him shorter rations than any other master does; he will demand, too, his strict share of the presents, — and sell it. When he is anointing himself at the bath, he will say to the slave-boy, Why, this oil that you have bought is rancid — and will use someone else's. He is apt to claim his part of a copper coin found by his servants in the streets, and to cry Shares in the luck! Having sent his cloak to be scoured he will borrow another from an acquaintance, and delay to restore it for several days, until it is demanded back. <br />These, again, are traits of his. He will weigh out their rations to his household with his own hands, using the measure of the frugal king, with the bottom dinted inward, and carefully brushing the rim. He will buy a thing privately, when a friend seems ready to sell it on reasonable terms, and will dispose of it at a raise price. It is just like him, too, when he is paying a debt of thirty minas, to withhold four drachmas. Then, if his sons, through ill-health, do not attend the school throughout the month, he will make a proportionate deduction from the payment; and all through <a href=/people/4844 target=_blank>Anthesterion</a> he will not send them to their lessons because there are so many festivals, and he does not wish to pay the fees. When he is receiving rent from a slave, he will demand in addition the discount charged on the copper money; also, in going through the account of the manager {he will challenge small items}. Entertaining his clansmen, he will beg a dish from the common table for his own servants; and will register the half-radishes left over from the repast, in order that the attendants may not get them. Again, when he travels with acquaintances, he will make use of their servants, but will let his own slave out for hire; nor will he place the proceeds to the common account. It is just like him, too, when a club-dinner is held at his house, to secrete some of the fire-wood, lentils, vinegar, salt, and lamp-oil placed at his disposal. If a friend, or a friend's daughter, is to be married, he will go abroad a little while before, in order to avoid giving a wedding present. And he will borrow from his acquaintances things of a kind that no one would ask back, — or readily take back, if it were proposed to restore them.</p>                        </div>
