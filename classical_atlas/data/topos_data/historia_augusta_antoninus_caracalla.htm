Once, when a child of seven, hearing that a certain playmate of his had been severely scourged for adopting the religion of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, he long refused to look at either the boy's father or his own, because he regarded them as responsible for the scourging. 7 It was at his plea, moreover, that their ancient rights were restored to the citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, with whom <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> had become angry because they had given aid to <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a>. 8 He conceived a hatred for <a href=/people/10104 target=_blank>Plautianus</a> because of his cruelty. And all the gifts he received from his father on the occasion of the <a href=/people/5971 target=_blank>Sigillaria</a> he presented of his own accord to his dependents or to his teachers. </p>                        </div>

For when he passed beyond the age of a boy, either by his father's advice or through a natural cunning, or because he thought that he must imitate <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=person long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, he became more reserved and stern and even somewhat savage in expression, and indeed so much so that many were unable to believe that he was the same person whom they had known as a boy. 2 <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the Great and his achievements were ever on his lips, and often in a public gathering he would praise <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> and <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>. 3 He was more arrogant than his father; and his brother, because he was very modest, he thoroughly despised. <br />4 After his father's death he went to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FCPr class=place long=12.506 lat=41.908>Praetorian Camp </a> and complained there to the soldiers that his brother was forming a conspiracy against him. And so he had his brother slain in the Palace, giving orders to burn his body at once. 5 He also said in the Camp that his brother had shown disrespect to their mother. To those who had killed his brother he rendered thanks publicly, 6 and indeed he even gave them a bonus for being so loyal to him. 7 Nevertheless, some of the soldiers at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=place long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alba</a> received the news of <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>'s death with anger, and all declared they had sworn allegiance to both the sons of <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> and ought to maintain it to both. 8 They then closed the gates of the camp, and the Emperor was not admitted for a long time, and then not until he had quieted their anger, not only by bitter words about <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a> and by bringing charges against him, but also by enormous sums of money, by means of which, as usual, the soldiers were placated. 9 After this he returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and then attended a meeting of the senate, wearing a cuirass under his senator's robe and accompanied by an armed guard. He stationed this in a double line in the midst of the benches 10 and so made a speech, in which, with a view to accusing his brother and excusing himself, he complained in a confused and incoherent manner about his brother's treachery. 11 The senate received his speech with little favour, when he said that although he had granted his brother every indulgence and had in fact saved him from a conspiracy, yet <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a> had formed a most dangerous plot against him and had made no return for his brotherly affection. </p>                        </div>

Afterwards, however, the Emperor frequently bewailed his death. 5 Many others, too, who had been privy to <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>'s murder were put to death, and likewise a man who paid honours to his portrait. <br />6 After this he gave orders that his cousin <a href=/people/2826 target=_blank>Afer</a> should be killed, although on the previous day he had sent him a portion of food from his own table. 7 <a href=/people/2826 target=_blank>Afer</a> in fear of the assassins threw himself from a window and crawled away to his wife with a broken leg, but he was none the less seized by the murderers, who ridiculed him and put him to death. 8 <a href=/people/11060 target=_blank>Pompeianus</a> too was killed, the grandson of the Emperor Marcus, — he was the son of his daughter and that <a href=/people/11060 target=_blank>Pompeianus</a> who was married to <a href=/people/11061 target=_blank>Lucilla</a> after the death of the Emperor <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> and made consul twice by Marcus and placed in command of all the most important wars of the time — and he was killed in such a way as to seem to have been murdered by robbers. </p>                        </div>

Whereupon the Emperor said to the slayer, You should have used a sword in carrying out my command. 2 Patruinus, too, was slain by his order, and that in front of the Temple of the Deified <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a>, and his body as well as <a href=/people/11055 target=_blank>Papinian</a>'s were dragged about through the streets without any regard for decency. Also <a href=/people/11055 target=_blank>Papinian</a>'s son was killed, who was a quaestor and only three days before had given a lavish spectacle. 3 During this same time there were slain men without number, all of whom had favoured the cause of <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>, and even the freedmen were slain who had managed <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>'s affairs. 4 Then there was a slaughtering in all manner of places. Even in the public baths there was slaughter, and some too were killed while dining, among them Sammonicus <a href=/people/2931 target=_blank>Serenus</a>, many of whose books dealing with learned subjects are still in circulation. 5 <a href=/people/7498 target=_blank>Cilo</a>, moreover, twice prefect and consul, incurred the utmost danger merely because he had counselled harmony between the brothers. 6 For not until after the city-soldiers had seized <a href=/people/7498 target=_blank>Cilo</a>, tearing off his senator's robe and pulling off his boots, did <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> check their violence. 7 After this he committed many further murders in the city, causing many persons far and wide to be seized by soldiers and killed, as though he were punishing a rebellion. He put to death <a href=/people/1885 target=_blank>Helvius</a> <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>, substitute consul, for no other reason than because he was the son of an emperor, 9 and he would never hesitate, whenever an opportunity presented itself, to put to death those who had been his brother's friends. 10 He often delivered insolent invectives against the senate and against the people, issuing proclamations and publishing harangues, and he even declared that he would be a second <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>. </p>                        </div>

Yet even toward those who nursed him he behaved most brutally. <br />4 Then he made ready for a journey to the Orient, but interrupted his march and stopped in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=place long=25 lat=44.5>Dacia</a>. In the region of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469105RRae class=place long=10.47 lat=46.85>Raetia</a> he put a number of the natives to death and then harangued his soldiers and made them presents quite as though they were the troops of <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>. 5 He did not, however, as <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> had done, permit his men to call him by the names of the gods, for many of them had begun to address him as <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> because he had killed a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> and some other wild beasts. 6 Yet he did call himself Germanus after defeating the Germans, either in jest or in earnest, for he was foolish and witless and asserted that had he conquered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=ethnic long=16 lat=40.4>Lucanians</a> he should have been given the name Lucanicus. 7 At that time men were condemned to death for having urinated in places where there were statues or busts of the Emperor or for having removed garlands from his busts in order to replace them by others, and some were even condemned for wearing them around their necks as preventives of quartan or tertian fever. <br />8 Then he journeyed through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> accompanied by the prefect of the guard. While he was crossing over from here into <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> the yard-arm of his ship broke and he ran great danger of shipwreck, so that, together with his bodyguard, he had to climb down into a lifeboat. From this he was taken up into a trireme by the prefect of the fleet and so was rescued. <br />9 He took wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> in great numbers and once he even faced a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> — an occasion on which he prided himself, writing to his friends and boasting that he had attained to the prowess of a <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi2331.phi013:8'><b>&sect; 8</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many, I know, have told the story of <a href=/people/11055 target=_blank>Papinian</a>'s death, but in such a way as to show that they did not know its cause, and each has given a different version. I, however, have preferred to record a variety of opinions rather than to remain silent about the murder of so great a man. 2 It is generally reported that <a href=/people/11055 target=_blank>Papinian</a> was a close friend of the Emperor <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> — related to him, some say, through his second wife, — and that he had given instruction along with <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> under <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a>'s direction and later succeeded <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> as pleader for the privy-purse. 3 It is further reported that <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> had particularly entrusted him with the care of his two sons, and for this reason he had always tried to reconcile the brothers <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, 4 and had even pleaded with <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a>, when he accused his brother of treachery, not to put <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a> to death; and for this reason he, together with <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>'s supporters, was killed by the soldiers, not only with the consent but even with the encouragement of <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. 5 Many, again, relate that <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a>, after killing his brother, commanded <a href=/people/11055 target=_blank>Papinian</a> to explain away his crime for him in the senate and before the people; to which <a href=/people/11055 target=_blank>Papinian</a> replied that it was not so easy to defend fratricide as to commit it. 6 There is also the story that <a href=/people/11055 target=_blank>Papinian</a> refused to compose a speech in which, to improve the murderer's case, the brother was to be attacked; and that in his refusal he had declared that to accuse an innocent man who had been murdered was a second act of murder. 7 All of which does not accord with facts; for the prefect of the guard may not compose speeches, and, besides, it is well established that <a href=/people/11055 target=_blank>Papinian</a> was killed for being one of <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>'s supporters. 8 It is further related that <a href=/people/11055 target=_blank>Papinian</a>, when, seized by the soldiers, he was being haled to the Palace to be put to death, foretold the future, saying that whoever should succeed to his position would be an utter fool did he not take vengeance for this brutal attack on the prefecture. 9 And this actually came to pass; 10 for, as we have previously related, <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> murdered <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>; then, after he had been acclaimed emperor in the camp, together with his son, he gave the latter, who was called <a href=/people/11050 target=_blank>Diadumenianus</a>, the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, for the reason that an <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> was earnestly desired by the praetorian guard. </p>                        </div>

He left a son, who afterward received, like his father, the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> — <a href=/people/809 target=_blank>Marcus Antoninus</a> <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a>; for such a hold had the name of the Antonines that it could not be removed from the thoughts of the people, because it had taken root in the hearts of all, even as had the name of Augustus. <br /> His mode of life was evil and he was more brutal even than his cruel father. He was gluttonous in his use of food and addicted to wine, hated by his household and detested in every camp save that of the praetorian guard; and between him and his brother there was no resemblance whatever. <br />4 Among the public works which he left at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was the notable Bath named after himself, the cella soliaris of which, so the architects declare, cannot be reproduced in the way in which it was built by him. 5 For it is said that the whole vaulting rested on gratings of bronze or copper, placed underneath it, but such is its size, that those who are versed in mechanics declare that it could not have been built in this way. 6 And he left a portico, too, named after his father and intended to contain a record of his achievements, both his triumphs and his wars. 7 He himself assumed the name <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracallus</a>, taken from the garment reaching down to the heels, which he gave to the populace and which before his time had not been in vogue. 8 Hence at this present day, too, the hooded cloaks of this kind, affected especially by the Roman plebs, are called Antonine. 9 He also constructed a new street at the side of his bath (that is to say, the Antonine Bath), one more beautiful than which it were hard to find among all the streets of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. 10 He brought the cult of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and built magnificent temples to this goddess everywhere, celebrating her rites with even greater reverence than they had ever been celebrated before. 11 In all this, however, it is a source of wonder to me how it can be said that it was he who first brought the rites of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, for <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> celebrated them too, and he even carried about the statue of <a href=/people/1656 target=_blank>Anubis</a> and made all the ritualistic pauses. Perhaps, however, <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> merely added to the renown of the goddess and was not actually the first to bring her to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. <br />12 His body was laid in the tomb of the Antonines, in order that the resting-place which had given him his name might also receive his remains. </p>                        </div>
