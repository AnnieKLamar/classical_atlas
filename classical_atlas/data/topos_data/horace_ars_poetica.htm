Perhaps you know how <br />To draw a cypress tree: so what, if you’ve been given <br />Money to paint a sailor plunging from a shipwreck <br />In despair? It started out as a wine-jar: then why, <br />As the wheel turns round does it end up a pitcher? <br />In short let it be what you wish, but whole and natural. <br />Most poets (dear sir, and you sons worthy of your sire), <br />Are beguiled by accepted form. I try to be brief <br />And become obscure: aiming at smoothness I fail <br />In strength and spirit: claiming grandeur he’s turgid: <br />Too cautious, fearing the blast, he crawls on the ground: <br />But the man who wants to distort something unnaturally <br />Paints a <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphin</a> among the trees, a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> in the waves. <br />Avoiding faults leads to error, if art is lacking. <br />The humblest craftsman, down by <a href=/people/116 target=_blank>Aemilius</a>’ School, <br />Who moulds finger-nails in bronze, imitates wavy hair, <br />Is unhappy with the result, because he’s unable <br />To create a whole. Now if I wished to cast something, <br />I’d no more wish to be him, than live with a crooked <br />Nose, though admired for my jet-black eyes and black hair. </p>                        </div>

It’s been our right, ever <br />Will be our right, to issue words that are fresh-stamped. <br />As the forests shed their leaves, as the year declines, <br />And the oldest fall, so perish those former generations <br />Of words, while the latest, like infants, are born and thrive. <br />We’re destined for death, we and ours: no matter if <br /><a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a>, harboured inshore, guards our ships from northerlies, <br />A royal project, no matter if an old barren marsh, that knew <br />The oar, feels the plough’s weight, and feeds the towns nearby, <br />Or that a river which ruined crops has changed its course, <br />And learnt better ways: our mortal works will vanish, <br />The beauty and charm of speech no more like to live. <br />Many words that are now unused will be rekindled, <br />Many fade now well-regarded, if Usage wills it so, <br />To whom the laws, rules, and control of language belong. </p>                        </div>

Comedy can’t be played in tragic mode. <br />Likewise <a href=/people/598 target=_blank>Thyestes</a>’ feast scorns being related <br />In everyday terms suited to the comic sock. <br />Let each thing keep to the proper place, allotted. <br />Yet Comedy may sometimes elevate its voice, <br />When an angry <a href=/people/3008 target=_blank>Chremes</a> storms in swelling phrase: <br />And often in tragedy, <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a> and <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephus</a>, <br />One exiled, one a beggar, lament in common prose, <br />Eschewing bombast, and sesquipedalian words, <br />When they want their moaning to touch the listener’s heart. <br />It’s not enough for poems to have beauty: they must have <br />Charm, leading their hearer’s heart wherever they wish. <br />As the human face smiles at a smile, so it echoes <br />Those who weep: if you want to move me to tears <br />You must first grieve yourself: then <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a> or <a href=/people/442 target=_blank>Telephus</a><br />Your troubles might pain me: speak inappropriately <br />And I’ll laugh or fall asleep. Sad words suit a face <br />Full of sorrow, threats fit the face full of anger, <br />Jests suit the playful, serious speech the solemn. <br />Nature first alters us within, to respond to each <br />Situation: brings delight or goads us to anger, <br />Or weighs us to the ground, tormented by grief: <br />Then, with tongue interpreting, shows heart’s emotion. <br />If the speaker’s words don’t harmonise with his state, <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> will bellow with laughter, knights and all. <br />Much depends on whether a god or man is speaking, <br />A mature old man, or one still flush with first youth, <br />A powerful lady, or perhaps a diligent nurse, <br />A wandering merchant, or tiller of fertile fields, <br /><a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=demonym long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchian</a> or <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a>, from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>. </p>                        </div>

Fine! Grand!’ <br />Now he’ll grow pale, now he’ll even force dew <br />From his fond eyes, leap, and strike the ground. <br />As those hired to mourn at funerals do and say <br />Almost more than those who are grieving deeply, <br />The hypocrite’s more ‘moved’ than the true admirer. <br />They say kings anxious to test someone, to see if <br />He’s worthy of friendship, urge on him many a glass, <br />Ply him with wine: so, if you should fashion verses, <br />Don’t be deceived by the <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>fox</a>’s hidden intent. </p>                        </div>

Grant poets the power and right to kill <br />Themselves: who saves one, against his will, murders him. <br />It’s not his first time, nor, if he’s rescued will he <br />Become human now, and stop craving fame in death. <br />It’s not too clear why he keeps on making verses. <br />Has he desecrated ancestral ashes, disturbed <br />A sad spot struck by lightning, sacrilegiously? Yes, <br />He’s mad: like a bear, that’s broken the bars of its cage <br />The pest puts all to flight, learned or not, with reciting: <br />Whom he takes tight hold of, he grips, and reads to death, <br />A leech that never looses the skin, till gorged with blood. </p>                        </div>
