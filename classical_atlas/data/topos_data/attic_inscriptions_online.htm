J. Rhodes, Date: 378/7 BC, found in the Athenian Agora <i>After the liberation of Thebes from Sparta in winter 379/8 (incorrectly dated a year later by Diodoros) the Athenians sent envoys to cities around the Greek world paving the way for a new alliance. Chios and Byzantium were first to respond positively, followed by Rhodes, Mytilene and others. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> established a Council (synedrion) of the allies to meet at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, the allies to remain autonomous, but under <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> leadership. Diodoros seems to imply that Thebes was initially outside, but allied to the new system, but soon became a full member. In a reference to unpopular aspects of her 5th cent. empire, the Athenians decided to give up all cleruchies (Athenian settlements) in allied cities and to forbid Athenians to farm land outside Attica.
