When he returned to the city, he was appointed consul with Quintus <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, in the fiftieth year of his age, and made a most illustrious marriage with <a href=/people/4906 target=_blank>Caecilia</a>, the daughter of <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, the <a href=/people/12031 target=_blank>Pontifex Maximus</a>.
