Though all went well with him in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, yet was he slain in his own palace by the guile of his wife <a href=/people/595 target=_blank>Clytemnestra</a> and the hand of <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a>, son of <a href=/people/598 target=_blank>Thyestes</a>. So he died and left behind him the ancient sceptre of <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a>, and <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a> reigns in his stead, with the daughter of <a href=/people/362 target=_blank>Tyndareus</a>, <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>'s queen, to wife. Now as for those whom he left in his halls, when he sailed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, his son <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> and his tender daughter <a href=/people/388 target=_blank>Electra</a>,-the boy <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a>, as he was like to be slain by <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a>, his sire's old foster-father secretly removed to the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=place long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocis</a> and gave to <a href=/people/2024 target=_blank>Strophius</a> to bring up, but the maid <a href=/people/388 target=_blank>Electra</a> abode in her father's house, and soon as she had budded into maidenhood, came all the princes of Hellas asking her hand in marriage. </p>                        </div>

But when e'en thus there seemed some room for fear that she might bear some noble lord a child by stealth and <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a> was minded to slay her, her mother, though she had a cruel heart, yet rescued the maiden from his hand. For she could find excuses for having slain her husband, but she feared the hatred she would incur for her children's murder. Wherefore <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a> devised this scheme; on <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>'s son who had escaped his realm by flight he set a price to be paid to any who should slay him, while he gave <a href=/people/388 target=_blank>Electra</a> to me in marriage, whose ancestors were citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377228PMyk class=place long=22.7561 lat=37.7308>Mycenae</a>. It is not that I blame myself for; my family was noble enough, though certainly impoverished, and so my good birth suffers. By making for her this weak alliance he thought he would have little to fear. For if some man of high position had married her, he might have revived the vengeance for <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>'s murder, which now is sleeping; in which case <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a> would have paid the penalty. But <a href=/people/168 target=_blank>Cypris</a> is my witness that I have ever respected her maidenhood; she is still as though unwed. Unworthy as I am, honour forbids that I should so affront the daughter of a better man. Yea, and I am sorry for <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a>, hapless youth, who is called my kinsman, to think that he should ever return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a> and behold his sister's wretched marriage. And whoso counts me but a fool for leaving a tender maid untouched when I have her in my house, to him I say, he measures purity by the vicious standard of his own soul, a standard like himself.

A truce to your folly! ye self-deceivers, swollen with idle fancies; learn to judge men by their converse, and by their habits decide who are noble. Such are they who rule aright both states and families; while those forms of flesh, devoid of intellect, are but figure-heads in the market-place. The strong arm, again, no more than the weak awaits the battle-shock, for this depends on natural courage. Well! absent or present, <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>'s son, whose business brings us here, deserves this of us, so let us accept a lodging in this house. (Calling to his servants) Ho! sirrahs, go within. A humble host, who does his best, in preference to a wealthy man for me! And so I thankfully accept this peasant's proffered welcome, though I could have preferred that thy brother were conducting me to share his fortune in his halls. Maybe he yet will come; for the oracies of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Loxias</a> are sure, but to man's divining Farewell say I.

Next <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a> took from basket a long straight knife, and cutting off some of the calf's hair, laid it with his right hand on the sacred fire, and then cut its throat when the servants had lifted it upon their shoulders, and thus addressed thy brother; </p>                        </div>

Now <a href=/people/362 target=_blank>Tyndareus</a> bestowed me on thy father not that I or any children I might bear should be slain. Yet he went and took my daughter from our house to the fleet at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384236UAul class=place long=23.5925 lat=38.4335>Aulis</a>, persuading me that <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> was to wed her; and there he held her o'er the pyre, and cut <a href=/people/708 target=_blank>Iphigenia</a>'s snowy throat.

Of all the wives in Hellas thou wert the only one I know who wert overjoyed when <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>'s star was in the ascendant, while, if it set, thy brow was clouded, since thou hadst no wish that <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> should return from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. And yet thou couldst have played a virtuous part to thy own glory. The husband thou hadst was no whit inferior to <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a>, for he it was whom Hellas chose to be her captain. And when thy sister <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> wrought that deed of shame, thou couldst have won thyself great glory, for vice is a warning and calls attention to virtue. If, as thou allegest, my father slew thy daughter, what is the wrong I and my brother have done thee? How was it thou didst not bestow on us our father's halls after thy husband's death, instead of bartering them to buy a paramour? Again, thy husband is not exiled for thy son's sake, nor is he slain to avenge my death, although by him this life is quenched twice as much as e'er my sister's was; so if murder is to succeed murder in requital, I and thy son <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> must slay thee to avenge our father; if that was just, why so is this. Whoso fixes his gaze on wealth or noble birth and weds a wicked woman, is a fool; better is a humble partner in his home, if she be virtuous, than a proud one. </p>                        </div>
