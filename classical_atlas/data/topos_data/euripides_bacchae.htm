Maybe some one will say, I have no respect for my grey hair in going to dance with ivy round my head; not so, for the god did not define whether old or young should dance, but from all alike he claims a universal homage, and scorns nice calculations in his worship. <br />CADMUS: <a href=/people/468 target=_blank>Teiresias</a>, since thou art blind, I must prompt thee what to say. <a href=/people/283 target=_blank>Pentheus</a> is coming hither to the house in haste, <a href=/people/1580 target=_blank>Echion</a>'s son, to whom I resign the government. How scared he looks I what strange tidings will he tell? Enter PENTHEUS. <br />PENTHEUS: I had left my kingdom for awhile, when tidings of strange mischief in this city reached me; I hear that our women-folk have left their homes on pretence of Bacchic rites, and on the wooded hills rush wildly to and fro, honouring in the dance this new god <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, whoe'er he is; and in the midst of each revel-rout the brimming wine-bowl stands, and one by one they steal away to lonely spots to gratify their lust, pretending forsooth that they are <a href=/people/12033 target=_blank>Maenads</a> bent on sacrifice, though it is <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> they are placing before the Bacchic god. As many as I caught, my gaolers are keeping safe in the public prison fast bound; and all who are gone forth, will I chase from the hills, <a href=/people/311 target=_blank>Ino</a> and <a href=/people/1211 target=_blank>Agave</a> too who bore me to <a href=/people/1580 target=_blank>Echion</a>, and <a href=/people/583 target=_blank>Actaeon</a>'s mother <a href=/people/993 target=_blank>Autonoe</a>. In fetters of iron will I bind them and soon put an end to these outrageous Bacchic rites. They say there came a stranger hither, a trickster and a sorcerer, from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a>'s land, with golden hair and perfumed locks, the flush of wine upon his face, and in his eyes each grace that <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> gives; by day and night he lingers in our maidens' company on the plea of teaching Bacchic mysteries. Once let me catch him within these walls, and I will put an end to his thyrsus-beating and his waving of his tresses, for I will cut his head from his body. This is the fellow who says that <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> is a god, says that he was once stitched up in the thigh of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>-that child who with his mother was blasted by the lightning flash, because the woman falsely said her marriage was with <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. Is not this enough to deserve the awful penalty of hanging, this stranger's wanton insolence, whoe'er he be? But lo! another marvel. I see <a href=/people/468 target=_blank>Teiresias</a>, our diviner, dressed in dappled fawn-skins, and my mother's father too, wildly waving the Bacchic wand; droll sight enough! Father, it grieves me to see you two old men so void of sense. Oh! shake that ivy from thee! Let fall the thyrsus from thy hand, my mother's sire! Was it thou, <a href=/people/468 target=_blank>Teiresias</a>, urged him on to this? Art bent on introducing this fellow as another new deity amongst men, that thou mayst then observe the fowls of the air and make a gain from fiery divination? Were it not that thy grey hairs protected thee, thou shouldst sit in chains amid the Bacchanals, for introducing knavish mysteries; for where the gladsome grape is found at women's feasts, I deny that their rites have any longer good results. </p>                        </div>

Hast thou no reverence, sir stranger, for the gods or for <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a> who sowed the crop of earth-born warriors? Son of <a href=/people/1580 target=_blank>Echion</a> as thou art, thou dost shame thy birth. <br />TEIRESIAS: Whenso a man of wisdom finds a good topic for argument, it is no difficult matter to speak well; but thou, though possessing a glib tongue as if endowed with sense, art yet devoid thereof in all thou sayest. A headstrong man, if he have influence and a capacity for speaking, makes a bad citizen because he lacks sense. This new deity, whom thou deridest, will rise to power I cannot say how great, throughout Hellas. Two things there are, young prince, that hold first rank among men, the goddess <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>, that is, the earth, calf her which name thou please; she it is that feedeth men with solid food; and as her counterpart came this god, the son of <a href=/people/205 target=_blank>Semele</a>, who discovered the juice of the grape and introduced it to mankind, stilling thereby each grief that mortals suffer from, soon as e'er they are filled with the juice of the vine; and sleep also he giveth, sleep that brings forgetfulness of daily ills, the sovereign charm for all our woe. God though he is, he serves all other gods for libations, so that through him mankind is blest. He it is whom thou dost mock, because he was sewn up in the thigh of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. But I will show thee this fair mystery. When <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> had snatched him from the lightning's blaze, and to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a> borne the tender babe, <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> would have cast him forth from heaven, but <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, as such a god well might, devised a counterplot. He broke off a fragment of the ether which surrounds the world, and made thereof a hostage against <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>'s bitterness, while he gave out <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> into other hands; hence, in time, men said that he was reared in the thigh of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, having changed the word and invented a legend, because the god was once a hostage to the goddess <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>. This god too hath prophetic power, for there is no small prophecy inspired by Bacchic frenzy; for whenever the god in his full might enters the human frame, he makes his frantic votaries foretell the future. Likewise he hath some share in <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>' rights; for oft, or ever a weapon is touched, a panic seizes an army when it is marshalled in array; and this too is a frenzy sent by <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>. Yet shalt thou behold him e'en on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>'s rocks leaping o'er the cloven height, torch in hand, waving and brandishing the branch by <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a> loved, yea, and through the length and breadth of Hellas. Hearken to me, <a href=/people/283 target=_blank>Pentheus</a>; never boast that might alone doth sway the world, nor if thou think so, unsound as thy opinion is, credit thyself with any wisdom; but receive the god into thy realm, pour out libations, join the revel rout, and crown thy head. It is not <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> that will force chastity on women in their love; but this is what we should consider, whether chastity is part of their nature for good and all; for if it is, no really modest maid will ever fall 'mid Bacchic mysteries. Mark this: thou thyself art glad when thousands throng thy gates, and citizens extol the name of <a href=/people/283 target=_blank>Pentheus</a>; he too, I trow, delights in being honoured. Wherefore I and <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a>, whom thou jeerest so, will wreath our brows with ivy and join the dance; pair of grey beards though we be, still must we take part therein; never will I for any words of thine fight against heaven.

His it is to rouse the revellers to dance, to laugh away dull care, and wake the flute, whene'er at banquets of the gods the luscious grape appears, or when the winecup in the feast sheds sleep on men who wear the ivy-spray. The end of all unbridled speech and lawless senselessness is misery; but the life of calm repose and the rule of reason abide unshaken and support the home; for far away in heaven though they dwell, the powers divine behold man's state. Sophistry is not wisdom, and to indulge in thoughts beyond man's ken is to shorten life; and if a man on such poor terms should aim too high, he may miss the pleasures in his reach.

Then did <a href=/people/1553 target=_blank>Bromius</a>-so at least it seemed to me; I only tell you what I thought-made a phantom in the hall, and he rushed after it in headlong haste, and stabbed the lustrous air, thinking he wounded me. Further the Bacchic god did other outrage to him; he dashed the building to the ground, and there it lies a mass of ruin, a sight to make him rue most bitterly my bonds. At last from sheer fatigue he dropped his sword and fell fainting; for he a mortal frail, dared to wage war upon a god; but I meantime quietly left the house and am come to you, with never a thought of <a href=/people/283 target=_blank>Pentheus</a>.

What is true wisdom, or what fairer boon has heaven placed in mortals' reach, than to gain the mastery o'er a fallen foe? What is fair is dear for aye. Though slow be its advance, yet surely moves the power of the gods, correcting those mortal wights, that court a senseless pride, or, in the madness of their fancy, disregard the gods. Subtly they lie in wait, through the long march of time, and so hunt down the godless man. For it is never right in theory or in practice to o'erride the law of custom. This is a maxim cheaply bought: whatever comes of God, or in time's long annals, has grown into a law upon a natural basis, this is sovereign. What is true wisdom, or what fairer boon has heaven placed in mortals' reach, than to gain the mastery o'er a fallen foe? What is fair is dear for ave. Happy is he who hath escaped the wave from out the sea, and reached the haven; and happy he who hath triumphed o'er his troubles; though one surpasses another in wealth and power; yet there be myriad hopes for all the myriad minds; some end in happiness for man, and others come to naught; but him, whose life from day today is blest, I deem a happy man.

First then we sat us down in a grassy glen, carefully silencing each footfall and whispered breath, to see without being seen. Now there was a dell walled in by rocks, with rills to water it, and shady pines o'erhead; there were the <a href=/people/12033 target=_blank>Maenads</a> seated, busied with joyous toils. Some were wreathing afresh the drooping thyrsus with curling ivy-sprays; others, like colts let loose from the carved chariot-yoke, were answering each other in hymns of Bacchic rapture. But <a href=/people/283 target=_blank>Pentheus</a>, son of sorrow, seeing not the women gathered there, exclaimed, Sir stranger, from where I stand, I cannot clearly see the mock <a href=/people/11014 target=_blank>Bacchantes</a>; but I will climb a hillock or a soaring pine whence to see clearly the shameful doings of the Bacchanals. Then and there I saw the stranger work a miracle; for catching a lofty fir-branch by the very end he drew it downward to the dusky earth, lower yet and ever lower; and like a bow it bent, or rounded wheel, whose curving circle grows complete, as chalk and line describe it; e'en so the stranger drew down the mountain-branch between his hands, bending it to earth, by more than human agency. </p>                        </div>

But they, not sure of the voice they heard, sprang up and peered all round; then once again his bidding came; and when the daughters of <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a> knew it was the Bacchic god in very truth that called, swift as doves they dirted off in cager haste, his mother <a href=/people/1211 target=_blank>Agave</a> and her sisters dear and all the Bacchanals; through torrent glen, o'er boulders huge they bounded on, inspired with madness by the god.
