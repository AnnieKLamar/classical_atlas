There the son of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronos</a> used to lie with the rich-tressed nymph, unseen by deathless gods and mortal men, at dead of night while sweet sleep should hold white-armed <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> fast. And when the purpose of great <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> was fixed in heaven, she was delivered and a notable thing was come to pass. For then she bare a son, of many shifts, blandly cunning, a robber, a <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> driver, a bringer of dreams, a watcher by night, a thief at the gates, one who was soon to show forth wonderful deeds among the deathless gods. Born with the dawning, at mid-day he played on the lyre, and in the evening he stole the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> of far-shooting <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> on the fourth day of the month; for on that day queenly <a href=/people/525 target=_blank>Maia</a> bare him. So soon as he had leaped from his mother's heavenly womb, he lay not long waiting in his holy cradle, but he sprang up and sought the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>. But as he stepped over the threshold of the high-roofed cave, he found a tortoise there and gained endless delight. For it was <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> who first made the tortoise a singer. The creature fell in his way at the courtyard gate, where it was feeding on the rich grass before the dwelling, waddling along. </p>                        </div>

I do not slight it. Hail, comrade of the feast, lovely in shape, sounding at the dance! With joy I meet you! Where got you that rich gaud for covering, that spangled shell — a tortoise living in the mountains?

As a swift thought darts through the heart of a man when thronging cares haunt him, or as bright glances flash from the eye, so glorious <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> planned both thought and deed at once. He cut stalks of reed to measure and fixed them, fastening their ends across the back and through the shell of the tortoise, and then stretched <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> hide all over it by his skill. Also he put in the horns and fitted a cross-piece upon the two of them, and stretched seven strings of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>-gut. But when he had made it he proved each string in turn with the key, as he held the lovely thing. At the touch of his hand it sounded marvellously; and, as he tried it, the god sang sweet random snatches, even as youths bandy taunts at festivals. He sang of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the son of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronos</a> and neat-shod <a href=/people/525 target=_blank>Maia</a>, the converse which they had before in the comradeship of love, telling all the glorious tale of his own begetting.

He threw them both panting upon their backs on the ground, and rolled them on their sides, bending their necks over, and pierced their vital chord. Then he went on from task to task: first he cut up the rich, fatted meat, and pierced it with wooden spits, and roasted flesh and the honourable chine and the paunch full of dark blood all together. He laid them there upon the ground, and spread out the hides on a rugged rock: and so they are still there many ages afterwards, a long, long time after all this, and are continually. Next glad-hearted <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> dragged the rich meats he had prepared and put them on a smooth, flat stone, and divided them into twelve portions distributed by lot, making each portion wholly honourable. Then glorious <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> longed for the sacrificial meat, for the sweet savour wearied him, god though he was; nevertheless his proud heart was not prevailed upon to devour the flesh, although he greatly desired. But he put away the fat and all the flesh in the high-roofed byre, placing them high up to be a token of his youthful theft. And after that he gathered dry sticks and utterly destroyed with fire all the hoofs and all the heads. </p>                        </div>
