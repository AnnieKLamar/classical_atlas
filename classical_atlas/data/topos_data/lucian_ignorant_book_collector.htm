You think that by buying up all the best books you can lay your hands on, you will pass for a man of literary tastes: not a bit of it; you are merely exposing thereby your own ignorance of literature. Why, you cannot even buy the right things: any casual recommendation is enough to guide your choice; you are as clay in the hands of the unscrupulous amateur, and as good as cash down to any dealer. How are you to know the difference between genuine old books that are worth money, and trash whose only merit is that it is falling to pieces? You are reduced to taking the worms and moths into your confidence; their activity is your sole clue to the value of a book; as to the accuracy and fidelity of the copyist, that is quite beyond you. </p>                        </div>

Your eyes, to be sure, are open; you do see your books, goodness knows, see them till you must be sick of the sight; you even read a bit here and there, in a scrambling fashion, your lips still busy with one sentence while your eyes are on the next. But what is the use of that?

So it is with you: you have always a book in your hand, you are always reading; but what it is all about, you have not an idea; you do but prick up asinine ears at the lyre's sound. Books would be precious things indeed, if the mere possession of them guaranteed culture to their owner. You rich men would have it all your own way then; we paupers could not stand against you, if learning were a marketable commodity; and as for the dealers, no one would presume to contest the point of culture with men who have whole shopfuls of books at their disposal. However, you will find on examination that these privileged persons are scarcely less ignorant than yourself. They have just your vile accent, and are as deficient in intelligence as one would expect men to be who have never learnt to distinguish good from bad.

Judge from this how much good your purchases are likely to do you; unless you think that your very book-cases acquire a tincture of learning, from the bare fact of their housing so many ancient manuscripts. Oblige me by answering some questions; or rather, as circumstances will not admit of your answering, just nod or shake your head. If the flute of <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a>, or that of <a href=/people/860 target=_blank>Ismenias</a>, which its owner sold in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a> for a couple of thousand pounds, were to fall into the hands of a person who did not know how to play the instrument, would that make him a flute-player? would his acquisition leave him any wiser than it found him? You very properly shake your head. A man might possess the instrument of a <a href=/people/451 target=_blank>Marsyas</a> or an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a>, and still he would not be able to play it if he had never learnt. Take another case: a man gets hold of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>'s bow and arrows: but he is no <a href=/people/448 target=_blank>Philoctetes</a>; he has neither that marksman's strength nor his eye. What do you say? will he acquit himself creditably? Again you shake your head. The same will be the case with the ignorant pilot who is entrusted with a ship, or with the unpractised rider on horseback. Nothing is wanting to the beauty and efficiency of the vessel, and the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> may be a <a href=/people/538 target=_blank>Median</a> or a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> or a Koppa: yet I take it that the incompetence of their respective owners will be made clear; am I right? And now let me ask your assent to one more proposition: if an illiterate person like yourself goes in for buying books, he is thereby laying himself open to ridicule. You hesitate? Yet surely nothing could be clearer: who could observe such a man at work, and abstain from the inevitable allusion to pearls and <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>?

But the absurd thing was, that he would always make a point of having the smartest and newest of shoes to set off his stumps — feet, I mean.

There is only one part you need trouble about; the rest does not apply to your case. I refer to the harangue of a certain ludicrous, maimed, distorted creature called <a href=/people/1306 target=_blank>Thersites</a>. Now imagine this <a href=/people/1306 target=_blank>Thersites</a>, such as he is there depicted, to have clothed himself in the armour of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>.

Will he prove a slayer of <a href=/people/1935 target=_blank>Asteropaeus</a>es and Lycaons, and finally of Hectors, he who cannot so much as bear <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>'s spear upon his shoulders? Of course not. He will simply be ridiculous: the weight of the shield will cause him to stagger, and will presently bring him on to his nose; beneath the helmet, as often as he looks up, will be seen that squint; the Achillean greaves will be a sad drag to his progress, and the rise and fall of the breast-plate will tell a tale of a humped-back; in short, neither the armourer nor the owner of the arms will have much to boast of. You are just like <a href=/people/1306 target=_blank>Thersites</a>, if only you could see it.

Well, he saw at once that the athletic contests were quite out of the question; he had neither the strength nor the agility required. A musical victory, on the other hand, would be an easy matter; so at least he was persuaded by his vile parasites, who used to burst into a roar of applause the moment he touched the strings of his lyre. He arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> in great style: among other things, he had provided himself with gold-bespangled garments, and a beautiful golden laurel-wreath, with full-size emerald berries. As for his lyre, that was a most gorgeous and costly affair — solid gold throughout, and ornamented with all kinds of gems, and with figures of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> and <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a> and the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, a wonder to all beholders.

Not thinking it advisable to display his acquisition in the city in broad daylight, he waited till night, and then, putting it under his cloak, walked off into the outskirts; and there this youth, who had not a note of music in him, produced his instrument and began jangling on the strings, expecting such divine strains to issue therefrom as would subdue all souls, and prove him the fortunate heir to <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>'s power. He went on till a number of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> collected at the sound and tore him limb from limb; thus far, at least, his fate resembled that of <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>, though his power of attraction extended only to hostile <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>. It was abundantly proved that the charm lay not in the lyre, but solely in those peculiar gifts of song and music that had been bestowed upon <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a> by his mother; as to the lyre, it was just like other lyres.

In point of fact, I have seen <a href=/people/85 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a>'s portrait, and the two — to borrow a musical phrase — are about as much like one another as bass and treble; and yet he was convinced he was the image of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>.
