Nevertheless, if you will promise to read with indulgence, and fill up the gaps in my tale from your imagination, I will essay the task.

Well, well, if any one does cast reflections of that sort upon us, we shall at least have a precedent to plead. <a href=/people/2592 target=_blank>Arrian</a> himself, disciple of <a href=/people/1264 target=_blank>Epictetus</a>, distinguished Roman, and product of lifelong culture as he was, had just our experience, and shall make our defence. He condescended, that is, to put on record the life of the robber Tilliborus. The robber we propose to immortalize was of a far more pestilent kind, following his profession not in the forests and mountains, but in cities; he was not content to overrun a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=place long=28 lat=40>Mysia</a> or an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397268LIda class=place long=26.8423 lat=39.6922>Ida</a>; his booty came not from a few scantily populated districts of Asia; one may say that the scene of his depredations was the whole Roman Empire. </p>                        </div>

In person — not to forget that part of him — he was a fine handsome man with a real touch of divinity about him, white-skinned, moderately bearded; he wore besides his own hair artificial additions which matched it so cunningly that they were not generally detected. His eyes were piercing, and suggested inspiration, his voice at once sweet and sonorous. In fact there was no fault to be found with him in these respects. </p>                        </div>

As for his mind and spirit — well, if all the kind Gods who avert disaster will grant a prayer, it shall be that they bring me not within reach of such a one as he; sooner will I face my bitterest enemies, my country's foes. In understanding, resource, acuteness, he was far above other men; curiosity, receptiveness, memory, scientific ability — all these were his in overflowing measure. But he used them for the worst purposes. Endowed with all these instruments of good, he very soon reached a proud pre-eminence among all who have been famous for evil; the <a href=/people/3195 target=_blank>Cercopes</a>, <a href=/people/2105 target=_blank>Eurybatus</a>, <a href=/people/5903 target=_blank>Phrynondas</a>, <a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemus</a>, <a href=/people/988 target=_blank>Sostratus</a> — all thrown into the shade. In a letter to his father-in-law <a href=/people/2782 target=_blank>Rutilianus</a>, which puts his own pretensions in a truly modest light, he compares himself to <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>. Well, I should not like to offend the wise, the divine <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>; but if he had been <a href=/people/1439 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s contemporary, I am quite sure he would have been a mere child to him. Now by all that is admirable, do not take that for an insult to <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, nor suppose I would draw a parallel between their achievements. What I mean is: if any one would make a collection of all the vilest and most damaging slanders ever vented against <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> — things whose truth I would not accept for a moment — , the sum of them would not come within measurable distance of <a href=/people/1439 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s cleverness. You are to set your imagination to work and conceive a temperament curiously compounded of falsehood, trickery, perjury, cunning; it is versatile, audacious, adventurous, yet dogged in execution; it is plausible enough to inspire confidence; it can assume the mask of virtue, and seem to eschew what it most desires. I suppose no one ever left him after a first interview without the impression that this was the best and kindest of men, ay, and the simplest and most unsophisticated. Add to all this a certain greatness in his objects; he never made a small plan; his ideas were always large. While in the bloom of his youthful beauty, which we may </p>                        </div>

They realized that, whether a man is most swayed by the one or by the other, what he must most depend upon and desire is a knowledge of futurity.

All this they turned over and debated, and it issued in the resolve to establish an oracle. If it were successful, they looked for immediate wealth and prosperity; the result surpassed their most sanguine expectations. The next things to be settled were, first the theatre of operations, and secondly the plan of campaign. </p>                        </div>

Each person was to write down his wish and the object of his curiosity, fasten the packet with thread, and seal it with wax, clay, or other such substance. He would receive these, and enter the adyton (by this time the temple was complete, and the scene all ready), whither the givers should be summoned in order by a herald and an acolyte; he would learn the God's mind upon each, and return the packets with their seals intact and the answers attached, the God being ready to give a definite answer to any question that might be put. </p>                        </div>

He would heat a needle, melt with it the under part of the wax, lift the seal off, and after reading warm the wax once more with the needle — both that below the thread and that which formed the actual seal — and re-unite the two without difficulty. Another method employed the substance called collyrium; this is a preparation of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392165RBre class=demonym long=16.5 lat=39.2>Bruttian</a> pitch, bitumen, pounded glass, wax, and mastich. He kneaded the whole into collyrium, heated it, placed it on the seal, previously moistened with his tongue, and so took a mould. This soon hardened; he simply opened, read, replaced the wax, and reproduced an excellent imitation of the original seal as from an engraved stone. One more I will give you. Adding some gypsum to the glue used in book-binding he produced a sort of wax, which was applied still wet to the seal, and on being taken off solidified at once and provided a matrix harder than horn, or even iron. There are plenty of other devices for the purpose, to rehearse which would seem like airing one's knowledge.

The funeral celebration was to be worthy of his life, taking the form of a contest — for possession of the oracle. The most prominent of the impostors his accomplices referred it to <a href=/people/2782 target=_blank>Rutilianus</a>'s arbitration which of them should be selected to succeed to the prophetic office and wear the hierophantic oracular garland. Among these was numbered the grey-haired physician <a href=/people/1226 target=_blank>Paetus</a>, dishonouring equally his grey hairs and his profession. But Steward-of-the-Games <a href=/people/2782 target=_blank>Rutilianus</a> sent them about their business ungarlanded, and continued the defunct in possession of his holy office. </p>                        </div>

First, I was willing to oblige a friend and comrade who is for me the pattern of wisdom, sincerity, good humour, justice, tranquillity, and geniality. But secondly I was still more concerned (a preference which you will be very far from resenting) to strike a blow for <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, that great man whose holiness and divinity of nature were not shams, who alone had and imparted true insight into the good, and who brought deliverance to all that consorted with him. Yet I think casual readers too may find my essay not unserviceable, since it is not only destructive, but, for men of sense, constructive also. </p>                        </div>
