WHEN <a href=/people/160 target=_blank>Polybius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374221PMeg class=person long=22.1273 lat=37.4124>Megalopolis</a> proposed to write the history of all the remarkable occurrences of his own times, he thought it proper to demonstrate by facts, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, who were continually at war with the neighbouring states, for six hundred years after the building of their city, acquired in that space of time no considerable extent of dominion. But after they had subdued a small part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, which upon the invasion of <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> they lost at the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413162UCan class=place long=16.1515 lat=41.2964>Cannae</a>, and viewed their enemies under their own walls; they made so great a progress in good fortune, that in less than fifty-three years, they became masters, not only of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and Africa, but likewise of Spain. And being still desirous to enlarge their empire, they crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian</a> sea, conquered Greece, and ruined the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, whose king they carried to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> in chains. No person can therefore suppose that all this proceeded from causes merely human, but either from fatal necessity, the influence of the planets, or the will of the Deity, which regards with favour all our actions, while they are just and virtuous. For these provide for future contingencies by such a train of apparent causes, that thinking persons must conclude the administration of human affairs to he in the hands of a divine Providence; so that when the energy of nations by the divine influence is roused and alert, they flourish in prosperity; and on the contrary, when they become displeasing to the gods, their affairs decline to a state resembling that which now exists. <br />But it is necessary to demonstrate by actual circumstances the truth of my observations.</p>                        </div>

But when <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> with his prefects brought against them an army of immense magnitude, eight thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, as if inspired from <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a>, and armed by mere chance, advanced to oppose him, and met with such success as to kill ninety thousand, and compel the remainder to fly from their country.

But <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, after the death of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, invaded Greece with a force so much more considerable, that he appeared to carry all <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> along with him into Greece; for the sea was covered with his ships, and the land with his soldiers. Finding it necessary to cross from <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> into Europe, he constructed a bridge over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a> for the passage of his foot soldiers, and, as if the two elements of earth and water were not capable of receiving his army without depriving them of their natural use, cut a channel through Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402243LAth class=place long=24.327 lat=40.158>Athos</a>, in which his ships rode as in the sea. In the mean time the Greeks, though terrified at the bare report of the approach of such an enemy, prepared to oppose him with their utmost strength. In a naval engagement at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390232SArt class=place long=23.217 lat=39.0097>Artemisium</a>, and another at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379235PSal class=place long=23.5408 lat=37.952>Salamis</a>, they so far exceeded their former victory, that <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> was glad to escape with life, having lost the greatest part, of his army; and the destruction of the remainder of them at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233PPla class=place long=23.2733 lat=38.2213>Plateae</a> gave such a completion to the renown of the Greeks, that, by the force, of the reputation they had acquired, they not only liberated the Greeks that were settled in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, but possessed themselves of almost all the islands.</p>                        </div>

But the commonwealth being ruined by the civil wars between <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> and <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, and between <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Julius Caesar</a> and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, the aristocracy, or government of the nobles, was set aside, and <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavianus</a> chosen dictator. The entire administration of affairs was thus committed to him alone, without the consideration, that it was like throwing the hopes and interests of all the people on the hazard of a die, and placing that vast empire at the risk of the inclination and authority of a single ruler. For were it the inclination of such a ruler to govern according to justice and moderation, he could not hope to give satisfaction to all, not being able to protect such as were at a considerable distance in any convenient time, nor to select so many officers, that would fear the disgrace of not performing their duty; nor could he suit his own disposition to the different humours of so many. But if he should wish to break through the bonds of imperial and regal government, and exercise absolute tyranny, by subverting the existing establishments, conniving at great crimes, selling of justice, and regarding his subjects as slaves (as most, and indeed with a few exceptions, almost all the emperors have done), it must of necessity follow, that his unbounded savage authority would prove a common calamity. , It is the very nature of such a despotism, that fawning miscreants and parasites are preferred to situations of the greatest trust, whilst modest quiet men, who are averse to so base a manner of living, resent with justice that they themselves cannot enjoy similar benefits. Hence cities are filled with sedition and tumult; for when all offices, both civil and military, are conferred upon ill-disposed magistrates, it both renders the citizens restless in peace, and discourages the soldiers in war.</p>                        </div>

But I am now speaking of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346383UPal class=ethnic long=38.2688 lat=34.5507>Palmyrenes</a>, who, having as I related, acquired a large portion of the Roman empire, were warned by several declarations from the gods of the overthrew which they afterwards sustained. For example: at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364339PSel class=place long=33.9165 lat=36.3765>Seleucia</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> there was a temple of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> (called there Sarpedonius) and in that temple an oracle. It is reported of this deity, that he used to give to those that were infested with locusts a species of birds, called Seleuciades, which used to hover about his temple, and would send them along with any that desired it; that these birds would fly amongst the locusts, catch them in their mouths, and in a moment destroy a vast number of them, thus delivering the people from the mischief they produced. This I ascribe to the felicity of that age; our own generation has not merited such kindness from heaven. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346383UPal class=ethnic long=38.2688 lat=34.5507>Palmyrenes</a>, having consulted this oracle, to learn if they should ever gain the empire of the east, received this answer, <br />Accursed race! avoid my sacred fane, <br />Whose treach'rous deeds the angry gods disdain. <br />And some persons enquiring there concerning the success of the expedition of <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelianus</a> against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346383UPal class=ethnic long=38.2688 lat=34.5507>Palmyrenes</a>, the gods told them, <br />One falcon many doves commands, whose end <br />On his destructive pounces must depend.</p>                        </div>

Here is frequently seen, near the temple and in the adjacent places, a fire in the air, resembling a lamp, of a round figure, which has appeared even in our time, as often as people have assembled there on particular days. Whoever resorted hither, brought to the pond some offering for the goddess, either in gold, silver, linen, silk, or any thing of like value. If she accepted it, the cloth sunk to the bottom, like substances of greater weight; but if rejected, they would float on the water; and not only cloth and such substances, but even gold, silver, or any other of those materials which usually sink. For an experiment of this miracle, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346383UPal class=ethnic long=38.2688 lat=34.5507>Palmyrenes</a>, in the year before their overthrow, assembled on a festival, and threw into the pond several presents of gold, silver and cloth, in honour of the goddess, all of which sunk to the bottom.

It happened that Lydius had ordered him to hit a particular person, whom either accidently or on purpose he missed, for which he stripped and scourged him severely, and, moreover, threatened him with death. The man was so exasperated on account of the blows he had received, and so affrighted at the menaces, that he took an opportunity to steal out of the town; and falling in with some soldiers to whom he gave an account of his actions and sufferings, he shewed them an aperture in the wall, through which Lydius used to inspect all that was done in their camp, and promised them to shoot him as he was looking through it in his usual manner. The commander of the expedition on this took the man into favour; who, having planted his engine, and placed some men before him that he might not be discovered by the enemy, took aim at Lydius as he looked through the aperture, and with a dart shot him and gave him a mortal wound.

This is an excellent remedy for the plague, consumption and other diseases; of its origin receive this account. Valesus Valseius, from whom descended the Valerian family, was a great man among the <a href=/people/11083 target=_blank>Sabines</a>, before whose house was a grove of very lofty trees, which were burnt with lightning. He was thus induced to enquire the meaning of such a portent. His children, moreover, falling sick, he consulted both the physicians and the soothsayers. He was told by them, that by the manner of the fire falling the gods were angry; which caused Valesius wisely to attempt by sacrifices to appease them. He and his wife being terrified, and expecting every moment the death of their children, he prostrated himself before <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a>, and promised to offer up two entire souls instead of their children, which were his own and that of their mother. But turning to the grove that had been burnt, he seemed to hear a voice that commanded hint to carry the children to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>, and there to warm some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> water over the fire of <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Pluto</a> and <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Proserpine</a>, and to give it to the children to drink.

For <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a> was at a great distance, and besides there was no <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> water to be had there: and it caused him to entertain more desponding thoughts of it, that the voice had told him the water must be warmed on the altar of the infernal deities, at which the soothsayers themselves were also startled.</p>                        </div>

Putting his children on board a small river-vessel, he carried the fire along with him. The children were ready to faint through heat, while he sailed to that part of the river where the stream is most gentle; and taking up his lodging at a shepherd's cottage, he heard a voice say that he must stay at Tarentum, for that was the name of the place, which had the same name with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a> near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400182RIap class=demonym long=16.9 lat=40.8>Iapygian</a> promontory; On which Valesius, having paid due adoration to the gods for his good fortune, ordered the pilot to put to shore, and, landing, told the whole story to the shepherds.

Having so done they told the senate, that by sacrificing to <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Pluto</a> and <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Proserpine</a> an end would be put to all their miseries.

The first night that the spectacles were exhibited, the emperor with the Quindecimviri sacrificed three <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> on as many altars purposely placed on the side of the river, where having sprinkled the altars with blood he offered up the victims whole. Then, having prepared a scene without a theatre, they placed a great number of lights, and made a large fire, by which they sang a new hymn, to render the games more solemn. They who performed these ceremonies were rewarded for their labour with the first fruits of their wheat, barley, and beans. For these were as I stated distributed among the people. The following day they went up to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, where the usual sacrifices were offered, and going from thence to the appointed place, celebrated games in honour of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> and <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a>.

Finding a prediction, that whoever designed any harm to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> should die a miserable death, he applied it to himself, because he withstood those that came against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and wished to take it. His application indeed proved just. For when <a href=/people/2896 target=_blank>Maxentius</a> drew out his army before the city, and was marching over the bridge that he himself had constructed, an infinite number of <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owls</a> flew down and covered the wall.

The signal being given to the infantry, they likewise marched in good order towards the enemy. A furious battle having commenced, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> themselves, and their foreign allies, were unwilling to risk their lives, as they wished for deliverance from the bitter tyranny with which they were burdened; though the other troops were slain in great numbers, being either trod to death by the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, or killed by the foot. <br />As long as the cavalry kept their ground, <a href=/people/2896 target=_blank>Maxentius</a> retained some hopes, but when they gave way, he tied with the rest over the bridge into the city. The beams not being strong enough to bear so great a weight, they broke; and <a href=/people/2896 target=_blank>Maxentius</a>, with the others, was carried with the stream down the river.</p>                        </div>

Not because <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> gave any cause for it, but that <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a>, in his usual manner, was unfaithful to his agreement, by endeavouring to alienate from <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> some nations that belonged to his dominions. By this means an open rupture ensued, and both prepared for war. <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> took up his head-quarters at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/453188UCib class=place long=18.8042 lat=45.2891>Cibalis</a>, a city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=place long=19 lat=45>Pannonia</a>, which stands on a hill; the road to which is rugged and narrow. The greatest part of this road is through a deep morass, and the remainder up a mountain, on which stands the city. Below it extends a spacious plain, which entertains the view with a boundless prospect. On this <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> fixed his camp, and extended the body of his army under the hill, that his flanks might be protected from the enemy. <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a> in the meantime drew up his men near the mountain, placing the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> in front, thinking that to be the best disposition lest the enemy should fall upon the foot, who moved but slowly, and hinder their advance. Having done this, he immediately gave the charge, and attacked the enemy. This engagement was one of the most furious that was ever fought; for when each side had expended their darts, they fought a long time with spears and javelins; and after the action had continued from morning to night, the right wing, where <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a> himself commanded, began to prevail. The enemy being routed, <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a>'s troops, seeing him mounted and ready to fly, dared not stay to eat their portions, but left behind them all their <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and provisions, taking only as much food as would suffice for one night, and marched with great precipitation along with <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450196USir class=place long=19.6102 lat=44.9666>Sirmium</a>, a city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=place long=19 lat=45>Pannonia</a>, by which runs a river which discharges itself into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>.

This being effected according to the command of <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a>, the officers of his navy thought it not prudent to engage with more than eighty of their best sailing vessels, which were gallies of thirty oars each, because the place was too narrow for the reception of a greater number. Upon which Abantus, the admiral of <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a>, making use of two hundred ships, despised the smallness of the enemy's fleet, which he thought he could easily surround. But the signals on both sides being given, and the vessels meeting stern to stern, the seamen of <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a> managed their ships so as to engage in good order; but the ships of Abantus, sailing against the enemy without any order, and being confined by the narrowness of the place, became exposed to the enemy, who sunk and otherwise destroyed them. Many were thrown overboard; till at length night put an end to the engagement.

His father had been king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>. He was once celebrating his own birthday after the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> manner, when <a href=/people/7776 target=_blank>Hormisdas</a> entered the palace, bringing with him a large quantity of venison. But as the guests at the table did not rise, and pay him the respect and honour due to him, he became enraged, and told them he would punish them with the death of <a href=/people/2464 target=_blank>Marsyas</a>. This saying most of them did not understand, because it related to a foreign story; but one of them, who had lived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>, and had heard the story of <a href=/people/2464 target=_blank>Marsyas</a>, explained to them the meaning of <a href=/people/7776 target=_blank>Hormisdas</a>'s menace, while they sat at table. It was therefore so treasured up in their recollection, that when his father died, they remembered his threat, and chose his younger brother king, though according to law the elder should be preferred above the other children. Not contented with that, they put <a href=/people/7776 target=_blank>Hormisdas</a> in chains, and confined him on a hill which lies before their city. But after some time had elapsed, his wife effected his escape in this manner. She procured a large fish, and put a file in its belly, and, sewing it up again, delivered it to the most trusty of her eunuchs, charging him to tell <a href=/people/7776 target=_blank>Hormisdas</a>, that he must eat the fish when no one was present, and use what he should find in its belly for his escape. When she had formed this contrivance, she sent several <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a> loaded with wine, and abundance of meat, to entertain her husband's keepers. While they were enjoying the feast she gave them, <a href=/people/7776 target=_blank>Hormisdas</a> cut open the fish, and found the file; having with that filed off the shackles from his legs, he put on the robe of the eunuch, and passed through the midst of his keepers, who were by that time perfectly intoxicated. Taking one of the eunuchs along with him, he fled to the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a>, who was his particular friend.

For since many fortunate occurrences had been thereby predicted to him, and really had happened according to such prediction, he was afraid that others might be told something which should fall out to his misfortune; and for that reason applied himself to the abolishing of the practice.

Having thus divided the power of these prefects, he invented other methods likewise of diminishing their influence. For as there used to be in all places, centurions, tribunes, and generals, he appointed officers called Magistri militum, some over the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and others over the foot, to whom he gave authority to discipline the soldiers, and punish those that had offended, by which the power of the prefects was diminished. That this innovation was productive of great injury to public affairs both in peace and war I will immediately prove. The prefects had hitherto collected the tribute in all places by their officers, and disposed of it in war expences, the soldiers at the same time being subject to their authority, whose offences they punished at discretion. Under these circumstances, the soldiers, considering that the same person who gave them their pay had the infliction of punishments whenever they offended, did not dare to act contrary to their duty, for fear of their stipend being withheld, and of being duly punished. But now since one person is paymaster and another inspector of discipline, they act according to their own inclination.</p>                        </div>

He determined, after much hesitation, to invite all the officers of his army to sup with him, and at table inform them of his opinion. The following day he again convened the army; he reminded them of the injuries they received from <a href=/people/2733 target=_blank>Constans</a> when furious and intoxicated. That the soldiers could not sustain the enormities with which he oppressed the state contrary to all law and justice, but had inclined to what was most for the public advantage; and that after they had freed the cities from so savage a monster, they had compelled him to become their emperor.</p>                        </div>

The sentinels who were on the watch in <a href=/people/4691 target=_blank>Siscia</a>, a town that lies on the Saus, perceived their approach, and gave notice of it, to the garrison, who shot some of them as they were landing on the bank of the river, and stopped others who were coming over; so that many of them were slain, hut more pushed into the river, either by each other or by the enemy. By which means a great slaughter was made amongst them, and while one party fell from the bridge in their haste to escape, the other pursued with the greatest speed: so that <a href=/people/2632 target=_blank>Magnentius</a>, who was reduced to his last device, had only one method of avoiding the present danger. He struck a spear into the ground, and beckoned with his right hand to the enemy as if he wished to treat for peace. When he saw that they attended to this, he said he would not pass the Saus without the emperor's permission. As soon as he had said this, <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> told him, that if he would treat for peace, he must leave <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/470150RNor class=place long=15 lat=47>Noricum</a>, and go into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>. <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a>, having heard what was said, commanded his soldiers to continue their pursuit no longer, and permitted <a href=/people/2632 target=_blank>Magnentius</a> to bring his troops into the plains between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/470150RNor class=place long=15 lat=47>Noricum</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=place long=19 lat=45>Pannonia</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440205RMys class=place long=20.5 lat=44>Moesia</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=place long=25 lat=44.5>Dacia</a>; having a wish to leave those rugged places, and to contend where his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> would have room to manoeuvre, for in that species of force he had the advantage of the enemy. His design succeeded; and he appointed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/453188UCib class=place long=18.8042 lat=45.2891>Cibalis</a> which he thought a convenient place for his purpose; it being the place where <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a> conquered <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a>. In that town, which is situated as I have described in my narrative of those times, he kept part of his army. And having erected a bulwark between the hill on which the town stands, and the plain through which the river Saus flows, he inclosed all that part of it which is not encompassed by the river, with a deep ditch and a strong rampart. He then made a bridge of boats over that part of the river which surrounds the place, which bridge he could disjoin when he pleased, and put together again with the same ease. Here he placed tents for his army, and in the midst of them a royal tent of exceeding magnificence. The emperor then invited his officers to a banquet, at which all except <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a> and <a href=/people/3088 target=_blank>Thalassius</a> were present.

Finding that those in the town had shut the gates against him and mounted the walls, he was at a loss how to act on the occasion, having no engines nor any other method of getting near the wall.

But this did not succeed to his wishes, the people on the wall extinguishing the flames with water which they poured down in large quantities. When he therefore heard that <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> was near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/456187UMur class=place long=18.6963 lat=45.5602>Mursa</a>, he invented another stratagem to this effect. There was before the city a stadium or place of exercise, formerly used by those that fought for prizes, which was covered over with wood. In this he concealed four companies of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celtae</a>, with orders when <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> should come up, and they were ready to engage before the city, to attack the enemy by surprise, and to surround them and kill every man.

They first selected the choicest of their men, both heavy armed and archers, and taking them along with themselves, fastened up all the doors of the stadium. Having then possessed themselves of the upper steps loading into the; Stadium, and inclosed the soldiers that were within on all sides, they threw darts at them. And observing some of them with their shields placed over their heads attempting to force open the doors, they fell upon them and did not cease throwing darts or cutting at them with their swords until they had killed them all. This project of <a href=/people/2632 target=_blank>Magnentius</a> being thus frustrated, the armies met and engaged in the plain before <a about=https://topostext.org/place/456187UMur class=place long=18.6963 lat=45.5602>Mursa</a>; where such a battle was fought as had not occurred before in the course of this war, and great numbers fell on both sides.</p>                        </div>

While he was thus deliberating, the armies were still engaged; and that of <a href=/people/2632 target=_blank>Magnentius</a> became more furious, nor would they cease fighting though night came on, but even their officers continued performing what belonged to common soldiers, and encouraging their men to oppose the enemy with vigour.

As she knew that the emperor was suspicious of all his kindred, she thus circumvented him. She observed to him, that <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a> was a young man unacquainted with the intrigues of state, having devoted himself totally to his studies; and that he was wholly inexperienced in worldly business. That on this account he would be more fit for his purpose than any other person. That either he would be fortunate, and his success would be attributed to the emperor's conduct, or that he would fail and perish; and that thus <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> would have none of the imperial family to succeed to him.</p>                        </div>

And understanding that the people of those parts were terrified at the very name of the barbarians, while those whom <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> had sent along with him, who were not more than three hundred and sixty, knew nothing more, as he used to say, than how to say their prayers, he enlisted as many more as he could and took in a great number of volunteers. He also provided arms, and finding a quantity of old weapons in some town he fitted them up, and distributed them among the soldiers. The scouts bringing him intelligence, that an immense number of barbarians had crossed the river near the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/486078UArg class=place long=7.7511 lat=48.5827>Argentoratum</a> (Strasburgh) which stands on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>, he no sooner heard of it, than he led forth his army with the greatest speed, and engaging with the enemy gained such a victory as exceeds all description. It is said that sixty thousand men were killed on the spot, besides as many more that were driven into the river and drowned. In a word, if this victory be compared to that of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> over <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, it will be found in no respects inferior to it. <br />We ought not however to pass over in silence an action of Caesar after the victory. He possessed a regiment of six hundred <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, which were well disciplined, and in whose valour and experience he so confided, that he ventured great partof his hopes upon their performances. Indeed when the battle commenced, the whole army attacked the enemy with all the resolution they could show; but some time afterwards, though the Roman army had considerably the advantage, these were the only troops that fled, and left their station so dishonourably, that when Caesar rode up to them with a small party, and called them back to a share of the victory, he could not by any means prevail on them to turn. On which account he was justly indignant with them, for having as much as related to them betrayed their countrymen to the barbarians. Yet he did not inflict on them the usual and legal punishment. But he dressed them in women's clothes, and led them through the camp towards another province, thinking that such a punishment would be worse than death to soldiers that were men. Indeed this happened very fortunately both for him and them; for in the second war against the Germans they recollected the ignominy which had previously been imposed upon them,and were almost the only troops who conducted themselves bravely in that engagement.</p>                        </div>

A most furious battle therefore took place; a great number of the barbarians being slain on the field of battle, while the rest fled, and were pursued by Caesar into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/484084RHer class=place long=8.35 lat=48.35>Hercynian</a> forest, and many of them killed. <a href=/people/2266 target=_blank>Vadomarius</a> the son of their general was made prisoner.

As they consented to this, and promised to deliver all that remained alive; Caesar used the following method of ascertaining that no single captive was detained by the barbarians. He sent for all that had fled out of each city and village, and required them to give him the names of the persons who had been carried off by the enemy from each of such city or village. Each of them having named the persons whom they knew, either from relationship, friendship, neighbourhood, or some other ground, he ordered the imperial notaries to take a list of them; which they did so privately, that the ambassadors knew nothing of it. Upon this, he crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>, and commanded them to bring back the captives, which they in a short time obeyed. As they declared that those were all they had taken, Caesar, who was seated upon a high throne, behind which the notaries were placed, ordered the barbarians to produce their captives, according to their agreement. When the captives came singly before him and told their names, the notaries, who stood close behind Caesar, examined their papers to find if they were all correct. Afterwards comparing those which they had taken down with what had appeared before Caesar, and perceiving that the inhabitants of the different places had named many more than were present, they communicated it to Caesar. On which he threatened the ambassadors with a war against their countrymen, for not delivering all the captives, and by the information of the notaries named some individuals of particular places that were yet missing. The barbarians, on hearing this, presently imagined that Caesar had the most abstruse secrets of nature revealed to him by some divine intelligence, and therefore promised to give up all that they found alive, and bound their promise with the customary oath of their country.</p>                        </div>

For the neighbouring cities could not supply them, having themselves felt the violence of the barbarians, and consequently having no great abundance for their own use.

This was so often repeated, the voyage being short, that he abundantly supplied those who were restored to their cities with sufficiency for their sustenance, so likewise for the sowing season, and what they needed until harvest.

Being obstructed by the Franks who resided near them, and who were afraid of giving Caesar a just occasion of making another attack on them, they shortly built themselves a number of boats, in which they sailed along the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> beyond the territory of the Franks, and entered the Roman empire.

As he dared not attempt this without being supported by the law, he at first went alone into the thickest part of the woods, and waited there till the barbarians made their incursions. In the night, when they lay intoxicated and asleep, he fell on them and slew them in great numbers, bringing their heads and shewing them to the people of the town. This he practised continually to such an extent, that he abated the keenness of the barbarians, who though unable to guess at the cause, yet were sensible of the losses they sustained, the army diminishing daily. Some other robbers having joined this man, and their number having increased to a considerable body, <a href=/people/6347 target=_blank>Charietto</a>, (which was the name of the man who first used (his kind of ambuscade against the barbarians) came to Caesar, and told him the whole circumstances, which few persons knew before that time. Caesar, was at this time unable to restrain their nocturnal and clandestine incursions of the barbarians, as they robbed in small parties, straggling from each other, and when day appeared, not one of them was visible, all hiding themselves in the woods, and subsisting on what they gained by robbery. Considering therefore the difficulty of subduing such an enemy, he determined to oppose these robbers, not with an army of soldiers, but with men of similar description. <br />For this reason, he sent <a href=/people/6347 target=_blank>Charietto</a> and his band, adding to them many of the Salii, against the plundering <a href=/people/11070 target=_blank>Quadi</a>, who though they lived on what they stole, yet were probably less expert in the art of robbing, than these men who had studied it. In the day he guarded the open fields, and killed all that escaped his robbers. He did this for a long time, until the <a href=/people/11070 target=_blank>Quadi</a> were reduced to such extremities, and to so small a number, that they and their general surrendered themselves to Caesar, who had taken a great number of prisoners in the former excursions and engagements, and among the rest the son of their king, who was taken by <a href=/people/6347 target=_blank>Charietto</a>. From this cause, when they so lamentably petitioned for peace, and Caesar demanded some of their chiefs as hostages, and required the king's son to be one of them; the general, or king, broke out into a most pathetic complaint, and declared with tears in his eyes that his son was one that had been lost.

Meanwhile the emperor <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> was in the east, disposing of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> affairs, and intent only on the wars in those countries. All the nations beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> were in a state of tranquillity, from the prudent management of Caesar; nor were either <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> in any danger, the barbarians who dwelt beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> being fearful that Caesar would come through Gaul, and pass the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> to attack them; they therefore contained themselves within the bounds of moderation. <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> being thus occupied, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, under their king Saphor, at that time ravaged <a href=/people/290 target=_blank>Mesopotamia</a>; and having pillaged all the places about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371412UNis class=place long=41.2149 lat=37.067>Nisibis</a>, they besieged the city itself with their whole forces. Lucilianus, the commander, was so well provided for a siege, that partly by the happy occasions of which he availed himself, and partly by his own contrivances, the city escaped the dangers that threatened it. The manner in which this was effected, I have thought it superfluous to explain, since <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a> himself has given a relation of all the transactions of those times in a particular treatise, in which the render may easily discern the eloquence and ability of its author. At this juncture, the affairs of the east appearing tranquil, and the splendid actions of <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a> occupying the discourse of the public, the mind of <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> became the seat of the most bitter envy. Being mortified at the prosperity that attended all that had been done in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=place long=7 lat=49>Celtica</a> and Spain, he invented pretexts, by which he might gradually, and without any dishonour, diminish the authority of <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a>, and then deprive him of his dignity. For this purpose he sent a messenger to Caesar, requiring him to send two of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=demonym long=7 lat=49>Celtic</a> legions, as if he wanted their assistance. <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a>, in obedience to his order, immediately sent them away, partly through ignorance of his design, and partly because he wished to avoid giving him the least cause of anger. After this he took every possible care of the affairs of Gaul, while the army daily increased, and the barbarians, even in the most remote part of their country, were in such dread of him, that they did not even dream of making war. <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> afterwards required more legions to be sent to him from Caesar, and having obtained the demand, sent for four other companies: according to which order <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a> gave notice to the soldiers to prepare for marching.</p>                        </div>

They were as yet ignorant of any design against Caesar, when some tribunes, who began to suspect the contrivance against him, privately distributed a number of anonymous billets among the soldiers, in which they represented to them, that Caesar, by his judicious conduct had so managed affairs, that almost all of them had erected trophies over the barbarians; that he had always fought like a private soldier, and was now in extreme danger from the emperor, who would shortly deprive him of his whole army, unless they prevented it. Some of the soldiers having read these billets, and published the intrigue to the whole army, all were highly enraged. They suddenly rose from their seats in great commotion, and with the cups yet in their hands went to the palace. Breaking open the doors without ceremony, they brought out Caesar, and lifting him on a shield declared him emperor and <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>. They then, without attending to his reluctance, placed a diadem upon his head. <br /><a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a> was uneasy at what they had done, yet did not think it safe to reverse it, because <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> would not observe any oath or covenant, or any obligation by which men are bound to their word: however, he determined to try him. He therefore sent ambassadors to inform <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> that he had been declared emperor, without his own concurrence, and, if he pleased, was ready to lay aside his diadem, and be contented with the sole dignity of being Caesar. <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> was so enraged and arrogant, that he told the ambassadors, that if <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a> loved his life, he must lay aside not only his Imperial dignity, but that of a Caesar, and in a private capacity submit himself to the emperor's pleasure. He should, in that case, receive no injury, nor suffer what his audacity merited. <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a>, when he was informed of this by the ambassadors, openly shewed his opinion of the deity, and declared that he would rather trust his life and fortune with the gods than with <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a>. From this time the enmity of <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> to <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a> was openly displayed; for <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> prepared for a civil war; while <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a> at the same time was grieved that such occurrences should happen; because if he fought against him from whom he had received the honour of a Caesar, he would by many be esteemed an ungrateful person. <br />While he was making these reflections, and revolving in his own mind how he might avoid a civil war, the gods told him what should occur in a dream. Being at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455049UVie class=place long=4.8787 lat=45.5248>Vienna</a>, the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> appeared to shew him the constellations, and to speak these verses; <br />When <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> th' extremity commands <br />Of moist <a href=/people/1692 target=_blank>Aquarius</a>, and <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a> stands <br />In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125AqVi class=place long=12.4834 lat=41.9029>Virgo</a> twenty five, th' Imperial state <br />Of high <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> shall be closed by fate. <br />Relying, therefore, on this vision, he conducted public business with his usual diligence. It being yet winter, he took all possible precautions in what related to the barbarians, that if he should be forced to undertake any new enterprise, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=place long=7 lat=49>Celtica</a> might be secure.

As the entrails signified that he must stay there for some time, he obeyed, observing likewise the time that was mentioned in his dream. When this, according to the motion of the planets, was arrived, a party of horsemen arrived from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433219UNai class=place long=21.9489 lat=43.3102>Naissus</a>, with intelligence that <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> was dead, and that the armies desired <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a> to be emperor. <br />Upon this he accepted what the gods had bestowed upon him, and proceeded on his journey. On his arrival at. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, he was received with joyful acclamations by all ranks of the people, who called him their beloved fellow-citizen, he being born and brought up in that city, and shewed him every kind of respect, as a person who was likely to be the author of much good to mankind.. He here provided for the advantage both of the city and the army: he conferred on the city the privilege of electing a senate like that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; he also constructed there a harbour to secure ships from the south wind, and a portico leading to the port. He built a library to the Imperial portico, in which he placed all the books he possessed; and having done this, he prepared for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> war. After having remained ten months in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, he appointed <a href=/people/7776 target=_blank>Hormisdas</a> and Victor to the command of his armies, and proceeded to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>. It is unnecessary to relate with what pleasure and enthusiasm the soldiers performed this journey: for it is not probable that they would be guilty of any improprieties under such an emperor as <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a>. Upon his arrival at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> he was joyfully received by the people. But being naturally great lovers of spectacles and public amusements, and more accustomed to pleasure than to serious affairs, they were not pleased with the emperor's general prudence and modesty. He indeed avoided entering the public theatres, and would seldom see plays, and when he did, would not sit at them the whole day: on which account they spoke disrespectfully of him, and offended him. He revenged himself on them, not by any real punishment, but by composing a very spirited oration; which contains so much satire and keenness, that it will serve as a perpetual lampoon on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=ethnic long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antiochians</a>. Being penitent for their offence, the emperor, after doing for the city all the favours which equity would allow him, granted to it a senate, the members of which succeeded by hereditary descent from father to son, admitting likewise those that were born of the daughters of senators into the same body; a privilege which few cities possess. After these, and many other just and noble actions, he prepared to make war on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>.</p>                        </div>

He was followed by his troops carrying provisions along with them, who likewise embarked according to the orders they received. The navy was by this time come up; it consisted of a great number of vessels; six hundred were made of wood, and five hundred of skins, besides which were fifty ships of war, and others that followed them for the construction of bridges, if requisite, that the army should pass the rivers on foot. A great number of other vessels likewise followed, some of them carrying provisions for the army, others timber for the construction of engines, and some battering engines for a siege which were ready made. Lucilianus and <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> were admirals of this navy. The army being thus disposed, the emperor seated himself on a throne, and made an address to the army; after which he gave each of them a hundred and thirty pieces of silver.

Between these and the main body were placed the beasts of burden, which carried the heavy armour and provisions, the attendants, that they might be secure, being inclosed on every side by the army. Having thus arranged the order of his march, he thought proper to send before him fifteen hundred men, in order to reconnoitre and observe whether any enemy approached either openly or in ambuscade. Of these he made Lucilianus captain. Then advancing sixty stadia he arrived at a place called Lautha, and from thence to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347407UDur class=place long=40.73 lat=34.747>Dura</a>, where were perceived the ruins of a city, which was then deserted, and the sepulchre of the emperor <a href=/people/9449 target=_blank>Gordianus</a>. In this place the soldiers found abundance of deer, which they shot and feasted on with great satisfaction. From thence he proceeded in seven day's to a place called Phathusae, opposite to which was an island in the river, wherein was a castle containing a great number of men. He therefore ordered Lucilianus with a thousand of his advanced guard to attack it. While it continued dark, the assailants proceeded without discovery, but as soon as it was day, being perceived by one that came from out of the castle to fetch water, the garrison was dreadfully alarmed. They all immediately mounted the ramparts, until the emperor came into the island with his engines and part of the army, and promised the besieged, that if they would surrender themselves and the castle, they would escape certain death. They accordingly surrendered, and were sent, by the emperor into the Roman dominions conducted by a guard of soldiers. Their captain, Puseus was not only made a tribune in the army, but on account of his fidelity was taken by the emperor into a familiarity which always subsisted.</p>                        </div>

To which they replied that they would regulate their conduct by that of others. He therefore proceeded on to other fortresses which he passed by, being satisfied with such promises. For he did not think it profitable to waste too much time in small affairs, but considered it the best course to hasten and prepare for the main business of the war. After a few days march he arrived at Dacira, a town on the right hand, sailing down the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>. The soldiers, finding this place forsaken by its inhabitants, took away a large quantity of corn that was laid there, and many other things. Having put to death all the women that remained in it, they so completely razed the buildings, that no one on seeing the place could imagine a town ever to have stood there. To conclude my account of this place and its vicinity, I must mention, that on the opposite shore was a foundation of bitumen. He from thence advanced to Sitha, Megia, and the city of Zaragardia, in which was a lofty throne made of stone, which the inhabitants used to call the throne of <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>. The soldiers, having with ease plundered and burnt this city, spent that and the following day in recreation. <br />The emperor in the mean time was surprised, that his army had advanced so far without meeting with any <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> either in ambuscade or in the open field; and therefore sent <a href=/people/7776 target=_blank>Hormisdas</a> with a party to reconnoitre, because he was best acquainted with the country. In this expedition <a href=/people/7776 target=_blank>Hormisdas</a> and his soldiers were all near perishing, had they not been unexpectedly preserved by a fortunate accident.

This hope would have been successful, had not the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> burst its banks, and running between the enemy and <a href=/people/7776 target=_blank>Hormisdas</a>, obstructed the march of his men. Being compelled by this cause to defer the journey, the following day they discovered the ambuscade of <a href=/people/8352 target=_blank>Surenas</a> and his troops, with whom they engaged.

Here the army found a stiff clay and marshy ground, in which the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> could not move without difficulty. As they could not swim across the river in their armour, nor ford through it being deep and full of mud, they did not know how to extricate themselves. Their difficulties were increased by the appearance of the enemy on the opposite bank, who were prepared to obstruct their passage with darts and stones, which they threw with slings. When no other person could imagine an expedient to free them from those imminent dangers, the emperor himself, who had great sagacity in all things, and was well versed in military affairs, determined on ordering Lucilianus and his reconnoitring party to make an attack on the enemy's rear, and thereby create a diversion, until the army had crossed the river. For this purpose he sent Victor, with a competent number of men. He began his journey in the night, that the enemy might not discover him, and when he had proceeded so far that the enemy could not perceive him even in the day, he crossed the channel to seek Lucilianus and his party.</p>                        </div>

He succeeded in meeting Lucilianus, who judging the intent of his coming, joined his force to that of Victor, and attacked the enemy by surprize in the rear. Being so unexpectedly assaulted they were either slain, or made their escape in whatever manner they could. The emperor, perceiving the success of this manoeuvre, passed the river without opposition, and continued his march, until he arrived at a city called Bersabora, the size and situation of which he examined. It was enclosed by two circular walls. In the midst of it was a citadel with another wall, shaped like the segment of a circle, to which there was a communication from the inner wall of the city, very difficult of ascent. On the south-west side of the city was a winding road; and on the north side a broad channel from the river, by which the inhabitants were supplied with water. On the east side it was encompassed by a deep ditch and a mound supported by strong pieces of timber; along this ditch stood large towers, which were built half way from the ground of bricks cemented with a kind of bituminous loam; the upper half of the same kind of brick with plaister.</p>                        </div>

They obeyed his orders with great alacrity. On this the citizens solicited the emperor to receive them into his favour and protection; requesting at one time that he would send <a href=/people/7776 target=_blank>Hormisdas</a> to treat with them of peace, and presently reviling the same person as a fugitive renegado and a traitor to his country. The emperor, with good reason, being incensed at this, commanded his troops to attend to their duty, and to carry on the siege with full vigour. None of them failed in the execution of their duty, until the besieged, finding themselves unable to defend their walls, fled into the citadel. The emperor, on seeing this, sent his troops into the city, which was now deserted of inhabitants. They destroyed the walls, burnt the houses, and planted engines at the most convenient places, with which they threw darts and stones on those in the fort. The besieged kept the assailants at a distance with darts and stones, which they threw back against them, so that great slaughter was occasioned on both sides. The emperor, either by his own ingenuity,on consideration of the situation of the place, or by means of his extensive experience, constructed an engine of the following description: He fastened together great pieces of timber with iron, in form of a square tower. This he placed against the wall of the citadel, till it gradually became of equal height. In this tower he placed archers and engineers, accustomed to fling darts and stones. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> being thus harrassed on all sides, both by the besiegers and by those in the tower, were compelled, after a short resistance, to promise that, if the emperor would offer them any reasonable terms, they would surrender the citadel. It was therefore agreed that, upon surrendering the citadel to the emperor, all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> in the place should pass without molestation through the midst of the Roman army, and should each receive a sum of money and a garment. About five thousand men were suffered to depart, besides those who had escaped in boats over the river. The soldiers, upon searching the citadel, discovered a vast quantity of corn, arms and military engines of all kinds, and houshold furniture and provisions in abundance. Of all these they disposed as they chose, except that the greater part of the corn was put on board ships for the maintenance of the soldiers, the remainder being divided between them in addition to their usual allowance. The weapons that were calculated for the use of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were distributed to the soldiers. Those that were adapted only to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> manner of fighting were either burnt or thrown into the river. <br />By this action the renown of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> was considerably augmented; so great a city, being next to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/331446UKte class=place long=44.5807 lat=33.0937>Ctesiphon</a> the most important in <a href=/people/454 target=_blank>Assyria</a>, and so strongly fortified, being taken by assault in two days.

As the commander of the party, preferring his own safety to the valour and honour of a Roman, had left his standard in the enemy's hands, he deprived him of his girdle, regarding him as a mean and worthless person, together with all who had accompanied him in his flight. <br />On his advance beyond the river, he arrived at a place near a city called Tissenia. This was surrounded by a ditch, which, though very deep, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> filled with a large quantity of water, which they procured from the neighbouring river, called the King's River.

These climbed to the tops of the palms, thus exhibiting to their view the fruit of the palm mixed with clusters of grapes. Having passed the night in this place, the next morning he continued his route. Approaching too near to a castle, he was in danger of receiving a mortal wound from a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, who issuing from the castle with his sword in his hand, aimed a stroke at the emperor's head.

He was disappointed in both parts of his project. For the emperor thought the capture of the castle an important object, because there, was near it a populous city called Besuchis; besides many other castles, the inhabitants of which had fled into that which the emperor was besieging, their own not being strong enough to protect them; except some who fled to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/331446UKte class=place long=44.5807 lat=33.0937>Ctesiphon</a>, or hid themselves in the thickest part of the grove. <br />For this reason the emperor besieged it, while in the mean time that part of the army, which was sent out to reconnoitre and scour the country, defeated all who opposed them, and rendered the emperor secure during the continuance of the siege.

The Roman soldiers, however, omitted no kind of warlike policy, but retained their usual courage. They threw and shot at the enemy great stones and darts, out of engines as well as bows; and those were contrived to strike several persons at one throw. The castle being situated on a hill, and fortified with two walls, sixteen large towers, and surrounded by a deep ditch, which in one part was introduced into the castle to furnish its inhabitants with water, the emperor ordered his soldiers to collect earth enough to fill up the ditch, and raise on it a mount to the height of one of the towers. He likewise resolved to make a mine under the wall, beyond the inner precinct, for the purpose of surprising the enemy.

Perceiving that those to whom the care of the mine was committed were slothful, and negligent of their charge, he removed them, as a disgrace for their remissness, and substituted others in their place. He afterwards brought the rams against another gate, which was too weak to bear the shock; when there came a messenger with information, that they who were ordered to construct a mine from the ditch into the town had completed their task, and were just ready to issue through it. The men employed in the mine were of three regiments, the Mattiarii, the Laccinarii, and the Victores. The emperor, however, suspended the attack a short time, while he commanded an engine to be brought against another gate, where he planted all his army, to induce the enemy to believe that on the following day he intended with that engine to storm the castle; his real design being to divert the attention of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> from the mine. All that were in the castle were therefore wholly occupied in destroying that engine, while the party in the mine, having dug quite through to the surface, issued from it at midnight in the middle of a house, in which was a woman grinding corn. She was immediately killed by the man who first sprang out, because she attempted to cry out. The name of the soldier who did this was Superantius, an excellent soldier in the regiment of Victores, the next to him was <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a>, then <a href=/people/2887 target=_blank>Jovianus</a>, a tribune in the regiment of the Notarii. These were followed by many others. The passage being widened, they all presently entered into the midst of the place, from whence they ran to the wall, and surprised the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, who in the manner of the country were singing in praise of the valour of their king, and speaking contemptuously of the vain attempt of the Roman emperor; and boasting that he might sooner take the palace of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> than their castle. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> now attacked them, and killing all they met with by throwing them over the wall, they pursued the rest, and put them to death in various manners; sparing neither women nor children, except a few whom they preserved for slaves. Anabdates, the governor of the castle, being taken while endeavouring to escape, together with his guards, eighty in number, was brought to the emperor with his hands bound. The castle being thus taken, and all the people put to death, except a few who were unexpectedly saved, the soldiers began to plunder; and having taken all they could find, levelled the wall to the ground, with the engines they had placed against it. Nor even then were they satisfied, but pulled down and burnt all the building; in such a manner, that no one could imagine that there had ever been any in the place.</p>                        </div>

The general voice was in favour of <a href=/people/2887 target=_blank>Jovianus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/5310 target=_blank>Varronianus</a>, tribune of the domestic forces. <br />When <a href=/people/2887 target=_blank>Jovian</a> had assumed the purple and the diadem, he directed his course homewards with all possible speed. Arriving at the castle of Suma, he was attacked by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> cavalry, accompanied by a great number of elephants, which committed great devastation in the right wing of the army, in which were placed the <a href=/people/6573 target=_blank>Joviani</a> and Herculiani. These were the appellations of two legions, so named from <a href=/people/1446 target=_blank>Diocletian</a> and <a href=/people/3044 target=_blank>Maximian</a>, the former of whom assumed the surname of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>, and the latter that of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>.

Upon feeling the smart of their wounds, the elephants, in their usual manner, immediately fled, breaking the line of the cavalry. The soldiers were thus enabled to kill the elephants in their flight, and numbers of the enemy. There fell also on the Roman side, three tribunes, <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a>, <a href=/people/2531 target=_blank>Maximianus</a>, and Macrobius. <br />They then marched forward four days, continually harassed by the enemy, who followed them when they were proceeding, but fled when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> offered any resistance.

Upon a former war in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, the senate appointed <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> their general and plenipotentiary, whose ill conduct brought a lasting disgrace on the Roman name, he being made prisoner and dying among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>. The command was then vested in <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>. Being enamoured of <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> he became indolent and regardless of military affairs, and perished, charged with actions unworthy of a Roman. Notwithstanding the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> suffered all these disasters they did not lose even one of those provinces.

On the contrary, a considerable time afterwards, when the emperor <a href=/people/9449 target=_blank>Gordianus</a> fought against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, and lost his life in the midst of the enemy's country, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, even after that disaster, were not able to acquire any part of the Roman dominion. Nor did they succeed more even when <a href=/people/12098 target=_blank>Philip</a> was emperor, although he entered into a most dishonourable peace with them. A short time afterwards, when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> fire had set all the east in flames, and the great city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> was taken by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> army which advanced as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, the emperor <a href=/people/5309 target=_blank>Valerianus</a> made an expedition against them, and though he was taken by them, yet still they did not dare to claim the sovereignty of those countries. The death of the emperor <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a> alone was a sufficient cause to deprive us of them all, and that in so irrevocable a manner, that the Roman emperors have never since been able to recover any part of them, but have gradually lost still more; some having made themselves perfectly independent, others having surrendered themselves to the barbarians, and others becoming deserted: all which I shall in the course of this history relate as it occurred.</p>                        </div>

The emperor on hearing this excused himself from complying with their desires by stating to them the articles of the treaty. Then <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a>, who was the chief of their council, repeated what the people had before said in their petition, adding, that to carry on a war against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> they were, not in need of money or of any foreign aid, but were able with their own bodies and their own purses to defend themselves; assuring him at the same time, that whenever they should prove victorious and recover their liberty, they would again become subject to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and obey their commands as before.

I have now to state, that while <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a> was on his journey towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, he was seized with a distemper, which increased his natural choleric temper to a degree of cruelty, and even to madness, so that he falsely suspected his sickness to proceed from some charm or poison which <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a>'s friends had prepared for him through malice. Accusations to that effect were drawn up against some distinguished persons, which were set aside by the discretion of <a href=/people/248 target=_blank>Sallustius</a>, who still was prefect of the court. After his distemper abated, he proceeded from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404297PNic class=place long=29.7168 lat=40.4266>Nicaea</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>. The army and his friends in that city advised him to chuse an associate in the empire, that if occasion should require, he might have some one to assist him, and prevent their again suffering as at the death of <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a>. He complied with their advice, and after consideration, selected his brother <a href=/people/466 target=_blank>Valens</a>, whom he thought most likely to prove faithful to him. He declared him associate in the empire.</p>                        </div>

Upon this the emperors, who had other reasons for animosity against the friends of <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a>, were excited to a greater degree of hatred, and therefore encouraged such charges against them as contained no appearance of reason. <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a> was particularly severe against the philosopher <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>, who in <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a>'s time had caused him to be punished for the neglect of sacred things, on the ground of Christianity. But other affairs both civil and military drew off their attention from these suspicions. <br />They then applied themselves to the appointment of governors over the different provinces, and consulted who should have the charge of the palace. By which means, all who had been governors of the provinces, or had held any other office under <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a>, were discharged, and amongst them <a href=/people/248 target=_blank>Sallustius</a>, prefect of the court. <a href=/people/2718 target=_blank>Arintheus</a> and Victor alone retained their military commands, while others who sought for preferments, acquired them at hazard.

In that they found no difficulty, for he surrendered himself voluntarily; and desired them to carry him wherever they pleased, if they would suffer him first to see his children. To this they consented, and he prepared an entertainment for them. When he perceived them to be intoxicated, he and his family fled towards the Tauric <a about=https://topostext.org/place/453343RChe class=place long=34.3 lat=45.3>Chersonesus</a>.

He there resided in the house of an old acquaintance, and making observations on the state of the city after the departure of the emperor, he attempted to raise himself to the empire, and formed his design on the following incident. <br />An eunuch, named Eugenius, had not long before been discharged from the court, who entertained but little friendship for the emperors. <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> therefore won this man to his interest, because he found him to be very rich. He informed him who he was, the cause of his arriving there, and the measures which he wished to pursue. On this, the eunuch promised to assist him in any enterprize, and to furnish him with money. Their first attempt was to bribe the court guards, which consisted of two legions. Then arming the slaves, and collecting with ease a considerable multitude, chiefly volunteers, they sent them in the night into the city, and occasioned a general commotion; the people issuing from their houses, and gazing on <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> as on a king made in a theatre.</p>                        </div>

Having then seized on Cesarius, whom the emperors had made prefect of the city, and on <a href=/people/3643 target=_blank>Nebridius</a>, who was appointed to succeed <a href=/people/248 target=_blank>Sallustius</a> in tbe prefecture of the court, he compelled them to write to the subjects of the empire whatever he wished. He also kept them separate, that they might not consult with each other. Having formed these projects, he proceeded in a splendid manner towards the palace. Ascending a tribunal before the gate, he gave the people great hopes and promises. He then entered the palace to provide for the remainder of his affairs. <br />The new emperors having divided the army between them, <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> determined to send persons to the soldiers, who were as yet in confusion, and went by the command of the emperors from place to place without any order.

His intended expedition into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> was obstructed by the incursions into the Roman territories of a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> tribe residing beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>. Against these he directed a competent force, arresting their progress and compelling them to surrender their arms. He sent them to several of his towns on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, with orders for them to be kept in prison without chains. <br />These were the auxiliaries that were sent by a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> chief to <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a>. Their chief therefore demanding their dismissal from the emperor, on the ground that they had been sent at the request of ambassadors from the person who then held the sovereign authority, <a href=/people/466 target=_blank>Valens</a> refused to listen to this demand. He replied, that they had neither been sent for nor taken by him as friends, but as enemies. This produced a war with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>. The emperor, perceiving that they designed to invade the Roman dominion, and were for that purpose collecting together with the utmost speed, drew up his army on the bank of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>.

He then appointed Auxonius prefect of the court, <a href=/people/248 target=_blank>Sallustius</a> having, by reason of his age, obtained permission to resign that office, which he had twice held. Auxonius, though on the eve of so dangerous a war, acted with the strictest justice in the collection of the tributes, being careful that no person was oppressed with exactions more than it was his right to pay. He likewise procured many transport-vessels, in which he conveyed provisions for the army through the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Euxine</a> Sea to the mouth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, and thence, that the army might be the more easily supplied, by boats to the several towns on the side of the river.</p>                        </div>

Not having sufficient resolution to come to a regular engagement, they took refuge in the marshes, from whence they occasionally sallied. The emperor therefore ordered his troops to continue at their stations, and collected all the slaves in the camp, and those who had the care of the baggage, promising a sum of money to every man who brought him the head of a barbarian. This filled them with hopes of gaining the money, inducing them to go into the woods and fens, killing all they met, whose heads they brought to the emperor, and received the promised reward.

Among the imperial notaries was one named <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a>, a person of reputation, birth, and education. Being very young he was easily seduced to vice by the delusions of designing profligates. A society of persons of that description persuaded him that they were men of great learning, particularly in the science of divination, by which they were able to foretel future events. In order to ascertain who should succeed <a href=/people/466 target=_blank>Valens</a> in the empire, they fixed up a tripod, which revealed to them in a secret manner what should happen hereafter. Now in this tripod appeared the letters θ, ε, ο, δ, (i. e. Theod.) by which was predicted in plain terms that <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a> would succeed <a href=/people/466 target=_blank>Valens</a> in the empire. He was so involved in these follies, that he was continually anxious for the conversation of jugglers and sorcerers, consulting them of the future.

The emperor was extremely incensed, and suspected all the most celebrated philosophers, and other persons who had acquired learning, as likewise some of the most distinguished courtiers, who were charged with a conspiracy against their sovereign. This filled every place with lamentation; the prisons being full of persons who did not merit such treatment, and the roads being more crowded than the cities.

The emperor, who still remained at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, sent a force sufficient to oppose them. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> then fled with their plunder to the clefts of the mountains, to which the soldiers were either prevented by indolence from pursuing them, or from some cause unable to redress the evils which the towns had suffered. <br />While these affairs were so conducted, a barbarous nation, which till then had remained unknown, suddenly made its appearance, attacking the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>.

In this they were so incessant, that the surviving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> were compelled to leave their habitations to these Huns, and crossing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, to supplicate the emperor to receive them, on their promise to adhere to him as faithful soldiers.

The tribunes and other officers therefore went over to bring the barbarians unarmed into the Roman territory; but occupied themselves solely in the gratification of their brutal appetites, or in procuring slaves, neglecting every thing that related to public affairs. A considerable number therefore crossed over with their arms, through this negligence. These, on arriving into the Roman dominion, forgot both their petition and their oaths.

Having enquired of him, who he was, and from whence he came, and who had so severely beat him, and receiving no reply, they concluded it to be a prodigy, and shewed him to the emperor as he passed by. Although he made the same enquiries, it still remained speechless, and though void of motion and apparently dead, yet the eyes appeared as if alive. At length it suddenly disappeared. The spectators were unable to account for the prodigy; but persons who were skilled in such events, said that it portended the future state of the empire; that the commonwealth should appear as if it had been beaten and whipped, until, by the misconduct of its magistrates and ministers, it would expire.

He well knew the difficulty of commanding a multitude of ill-disciplined dissolute men, and that a small number might more easily be reclaimed from their effeminacy; and, moreover, that it was better to risk a few than all. By these arguments having prevailed upon the emperor, he obtained his desire. He selected, not such as had been trained to cowardice and accustomed to flight, but strong and active men who had lately been taken into the army, and who appeared to him, who was able to judge of men, to be capable of any service. He immediately made trial of each of them, and obviated their defects by continual exercise; bestowing commendations and rewards on all who were obedient, but appearing severe and inexorable to those who neglected their duty. Having by these means infused into them the principles of the military art, he took possession of several fortified towns, for the security of his army. From these he frequently surprised the barbarians as they came out for forage. Sometimes, when they were loaded with spoils, he killed them and took what they carried; at other times he destroyed them when they were intoxicated or washing themselves in the river. <br />When he had by these methods cut off great part of the barbarians, and the remainder felt such dread of him that they dared not attempt to forage, an extraordinary degree of envy was excited against him. From this envy proceeded hatred; until at length the court eunuchs, at the instigation of those who had lost their command, accused him to the emperor, who by these means was induced to entertain unjust suspicions of him. <a href=/people/2256 target=_blank>Sebastianus</a> sent a request to the emperor, desiring him to remain where he then was, and not to advance; since it was not easy to bring such a multitude to a regular engagement. He, moreover, observed that it would be better to protract the war in harassing them by ambuscades, until they should be reduced to despair from the want of necessaries, and rather than expose themselves to the misery and destruction of famine, either surrender themselves, or depart from the Roman territory and submit to the Huns.</p>                        </div>

The barbarians resolutely opposed them, and gained so signal a victory, that they slew all, except a few with whom the emperor fled into an unfortified village.

When the Huns, as I have related, had invaded the countries beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, being unable to withstand their incursions, intreated the emperor <a href=/people/466 target=_blank>Valens</a>, who was then living, to admit them into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, promising, in perfect submission to his commands, to perform the duty of faithful soldiers and subjects. By this promise <a href=/people/466 target=_blank>Valens</a> was induced to receive them; and imagining that it would be a surety of their fidelity to cause all their young children to be brought up in a different country, he sent a great number of infants into the east, and appointed <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> to superintend their maintenance and education, conceiving him to be a person of competent understanding for the fulfilment of both those offices. He, therefore, distributed them into various towns, to prevent them, when grown to manhood, from having an opportunity, by being collected in great numbers, of forming an insurrection. However, when they had attained maturity, the intelligence of what their conntrymen had suffered in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> reached them in the different towns. This gave them much uneasiness; those of one city assembling together and sending private information to those in other places, that they intended to assault the Roman towns in revenge for the sufferings of their countrymen. Meantime <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a>, discovering the design of the barbarians, was in doubt how to act. At length he resolved not to give <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> information of the conspiracy, not only because he was then in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, but that he had been appointed to that charge by <a href=/people/466 target=_blank>Valens</a>, and not by <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, who scarcely knew him. He, therefore, privately sent letters to the senate of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>. Being authorised by them to proceed as he deemed most conducive to the public good, he averted the danger with which the towns were menaced by the following measures. He sent for all the officers, and, before he disclosed to them his design, required them to take an oath of secresy. Being informed of it, and instructed how to act, they reported among the barbarians of each town, that the emperor intended to bestow on them considerable presents, both in money and land, in order to bind them in gratitude to himself and the Roman people. For this purpose they were ordered to assemble on a particular day in the principal cities. This intelligence was so gratifying to the barbarians, that their fury considerably abated. Upon the appointed day they all attended at the places at which they were desired to meet. When they were arrived, the soldiers, on the signal being made, mounted upon the roofs of the houses in the respective market-places in which they were stationed, and cast at the barbarians such numbers of darts and stones, that they killed every man.

The number of eunuchs in the service of the emperor was immense, most of whom, and particularly those of handsome persons, disgraced at their pleasure any magistrate or officer. The whole government was, in effect, at their disposal; the emperor being guided by their pleasure, and changing his sentiments at their desire. As he squandered the public money without consideration, bestowing it on unworthy persons, he consequently impoverished himself. He therefore sold the government of provinces to any who would purchase them, without regard to the reputation or ablity of the persons, esteeming him the best qualified who brought him the most gold or silver. Goldsmiths, bankers, and even the meanest professions, were therefore seen wearing the ensigns of magistracy, and selling the provinces to the best bidders.</p>                        </div>

Many of them were induced by his promises, and were embodied with the legions; conceiving that when more of them should be collected, they might attack the government, and without difficulty acquire possession of the sovereignty. The emperor, however, having reviewed these fugitives, who were very numerous, and already exceeded in number the other soldiers, reflected on the difficulty of restraining them, should they be inclined to infringe their promise of obedience.

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, who were grieved at the sight of so evil an action, mildly admonished the barbarians to desist from actions so base and unjust, which were disgraceful to men who lived under the Roman laws.

He therefore repaired with great expedition to <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, who was then recovering from a disease which had nearly caused his death. <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> gave a kind reception both to him and to the barbarians who followed him, even proceeding some distance from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a> to meet him. Nor did he afterwards treat him with less respect, but at his death, which happened shortly afterwards, interred him in a royal sepulchre, which was so magnificent, that the barbarians were filled with amazement at its extreme splendour, and returned to their country without offering any further molestation to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, so charmed were they with the liberality and magnificence of the emperor. They who had folowed the deceased chief likewise kept a continual guard on the bank of the river, to prevent any incursions being made against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. <br />At the same time <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> had additional good fortune. He repulsed the Scyri and Carpodaces, who were mixed with the Huns, and so defeated them as to compel them to cross the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, and to return into their own country. The success of the emperor revived the courage of the soldiers, who now appeared to recover from their former calamities. The husbandmen had now the liberty of cultivating their lands, and of feeding their <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> with security.</p>                        </div>

Meanwhile Promotus, who was commander of the forces in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, encountered with Aedotheus, who had levied an immense army, not only among the nations upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, but among others situated in unknown countries at a great distance, which he was then leading across the river. Promotus here made such havoc among the troops, that the river was filled with dead bodies, and the number which fell on the shore was almost too great to be counted. <br />While the affairs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> were, thus situated, those of <a href=/people/1668 target=_blank>Gratian</a> were in great perplexity. Having accepted the counsel of those courtiers who usually corrupt the manners of princes, he gave a reception to some fugitives called Alani, whom he not only introduced into his army, but honoured with valuable presents, and confided to them his most important secrets, esteeming his own soldiers of little value. This produced among his soldiers a violent hatred against him, which being gradually inflamed and augmented incited in them a disposition for innovation, and most particulary in that part of them which was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>, since they were the most resolute and vindictive. In this spirit they were encouraged by <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, a Spaniard, who had been the fellow-soldier of <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>. He was offended that <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> should be thought worthy of being made emperor, while he himself had no honourable employment. He therefore cherished the animosity of the soldiers towards the emperor. They were thus easily induced to revolt and to declare <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> emperor.

Among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, the persons who had the superintendence of sacred things were the Pontifices, whom we may term Gephyraei, if we translate the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> word Pontifices, which signifies bridge-makers, into the Greek. The origin of that appellation was this: At a period before mankind were acquainted with the mode of worshipping by statues, some images of the gods were first made in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>. As there were not then any temples (for the use of them was likewise then unknown), they fixed up those figures of the gods on a bridge over the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399227WPen class=place long=22.7094 lat=39.9298>Peneus</a>, and called those who sacrificed to the gods, Gephyraei, Priests of the Bridge, from the place where the images were first erected. Hence the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, deriving it from the Greeks, called their own priests Pontifices, and enacted a law, that kings, for the sake of dignity, should be considered of the number. The first of their kings who enjoyed this dignity was <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> <a href=/people/1714 target=_blank>Pompilius</a>. After him it was conferred not only upon the kings but upon <a href=/people/2641 target=_blank>Octavianus</a> and his successors in the Roman empire. Upon the elevation of any one to the imperial dignity, the pontifices brought him the priestly habit, and he was immediately styled, <a href=/people/12031 target=_blank>Pontifex Maximus</a>, or chief priest. All former emperors, indeed, appeared gratified with the distinction, and willingly adopted the title. Even <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a> himself, when he was emperor, accepted it, although he was seduced from the path of rectitude in regard to sacred affairs, and had embraced the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> faith. In like manner did all who succeeded him to <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a> and <a href=/people/466 target=_blank>Valens</a>. But when the Pontifices, in the accustomed manner, brought the sacred robe to <a href=/people/1668 target=_blank>Gratian</a>, he, considering it a garment unlawful for a <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> to use, rejected their offer. When the robe was restored to the priests who brought it, their chief is said to have made this observation, If the emperor refuses to become Pontifex, we shall soon make one.</p>                        </div>

Promotus, the commander of the forces in that quarter, drew out his troops as far as he could extend them along the bank of the river, and hindered the passage of the barbarians. While he was thus employed, he invented a stratagem to this effect. He called to him some of his own soldiers, who understood their language, and in whom he could confide in affairs of that nature, and sent them to agree with the barbarians upon betraying their own party. These men proposed to the barbarians to deliver the whole army into their hands in consideration of a large reward. The barbarians replied, that they were not able to give so much. However, to induce them to believe their promises, they adhered to their original proposals, and would not abate in any part of the reward. At length they agreed to the sum, which was in part to be paid immediately, and the remainder at the accomplishment of the treason. Having arranged the method of giving the signal, and the time for the execution of the project, they communicated to the commander each circumstance; that the barbarians would commence the enterprize in the night, and would cross the river to attack the Roman army. <br />The barbarians, therefore, having placed all their best troops on board a great number of small vessels, commanded them to cross over first, and to fall on the soldiers while they were asleep. Next to these, they sent those of an inferior description to support the former when they had commenced the attack; and after them the useless multitude of every age, who are ready to boast of victories which others have gained. </p>                        </div>

He therefore ranged his ships in a triple line close together along the side of the river, the length of twenty stadia. By this plan he not only prevented the enemy from crossing over, but sunk many of them in their vessels. The night being dark and without a moon, the barbarians were unacquainted with the preparations which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had made, and therefore embarked with great silence, supposing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> to be ignorant of their design. When the signal was made, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> sailed up to them in large and strong ships with firm oars, and sunk all that they met, among which not one man was saved by swimming, their arms being very heavy. The vessels which escaped from the Roman ships, upon approaching those which lay along shore, were so assaulted with whatever was at hand, that they and all on board were lost at the same time, nor were any of them able to pass this wall of Roman vessels. <br />This produced among them an immense slaughter, greater than had ever occurred in any former naval action. Thus the river was filled with dead bodies and with arms. As many of them or were able to swim to the bank were destroyed by those who were ranged along it.

Before that town was placed a select corps of barbarians, who excelled the rest of their countrymen in strength and courage. Although these men were favoured by the emperor with a larger allowance of corn and other provisions than any other of the soldiers; yet they did not repay these distinctions with good will, but with hatred to the governor of the town, and contempt of the Roman soldiers. Gerontius on discovering their design, which was to attack the town, and to confuse the government, consulted with his most prudent soldiers on the method of punishing those insolent barbarians, Finding them fearful, and consequently backward in giving their assent, he took his arms, and issued with a few of his guards to engage the whole body of barbarians. Having opened the gates, he marched out against them, while his soldiers were yet asleep, and shackled by fear as by a chain, or had mounted the wall to witness what should occur. Meantime the barbarians laughed at the temerity of Gerontius, and thinking him desirous of death, sent against him men of extraordinary strength. Gerontius engaged with the first man whom he encountered, who immediately catching hold of his buckler resolutely opposed him. At length, one of the guards, who saw them closed, coming to his assistance, cut off the arm of the .barbarian, and caused him to fall from his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. While the barbarians stood in astonishment at his courage and audacity, Gerontius attacked others of the enemy.

A few only of them escaped to an edifice, which was held in high veneration by the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, and esteemed an asylum or sanctuary. <br />Gerontius, having delivered this part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a> from all impending dangers, and from the barbarians who had formed attempts against it, but were subdued by his remarkable valour and conduct, expected some remuneration from the emperor. On the contrary, <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> was offended, that the barbarians, whom he had so much honoured, were cut off; although they had been a great annoyance to the public repose. He therefore privately required Gerontius to be brought before him in custody, to plead in defence of his brave achievements for the advantage of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. Upon this occasion, Gerontius charged the barbarians with rebellion, and related the depredations and ravages they had committed among the inhabitants of that town. The emperor, however, continued regardless of all he said, and persisted in accusing him of having removed them, not for the public good, but in order to acquire the presents which the emperor had given them. Gerontius replied, that he had sent their property to the public treasury after their death. He had only taken from them some golden necklaces which the emperor had presented to them as ornaments.

Full of this resolution, he prepared to cross the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. Perceiving, however, that it would be necessary for him to pass through narrow defiles, and over craggy and pathless mountains, and beyond these, through morasses and fens which admit of no passengers, except those who travel very slowly, much less of so considerable an army, he deferred the enterprize until he could form better measures. <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a>, however, sending ambassadors from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a> to desire a continuance of peace, <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> complied with his request, and pretended to be gratified with the proposal. <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a>, therefore, sent <a href=/people/2869 target=_blank>Domninus</a> to treat, who, though by birth a Syrian, was a steady friend to the emperor. As he was next to the emperor in authority, he seemed likewise to excel all others in fidelity and experience, and whatever private measures he wished to adopt, he imparted to this person alone. When <a href=/people/2869 target=_blank>Domninus</a> arrived with <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, and had informed him of the motive of the embassy, he was received with the utmost kindness and respect. <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> conferred on him so great honours, and so many presents, that <a href=/people/2869 target=_blank>Domninus</a> supposed that <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a> would never again have so good a friend. To such a degree did <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> succeed in deluding <a href=/people/2869 target=_blank>Domninus</a>, that he sent along with him part of his own army to the assistance of the emperor against the barbarians, who dreadfully oppressed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=ethnic long=19 lat=45>Pannonians</a> under his dominion. <a href=/people/2869 target=_blank>Domninus</a> departed from him highly gratified not only by the many presents he had received, but at being accompanied by those were sent with him. He therefore imprudently by crossing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> rendered the passage more practicable to <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>. That he would do this had been foreseen by <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, who had therefore made every preparation, and followed him with all his forces. He moreover detached guards before him, to prevent the passage of any that way, who might give intelligence to the attendants of <a href=/people/2869 target=_blank>Domninus</a>, that <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> was penetrating into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>.

This journey they performed, and there again consulted what measures to pursue. It was at length agreed, with the unanimous assent of the assembly, that <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> should receive the punishment due to his offences. Their opinion was, that such a person was undeserving of life, who had not only murdered <a href=/people/1668 target=_blank>Gratian</a> and usurped his dominions, but after having succeeded in his usurpation, had extended his progress, and also deprived the brother of <a href=/people/1668 target=_blank>Gratian</a> of the territory which had been allotted to him.</p>                        </div>

He therefore pointed out to them the inconveniences which unavoidably arise from civil discord, and that the commonwealth must of necessity receive fatal wounds from both parties. He therefore stated that it would be better first to send an embassy, and that if <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> would surrender the empire to <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a> and remain at peace, the empire should be divided between them all as before, but if he should yield to his ambition, they would immediately commence a war against him. No person in the senate dared to speak in opposition to this, because it appeared to be calculated for the public advantage. <br />Meanwhile Justina, who was a person of great experience, and knew the best manner of conducting her affairs, understanding that <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> was naturally inclined to love, introduced into his presence her daughter Galla, who was extremely beautiful. Then embracing the knees of the emperor, she supplicated with great humility that he would neither suffer the death of <a href=/people/1668 target=_blank>Gratian</a> to pass unrevenged, to whom he owed the empire, nor them to remain neglected and destitute of every hope. As she spoke these words she shewed him her daughter, who was in tears, lamenting her misfortunes. When <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> had listened to this supplication, and had observed the beauty of Galla, his eyes discovered the wound she had inflicted on his heart. Yet he deferred that affair to a future occasion, and in the mean time gave them favourable hopes. Becoming daily more inflamed with love for Galla, he requested Justina to grant him her daughter, since his former wife Placilla was dead. To this demand she replied, that she would by no means accede to it, unless he would make war on <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> to avenge the death of <a href=/people/1668 target=_blank>Gratian</a>. Resolving, therefore, to obtain her consent, he exerted himself in preparing for war. Being thus incited by his passion for Galla, he not only conciliated the soldiers by augmenting their stipend, but was roused from his negligence in other affairs, resolving, since he was compelled by necessity, to provide for affairs that would require attention after his departure.</p>                        </div>

Upon hearing of the late victory, and that the emperor was upon his return, they again concealed themselves in the marshes, and issuing privately from thence at break of day, carried off all that they found, and returned to their usual abode. To so great degree did they extend these ravages, that the emperor at length thought them to be rather daemons than men. Being therefore in doubt, he communicated his design to no person. He took with him five horsemen, each of whom he ordered to lead three or four <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, that when any <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> became weary, the rider might have another to mount, and the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> might by that means be enabled to endure the fatigue of the enterprize which he intended. He gave no cause to suppose that he was the emperor, but travelled through the country as a private individual. When he or his retinue was in want of food, they procured it from the country people. He arrived at length at a small inn, in which resided an old woman, whom he requested to admit him into her house, and to give him some wine. She complied with both these demands. While she was entertaining him very hospitably with wine and the provisions which were then accidentally in the house, the night approached, and he therefore desired her to allow him to sleep there, to which she likewise consented. In the room, where the emperor lay, he perceived a man who remained perfectly silent, and appeared to have no desire to be known. The emperor, being surprised at this appearance; called the old woman, and demanded of her who the man was and from whence he came. Her reply was, that she could neither give him that information, nor wherefore he came there; all she knew being, that since the emperor <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> and his army had returned home, he had been her guest and had paid her every day for his entertainment; that he had gone out every morning, walked where he pleased, and returned at night as from some hard labour, and after having eaten something had lain down in the position in which he now saw him. The emperor, having heard the story of the woman, judged it convenient to make a further inquiry into the affair; and taking hold of the man, commanded him to declare who he was. The man not returning any answer, he beat him in order to force him to confess. But the man continuing unmoved by these blows, he commanded the horsemen to prick him with their swords, and told him that he was the emperor <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>. He then confessed that he was a spy in the service of the barbarians who were concealed in the fens, and informed him where they were, and in what places he could most conveniently attack them. The emperor immediately cut off his head. <br />After this joining his army, which was encamped at no great distance, he brought his forces to the place which he knew to be the residence of the barbarians. He attacked and slew them without distinction of age, dragging some out of the fens in which they were concealed, and killing others in the water, thus causing a great slaughter of the barbarians.</p>                        </div>

To this the emperor assented, and the trumpet sounded a retreat; upon which the soldiers ceased pursuing the barbarians. When they had abundantly satisfied themselves with eating and drinking, they were so overpowered with wine and fatigue that they fell asleep. This being observed by the remaining barbarians, they seized their arms, and falling on the soldiers, who were already subdued by sleep and intoxication, they pierced them with their spears and swords, and other instruments of death. The emperor himself with his whole army were in the most imminent danger of death, had not some, who had not yet dined, hastened to the tent of the emperor, and informed him of the circumstance. The emperor and those who were with him, being considerably alarmed, resolved to avoid the impending danger by a precipitate flight. But being met, as they were escaping, by Promotus, who had been sent for by the emperor, he desired the emperor to consult his own safety and that of those who were with him; as he himself would attend to the barbarians, and punish them as for their obstinacy they deserved. He had no sooner said this, than he hastened to the barbarians, whom he found still among the sleeping soldiers, and slew so many of them, that scarcely any of them escaped with safety into the marshes.</p>                        </div>

These opposite features of his character have incited in me a degree of wonder. For although naturally addicted to indolence and other vices which I have before mentioned, and, therefore, when unmolested by any formidable accident, giving way to his nature, yet when roused by any circumstance, by which his affairs were threatened with danger, he laid aside his languor, and reliquishing his pleasures, prepared himself for manly, vigorous, and difficult enterprizes.

Being thought proper for the station by all the soldiers under him, both for his valour and experience in military affairs, and for his disregard of riches, he attained great influence. He thus became so elevated, that he would speak without reserve to the emperor, and would blame any measure which he thought improper. This gave such umbrage to <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a>, that he opposed him on several occasions, and would have done him injury had he known how to effect it. At length <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a>, no longer able to submit to his correction, when Arbogastes was approaching him as he sat on the imperial throne, looked sternly upon him, and presented him with a writing, by which he dismissed him from his command. Arbogastes, having read it, replied, You neither gave me the command, nor can deprive me of it; and having said this, tore the writing to pieces, threw it down, and retired. From that period their hatred was no longer kept to themselves, but appeared in public. <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a> sent frequent letters to the emperor <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, acquainting him with the arrogant behaviour of Arbogastes towards the majesty of an emperor, and requesting him speedily to send assistance, or that he should suddenly make him a visit.

He had been recommended to the notice of Arbogastes by Rictomeris as a person of a kind and obliging disposition, with a desire that he would make him his familiar friend, being one who would be serviceable to him in any circumstances where the assistance of a real friend would be needful. When Rictomeris was departed to the emperor <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, by daily conversation Eugenius became the sincere friend of Arbogastes, who had no secret which he did not confide to him. Recollecting Eugenius, therefore, at this juncture, who by his extraordinary learning and the gravity of his conversation seemed well-adapted for the management of an empire, he communicated to him his designs. But finding him not pleased with the proposals, he attempted to prevail on him by all the arts he could use, and entreated him not to reject what fortune so favourably offered. Having at length persuaded him, he deemed it advisable in the first place to remove <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a>, and thus to deliver the sole authority to Eugenius. With this view he proceeded to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455049UVie class=place long=4.8787 lat=45.5248>Vienna</a>, a town in Gaul, where the emperor resided; and as he was amusing himself near the town in some sports with the soldiers, apprehending no danger, Arbogastes gave him a mortal wound. To this audacious action the soldiers quietly submitted, not only because he was so brave and warlike a person, but because they were attached to him through his contempt of riches. As soon as he had performed this action, he declared Eugenius emperor, and infused into them the most favourable hopes that he would prove an excellent ruler, since he possessed such extraordinary qualifications.</p>                        </div>

Although he made these reflections and frequently revolved them in his mind, yet he resolved at once as it were to throw the die for all that he possessed, and therefore made every preparation for war. In pursuance of his design he intended to make Rictomeris commander of the cavalry, having experienced his courage in many wars, and to appoint other officers over the legions.

But as he was arrived there, and consequently was under the necessity of engaging, he judged it most prudent to place the barbarian troops in front, and to expose them first. He ordered Gaines with the troops under his command to make the first attack, and the other commanders of barbarian soldiers to follow him, either cavalry, <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> archers, or infantry. Eugenius then drew out his forces. When the two armies were engaged, so great an eclipse of the sun happened, that for more than half the time of the action it appeared rather to be night than day. As they fought therefore a kind of nocturnal battle, so great a slaughtor was made, that in the same day the greater part of the allies of <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> were slain, with their commander Bacurius, who fought very courageously at their head, while the other commanders escaped very narrowly with the remainder. When night came on and the armies had rallied, Eugenius was so elated with his victory, that he distributed money among those who had behaved with the greatest gallantry in the battle, and gave them time to refresh themselves, as if after such a defeat there was no probability of another engagement As they were thus solacing themselves, the emperor <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> about break of day fell suddenly on them with his whole forces, while they were still reclined on the ground, and killed them before they knew of the approach of an enemy.

But not a single individual of them would be persuaded to this, nor recede from the ancient ceremonies, which had been handed down to them from the building of their city, and prefer to them an irrational assent; having, as they said, lived in the observance of them almost twelve hundred years, in the whole space of which their city had never been conquered, and, therefore, should they change them for others, they could not foresee what might ensue. <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, therefore, told them, that the treasury was too much exhausted by the expence of sacred rites and sacrifices, and that he should, therefore, abolish them, since he neither thought them commendable, nor could the exigencies of the army spare so much money. The senate in reply observed, that the sacrifices were not duly performed, unless the charges were defrayed from the public funds. Yet thus the laws for the performance of sacred rites and sacrifices were repealed and abolished, besides other institutions and ceremonies, which had been received from their ancestors. By these means, the Roman empire, having been devastated by degrees, is become the habitation of barbarians, or rather having lost all its inhabitants, is reduced to such a form, that no person can distinguish where its cities formerly stood. That affairs were thus brought into so melancholy a state will be evident from a particular narrative of them. The emperor <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, having consigned <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, Spain, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=place long=7 lat=49>Celtica</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> to his son <a href=/people/7775 target=_blank>Honorius</a>, died of a disease on his journey towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>.

By these all causes were determined, at their own pleasure; for whoever bribed plentifully, or by any other means of friendship or consanguinity could make the judge his advocate, was sure to succeed in the process. From hence it happened that most of those great estates, which cause the possessors to be generally esteemed fortunate, devolved to these two; since some endeavoured by gifts to avoid false accusations, and others relinquished all their possessions to obtain an office, or in any other manner to purchase the ruin of particular cities. While iniquity of every kind presided, therefore, in the respective cities, the money from all quarters flowed into the coffers of <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a> and <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a>; while on the reverse, poverty preyed on the habitations of those who had formerly been rich. Nor were the emperors acquainted with anything that was done, but thought all that <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a> and <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a> commanded was done by virtue of some unwritten law. After they had amassed immense wealth, <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a> began to concert the means of becoming emperor, by making his own daughter, who was now marriageable, the wife of the emperor; for by that he conceived he should possess a plausible argument in favour of his pretensions to government. With this intent he privately intimated the affair by means of some of the emperor's attendants, supposing that no one perceived his aim, although the report of it was circulated through the whole city. For all persons conjectured his intention by his pride and arrogance, which increased so much every day, that the general hatred against him was augmented. Notwithstanding this, as if he proposed to disguise small faults with greater enormities, he had the audacity to be guilty of another atrocity.</p>                        </div>

For this reason <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a> professed on every occasion great kindness for the young man, and was continually speaking in his commendation to the emperor <a href=/people/4862 target=_blank>Arcadius</a>, who made him count of the east, a dignity which authorizes every one on whom it is conferred to superintend the conduct of all the prefects of provinces through the east, and to correct whatever is improperly done. Lucianus, exhibiting toward those under his authority all the virtue that becomes a governor, was celebrated for his justice, temperance, and all other endowments which adorn a worthy magistrate; neither having respect of persons, or any other thoughts than such as were suggested to him by the laws. From this cause, when Eucherius, the emperor's uncle, desired him to perform an action not proper for him to comply with, he repulsed him, and by that exasperated him to such a degree, that he calumniated him to the emperor. The emperor observing that <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a> was the occasion of it, by having conferred so much power to such a person; <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a>, as if in resentment for the blame laid to his charge by the emperor, without communicating his design to any person, proceeded with a very small retinue to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>. Having entered that city at midnight, he seized on Lucianus, and brought him to trial without any accusation. He afterwards commanded him to be beaten on the neck with leaden balls until he expired. <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a> then caused him to be carried in a litter, closely covered, to cause the people to suppose that he was not yet dead, and that he should receive some act of humanity. The city was so much disgusted by this unusual manner of proceeding, that he was compelled to conciliate the people by erecting a portico, which exceeds in elegance every structure in the city.</p>                        </div>

But fortune ordered the affair in a different mannner, and the expectation of <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a> was frustrated by those means. Promotus had two sons, who while <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> was living were brought up with his children. One of these had in his house a young lady of remarkable beauty, whom the emperor was advised by <a href=/people/5659 target=_blank>Eutropius</a>, one of his eunuchs, to make his wife, with great commendations of her beauty. Perceiving that the emperor listened to what he said with some satisfaction, he shewed him her picture, by which he inflamed <a href=/people/4862 target=_blank>Arcadius</a> with so violent a passion for the lady, that he at length persuaded him to a resolution to marry her, while <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a> in the mean time was ignorant of the circumstance, and expected that his own daughter would shortly be empress, and that he himself should be an associate in the empire. The eunuch, as soon as he perceived that his design was effected, commanded the people to dance with garlands in their hands, as they were accustomed to do on the wedding-day of an emperor. Having procured from the palace an imperial robe and other attire proper for an empress, which he gave to the servants of the emperor to carry, he proceeded through the city attended by the populace. They all supposed that those ornaments were to be presented to the daughter of <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a>, and ran along with those that carried them, yet on arriving at the house of Promotus, they entered it with the presents, and delivered them to the young lady, who resided there with the son of Promotus. It thus became manifest who was chosen to become the emperor's wife. The hopes of <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a> being thus rendered abortive, on seeing another woman made empress, he employed himself in inventing a method to remove <a href=/people/5659 target=_blank>Eutropius</a>.

When <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a> heard of these transactions, he sailed back into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> without having effected any thing, except bringing on the Greeks' much greater and more grievous calamities by means of the soldiers whom he had taken with him. <br />Upon his return into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, he immediately resolved to effect the death of <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a>, in the following manner: He informed the emperor <a href=/people/7775 target=_blank>Honorius</a> that he might conveniently send some auxiliary legions to his brother <a href=/people/4862 target=_blank>Arcadius</a>, to defend the miserable nations under his dominion. The emperor commanding him to act as he judged expedient, he gave orders what troops should be sent upon that occasion, appointing Gaines their commander, to whom he communicated his design against <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a>. When these troops were arrived near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, Gaines went forward, and informed the emperor <a href=/people/4862 target=_blank>Arcadius</a> of their approach, and that they were come for the purpose of assisting him in his necessity. The emperor being pleased at their coming, Gaines advised him to meet them on their entrance into the city, which he observed was an honour usually conferred on the soldiers in similar instances. The emperor, being persuuded to this, went out of the city, and the soldiers paid him the usual marks of respect, which he received with kindness. At length, the signal being made by Gaines, they all fell on <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a>, and surrounding him struck him with their swords, so that one struck off his right hand, another his left, a third divided his head from his body, and went away singing songs of triumph. They even so insulted him after he was dead, as to carry his head round the whole, city, asking every person they met to give something to an insatiable miser.</p>                        </div>

Timasius having visited <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=place long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardis</a>, and seen this man, who possessed sufficient wit and cunning to flatter any person into a kindness for him, he made him his familiar, and shortly gave him the command of a cohort. He likewise took him with himself to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, which displeased the magistrates, for <a href=/people/8965 target=_blank>Bargus</a> had been formerly expelled from that city for some villainies of which he had been guilty. <a href=/people/5659 target=_blank>Eutropius</a>, however, was well pleased with it, having found him a person adapted for his purpose in his false charge against Timasius. He, therefore, made him the informer, employing him to impeach Timasius of treason in aiming at the throne. In this cause the emperor sat as president of the court, but <a href=/people/5659 target=_blank>Eutropius</a> stood near him, being the imperial chamberlain, and possessing full authority to pass the sentence. But perceiving the people to be all displeased, that a vender of provisions should accuse a person who had been so great and honourable, the emperor left the court, and left the whole affair to Saturnius and <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a>. The former of these was old, and had filled several offices of high importance, yet not without adulation, accustoming himself even in judicial cases to humour those who were the chief favourites of the emperor. On the other hand, <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a>, who was father-in-law to the emperor <a href=/people/466 target=_blank>Valens</a>, was a morose inflexible man, and in many instances spoke the truth boldly. Upon this occasion, being appointed a judge in the cause of Timasius, he stated to Saturnius these objections: that <a href=/people/8965 target=_blank>Bargus</a> was not a proper person to accuse Timasius, that a person who had held so many important offices, and a man of so great honour, ought; not to perish at the accusation of so mean and worthless an individual, and, that it was most improper that a benefactor should suffer from him whom he had patronized. But <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> gained no advantage by speaking with such freedom, since the opinion of Saturnius prevailed and was approved. <br />Timasius was, therefore, sentenced to reside in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/255307UOas class=place long=30.7305 lat=25.5968>Oasis</a>, and was sent there under a common guard.

Yet a report was in general circulation, that Timasius was rescued by his son <a href=/people/10332 target=_blank>Syagrius</a>, who having eluded those who were sent in search of him, employed some robbers to rescue his father. But whether that report was founded on truth, or was circulated to mortify <a href=/people/5659 target=_blank>Eutropius</a>, remains unknown. It is only ascertained, that Timasius and <a href=/people/10332 target=_blank>Syagrius</a> have never been seen since that period.</p>                        </div>

Therefore, when he had crossed into <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, he made no attempt to prevent the destruction of the towns and provinces, but confined himself merely to following the enemy, expecting that Tribigildus would proceed into the east, and privately sent forces to his assistance. He had not yet disclosed his present intentions. If Tribigildus had passed into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>, and from thence had proceeded not into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=place long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidia</a>, but directly into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a>, he could have encountered no obstacle, but when he had made himself master of that country, might likewise have devastated <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>. By crossing the sea from thence into the islands, he might have procured as many ships as he desired, by which, there not being any army able to resist him, he would have been enabled to overrun the whole east, and to pillage every country there, as well as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>.

This ascent being round and winding is by the natives called the Snail, from its similitude to that animal. In this were placed a sufficient number of men under <a href=/people/2106 target=_blank>Florentius</a> to obstruct any who should attempt to pass through it. The barbarians being blocked up in this place, and great quantities of huge stones continually thrown at them, they were almost all killed; since they were confined in so small a space, that the stones which fell from above could not fail to kill some of them. Being therefore in great perplexity, most of them plunged with their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> into the lake, and to avoid death by the stones perished in the water. Tribigildus, however, with three hundred of his men, ascended the Snail, where he bribed <a href=/people/2106 target=_blank>Florentius</a> and the guards who were with him with a vast sum of money to permit them to pass. Having by this means effected his escape, he suffered the remainder to be totally destroyed. Although Tribigildus concluded that he had thus delivered himself from the danger which Valentine had brought on him, yet he presently fell into far greater peril than the former. Almost all the inhabitants of the several towns, arming themselves with whatever was in their reach, inclosed him and the three hundred men who had escaped with him, between the rivers <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368314WMel class=place long=31.4487 lat=36.7744>Melas</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369312WEur class=place long=31.159 lat=36.911>Eurymedon</a>, one of which runs above <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368314PSid class=place long=31.391 lat=36.768>Side</a>, and the other through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369312PAsp class=place long=31.172 lat=36.939>Aspendus</a>. Being thus reduced to great embarrassment, he sent to Gaines.

He therefore sent other barbarian troops who were with him into the Roman camp to enable Tribigildus to escape. These barbarians, whom Gaines sent to <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> as auxiliaries, fell upon every Roman with whom they met, ravaged the country, and killed the soldiers. Nor did they cease to attack all places, until they had cut off <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> and all his army, and converted the whole country into a desert. Thus the design of Gaines met with success. Tribigildus, having escaped from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=place long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylia</a>, indicted still greater miseries than before on the cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>. Gaines from hence took occasion to magnify the exploits of Tribigildus to the emperor, and so far alarmed the senate and the whole court, that he persuaded them that Tribigildus would advance to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a> itself, and might nearly subvert the empire, unless the emperor should attend to his demands. <br />Gaines acted thus from policy, at once to conceal from the emporor his own inclinations, and to acquire by those concessions, which Tribigildus should extort, an opportunity of putting his own projects into execution. For he was not so much displeased at being himself neglected, as at the exaltation of <a href=/people/5659 target=_blank>Eutropius</a> to the highest degree of power, so as to possess the dignity of consul, bear that title for a considerable time together, and to be honoured with the patrician rank. This it was that principally excited Gaines to sedition. When his design, therefore, was ripe, he first planned the death of <a href=/people/5659 target=_blank>Eutropius</a>. With this purpose, while he was still in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>, he sent to the emperor, and informed him that he despaired of any success, since Tribigildus was so artful a warrior, and, moreover, that it was impossible to sustain his fury, or to deliver <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> from the present extremities, unless the emperor would comply with his request, which was, that <a href=/people/5659 target=_blank>Eutropius</a>, who was the chief cause of all the mischief which had happened, might be delivered into his hands, to be disposed of at his own pleasure.</p>                        </div>

Upon this he immediately fled for shelter to a <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> church, which had been made a sanctuary by himself. But Gaines being extremely urgent, and declaring that Tribigildus would never be appeased until <a href=/people/5659 target=_blank>Eutropius</a> was removed, they seized him by force, notwithstanding the law for establishing churches as sanctuaries, and sent him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a> under a strict guard. As Gaines still continued very impressively to urge the emperor <a href=/people/4862 target=_blank>Arcadius</a> to dispatch him, the emperor's attendants made an equivocating evasion of the oath that was sworn to <a href=/people/5659 target=_blank>Eutropius</a> when he was dragged out of the church, and caused him to be sent back out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>. Then, as if they had only sworn not to put him to death while he was at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, they sent him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a>, and there murdered him. <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> thus treated <a href=/people/5659 target=_blank>Eutropius</a> in a most singular manner on both hands, first in exalting him to such a height as no eunuch had ever before been raised, to, and then in exposing him to death, through the hatred of those who were enemies to the commonwealth. <br />Gaines, though now evidently inclined to innovation, yet thought himself still undiscovered. Therefore, being absolutely master of the will of Tribigildus, as he was much his superior in power and influence, he assisted him in making peace with the emperor. After they had mutually exchanged oaths, he returned again through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a>. Tribigildus followed him the same way, marching through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a> so as not to pass by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=place long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardis</a>, the metropolis of that country. When they had formed a junction at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389278UThy class=place long=27.8405 lat=38.9229>Thyatira</a>, Tribigildus repented that he had left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=place long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardis</a> unpillaged, since it was easy to take a city like that, destitute of all defence. He, therefore, resolved to return, there along with Gaines and to attack that city. Their design would certainly have been carried into effect, had not a great quantity of rain fallen, which occasioned a great flood on the land, and swelled the rivers so as to render them impassable; by which their journey was obstructed. They then divided the country between them, and Gaines led his forces towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a>, and Tribigildus his towards the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>, permitting the barbarians who followed them to pillage all before them. By the time, when the one had arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a>, the other had taken possession of all the places near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403267UPit class=place long=26.6992 lat=40.3467>Lampsacus</a>. Thus <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, and even the whole empire, was in extreme danger. Gaines then desired the emperor to come to him, being resolved to confer with no one except himself in person. The emperor submitted to this, and they met in a place near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a>, where is a church dedicated to the martyr Euphemia, who is honoured for her devotion to <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>. It was there agreed that Gaines and Tribigildus should repair from <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> into Europe, and that the most eminent persons in the whole state should be given up to them to be put to death. Among these were Aurelianus, who was consul for that year, Saturnius who had been consul, and John, to whom the emperor confided all his secrets, and who was said by many people to be the father of the presumed son of <a href=/people/4862 target=_blank>Arcadius</a>. <br />This tyrannical and insolent demand was complied with by the emperor. But Gaines, when he had these men in his own hands, was content with their suffering banishment He afterwards crossed into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, where he commanded Tribigildus to follow him, leaving <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, which was now beginning to recover breath, and had a probability of being delivered from all the dangers that had surrounded it. While he resided at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, he distributed his soldiers into several quarters; depriving the city even of the court-guards. He gave the barbarians private instructions, when they saw that the soldiers were departed from the city, immediately to attack it, being now destitute of all protection, and to deliver the sole authority into his hands.</p>                        </div>

He therefore left the barbarians in the city, who considerably exceeded in number the court-guards, and retired to a villa, about forty stadia from the city; expecting an opportunity of attacking it when the barbarians within should make their attempt. Gaines was filled with these hopes; and had he not been led away by the impetuosity natural to a barbarian, and anticipated the season proper for his enterprise, the barbarians must inevitably have made themselves masters of the city. But not waiting for the signal, he led his soldiers to the wall, and caused the sentinels to give an alarm. Upon this a general tumult immediately arose, with shrieks of women and mingled cries, as if the city had already been taken. At length the inhabitants collected together, and fell on the barbarians within the city. Having dispatched these with swords, stones, or whatever weapons they could find, they ran to the wall, and with the assistance of the guards so assailed the troops of Gaines, that they repulsed them from entering the city. <br />The city having thus escaped the danger, and the barbarians within being surrounded, more than seven thousand of them fled into a church belonging to the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, which stands near the palace, intending by that sanctuary to preserve themselves. The emperor commanded them to be slain even in that place; nor would he permit them to be protected by it from the just punishment which their daring actions merited. But although the emperor gave this command, none had courage to lay hands on them, through apprehension that they would defend themselves. They, therefore, deemed it best to take off the roof of the church, over what they term the altar, and to throw down firebrands upon them, until every man should be burnt to death. By these means the barbarians were destroyed. This, in the eyes of some who were zealous for Christianity, appeared a most abominable crime to be committed in the midst of so great a city. <br />Gaines, being disappointed in this great attempt, now made open preparation for war against the commonwealth. Attacking first the countries of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, he found the cities well protected by walls, and defended by their magistrates and inhabitants.

He, though, a barbarian by birth, was yet a Grecian in every other respect, not only in his manner of living, but in his disposition and his religion. They therefore committed the management of the army to him, who had been a celebrated leader in many wars, and had delivered all the east, from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenice</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/320350RPal class=place long=35.0001 lat=32.0206>Palestine</a>, from the depredations of robbers.

The Roman general, on the other hand, sailed continually about the coast of <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, to observe the designs of the enemy. Gaines, from the want of provisions, being uneasy at the protraction of the time, cut down a quantity of timber in a wood in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403265LChe class=place long=26.5 lat=40.3333>Chersonesus</a>, which he fastened together with great accuracy, and rendering it capable to contain both men and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, placed his troops upon it, and suffered them to float with the stream. These rafts were incapable of being managed with oars, or of admitting of the pilot's art, being hastily constructed by the rude contrivance of barbarians. He himself remained on shore, in the hopes of presently acquiring a victory, supposing that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> would not be sufficiently strong to contend against his men in an engagement. The prudent Roman general was not incautious, and, therefore, forming a conjecture of what was in agitation, he commanded his ships to put off a little from land. Perceiving the rude vessels of the barbarians to be carried with the current in whatever direction it drove them, he first attacked the foremost of them in front, and his ship, having a stem of bronze, overpowered it, not only distressing it with his ship, but throwing darts at the men who were in it, and thus sunk both them and their vessel. When the crews of his other ships saw this, they imitated the example, killed some of them with their darts, while others, falling off the rafts, were drowned, and scarcely any of them escaped with life. Gaines, being much grieved by this signal discomfiture, and having lost so many of his troops, removed from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403265LChe class=place long=26.5 lat=40.3333>Chersonesus</a> into that part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> which is beyond it. Fraiutus did not then think it expedient to pursue Gaines, but mustered his forces in the same place, being contented with the victory which fortune had bestowed on him. Fraiutus was now the subject of general animadversion, for not pursuing Gaines, but sparing him, because those who were escaped with him were the fellow-countrymen of Fraiutus. But being conscious of no such intention, he returned to the emperor, proud of his victory, which he openly and boldly ascribed to the favour of the gods whom he worshipped. For he was not ashamed, even in the presence of the emperor, to profess that he worshipped and honoured the gods after the ancient custom of his forefathers, and would not in that instance follow the vulgar people. The emperor received him with great kindness, and appointed him consul. Meantime Gaines, having lost the greater part of his army as I have related, fled with the remainder to the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>. Finding <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> to be devastated by the former inroads it had sustained, he pillaged every thing that was in his reach.

He afterwards crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> with his barbarians, designing to retire into his own country, there to spend the remainder of his days.</p>                        </div>

Meeting, however, with him, they landed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>, where consulting their own security, being in great danger through their extraordinary offence, they gave their prisoners an opportunity to escape; although it is said by some, that they were bribed by them to set them at liberty. However they might escape, they most unexpectedly returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, where they appeared before the emperor, the senate, and the people. <br />From this time, the hatred which the empress had conceived against John, who was a <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> bishop, was greatly increased. Although she had formerly been incensed against him, for having been severe upon her in his public homilies before the people, yet at this period, when he and the other two had returned, she became openly his enemy. In order, therefore, to satisfy her resentment, she used great efforts to induce the bishops of every place to consent to the removal of John. The first and chief of these was <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a>, the bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, who was the first who had opposed the ancient sacred rites and observances. Although a synod was proposed to be held for this purpose, John, finding that equity was little attended to, left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a> of his own accord. This giving offence to the people, to whom he had always shewn kindness, a tumult was excited in the city. The <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> church was then filled with those men whom they call Monks. These are persons who abstain from lawful marriage, and who fill large colleges, in many cities and villages, with unmarried men, incapable of war, or of any other service to the commonwealth. These men, by their arts, have from that to the present time acquired possession of extensive lands, and under the pretext of charity to the poor, have reduced (I might almost say) all other men to beggary. These Monks having now entered the churches, prevented the people from coming to their usual devotion. This so enraged the populace and the soldiers, that they attempted to suppress, and as it were to lop off, the luxuriant insolence of the Monks. The signal being given them for this purpose, they made a fierce attack, and without trial or examination put all the Monks to the sword, until they had filled the churches with dead bodies, and pursuing those who fled, wounded every one whom they met in black clothes. Among these many were killed through mistake, who were either in mourning, or wore such a dress from any other cause. <br />John, having returned again, attempted a repetition of the same measures, and excited similar commotions in the city.</p>                        </div>

Upon the death of any wealthy person they brought information of his estate, as if he had no children or relations. Upon this the emperor's letters were issued, commanding the estate to be put in possession of a particular person. Inheritances were even disposed of to any who begged them, although the children of the party stood by, lamenting and calling on their parent. In fine, every thing combined to fill the cities with grief, and to injure the inhabitants. For the emperor being a mere idiot, his wife, who exceeded in arrogance the rest of her sex, and was devoted to the insatiable avarice of eunuchs and her female attendants, who had the greatest influence with her, caused everyone to be weary of life; so that to modest persons nothing was then so eligible as death. <br />As if these circumstances did not sufficiently heighten the public misery, another inconceivable disaster fell on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>. John, as I have related, having returned from his banishment, and instigating the populace against the empress in his usual sermons, finding himself expelled both from his episcopal see and from the city, embarked and left the city. Those who had espoused his party, endeavouring to prevent any person from succeeding to his bishopric, privately set fire to a church in the night, and left the city at break of day, in order to avoid detection. As soon as it was day, the people discovered the extreme danger in which the city stood. Not only was the church burnt to the ground, but the adjacent houses were likewise consumed, especially those on which the violence of the wind directed the flames. Besides these, the fire extended to the senate-house, which stood before the palace, and was a most beautiful and magnificent edifice. It was adorned with statues by the most celebrated artists, which had a most splendid appearance; and with marble of such colours, as are not now to be found in any quarries. It is is said that, the images which were formerly consecrated in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383231SMus class=place long=23.0587 lat=38.3208>Helicon</a> to the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, and in the time of <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a> suffered by the universal sacrilege, having been erected and dedicated in this place, were burnt at the same time, as if to denote the disregard which all men should one day bear to the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. <br />At that time occurred a miracle which I think not unworthy of being mentioned. Before the doors of the temple of the senate were the statues of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> and <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>, standing on two pedestals, as they still continue. That of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> is said to be the <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> Dodonaeus, and that of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a> the same which was formerly consecrated in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361281PLin class=place long=28.0882 lat=36.0913>Lindus</a>. When the fire consumed the temple, the lead on its roof melted and ran down on the statues, and all the stones which could not resist the force of the fire likewise fell upon them, until at length the beauty of the building was converted into a heap of rubbish, and it was generally supposed that these two statues were also reduced to ashes. But when the ruins were removed, the statues of these two deities alone appeared to have escaped the general destruction. This circumstance inspired all persons above the ordinary rank with more favourable hopes for the city, as if these deities resolved to afford it their continual protection. <br />Leaving these circumstances, however, to be disposed of at the will of the deity, I return to my narrative.</p>                        </div>

Although they were not sufficiently strong to attack the fortified towns, yet they ravaged all the unwalled villages, and plundered every thing before them.

It would not be impertinent to notice what is remarkable concerning this town and its origin.

Having effected this, and arrived at that place, they left a memorial of their arrival there, which was the building of the town. Afterwards placing their ship, the <a href=/people/352 target=_blank>Argo</a>, on machines purposely constructed, they drew it four hundred stadia, as far as the sea-side, and thus arrived at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> shore, as is related by the poet <a href=/people/1403 target=_blank>Peisander</a>, who has comprehended almost the whole story in a poem called The Heroic Marriages of the Gods. <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a>, having marched out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/460145UEmo class=place long=14.5016 lat=46.0453>Emona</a>, and crossed the river Aquilis, passed over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425136LApe class=place long=13.567 lat=42.47>Apennine</a> mountains, and entered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/470150RNor class=place long=15 lat=47>Noricum</a>. <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/425136LApe class=place long=13.567 lat=42.47>Apennine</a> mountains are situated on the borders of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=place long=19 lat=45>Pannonia</a>, and render the way into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/470150RNor class=place long=15 lat=47>Noricum</a> very narrow, wherefore, if the pass were guarded by a small number, a large force would find great difficulty in penetrating it.

But <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a>, although he received the embassy, left those who brought it at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, and proceeded himself to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, with a design to consult the emperor and the senate upon this affair. When the senate was assembled at the imperial palace, and deliberated whether to declare war, most of them were disposed for war. <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a>, and a few others who complied with him merely through fear, were of a contrary opinion, and voted for a peace with <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a>. When those who preferred a war desired of <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a> his reason for chusing peace rather than war, and wherefore, to the dishonour of the Roman name, he was willing basely to purchase it with money, he replied, <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> has continued this length of time in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> that he may join with me against the emperor of the east, and separating the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a> from that dominion, add them to the subjects of <a href=/people/7775 target=_blank>Honorius</a>. This, he said, would have been effected before this period, had not letters in the mean time arrived from the emperor <a href=/people/7775 target=_blank>Honorius</a>, which deferred the expedition to the east, in expectation of which <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> had spent so much time in that country. When <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a> had said these words, he produced an epistle from the emperor, and said that Serena was the occasion of all, wishing to preserve an inviolable friendship between the two emperors. <br />The senate, therefore, imagining that <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a> spoke nothing but what was reasonable, decreed that <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> should receive three thousand pounds of silver in consideration of maintaining peace, although most of them gave their voices more in dread of <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a> than of their own judgment or inclination. For this reason, <a href=/people/5739 target=_blank>Lampadius</a>, a person of exalted birth and rank, having uttered this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> sentence, Non est ista pax, sed pactio servitutis, This is not a peace, but a bond of servitude, he was compelled, as soon as the senate was dismissed, to fly into a neighbouring church, belonging to the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, from the fear of being punished for the freedom with which he had expressed himself.</p>                        </div>

At this they were in such consternation, that they burst into tears, and desiring him to have compassion on them, prevailed on him to promise them a pardon from the emperor. The emperor having performed what <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a> had promised, they applied themselves to public business. For <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a> was desirous of proceeding to the east to undertake the management of the affairs of <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, the son of <a href=/people/4862 target=_blank>Arcadius</a>, who was very young, and in want of a guardian. <a href=/people/7775 target=_blank>Honorius</a> himself was also inclined to undertake the same journey, with a design to secure the dominions of that emperor. But <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a>, being displeased at that, and laying before the emperor a calculation of the immense sum of money it would require to defray the expence of such an expedition, deterred him from the enterprise. He likewise observed to him, that the rebellion of <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a> would not admit of his going so far, as not to protect <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> itself, since that usurper had over-run all Gaul, and then resided at Orleans. Moreover, though what he had pointed out was sufficient to deserve the attention and presence of the emperor, <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> was also approaching with a vast force of barbarians, who, being a barbarian and void of faith, when he should find <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> devoid of all aid, would certainly invade it.

The soldiers, then dispersing themselves about the city, killed as many of the magistrates as they could lay hands on, tearing them out of the houses into which they had fled, and plundered all the town. So violent was the commotion, that the emperor, finding the disorder beyond remedy, put on a short mantle, and without either his long robe or his diadem, issuing into the midst of the city, had great difficulty in appeasing and restraining their fury. For those magistrates who were taken, even after their flight, were murdered. Among these were Naemorius commander of the court-bands, <a href=/people/908 target=_blank>Petronius</a>, the treasurer and steward of the emperor's private property, and <a href=/people/1677 target=_blank>Salvius</a>, whose office it was to proclaim the intentions of the emperor upon any occasion, which officer had borne the title of Questor from the time of <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a>. Nor could the latter escape death, though he embraced the emperor's knees. The tumult continued till late in the night, and the emperor fearing lest any violence should be committed against his own person also, for which reason he withdrew. They then happened to find Longinianus, the prefect of the court for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, whom they put to death. All these magistrates were slain by the infuriated soldiers. There likewise perished so great a number of promiscuous persons as is beyond all computation.</p>                        </div>

Summoning, therefore, all the commanders of his confederate barbarians, who were with him, he proposed a consultation relative to what measures it would be most prudent to adopt. It was agreed with common consent, that if the emperor were killed, which was yet doubtful, all the confederated barbarians should join together, and fall at once on the Roman soldiers, and by that means afford a warning to all others to use greater moderation and submissiveness. But if the emperor were safe, although the magistrates were cut off, the authors of the tumult were to be brought to condign punishment.

But being unable to prevail with him, they all determined to remain in some place until they should be better apprized of the emperor's sentiments towards <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a>, with the exception of Sarus, who excelled all the other confederates in power and rank, and who, accompanied by the barbarians under his command, having killed all the Huns who formed the guard of <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a> while they were asleep, and having seized all the carriages that followed him, entered his tent, in which he remained to observe the event. Upon this <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a>, observing that his barbarians were quarrelling among each other, hastened to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, and engaged the cities, in which were any women or children belonging to the barbarians, not to afford reception to any of the barbarians if they should come to them. In the meantime <a href=/people/3220 target=_blank>Olympius</a>, who was now become master of the emperor's inclination, sent, the imperial mandate to the soldiers at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, ordering them immediately to apprehend <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a>, and to detain him in prison without fetters. When <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a> heard this, he took refuge in a <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> church that was near, while it was night. His barbarians and his other familiars, who, with his servants, were all armed, upon seeing this expected what would ensue. When day appeared, the soldiers, entering the church, swore before the bishop, that they were commanded by the emperor not to kill <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a>, but to keep him in custody. Being brought out of the church, and in the custody of the soldiers, other letters were delivered by the person who brought the first, in which the punishment of death was denounced against <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a>, for his crimes against the commonwealth. Thus, while Eucherius, his son, fled towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a> was led to execution. The barbarians who attended him, with his servants and other friends and relations, of whom there was a vast number, preparing and resolving to rescue him from the stroke, <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a> deterred them from the attempt by all imaginable menaces, and calmly submitted his neck to the sword. He was the most moderate and just of all the men who possessed great authority in his time. For although he was married to the niece of the first <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, was entrusted with the empires of both his sons, and had been a commander twenty-three years, yet he never conferred military rank for money, or coverted the stipend of the soldiers to his own use. Being the father of one only son, he offered to him the office of tribune of the Notarii, and limitted him neither to desire nor attempt obtaining any other office or authority. In order that no studious person, or astrologers, maybe ignorant of the time of his death, I shall relate, that it happened in the consulship of <a href=/people/837 target=_blank>Bassus</a> and <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a>, during which the emperor <a href=/people/4862 target=_blank>Arcadius</a> submitted to fate, on the twenty-second day of August.</p>                        </div>

Meanwhile, not only all the friends of <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a>, but all others who had any regard for him, were searched out. Among these, Duterius, who commanded the guard of the imperial bed-chamber, was examined, as was likewise Petrus, tribune of the Notarii.

Although many others, who were suspected of being the adherents of <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a>, and acquainted with his designs, were examined and put to torture to induce them to confess a knowledge of his ambition to be emperor; yet since none of them would make such a confession, the inquirers at length desisted from their enterprise. In the mean time, the emperor <a href=/people/7775 target=_blank>Honorius</a> commanded his wife Thermantia to be taken from the imperial throne, and to be restored to her mother, who notwithstanding was without suspicion. He likewise ordered Eucherius, the son, of <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a>, to be searched for and put to death.

He therefore sent ambassadors with a desire to procure a peace, even if he acquired for it but a small sum of money.

When <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> demanded peace on those conditions, the emperor refused to grant it, although if he would have disposed of his affairs with prudence, he must have chosen one of two alternatives that were before him. He ought either to have deferred the war, and to have procured a peace by a small sum, or if he preferred to contend, he should have collected together as many legions as possible, and have posted them in the route of the enemy, to obstruct the barbarians from advancing any further. He should likewise have chosen a proper person to lead them, and have conferred the command on Sarus, who alone was sufficient to strike terror into the enemy, both by means of his intrepidity, and of his experience in warlike affairs; who had also under him a force of barbarians sufficient to make a good defence. . The emperor, on the contrary, neither accepting the offers of peace, making Sarus his friend, nor collecting the Roman army, but placing all his dependance on <a href=/people/3220 target=_blank>Olympius</a>, occasioned the innumerable calamities by which the commonwealth was overwhelmed.

When he had crossed that river, being as it were at some festival, and having no enemy to obstruct him, he arrived at a castle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445113UBon class=place long=11.3418 lat=44.4946>Bononia</a>, called Occuparia.

From thence marching towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, he sacked all the castles and towns in his way. Thus if <a href=/people/8887 target=_blank>Arsacius</a> and Tarentius, the two eunuchs, had not hastened to bring Eucherius, the son of <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a>, from those quarters to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to be executed according to the command of the emperor, the youth would certainly have fallen into the hands of <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a>, and would have been saved. The eunuchs having fulfilled the injunctions laid on them to that effect, and having delivered Thermantia, the wife of <a href=/people/7775 target=_blank>Honorius</a>, to her mother, went by sea to the emperor in Gallia <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=place long=7 lat=49>Celtica</a>, where he then resided, because they were not able to go to him by the same way they had come.

They observed, that <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a>, upon Serena being removed, will retire from the city, because no person will remain by whom he can hope the town to be betrayed into his hands. This suspicion was in reality groundless, as Serena never had any such intentions. However she suffered justly for her impieties toward the gods, which I am now about to relate. When the elder <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, after defeating the rebel Eugenius, arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and occasioned in all persons a contempt and neglect of divine worship, by refusing to defray the charge of the holy rites from the public funds, the priests of both sexes were dismissed and banished, and the temples were deprived of sacrifices. Serena, insulting the deities with derision, was determined to see the temple dedicated to the mother of the gods. In this perceiving some ornaments around the neck of the statue of <a href=/people/243 target=_blank>Rhea</a>, suitable to the divine worship that was paid to her, she took them off the statue, and placed them upon her own neck. An aged woman, who was the only one remaining of the <a href=/people/12228 target=_blank>vestal virgins</a>, upbraided her severely for so impious an action. Serena not only returned very violent language, but commanded her attendants to drive or carry her away. Notwithstanding, the old woman, as she was leaving the place, prayed that whatever was due to such impiety might fall on Serena, her husband, and children. Serena did not notice what she had said, but left the temple pleased with the ornaments she had obtained. Yet afterwards she was frequently visited by an appearance, not only imaginary, in her dreams, but real, when she was awake, which predicted her death. Other persons likewise beheld the same appearance. So far did that just power of vengeance, whose office it is to punish the wicked, discharge its duty, that although Serena knew what would happen, she was without caution, and submitted that neck which she had decorated with the attire of the goddess, even to a halter. It is likewise said that <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a>, for an impiety not much unlike this of which Serena was guilty, did not escape the secret hand of vengeance. He is said to have commanded the doors of the capitol to be stripped of a large quantity of gold with which they were covered. They who were employed in that act found on some part of the doors this inscription, These are reserved for a wretched prince. The veracity of the prediction contained in this inscription was proved, for he indeed died in the most wretched and miserable manner.</p>                        </div>

But none coming to their assistance, and being disappointed in their hopes, they diminished the allowance of grain, and ordered that not more than half of the former quantity of provisions should be dressed each day and afterwards when the scarcity increased, only a third part. Receiving no relief, and all their provisions being consumed, the famine, as might be expected, was succeeded by a pestilence, and all places were filled with dead bodies. As the dead could not be interred outside the city, for the enemy was in possession of all the avenues, the city was made their sepulchre. Thus it was in danger of being depopulated by an additional cause, and though no want of provisions had subsisted, yet the stench arising from the putrid corpses was sufficient to infect them with disease. Laeta the wife of the late emperor <a href=/people/1668 target=_blank>Gratian</a>, and her mother Tisamene, supplied great numbers with food for some time. For since they were allowed from the treasury the provisions of an imperial table, through the generosity of <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, who had conferred on then, that privilege, many received the bounty of these two ladies, and obtained from their house what preserved them from famine.</p>                        </div>

They tried all methods of support, which are abominable in the eyes of all mankind. They then resolved on sending an embassy to the enemy, to inform him that they were willing to accept any reasonable conditions of peace, and at the same time were ready for war, since the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> had taken up arms, and by means of continual military exercise were become well disposed for action. Basilius was appointed their ambassador, who was a Spaniard, and governor of a province. Johannes, the chief of the imperial notaries, went with him, because he was acquainted with <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a>, and might be the cause of a reconciliation. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> did not certainly know whether <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> himself was present or not, or whether it was he who besieged the city. For they were deluded by a report that it was another person, who had been a friend of <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a>, which had occasioned him to come against their city. When the ambassadors came to him, they were ashamed of the ignorance in which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had so long remained, but delivered the message of the senate. When <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> heard it, and that the people having been exercised to arms were ready for war, he remarked, The thickest grass is more easy to cut than the thinnest. Having said this, he laughed immoderately at the ambassadors. But when they spoke of peace, he used such expressions as were in the extreme of arrogance and presumption. He declared, that he would not relinquish the siege on any condition but that of receiving all the gold and silver in the city, all the household goods, and the barbarian slaves. One of the ambassadors observing, If you take all these, what will you leave for the citizens ? He replied, Their Souls. When the ambassadors received this answer, they desired time to communicate it to the citizens, and to consult with them in what manner they should act. Having obtained that permission, they related all the conversation that had passed in their embassy. On this the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, being convinced that it was really <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> who attacked them, and despairing therefore of all things that conduce to human strength, called to mind the aid which the city had formerly met with in emergencies; and that they, by transgressing their ancient institutions, were now left destitute of it.</p>                        </div>

Having discoursed with these men, he performed all that was in his power according to the books of the chief priests. Recollecting, however, the opinions that were then prevalent, he resolved to proceed with greater caution, and proposed the whole affair to the bishop of the city, whose name was <a href=/people/9574 target=_blank>Innocentius</a>. Preferring the preservation of the city to his own private opinion, he gave them permission to do privately whatever they knew to be convenient. They declared however that what they were able to do would be of no utility, unless the public and customary sacrifices were performed, and unless the senate ascended to the capitol, performing there, and in the different markets of the city, all that was essential. But no person daring to join in the ancient religious ordinances, they dismissed the men who were come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscia</a>, and applied themselves to the endeavouring to appease the barbarians in the best possible manner. With this design they again sent ambassadors. After long discussions on both sides, it was at length agreed, that the city should give five thousand pounds of gold, and thirty thousand of silver, four thousand silk robes, three thousand scarlet fleeces, and three thouand pounds of pepper. As the city possessed no public stock, it was necessary for the senators who had property, to undertake the collection by an assessment. <a href=/people/2178 target=_blank>Palladius</a> was empowered to rate every person according to his estate, but was not able to complete the whole sum out of all, either because many persons concealed part of their property, or because the city was impoverished, through the avarice and unceasing exactions of the magistrates appointed by the emperor. The evil genius, who at that time presided over the human race, then incited the persons employed in this transaction to the highest pitch of wickedness. They resolved to supply the deficiency from the ornaments that were about the statues of the gods. This was in effect only rendering inanimate and inefficacious those images, which had been fixed up, and dedicated to sacred rites and ceremonies, and were decorated with precious attire, for preserving the city in perpetual felicity. And since every thing then conspired to the ruin of the city, they not only robbed the statues of their ornaments, but also melted down some of them that were made of gold and silver. Among these was that of Valour or Fortitude, which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call Virtus. This being destroyed, all that remained of the Roman valour and intrepidity was totally extinguished; according to the remarks of persons who were skilled in sacred rites and observances.</p>                        </div>

This being done, <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> gave the citizens a free market for three successive days, with permission to pass securely through certain gates of the city, and to bring corn from the port.

These regiments consisted of six thousand men, who for strength and discipline were the flower of the whole Roman army. Their general was <a href=/people/466 target=_blank>Valens</a>, a person ready for the greatest and most hazardous enterprizes. He disdained, therefore, to appear so cowardly as to march by a way that was not guarded by the enemy. Thus <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a>, delaying until he came up to him, and attacking him with all his forces, cut off all his troops, except a hundred, who with much difficulty escaped, together with their commander. He arrived in safety at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> together with <a href=/people/90 target=_blank>Attalus</a>, whom the senate had sent to the emperor.

Heliocrates was employed to make an inquisition into the estates of those who were banished on account of their acquaintance with or relation to <a href=/people/12193 target=_blank>Stilico</a>, and to make a return of them to the treasury. But he being a man of great moderation, and of good disposition, considered it an impiety to insult the unfortunate; and therefore did not make strict enquiries, but on the contrary sent private notice to many of the parties to conceal what they were able. Being for this reason considered a worthless person, he was seized and carried to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, to suffer for his humanity towards the unfortunate. He would undoubtedly have died for it, through the cruelty which then prevailed, had he not wisely fled to a church belonging to the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>. Maximilianus, having fallen into the hands of the enemy, was redeemed by his father, Marinianus, with thirty thousand pieces of gold. For since the emperor deferred the peace, and did not fulfil what had been agreed on, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> could no longer pass freely out of the city. The senate therefore a second time sent ambassadors to the emperor concerning the peace, along with whom the bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> also went. There were in their retinue some barbarians, whom <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> sent to protect them from their enemies who infested the different roads. When these ambassadors were arrived with the emperor, Ataulphus, for whom <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a> had sent, as I before mentioned, had crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a>, between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=place long=19 lat=45>Pannonia</a> and Venice. When the emperor heard of his approach, and that he had with him an inconsiderable force, he ordered all his troops both <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and foot, which were in the different towns, to march under their own officers to meet him. To <a href=/people/3220 target=_blank>Olympius</a>, who was commander of the court guards, he gave the Huns who were in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, amounting to three hundred.

After making many innovations in the magistracy, and in other respects; discharging those who were previously in high authority, and bestowing their offices on others; he appointed Generidus commander of the forces in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a>, who already held the chief command of those stationed in the upper <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=place long=19 lat=45>Pannonia</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/470150RNor class=place long=15 lat=47>Noricum</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469105RRae class=place long=10.47 lat=46.85>Rhaetia</a>, as far as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a>. This Generidus, although of barbarian extraction, was in disposition inclined to all virtues, and was remarkably devoid of covetousness. While he adhered to ancient ordinances, and could not endure to relinquish the old mode of worshipping the gods, a law was promulgated, prohibiting all who were not <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> from wearing a girdle in the court. This law being established, Generidus, who was at that time a military officer in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, laid aside his girdle, and remained in his own house. The emperor requiring him, as one enrolled among the officers, to attend at court in his due course, he replied that there was a law which forbad him the use of a girdle, or that any one should be reckoned among the officers who did not reverence the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> religion. The emperor answered, that the law indeed was obligatory on all others, but excepted him alone, who had undertaken such dangerous enterprizes for the commonwealth. Generidus said in reply, that he could not suffer himself to accept of an honour that appeared to affront all who by means of that law had been put out of commission. Nor did he execute his office, until the emperor, compelled both by necessity and shame, completely abolished the law, and gave all persons liberty of enjoying their own sentiments in all offices, whether civil or military. <br />Generidus, having commenced with this act of gallantry, employed and instructed the soldiers with continual labour and exercise. He distributed corn among them, suffering no person to deprive them of any part of it, as was formerly the practise. He likewise gave suitable recompenses out of his own public allowance to those who were most deserving. Appearing therefore thus great, he was not only a terror to the adjacent barbarians, but a security to the nations which were under his care.</p>                        </div>

On hearing the soldiers reply, that they must deliver into their hands Turpillio and Vigilantius, the two generals, with <a href=/people/217 target=_blank>Terentius</a>, the imperial chamberlain, and <a href=/people/8887 target=_blank>Arsacius</a>, next to him in dignity, the emperor fearing an insurrection of the soldiers condemned the two generals to perpetual exile. They being therefore placed on board a ship, were murdered by those who were appointed to carry them to the place of banishment. Jovius indeed had commanded them to do this; fearing lest if they should ever return, and discover the intrigue that was formed against them, they might excite the emperor to punish him for it. <a href=/people/217 target=_blank>Terentius</a> was sent into the east, and <a href=/people/8887 target=_blank>Arsacius</a> was ordered to reside in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Milan</a>.</p>                        </div>

This determined the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> on besieging the city, perceiving that the Roman soldiers were either fled or very negligent of their duty, the barbarians having long endeavoured in vain, and being unable to take it by assault, were obliged to have recourse to stratagem. They pretended to return into their own country, and selected three hundred young men of great strength and courage, whom they bestowed on the Roman nobility as a present, having previously instructed them to oblige their masters by all possible observance, and on a certain day appointed, about noon, when the nobility were either asleep or otherwise unmindful of business, to meet suddenly at the gate called Porta Avinaria, where having surprised and killed the guards, they should open the gate for those who would be there in waiting. Meanwhile the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> delayed their return home, under pretence of still wanting something, until the three hundred youths, making a good use of their opportunity, opened the gate to their countrymen. The <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, on being admitted, immediately began to plunder the city, although they committed more dishonour than mischief to the citizens. It is the opinion of some, that the gate was opened by the contrivance of Proba, a lady of great rank and wealth, who compassionated the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, who were dying of famine and of several distempers, like <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>. There are two circumstances relative to this occasion worthy of being noticed. The one is, that an edict was made by <a href=/people/12075 target=_blank>Alaric</a>, that whoever took refuge in the churches of saints, especially in those of Peter and Paul, should receive no injury; which was accordingly observed with great care. The other was, that when <a href=/people/7775 target=_blank>Honorius</a> received intelligence at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> that Roma was destroyed, he understood by it a certain strong Gaul, whose name was Roma, and thought it very remarkable that he should so soon be cut off, with whom a little before he had so diverted himself.</p>                        </div>
