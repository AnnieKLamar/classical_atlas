                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0060.tlg001:1.1.1'><b>&sect; 1.1.1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fitting that all men should ever accord great gratitude to those writers who have composed universal histories, since they have aspired to help by their individual labours human society as a whole; for by offering a schooling, which entails no danger, in what is advantageous they prove their readers, through such a presentation of events, with a most excellent kind of experience. 2 For although the learning which is acquired by experience in each separate case, with all the attendant toils and dangers, does indeed enable a man to discern in each instance where utility lies — and this is the reason why the most widely experienced of our heroes suffered great misfortunes before he <br />Of many men the cities saw and learned <br />Their thoughts;— <br />yet the understanding of the failures and successes of other men, which is acquired by the study of history, affords a schooling that is free from actual experience of ills. 3 Furthermore, it has been the aspiration of these writers to marshal all men, who, although united one to another by their kinship, are yet separated by space and time, into one and the same orderly body. And such historians have therein shown themselves to be, as it were, ministers of <a href=/people/1595 target=_blank>Divine Providence</a>. For just as Providence, having brought the orderly arrangement of the visible stars and the natures of men together into one common relationship, continually directs their courses through all eternity, apportioning to each that which falls to it by the direction of fate, so likewise the historians, in recording the common affairs of the inhabited world as though they were those of a single state, have made of their treatises a single reckoning of past events and a common clearing-house of knowledge concerning them. 4 For it is an excellent thing to be able to use the ignorant mistakes of others as warning examples for the correction of error, and, when we confront the varied vicissitudes of life, instead of having to investigate what is being done now, to be able to imitate the successes which have been achieved in the past. Certainly all men prefer in their counsels the oldest men to those who are younger, because of the experience which has accrued to the former through the lapse of time; be it is a fact that such experience is in so far surpassed by the understanding which is gained from history, as history excels, we know, in the multitude of facts at its disposal. For this reason one may hold that the acquisition of a knowledge of history is of the greatest utility for every conceivable circumstance of life. 5 For it endows the young with the wisdom of the aged, while for the old it multiplies the experience which they already possess; citizens in private station it qualifies for leadership, and the leaders it incites, through the immortality of the glory which it confers, to undertake the noblest deeds; soldiers, again, it makes more ready to face dangers in defence of their country because of the public encomiums which they will receive after death, and wicked men it turns aside from their impulse towards evil through the everlasting opprobrium to which it will condemn them. </p>                        </div>

And since complete happiness can be attained only through the combination of all these activities, the foremost meed of praise must be awarded to that which more than any other thing is the cause of them, that is, to history. 2 For we must look upon it as constituting the guardian of the high achievements of illustrious men, the witness which testifies to the evil deeds of the wicked, and the benefactor of the entire human race. For if it be true that the myths which are related about <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>, in spite of the fact that their subject-matter is fictitious, contribute greatly to fostering piety and justice among men, how much more must we assume that history, the prophetess of truth, she who is, as it were, the mother-city of philosophy as a whole, is still more potent to equip men's characters for noble living! 3 For all men, by reason of the frailty of our nature, live but an infinitesimal portion of eternity and are dead throughout all subsequent time; and while in the case of those who in their lifetime have done nothing worthy of note, everything which has pertained to them in life also perishes when their bodies die, yet in the case of those who by their virtue have achieved fame, their deeds are remembered for evermore, since they are heralded abroad by history's voice most divine. </p>                        </div>

In the case of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, for instance, it is generally agreed that during the whole time which he spent among men he submitted to great and continuous labours and perils willingly, in order that he might confer benefits upon the race of men and thereby gain immortality; and likewise in the case of other great and good men, some have attained to heroic honours and others to honours equal to the divine, and all have been thought to be worthy of great praise, since history immortalizes their achievements. 5 For whereas all other memorials abide but a brief time, yet the power of history, which extends over the whole inhabited world, possesses in time, which brings ruin upon all things else, a custodian which ensures its perpetual transmission to posterity. <br />History also contributes to the power of speech, and a nobler thing than that may not easily be found. 6 For it is this that makes the Greeks superior to the barbarians, and the educated to the uneducated, and, furthermore, it is by means of speech alone that one man is able to gain ascendancy over the many; and, in general, the impression made by every measure that is proposed corresponds to the power of the speaker who presents it, and we describe great and human men as worthy of speech, as though therein they had won the highest prize of excellence. 7 And when speech is resolved into its several kinds, we find that, whereas poetry is more pleasing than profitable, and codes of law punish but do not instruct, and similarly, all the other kinds either contribute nothing to happiness or else contain a harmful element mingled with the beneficial, while some of them actually pervert the truth, history alone, since in it word and fact are in perfect agreement, embraces in its narration all the other qualities as well as that are useful; 8 for it is ever to be seen urging men to justice, denouncing those who are evil, lauding the good, laying up, in a word, for its readers a mighty store of experience. </p>                        </div>

But when we turned our attention to the historians before our time, although we approved their purpose without reservation, yet we were far from feeling that their treatises had been composed so as to contribute to human welfare as much as might have been the case. 2 For although the profit which history affords its readers lies in its embracing a vast number and variety of circumstances, yet most writers have recorded no more than isolated wars waged by a single nation or a single state, and but few have undertaken, beginning with the earliest times and coming down to their own day, to record the events connected with all peoples; and of the latter, some have not attached to the several events their own proper dates, and others have passed over the deeds of barbarian peoples; and some, again, have rejected the ancient legends because of the difficulties involved in their treatment, while others have failed to complete the plan to which they had set their hand, their lives having been cut short by fate. And of those who have undertaken this account of all peoples not one has continued his history beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> period. 3 For while some have closed their accounts with the deeds of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, others with those of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, and some with the Diadochi or the Epigoni, yet, despite the number and importance of the events subsequent to these and extending even to our own lifetime which have been left neglected, no historian has essayed to treat of them within the compass of a single narrative, because of the magnitude of the undertaking. 4 For this reason, since both the dates of the events and the events themselves lie scattered about in numerous treatises and in divers authors, the knowledge of them becomes difficult for the mind to encompass and for the memory to retain. </p>                        </div>

In general, a history of this nature must be held to surpass all others to the same degree as the whole is more useful than the part and continuity than discontinuity, and, again, as an event whose date has been accurately determined is more useful than one of which it is not known in what period it happened. </p>                        </div>

Such a phenomenon can be seen even yet in swamps and marshy places whenever, the ground having become cold, the air suddenly and without any gradual change becomes intensely warm. 4 And while the wet was being impregnated with life by reason of the warmth in the manner described, by night the living things forthwith received their nourishment from the mist that fell from the enveloping air, and by day were made solid by the intense heat; and finally, when the embryos had attained their full development and the membranes had been thoroughly heated and broken open, there was produced every form of animal life. 5 Of these, such as had partaken of the most warmth set off to the higher regions, having become winged, and such as retained an earthy consistency came to be numbered in the class of creeping things and of the other land animals, while those whose composition partook the most of the wet element gathered into the region congenial to them, receiving the name of water animals. 6 And since the earth constantly grew more solid through the action of the sun's fire and of the winds, it was finally no longer able to generate any of the larger animals, but each kind of living creatures was now begotten by breeding with one another. </p>                        </div>

Then, 2 since they were attacked by the wild beasts, they came to each other's aid, being instructed by expediency, and when gathered together in this way by reason of their fear, they gradually came to recognize their mutual characteristics. 3 And though the sounds which they made were at first unintelligible and indistinct, yet gradually they came to give articulation to their speech, and by agreeing with one another upon symbols for each thing which presented itself to them, made known among themselves the significance which was to be attached to each term. 4 But since groups of this kind arose over every part of the inhabited world, not all men had the same language, inasmuch as every group organized the elements of its speech by mere chance.

But if a man should concede even this last point, it still seems evident that writers of history are as a class a quite recent appearance in the life of mankind. 3 Again, with respect to the antiquity of the human race, not only do Greeks put forth their claims but many of the barbarians as well, all holding that it is they who were autochthonous and the first of all men to discover the things which are of use in life, and that it was the events in their own history which were the earliest to have been held worthy of record. 4 So far as we are concerned, however, we shall not make the attempt to determine with precision the antiquity of each nation or what is the race whose nations are prior in point of time to the rest and by how many years, but we shall record summarily, keeping due proportion in our account, what each nation has to say concerning its antiquity and the early events in its history. 5 The first peoples which we shall discuss will be the barbarians, not that we consider them to be earlier than the Greeks, as <a href=/people/225 target=_blank>Ephorus</a> has said, but because we wish to set forth most of the facts about them at the outset, in order that we may not, by beginning with the various accounts given by the Greeks, have to interpolate in the different narrations of their early history any event connected with another people. 6 And since <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> is the country where mythology places the origin of the gods, where the earliest observations of the stars are said to have been made, and where, furthermore, many noteworthy deeds of great men are recorded, we shall begin our history with the events connected with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. </p>                        </div>

Over each piece of the body, as the account goes, she fashioned out of spices and wax a human figure about the size of <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a>; 6 then summoning the priests group by group, she required all of them an oath that they would reveal to no one the trust which she was going to confide to them, and taking each group of them apart privately she said that she was consigning to them alone the burial of the body, and after reminding them of the benefactions of <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> she exhorted them to bury his body in their own district and pay honours to him as to a god, and to consecrate to him also some one that they might choose of the animals native to their district, pay it while living the honours which they had formerly rendered to <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a>, and upon its death accord it the same kind of funeral as they had given to him. 7 And since <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> wished to induce the priests to render these honours by the incentive of their own profit also, she gave them the third part of the country to defray the cost of the worship and service of the gods. 8 And the priests, it is said, being mindful of the benefactions of <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> and eager to please the queen who was petitioning them, and incited as well by their own profit, did everything just as <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> had suggested. 9 It is for this reason that even to this day each group of priests supposes that <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> lies buried in their district, pays honours to the animals which were originally consecrated to him, and, when these die, renews in the funeral rites for them the mourning for <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a>. 10 The consecration to <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a>, however, of the sacred <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>, which are given the names <a href=/people/360 target=_blank>Apis</a> and <a href=/people/3210 target=_blank>Mnevis</a>, and worship of them as gods were introduced generally among all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, 11 since these animals had, more than any others, rendered aid to those who discovered the fruit of the grain, in connection with both the sowing of the seed and with every agricultural labour from which mankind profits. </p>                        </div>

Once when there was a great drought, as is generally agreed, which extended over practically all the inhabited earth except <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> because of the peculiar character of that country, and there followed a destruction both of crops and of men in great numbers, <a href=/people/298 target=_blank>Erechtheus</a>, through his racial connection with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, brought from there to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> a great supply of grain, and in return those who had enjoyed this aid made their benefactor king. 2 After he had secured the throne he instituted the initiatory rites of <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235SEle class=place long=23.538 lat=38.0411>Eleusis</a> and established the mysteries, transferring their ritual from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. And the tradition that an advent of the goddess into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a> also took place at that time is reasonable, since it was then that the fruits which are named after her were brought to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, and this is why it was thought that the discovery of the seed had been made again, as though <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a> had bestowed the gift. 3 And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> on their part agree that it was in the reign of <a href=/people/298 target=_blank>Erechtheus</a>, when a lack of rain had wiped out the crops, that <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a> came to them with the gift of grain.

The land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> almost lies wholly to the south, and is naturally fortified, and the most pleasant country of any of the kingdoms round about it. For on the west it is defended by the deserts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, full of wild beasts, running out a vast way in length; where the passage is both difficult, and extremely hazardous, through want of water and other provision. On the south it is environed with the cataracts of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, and the mountains adjoining. For from the country of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195372RTro class=ethnic long=37.2 lat=19.5>Troglodites</a>, and the higher parts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, for the space of five thousand and five hundred furlongs, there is no passing either by land or water, without such a measure of provision as a king himself could only be furnished with. Those parts towards the east, are partly secured by the river, and partly surrounded by the deserts and by the marshes called the Barathra. For there is a lake between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335360RCSy class=place long=36 lat=33.5>Coele-Syria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, very narrow, but exceeding deep, even to a wonder, two hundred furlongs in length, called Serbon: if any through ignorance approach it, they are lost irrecoverably; for the channel being very narrow, like a swadling-band, and compassed round with vast heaps of sand, great quantities of it are cast into the lake, by the continued southern winds, which so cover the surface of the water, and make it to the view so like unto dry land, that it cannot possibly be distinguished; and therefore many, unacquainted with the nature of the place, by missing their way, have been there swallowed up, together with whole armies. For the sand being trod upon, sinks down and gives way by degrees, and like a malicious cheat, deludes and decoys them that come upon it, till too late, when they see the mischief they are likely to fall into, they begin to support and help one another, but without any possibility either of returning back, or escaping certain ruin; for, sinking into the gulf, they are neither able to swim (the mud preventing all motion of the body) nor in a capacity to wade out, having nothing firm to support them for that purpose; for sand and water being mixed together, the nature of both is thereby so changed, that there is neither fording, nor passing over it by boats. Being brought therefore to this pass, without the least possibility of help to be afforded them, they go together with the sand to the bottom of the gulf, at the very brink of the bog; and so the place, agreeable to its nature, is called Barathrum. </p>                        </div>

The fourth side is nearly surrounded with a vast sea, without any harbours, being a very long and tedious voyage, and very difficult to find any place of landing. For from Parcetonium in Africa, to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/320348UJop class=place long=34.752 lat=32.054>Joppa</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335360RCSy class=place long=36 lat=33.5>Coele Syria</a>, for the space almost of five thousand furlongs, there is not one safe harbour to be found, except <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299IPha class=place long=29.8856 lat=31.213>Pharus</a>. Then again all along the coasts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, the sea is full of rocks and sands, not discernible by mariners unacquainted with the places; so that when they look upon themselves as safe, and to have escaped the danger of the seas, and make with great joy to land (wanting skill to steer aright) they are on a sudden and unexpectedly shipwrecked. Others inconsiderately, because they cannot see the land, in regard it lies so low, are carried either into the bogs, or to the deserts. And in this manner is <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> naturally guarded on every side. It is of a long form or shape; that part that lies along to the sea coast stretches forth itself in length two thousand furlongs; but to the south it runs almost six thousand furlongs. It was antiently the most populous country in the world, and at this day not inferior to any. It was formerly full of famous towns, and had in it above eighteen thousand cities, as is to be seen registered in their sacred records: and in the time of <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, there were reckoned above three thousand, which remain still to this day. Once they say in a general account taken of all the inhabitants, they amounted to seven millions; and at this time are not less than three millions of people. And therefore they say that their kings by the help of such a multitude, left behind them in their great and wonderful works, eternal monuments of their state and grandeur; which we shall by and by distinctly treat of; but at present we shall speak of the nature of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, and of the property of the soil. </p>                        </div>

For it runs down from the mountains of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, till it empties itself into the sea, at least twelve thousand furlongs, accounting the several windings it makes in the way. In its course it makes many islands; amongst many others in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, one remarkable for its greatness, called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/169337UMer class=place long=33.7104 lat=16.938>Meroe</a>, two-and-twenty furlongs broad. But, in the lower places, its swelling waves grow narrower, and the current divides itself into two channels towards the continents that lie on either side the island. One of the currents bends towards Africa, and is at length swallowed up in a bed of sand of an incredible depth: the other makes its course towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>, on the other side, and falls into deep guts and vast bogs, inhabited round by divers nations; entering at last into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, it keeps no direct course, but turns and winds here and there in some places ten furlongs in breadth, in others less, sometimes running towards the east, then to the west, and sometimes back again to the south. For mountains stand on both sides the river, and take up a large tract of ground; and the river, forcing itself with great violence against strait and narrow precipices, the water is driven back, and flows over the neighbouring fields; and after it has run a considerable way towards the south, it returns at length to its natural course. And though this river is thus remarkable above all others, yet this is especially observable in it, that its stream runs calm and smooth, without any violent surges, or tempestuous waves, except at the cataracts; a place of ten furlongs being so called, running down in a precipice, in a strait and narrow passage amongst steep rocks; the whole is a rugged shelvy gulf, where there lie many great stones, like huge rocks. The water dashing violently against these rocks, is beaten back, and rebounds the contrary way, by which are made wonderful whirlpools, and by the repeated influx, the whole place is covered with froth and foam, to the no small amazement of the beholders: for the river there runs down with as quick and violent a current, as an arrow out of a bow.

The first, lying to the most eastward channel, is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/310325UPel class=place long=32.5462 lat=31.0424>Pelusium</a>, called <a href=/people/10020 target=_blank>Pelusaicum</a>; the second Taniticum; the third Mendisium; the fourth Phatniticum; the fifth <a about=https://topostext.org/place/309312USeb class=demonym long=31.24 lat=30.9641>Sebenyticum</a>; the sixth <a about=https://topostext.org/place/314304UBol class=demonym long=30.4147 lat=31.4009>Bolbitinum</a>, and the last <a href=/people/9069 target=_blank>Canopicum</a> or Herculeum, as some call it. There are some other mouths made by art, of which it is not material to write. At every of the mouths is a city built on either side of the river, defended with strong guards and bridges on each bank. From <a href=/people/10020 target=_blank>Pelusaicum</a> as far as to the <a href=/people/275 target=_blank>Arabian</a> gulf, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Red Sea</a>, is a canal cut out. <a href=/people/4226 target=_blank>Necos</a> the son of Psameticus, was the first that began this work, and after him <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=person long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> carried it on, but left it unfinished, being told by some that if be cut it through the isthmus, all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> would be drowned, for that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Red Sea</a> lay higher than <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. The last attempt was made by <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> the second, who cut a sluice across the isthmus in a more convenient place, which he opened when he had a mind to sail down that way, and then presently after shut up again; which contrivance proved very useful and serviceable. The river which runs through this cut is called <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, after the name of the maker.

For its skin is covered all over with scales of an extraordinary hardness; many sharp teeth are ranged on both sides its jaws, and two of them are much bigger than the rest. This monster does not only devour men, but other creatures that come near the river. His bites are sharp and destructive, and with his claws he tears his prey cruelly in pieces, and what wounds he makes, no medicine or application can heal. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> formerly caught these monsters with hooks, baited with raw flesh; but of later times, they have used to take them with strong nets like fishes: sometimes they strike them on the head with forks of iron, and so kill them. There is an infinite multitude of these creatures in the river and the neighbouring pools, in regard they are great breeders, and are seldom killed: for the crocodile is adored as a god by some of the inhabitants; and for strangers to hunt and destroy them is to no purpose, for their flesh is not eatable. But nature has provided relief against the increase of this destructive monster; for the ichneumon, as it is called (of the bigness of a little <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>), running up and down near the water side, breaks all the eggs laid by this beast, wherever he finds them; and that which is most to be admired is, that he does this not for food or any other advantage, but out of a natural instinct for the mere benefit of mankind. The beast called the River <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>Horse</a>, is five cubits long, four-footed, and cloven-hoofed like to an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>. He has three teeth or tushes on either side his jaw, appearing outwards larger than those of a wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>; as to his ears, tail, and his neighing, he is like a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. The whole bulk of his body is not much unlike an elephant; his skin is firmer and thicker almost than any other beast. He lives both on land and in water; in the day time he lies at the bottom of the river, and in the night time comes to land, and feeds upon grass and corn. If this beast were so fruitful as to bring forth young every year, he would undo the husbandman, and destroy a great part of the corn of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. He is likewise by the help of many hands often caught, being struck with instruments of iron; for, when he is found, they hem him round with their boats, and those on board wound him with forked instruments of iron, cast at him like so many darts; and having strong ropes to the irons, they fix them in him; they let him go till he loses his blood, and he then dies. His flesh is extraordinary hard, and of ill digestion. There is nothing in his inner parts that can be eaten, neither his bowels, nor any other of his entrails. </p>                        </div>

Its inundation begins at the summer solstice, and increases till the equinoctial in autumn; during which time, he brings in along with him new soil, and waters as well the tilled and improved ground, as that which lies waste and untilled, as long as it pleases the husbandman; for the water flowing gently and by degrees, they easily divert its course, by casting up small banks of earth; and then, by opening a passage for it, as easily turn it over their land again, if they see it needful. It is so very advantageous to the inhabitants, and done with so little pains, that most of the country people turn in their <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> into the sowed ground to eat, and tread down the corn, and four or five months after, they reap it. Some lightly run over the surface of the earth with a plow, after the water is fallen, and gain a mighty crop without any great cost or pains: but husbandry amongst all other nations, is very laborious and chargeable, only the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> gather their fruits with little cost or labour.

And in regard the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> lies low and champaign; the towns, cities, and country villages, that are built upon rising ground, (cast up by art), look like the islands of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372248RKyk class=place long=24.8 lat=37.2>Cyclades</a>. Many of the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> sometimes are by the river intercepted, and so are drowned; but those that fly to the higher grounds are preserved.

But the common people, now at liberty from all employments in the field, indulge themselves in idleness, feasting every day, and giving themselves up to all sorts of sports and pleasures.

Of the increase and springheads of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, and of its emptying itself at length into the Sea, and other properties peculiar to this river above all others, though it be the greatest in the world, yet some authors have not dared to say the least thing: some who have attempted to give their reasons, have been very wide from the mark. For as for <a href=/people/637 target=_blank>Hellanicus</a>, <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a>, <a href=/people/745 target=_blank>Hecataeus</a>, and such like ancient authors, they have told little but frothy stories, and mere fables. <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>, above all other writers, very industrious, and well acquainted with general history, made it his business to find out the causes of these things; but what he says is, notwithstanding, very doubtful, and some things seem to be repugnant and contradictory one to another. <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a> and <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>, who have the reputation of faithful historians, never so much as touch upon the description of any place in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. But <a href=/people/225 target=_blank>Ephorus</a> and <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>, though they are very earnest in this matter, yet they have not in the least discovered the truth. But it was through ignorance of the places, and not through negligence, that they were all led into error. For anciently, none of the Grecians, till the time of <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> <a href=/people/814 target=_blank>Philadelphus</a>, ever went into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, or so much as to the utmost bounds of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. For those places were never frequented by travellers, they were so hazardous, till that king marched with a Grecian army into those parts, and so made a more perfect discovery of the country. No writer hitherto has pretended that he himself ever saw, or heard of any one else that affirmed, he had seen the spring-heads of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>: all, therefore, amounting to no more than opinion and conjecture, the priests of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> affirm that it comes from the ocean, which flows round the whole earth. But nothing that they say is upon any solid grounds, and they resolve doubts by things that are more doubtful; and to prove what they say, they bring arguments that have need to be proved themselves. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195372RTro class=ethnic long=37.2 lat=19.5>Troglodites</a> (otherwise called Molgii), whom the scorching heat forced to remove from the higher parts into those lower places, say, that there are some signs, whence a man may rationally conclude, that the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> rises from streams which run from many fountains or spring-heads, and meet at last in one channel, and therefore to be the most fruitful and richest river of any that is known in the world. The inhabitants of the Isle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/169337UMer class=place long=33.7104 lat=16.938>Meroe</a> (who are most to be credited upon this account), are far from inventing so much as any probable arguments; and though they live near to the place in controversy, are so far from giving any certain account of this matter, that they call the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, <a href=/people/3348 target=_blank>Astapus</a>; which, in the Greek language, signifies water that issues out of a place of darkness; so that they give a name to the river, to denote their ignorance of the place from whence it springs. But that seems the truest reason to me, that looks to be furthest from fiction and studied contrivance. Yet I am not ignorant, that <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> who bounds <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> both on the east and west, with this river, ascribes the exact knowledge of it to the Africans, called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298200RNas class=ethnic long=20 lat=29.8>Nasamones</a>, and says, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> rises from a certain lake, and runs through a large tract of ground, down all along through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>: but, neither are the sayings of the Africans in this behalf, (as not altogether agreeable to truth), nor the affirmation of the writer, (who proves not what he says), to be of absolute credit. </p>                        </div>

Though this seems a plausible reason, yet it may be easily disproved: for if it were true what he says, then all the rivers which run into the sea against the <a href=/people/12230 target=_blank>Etesian</a> winds, would overflow in like manner; which being never known in any other part of the world, some other reason, and more agreeable to truth, must of necessity be sought for. <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a> the philosopher, ascribes the cause to the melting of the snow in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, whom the poet <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> (who was his scholar) follows, saying thus: <br />The pleasant streams of th' river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> forsakes, <br />Which flowing from the Negro's parched land. <br />Swells big when th' melting snow to th' river takes, <br />Comes falling down, and overflows the strand. <br />Neither is it any hard task to confute this opinion, since it is apparent to all, that by reason of the parching heats, there is no snow in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> at that time of the year. For in these countries there is not the least sign either of frost, cold, or any other effect of winter, especially at the time of the overflowing of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>; and suppose there be abundance of snow in the higher parts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, yet what is affirmed, is certainly false; for every river that is swelled with snow, fumes up in cold fogs, and thickens the air; but about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> only, above all other rivers, neither mists gather, nor are there any cold breezes, nor is the air gross and thick. <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> says, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> is such in its own nature, as it seems to be in the time of its increase; for that in winter, when the sun moves to the south, and runs its daily course directly over Africa, it exhales so much water out of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, that it decreases against nature; and in summer, when the sun returns to the north, the rivers of Greece, and the rivers of all other northern countries, fall and decrease; and therefore, that it is not so strange for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> about summer time to increase, and in winter to fall and grow lower. But to this it may be answered, that if the sun exhale so much moisture out of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> in winter time, it would do the like in other rivers in Africa, and so they must fall as well as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, which no where happens throughout all Africa; and therefore, this author's reason is frivolous; for the rivers of Greece rise not in the winter, by reason of the remoteness of the sun, but by reason of the great rains that fall at that time. </p>                        </div>

These vapours, he says, are driven about by the <a href=/people/12230 target=_blank>Etesian</a> winds, till they fall upon the highest mountains, which are, (as he affirms, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>), and by the violent impression they make upon the tops of these mountains, great storms and showers of rain are occasioned, which, about the time of the <a href=/people/12230 target=_blank>Etesian</a> winds, cause the river to rise. But if any will diligently observe the time and season of the year when this falls out, he may easily answer this argument; for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> begins to swell at the time of the summer solstice, when there are no <a href=/people/12230 target=_blank>Etesian</a> winds; and after the autumnal equinox, when those winds are past, it falls again. Inasmuch, therefore, as certain experience to the contrary, answers all arguments, be they ever so probable, the man's diligence and ingenuity is to be commended; but his affirmations and opinions are by no means to be relied upon. And I wave this, that it is evident that the <a href=/people/12230 target=_blank>Etesian</a> winds come as often from the west, as from the north. For not only the north-east winds, called Aparctie, but those of the north-west, called Argeste, go under the name of the <a href=/people/12230 target=_blank>Etesian</a> winds. And whereas he affirms, that the greatest mountains are in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, as it wants proof; so likewise, all grounds for credit and belief, as is evident from the thing itself. <a href=/people/225 target=_blank>Ephorus</a>, who gives the last account of the thing, endeavours to ascertain the reason, but seems not to find out the truth. The whole land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> (says he) is cast up from the river, and the soil is of a loose and spongy nature, and has in it many large cliffs and hollow places, wherein are abundance of water, which in the winter time is frozen up, and in the summer issues out on every side, like sweat from the pores, which occasions the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> to rise. This writer does not only betray his own ignorance of the nature of places in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, that he never saw them himself, but likewise, that he never was rightly informed by any that was acquainted with them. For if the overflowing of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> should proceed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> itself, it could not flow above the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, where it passes through rock and mountainous places. For, as it takes its course through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> for above the space of six thousand furlongs, it is at its full height before ever it reach <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>; and therefore, if the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> lie lower than the caverns of congested earth, those clefts and hollow places must be above, towards the superficies of the earth, in which it is impossible so much water should be contained. And if the river lie higher than those spongy caverns, it is not possible that from hollow places, much lower than the river, the water should rise higher than the river. Lastly, who can imagine that waters issuing out of holes and hollow parts of the earth, should raise the river to such a height, as to overflow almost all the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>? But I let pass this vain imagination of casting up the soil, and lodging of waters in the bowels of the earth, being so easily to be confuted. The river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376275WMae class=place long=27.4713 lat=37.622>Meander</a> hath cast up a great tract of land in Asia, whereas, at the time of the rising of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, nothing of that kind in the least can be seen. In the same manner the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383211WAch class=place long=21.1067 lat=38.3388>Achelous</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388210RAka class=place long=21 lat=38.8>Acarnania</a>, and <a href=/people/7461 target=_blank>Cephisos</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a>, which runs down from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=place long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocis</a>, have cast up great quantities of earth, by both which the writer is convicted of falsity: and indeed no man is to expect any certainty from <a href=/people/225 target=_blank>Ephorus</a>, who may be palpably discerned not to make it his business in many things to declare the truth. </p>                        </div>

For they divide the earth into three parts, one of which is that wherein we inhabit; another quite contrary to these places in the seasons of the year; the third lying between these two, which they say is uninhabitable by reason of the scorching heat of the sun; and therefore, if the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> should overflow in the winter time, it would be clear and evident, that its source would arise out of our zone, because then we have the most rain: but on the contrary, being that it rises in summer, it is very probable that in the country opposite to us it is winter time, where then there is much rain, and that those floods of water are brought down thence to us: and therefore that none can ever find out the head-springs of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, because the river has its course through the opposite zone; which is uninhabited. And the exceeding sweetness of the water, they say, is the confirmation of this opinion; for passing through the torrid zone, the water is boiled, and therefore this river is sweeter than any other in the world; for heat does naturally dulcorate water. But this reason is easily refuted; for it is plainly impossible that the river should rise to that height, and come down to us from the opposite zone; especially if it be granted that the earth is round. But if any yet shall be so obstinate as to affirm it is so as the philosophers have said, I must in short say, it is against, and contrary to the laws of nature. For, as they hold opinions which in the nature of the things can hardly be disproved, and place an inhabitable part of the world between us and them that are opposite to us, they conclude, that by this device, they have made it impossible, and out of the reach of the wit of man to confute them. But it is but just and equal, that those who affirm any thing positively, should prove what they say, either by good authority or strength of reason. How comes it about that only the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> should come down to us from the other opposite zone? Have we not other rivers that this maybe as well applied to? As to the causes alleged for the sweetness of the water, they are absurd: for if the water be boiled with the parching heat, and thereupon becomes sweet, it would have no productive quality, either of fish or other kinds of creatures and beasts: for all water whose nature is changed by fire, is altogether incapable to breed any living thing; and therefore as the nature of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> contradicts this decoction and boiling of the water, we conclude that the causes alleged of its increase are false. </p>                        </div>

But in summer time, when the waters that lie deep in the earth are no longer exhaled, then the channel of the river, according to the order of nature, fills without any obstruction. But to this it may be answered, that many rivers in Africa, whose mouths lie parallel with this river, and run the like course, yet overflow not like the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>. For on the contrary they rise in winter, and fall in summer, which clearly evinces his falsity, who endeavours with a shew of reason to oppose the truth. But to the true cause, <a href=/people/1500 target=_blank>Agatharchides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=person long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidus</a> comes nearest. For he says, that in the mountainous parts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, there are yearly continual rains from the summer solstice to the equinox in autumn, and therefore there is just cause for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> to below in the winter, which then flows only from its own natural spring-heads, and to overflow in summer through the abundance of rains. And though none hitherto have been able to give a reason for these inundations, yet he says his opinion is not altogether to be rejected; for there are many things that are contrary to the rules of nature, for which none are able to give any substantial reason. That which happens in some parts of Asia, he says, gives some confirmation to his opinion. For in the confines of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a>, near Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>, after the winter is over, he affirms, that abundance of snow falls every year for many days together: and that in the northern parts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, at certain times, there falls abundance of hail, and of an incredible bigness: and that near the river <a href=/people/216 target=_blank>Hydaspes</a>, in summer time, it rains continually; and the same happens in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> for many days together; and that this disorder of the air whirling about, occasions many storms of rain in places near adjoining; and that therefore it is no wonder if the mountainous parts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, which lies much higher than <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, are soaked with continual rains, wherewith the river being filled, overflows; especially since the natural inhabitants of the place affirm, that thus it is in their country. And though these things now related, are in their nature contrary to those in our own climate, yet we are not for that reason to disbelieve them. For with us the south wind is cloudy and boisterous, whereas in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> it is calm and clear; and that the north winds in Europe are fierce and violent, but in those regions low and almost insensible. </p>                        </div>

Because of this fact the natives, in remembrance of the usefulness of this plant, to this day, when approaching the gods, hold some of it in their hands as they pray to them; for they believe that man is a creature of swamp and marsh, basing this conclusion on the smoothness of his skin and his physical constitution, as well as on the fact that he requires a wet rather than a dry diet. 3 A second way by which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> subsisted was, they say, by the eating of fish, of which the river provided a great abundance, especially at the time when it receded after its flood and dried up. 4 They also ate the flesh of some of the pasturing animals, using for clothing the skins of the beasts that were eaten, and their dwellings they built out of reeds. And traces of these customs still remain among the herdsmen of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, all of whom, they say, have no other dwelling up to this time than one of reeds, considering that with this they are well enough provided for. 5 After subsisting in this manner over a long period of time they finally turned to the edible fruits of the earth, among which may be included the bread made from the lotus. The discovery of these is attributed by some to <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>, but by others to one of their early kings called <a href=/people/1593 target=_blank>Menas</a>. 6 The priests, however, have the story that the discoverer of the branches of learning and of the arts was <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, but that it was their kings who discovered such things as are necessary for existence; and that this was the reason why the kingship in early times was bestowed, not upon the sons of their former rulers, but upon such as conferred the greatest and most numerous benefits upon the peoples, whether it be that the inhabitants in this way sought to provoke their kings to useful service for the benefit of all, or that they have in very truth received an account to this effect in their sacred writings. </p>                        </div>

And in fact many kings have been deprived of the public burial customarily accorded them because of the opposition of the people; the result was, consequently, that the successive kings practised justice, not merely for the reasons just mentioned, but also because of their fear of the despite which would be shown their body after death and of eternal obloquy. <br />Of the customs, then, touching the early kings these are the most important. </p>                        </div>

Allowances to provide for their needs were supplied by the king, to the judges sufficient for their maintenance, and many times as much to the chief justice. 5 The latter regularly wore suspended from his neck by a golden chain a small image made of precious stones, which they called <a href=/people/819 target=_blank>Truth</a>; the hearings of the pleas commenced whenever the chief justice put on the image of <a href=/people/819 target=_blank>Truth</a>. 6 The entire body of the laws was written down in eight volumes which lay before the judges, and the custom was that the accuser should present in writing the particulars of his complaint, namely, the charge, how the thing happened, and the amount of injury or damage done, whereupon the defendant would take the document submitted by his opponents in the suit and reply in writing to each charge, to the effect either that he did not commit the deed, or, if he did, that he was not guilty of wrongdoing, or, if he was guilty of wrongdoing, that he should receive a lighter penalty. 7 After that, the law required that the accuser should reply to this in writing and that the defendant should offer a rebuttal. And after both parties had twice presented their statements in writing to the judges, it was the duty of the thirty at once to declare their opinions among themselves and of the chief justice to place the image of <a href=/people/819 target=_blank>Truth</a> upon one or the other of the two pleas which had been presented. </p>                        </div>

The same law has also been enacted by many Greek states, since they held it entirely unjust that the innocent should suffer the same punishment as the guilty, that a penalty should be exacted of two for only one transgression, and, further, that, since the crime had been actuated by an evil intention, a being as yet without intelligence should receive the same correction, and, what is the most important consideration, that in view of the fact that the guilty had been laid at the door of the pregnant mother it was by no means proper that the child, who belongs to the father as well as to the mother, should be despatched; 10 for a man may properly consider judges who spare the life of a murderer to be no worse than other judges who destroy that which is guilty of no crime whatsoever. </p>                        </div>

Thus the lawgiver at the same time made disgrace a more terrible punishment than death, in order to accustom all the people to consider dishonour the greatest of evils, and he also believed that, while dead men would never be of value to society, men who had been disgraced would do many a good deed through their desire to regain freedom of speech. In the case of those who had disclosed military secrets to the enemy the law prescribed that their tongues should be cut out, while in the case of counterfeiters or falsifiers of measures and weights or imitators of seals, and of official scribes who made false entries or erased items, and of any who adduced false documents, it ordered that both their hands should be cut off, to the end that the offender, being punished in respect of those members of his body that were the instruments of his wrongdoing, should himself keep until death his irreparable misfortune, and at the same time, by serving as a warning example to others, should turn them from the commission of similar offences. </p>                        </div>

And since the good order resulting therefrom greatly contributed to victory, they thought that the animals had been responsible for their deliverance; and so the people, wishing to show their gratitude to them, established the custom of not killing any one of the animals whose likeness had been fashioned at that time, but of rendering to them, as objects of worship, the care and honour which we have previously described. </p>                        </div>

Again, the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> is useful both for the hunt and for man's protection, and this is why they represent the god whom they call <a href=/people/1656 target=_blank>Anubis</a> with a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>'s head, showing in this way that he was the bodyguard of <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> and <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>. 3 There are some, however, who explain that <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> guided <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> during her search for <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> and protected her from wild beasts and wayfarers, and that they helped her in her search, because of the affection they bore for her, by baying; and this is the reason why at the Festival of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> the procession is led by <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>, those who introduced the rite showing forth in this way the kindly service rendered by this animal of old. 4 The <a href=/people/556 target=_blank>cat</a> is likewise useful against asps with their deadly bite and the other reptiles that sting, while the ichneumon keeps a look-out for the newly-laid seed of the crocodile and crushes the eggs left by the female, doing this carefully and zealously even though it receives no benefit from the act. 5 Were this not done, the river would have become impassable because of the multitude of beasts that would be born. And the crocodiles themselves are also killed by this animal in an astonishing and quite incredible manner; for the ichneumons roll themselves over and over in the mud, and when the crocodiles go to sleep on the land with their mouths open they jump down their mouths into the centre of their body; then, rapidly gnawing through the bowels, they get out unscathed themselves and at the same time kill their victims instantly. 6 And of the sacred birds the ibis is useful as a protector against the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a>, the locusts, and the caterpillars, and the hawk against the scorpions, horned <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a>, and the small animals of noxious bite which cause the greatest destruction of men. 7 But some maintain that the hawk is honoured because it is used as a bird of omen by the soothsayers in predicting to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> events which are to come. 8 Others, however, say that in primitive times a hawk brought to the priests in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/257326PThe class=place long=32.641 lat=25.684>Thebes</a> a book wrapped about with a purple band, which contained written directions concerning the worship of gods and the honours due to them; and it is for this reason, they add, that the sacred scribes wear on their heads a purple band and the wing of a hawk. 9 The <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> also is honoured by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/257326PThe class=ethnic long=32.641 lat=25.684>Thebans</a> because it is believed to be a royal animal and worthy of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. </p>                        </div>

Any also who are forbidden burial because of the accusations brought against them or because their bodies have been made security for a loan they lay away in their own homes; and it sometimes happens that their sons's sons, when they have become prosperous and paid off the debt or cleared them of the charges, give them later a magnificent funeral. </p>                        </div>

Another custom of theirs is to put up the bodies of their deceased parents as security for a loan; and failure to repay such debts is attended with the deepest disgrace as well as with deprivation of burial at death. 2 And a person may well admire the men who established these customs, because they strove to inculcate in the inhabitants, as far as was possible, virtuousness and excellence of character, by means not only of their converse with the living but also of their burial and affectionate care of the dead. 3 For the Greeks have handed down their beliefs in such matters — in the honour paid to the righteous and the punishment of the wicked — by means of fanciful tales and discredited legends; consequently these accounts not only cannot avail to spur their people on to the best life, but, on the contrary, being scoffed at by worthless men, are received with contempt. 4 But among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, since these matters do not belong to the realm of myth but men see with their own eyes that punishment is meted out to the wicked and honour to the good, every day of their lives both the wicked and the good are reminded of their obligations and in this way the greatest and most profitable amendment of men's characters is effected.

Now, in general, this nation is one which loves freedom and under no circumstances submits to a foreign ruler; consequently neither the kings of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> at a later time nor those of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, though the most powerful of their day, were ever able to enslave this nation. 6 For <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a> is, in general, a difficult country for a foreign army to campaign in, part of it being desert and part of it waterless and supplied at intervals with wells which are hidden and known only to the natives. 7 <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a>, however, the king of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>, taking along the ruler of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a> as an ally, made a campaign with a great army against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a> whose country bordered upon his — in those times the present city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> had not yet been founded, but there were other notable cities in <a href=/people/471 target=_blank>Babylonia</a> — and after easily subduing the inhabitants of that region because of their inexperience in the dangers of war, he laid upon them the yearly payment of fixed tributes, but the king of the conquered, whom he took captive along with his children, he put to death. 8 Then, invading <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a> in great force and laying waste some of its cities, he struck terror into the inhabitants; consequently their king <a href=/people/8968 target=_blank>Barzanes</a>, realizing that he was no match for him in battle, met him with many presents and announced that he would obey his every command. 9 But <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> treated him with great magnanimity, and agreed that he should not only continue to rule over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a> but should also, as his friend, furnish a contingent and supplies for the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> army. And as his power continually increased, he made a campaign against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a>. 10 And the king of this country, Pharnus, meeting him in battle with a formidable force, was defeated, and he both lost the larger part of his soldiers, and himself, being taken captive along with his seven sons and wife, was crucified. </p>                        </div>

The longer sides of the city were each one hundred and fifty stades in length, and the shorter ninety. 3 And so, since the total circuit comprised four hundred and eighty stades, he was not disappointed in his hope, since a city its equal, in respect to either the length of its circuit or the magnificence of its walls, was never founded by any man after his time. For the wall had a height of one hundred feet and its width was sufficient for three chariots abreast to drive upon; and the sum total of its towers was one thousand five hundred, and their height was two hundred feet. 4 He settled in it both <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>, who constituted the majority of the population and had the greatest power, and any who wished to come from all other nations.

On its shore is a precinct of a famous goddess whom the Syrians call <a href=/people/3164 target=_blank>Derceto</a>; and this goddess has the head of a woman but all the rest of her body is that of a fish, the reason being something like this. 3 The story as given by the most learned of the inhabitants of the region is as follows: <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, being offended with this goddess, inspired in her a violent passion for a certain handsome youth among her votaries; and <a href=/people/3164 target=_blank>Derceto</a> gave herself to the Syrian and bore a daughter, but then, filled with shame of her sinful deed, she killed the youth and exposed the child in a rocky desert region, while as for herself, from shame and grief she threw herself into the lake and was changed as to the form of her body into a fish; and it is for this reason that the Syrians to this day abstain from this animal and honour their fish as gods. 4 But about the region where the babe was exposed a great multitude of doves had their nests, and by them the child was nurtured in an astounding and miraculous manner; for some of the doves kept the body of the babe warm on all sides by covering it with their wings, while others, when they observed that the cowherds and other keepers were absent from the nearby steadings, brought milk therefrom in their beaks and fed the babe by putting it drop by drop between its lips. 5 And when the child was a year old and in need of more solid nourishment, the doves, pecking off bits from the cheeses, supplied it with sufficient nourishment. Now when the keepers returned and saw that the cheeses had been nibbled about the edges, they were astonished at the strange happening; they accordingly kept a look-out, and on discovering the cause found the infant, which was of surpassing beauty. 6 At once, then, bringing it to their steadings they turned it over to the keeper of the royal herds, whose name was <a href=/people/6924 target=_blank>Simmas</a>; and <a href=/people/6924 target=_blank>Simmas</a>, being childless, gave every care to the rearing of the girl, as his own daughter, and called her <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a>, a name slightly altered from the word which, in the language of the Syrians, means doves, birds which since that time all the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> have continued to honour as goddesses. </p>                        </div>

The king of the country, <a href=/people/1954 target=_blank>Oxyartes</a>, had enrolled all the men of military age, and they had been gathered to the number of four hundred thousand. 3 So taking this force with him and meeting the enemy at the passes, he allowed a division of the army of <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> to enter the country; and when he thought that a sufficient number of the enemy had debouched into the plain he drew out his own forces in battle-order.

And she, endowed as she was with understanding, daring, and all the other qualities which contribute to distinction, seized the opportunity to display her native ability. 6 First of all, then, since she was about to set out upon a journey of many days, she devised a garb which made it impossible to distinguish whether the wearer of it was a man or a woman. This dress was well adapted to her needs, as regards both her travelling in the heat, for protecting the colour of her skin, and her convenience in doing whatever she might wish to do, since it was quite pliable and suitable to a young person, and, in a word was so attractive that in later times the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, who were then dominant in Asia, always wore the garb of <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a>, as did the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> after them. 7 Now when <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a> arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=place long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactriana</a> and observed the progress of the siege, she noted that it was on the plains and at positions which were easily assailed that attacks were being made, but that no one ever assaulted the acropolis because of its strong position, and that its defender had left their posts there and were coming to aid of those who were hard pressed on the walls below. 8 Consequently, taking with her such soldiers as were accustomed to clambering up rocky heights, and making her way with them up through a certain difficult ravine, she seized a part of the acropolis and gave a signal to those who were besieging the wall down in the plain. Thereupon the defenders of the city, struck with terror at the seizure of the height, left the walls and abandoned all hope of saving themselves. </p>                        </div>

And the stones, which were set firmly together, she bonded with iron cramps, and the joints of the cramps she filled by pouring in lead. Again, before the piers on the side which would receive the current she constructed cutwaters whose sides were rounded to turn off the water and which gradually diminished to the width of the pier, in order that the sharp points of the cutwaters might divide the impetus of the stream, while the rounded sides, yielding to its force, might soften the violence of the river. 3 This bridge, then, floored as it was with beams of cedar and cypress and with palm logs of exceptional size and having a width of thirty feet, is considered to have been inferior in technical skill to none of the works of <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a>. And on each side of the river she built an expensive quay of about the same width as the walls and one hundred and sixty stades long. <br /><a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a> also built two palaces on the very banks of the river, one at each end of the bridge, her intention being that from them she might be able both to look down over the entire city and to hold the keys, as it were, to its most important sections. 4 And since the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> river passed through the centre of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> and flowed in a southerly direction, one palace faced the rising and the other the setting sun, and both had been constructed on a lavish scale. For in the case of the one which faced west she made the length of its first or outer circuit wall sixty stades, fortifying it with lofty walls, which had been built at great cost and were of burned brick. And within this she built a second, circular in form, in the bricks of which, before they were baked, wild animals of every kind had been engraved, and by the ingenious use of colours these figures reproduced the actual appearance of the animals themselves; 5 this circuit wall had a length of forty stades, a width of three hundred bricks, and a height, as <a href=/people/485 target=_blank>Ctesias</a> says, of fifty fathoms; the height of the towers, however, was seventy fathoms. 6 And she built within these two yet a third circuit wall, which enclosed an acropolis whose circumference was twenty stades in length, but the height and width of the structure surpassed the dimensions of the middle circuit wall. On both the towers and the walls there were again animals of every kind, ingeniously executed by the use of colours as well as by the realistic imitation of the several types; and the whole had been made to represent a hunt, complete in every detail, of all sorts of wild animals, and their size was more than four cubits. Among the animals, moreover, <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a> had also been portrayed, on horseback and in the act of hurling a javelin at a leopard, and nearby was her husband <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a>, in the act of thrusting his spear into a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> at close quarters. 7 In this wall she also set triple gates, two of which were of bronze and were opened by a mechanical device. <br />Now this palace far surpassed in both size and details of execution the one on the other bank of the river. For the circuit wall of the latter, made of burned brick, was only thirty stades long, and instead of the ingenious portrayal of animals it had bronze statues of <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> and <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a> and their officers, and one also of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, whom the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a> call <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a>; and on it were also portrayed both battle-scenes and hunts of every kind, which filled those who gazed thereon with varied emotions of pleasure. </p>                        </div>

The side walls of the passage-way were twenty bricks thick and twelve feet high, exclusive of the barrel-vault, and the width of the passage-way was fifteen feet. 3 And after this construction had been finished in only seven days she let the river back again into its old channel, and so, since the stream flowed above the passage-way, <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a> was able to go across from one palace to the other without passing over the river.

But the rebels, drawing up their forces in the plain before the city, overcame the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> in two battles, and they not only slew <a href=/people/9415 target=_blank>Galaemenes</a>, but of the opposing forces they cut down some in their flight, while others, who had been shut out from entering the city and forced to leap into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> river, they destroyed almost to a man. 7 So great was the multitude of the slain that the water of the stream, mingled with the blood, was changed in colour over a considerable distance.

But they occupy themselves largely with soothsaying as well, making predictions about future events, and in some cases by purifications, in others by sacrifices, and in others by some other charms they attempt to effect the averting of evil things and the fulfilment of the good. 3 They are also skilled in soothsaying by the flight of birds, and they give out interpretations of both dreams and portents. They also show marked ability in making divinations from the observation of the entrails of animals, deeming that in this branch they are eminently successful. <br />The training which they receive in all these matters is not the same as that of the Greeks who follow such practices. 4 For among the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldaeans</a> the scientific study of these subjects is passed down in the family, and son takes it over from father, being relieved of all other services in the state. Since, therefore, they have their parents for teachers, they not only are taught everything ungrudgingly but also at the same time they give heed to the precepts of their teachers with a most unwavering trust. Furthermore, since they are bred in these teachings from childhood up, they attain a great skill in them, both because of the ease with which youth is taught and because of the great amount of time which is devoted to this study. </p>                        </div>

The name of this region of the hill-country, where <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> relieved his forces of the sickness, is <a href=/people/4206 target=_blank>Meros</a>; and it is because of this fact that the Greeks have handed down to posterity in their account of this god the story that <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> was nourished in a thigh (meros). </p>                        </div>

And many generations after these events, when the excellence of these women had been noised abroad through the whole inhabited world, they say that <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, the son of <a href=/people/1123 target=_blank>Alcmene</a> and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, was assigned by <a href=/people/247 target=_blank>Eurystheus</a> the Labour of securing the girdle of <a href=/people/1735 target=_blank>Hippolyte</a> the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazon</a>. 4 Consequently he embarked on this campaign, and coming off victorious in a great battle he not only cut to pieces the army of the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a> but also, after taking captive <a href=/people/1735 target=_blank>Hippolyte</a> together with her girdle, completely crushed this nation. Consequently the neighbouring barbarians, despising the weakness of this people and remembering against them their past injuries, waged continuous wars against the nation to such a degree that they left in existence not even the name of the race of the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a>. 5 For a few years after the campaign of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> against them, they say, during the time of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> War, <a href=/people/2021 target=_blank>Penthesileia</a>, the queen of the surviving <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a>, who was a daughter of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> and had slain one of her kindred, fled from her native land because of the sacrilege.

For in the waterless region, as it is called, they have dug wells at convenient intervals and have kept the knowledge of them hidden from the peoples of all other nations, and so they retreat in a body into this region out of danger. 3 For since they themselves know about the places of hidden water and open them up, they have for their use drinking water in abundance; but such other peoples as pursue them, being in want of a watering-place by reason of their ignorance of the wells, in some cases perish because of the lack of water and in other cases regain their native land in safety only with difficulty and after suffering many ills. 4 Consequently the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabs</a> who inhabit this country, being difficult to overcome in war, remain always unenslaved; furthermore, they never at any time accept a man of another country as their over-lord and continuous to maintain their liberty unimpaired. 5 Consequently neither the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> of old, nor the kings of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, nor yet those of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> have been able to enslave them, and although they led many great forces against them, they never brought their attempts to a successful conclusion. </p>                        </div>

And a large lake is also there which produces asphalt in abundance, and from it they derive not a little revenue. 7 It has a length of about five hundred stades and a width of about sixty, and its water is so ill-smelling and so very bitter that it cannot support fish or any of the other animals which commonly live in water. And although great rivers of remarkable sweetness empty into it, the lake gets the better of them by reason of its evil smell, and from its centre it spouts forth once a year a great mass of asphalt, which sometimes extends for more than three plethra, and sometimes for only two; and when this occurs the barbarians who live about the lake usually call the larger flow a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> and to the smaller one they give the name calf. 8 Since the asphalt floats on the surface of the lake, to those who view it from a distance it takes the appearance of an island. And the fact is that the emission of the asphalt is made known to the natives twenty days before it takes place; for to a distance of many stades around the lake the odour, borne on the wind, assails them, and every piece of silver and gold and brass in the locality loses it characteristic lustre. But this returns again as soon as all the asphalt has been spouted forth; and the region round about, by reason of its being exposed to fire and to the evil odours, renders the bodies of the inhabitants susceptible to disease and makes the people very short-lived. 9 Yet the land is good for the growing of palms, wherever it happens to be traversed by rivers with usable water or to be supplied with springs which can irrigate it. And there is also found in these regions in a certain valley the balsam tree, as it is called, from which they receive a substantial revenue, since this tree is found nowhere else in the inhabited world and the use of it for medicinal purposes is most highly valued by physicians. </p>                        </div>

And since it his wings with feathers which are covered with a fine hair, and is supported upon two legs and on feet with cloven hoofs, it has the appearance of a land animal as well as of a bird. 5 But being unable by reason of its weight to raise itself in the air and to fly, it swiftly skims over the land, and when pursued by hunters on horseback with its feet it hurls stones as from a sling upon its pursuers, and with such force that they often receive severe wounds. 6 And whenever it is overtaken and surrounded, it hides its head in a bush or some such shelter, not, as some men suppose, because of its folly and stupidity of spirit, as if it thought that since it could not see the others it could not itself be seen by others either, but because its head is the weakest part of its body it seeks a shelter for it in order to save its life; 7 for Nature is an excellent instructor of all animals for the preservation not only of their own lives but also of their offspring, since by planting in them an innate love of life she leads successive generations into an eternal cycle of continued existence. </p>                        </div>

And as for the natural qualities of the dark-red stones, it is the influence of the light, as it is compressed to a greater or less degree in them when they are hardening, which, they say, accounts for their differences. 5 In like manner, it is reported, the different kinds of birds get their colouring, some kinds appearing to the eye as pure red, other kinds marked with colours of every variety one after the other; for some birds are flaming red in appearance, others saffron yellow, some emerald green, and many of the colour of gold when they turn towards the light, and, in brief, hues are produced in great variety and difficult to describe; and this same thing can be seen taking place in the case of the rainbow in the heavens by reason of the light of the sun. 6 And it is from these facts that the students of nature draw their arguments when they affirm that the variety of colouring that is put forth by the things which we have mentioned above was caused by the heat coincident with their creation which dyed them, the sun, which is the source of life, assisting in the production of each several kind. 7 And it is generally true, they continue, that of the differences in the hues of the flowers and of the varied colours of the earth the sun is the cause and creator; and the arts of mortal men, imitating the working of the sun in the physical world, impart colouring and varied hues to every object, having been instructed in this by nature. 8 For the colours, they continue, are produced by the light, and likewise the odours of the fruits and the distinctive quality of their juices, the different sizes of the animals and their several forms, and the peculiarities which the earth shows, all are generated by the heat of the sun which imparts its warmth to a fertile land and to water endowed with the generative power and thus becomes the creator of each separate thing as it is. 9 Consequently, neither white marble of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371252PPar class=place long=25.1483 lat=37.0844>Paros</a> nor any other stone which men admire can be compared with the precious stones of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>, since their whiteness is most brilliant, their weight the heaviest, and their smoothness leaves no room for other stones to surpass them. And the cause of the peculiar nature of the several parts of the country is, as I have told, the influence of the sun, which has hardened it by its heat, compressed it by its dryness, and made it resplendent by its light. </p>                        </div>

For among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a> who lived in that place there was a custom, which had been handed down from ancient times, and had been ratified by oracles of the gods, over a period of twenty generations or six hundred years, the generation being reckoned at thirty years; and at the time when the purification by means of the two men was to take place, a boat had been built for them sufficient in size and strong enough to withstand the storms at sea, one which could easily be manned by two men; and then loading it with food enough to maintain two men for six months and putting them on board they commanded them to set out to sea as the oracle had ordered. 4 Furthermore, they commanded them to steer towards the south; for, they were told, they would come to a happy island and to men of honourable character, and among them they would lead a blessed existence. And in like manner, they stated, their own people, in case the men whom they sent forth should arrive safely at the island, would enjoy peace and a happy life in every respect throughout six hundred years; but if, dismayed at the extent of the sea, they should turn back on their course they would, as impious men and destroyers of the entire nation, suffer the severest penalties. 5 Accordingly, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a>, they say, held a great festal assembly by the sea, and after offering costly sacrifices they crowned with flowers the men who were to seek out the island and effect the purification of the nation and then sent them forth. 6 And these men, after having sailed over a vast sea and been tossed about four months by storms, were carried to the island about which they had been informed beforehand; it was round in shape and had a circumference of about five thousand stades. </p>                        </div>

There is absolutely no hair on any part of their bodies except on the head, eyebrows and eyelids, and on the chin, but the other parts of the body are so smooth that not even the least down can be seen on them. 4 They are also remarkably beautiful and well-proportioned in the outline of the body. The openings of their ears are much more spacious than ours and growths have developed that serve as valves, so to speak, to close them. 5 And they have a peculiarity in regard to the tongue, partly the work of nature and congenital with them and partly intentionally brought about by artifice; among them, namely, the tongue is double for a certain distance, but they divide the inner portions still further, with the result that it becomes a double tongue as far as the base. 6 Consequently they are very versatile as to the sounds they can utter, since they imitate not only every articulate language used by man but also the varied chatterings of the birds, and, in general, they reproduce any peculiarity of sounds. And the most remarkable thing of all is that at one and the same time they can converse perfectly with two persons who fall in with them, both answering questions and discoursing pertinently on the circumstances of the moment; for with one division of the tongue they can converse with the one person, and likewise with the other talk with the second. </p>                        </div>

Now when they have gathered this they steep it in warm water until it has become the size of a pigeon's egg; then after they have crushed it and rubbed it skilfully with their hands, they mould it into loaves, which are baked and eaten, and they are of surprising sweetness. 3 There are also in the island, they say, abundant springs of water, the warm springs serving well for bathing and the relief of fatigue, the cold excelling in sweetness and possessing the power to contribute to good health. Moreover, the inhabitants give attention to every branch of learning and especially to astrology; 4 and they use letters which, according to the value of the sounds they represent, are twenty-eight in number, but the characters are only seven, each one of which can be formed in four different ways. Nor do they write their lines horizontally, as we do, but from the top to the bottom perpendicularly.

And there is also a law among them that they should live only for a stipulated number of years, and that at the completion of this period they should make away with themselves of their own accord, by a strange manner of death; for there grows among them a plant of a peculiar nature, and whenever a man lies down upon it, imperceptibly and gently he falls asleep and dies. </p>                        </div>

It also has beneath it all around its body many feet, by means of which it can move in whatever direction it pleases. 4 And the blood of this animal, they say, has a marvellous potency; for it immediately glues on to its place any living member that has been severed; even if a hand or the like should happen to have been cut off, by the use of this blood it is glued on again, provided that the cut is fresh, and the same thing is true of such other parts of the body as are not connected with the regions which are vital and sustain the person's life. 5 Each group of the inhabitants also keeps a bird of great size and of a nature peculiar to itself, by means of which a test is made of the infant children to learn what their spiritual disposition is; for they place them upon the birds, and such of them as are able to endure the flight through the air as the birds take wing they rear, but such as become nauseated and filled with consternation they cast out, as not likely either to live many years and being, besides, of no account because of their dispositions. </p>                        </div>

Now the hawk signifies to them everything which happens swiftly, since this animal is practically the swiftest of winged creatures. And the concept portrayed is then transferred, by the appropriate metaphorical transfer, to all swift things and to everything to which swiftness is appropriate, very much as if they had been named. 3 And the crocodile is a symbol of all that is evil, and the eye is the warder of justice and the guardian of the entire body. And as for the members of the body, the right hand with fingers extended signifies a procuring of livelihood, and the left with the fingers closed, a keeping and guarding of property. 4 The same way of reasoning applies also to the remaining characters, which represent parts of the body and implements and all other things; for by paying close attention to the significance which is inherent in each object and by training their minds through drill and exercise of the memory over a long period, they read from habit everything which has been written. </p>                        </div>

The priests, for instance, first choose out the noblest men from their own number, and whichever one from this group the god may select, as he is borne about in a procession in accordance with a certain practice of theirs, him the multitude take for their king; and straightway it both worships and honours him like a god, believing that the sovereignty has been entrusted to him by <a href=/people/1595 target=_blank>Divine Providence</a>. 2 And the king who has been thus chosen both follows a regimen which has been fixed in accordance with the laws and performs all his other deeds in accordance with the ancestral custom, according neither favour nor punishment to anyone contrary to the usage which has been approved among them from the beginning. It is also a custom of theirs that the king shall put no one of his subjects to death, not even if a man shall have been condemned to death and is considered deserving of punishment, but that he shall send to the transgressor one of his attendants bearing a token of death; and the guilty person, on seeing the warning, immediately retires to his home and removes himself from life. Moreover, for a man to flee from his own into a neighbouring country and thus by moving away from his native land to pay the penalty of his transgression, as is the custom among the Greeks, is permissible under no circumstances. 3 Consequently, they say, when a man to whom the token of death had been sent by the king once undertook to flee from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, and his mother, on learning of this, bound his neck about with her girdle, he dared not so much as raise his hands against her in any way but submitted to be strangled until he died, that he might not leave a greater disgrace to his kinsmen. </p>                        </div>

For the priests at Meroe who spend their time in the worship of the gods and the rites which do them honour, being the greatest and most powerful order, whenever the idea comes to them, dispatch a messenger to the king with orders that he die. 2 For the gods, they add, have revealed this to them, and it must be that the command of the immortals should in no wise be disregarded by one of mortal frame. And this order they accompany with other arguments, such as are accepted by a simple-minded nature, which has been bred in a custom that is both ancient and difficult to eradicate and which knows no argument that can be set in opposition to commands enforced by no compulsion. 3 Now in former times the kings would obey the priests, having been overcome, not by arms nor by force, but because their reasoning powers had been put under a constraint by their very superstition; but during the reign of the second <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> the king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a>, Ergamenes, who had had a Greek education and had studied philosophy, was the first to have the courage to disdain the command. 4 For assuming a spirit which became the position of a king he entered with his soldiers into the unapproachable place where stood, as it turned out, the golden shrine of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a>, put the priests to the sword, and after abolishing this custom thereafter ordered affairs after his own will. </p>                        </div>

For the earth is naturally black and contains seams and veins of a marble which is unusually white and in brilliancy surpasses everything else which shines brightly by its nature, and here the overseers of the labour in the mines work recover the gold with the aid of a multitude of workers. 2 For the kings of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> gather together and condemn to the mining of the gold such as have been found guilty of some crime and captives of war, as well as those who have been accused unjustly and thrown into prison because of their anger, and not only such persons but occasionally all their relatives as well, by this means not only inflicting punishment upon those found guilty but also securing at the same time great revenues from their labours. 3 And those who have been condemned in this way — and they are a great multitude and are all bound in chains — work at their task unceasingly both by day and throughout the entire night, enjoying no respite and being carefully cut off from any means of escape; since guards of foreign soldiers who speak a language different from theirs stand watch over them, so that not a man, either by conversation or by some contact of a friendly nature, is able to corrupt one of his keepers. 4 The gold-bearing earth which is hardest they first burn with a hot fire, and when they have crumbled it in this way they continue the working of it by hand; and the soft rock which can yield to moderate effort is crushed with a sledge by myriads of unfortunate wretches. 5 And the entire operations are in charge of a skilled worker who distinguishes the stone and points it out to the labourers; and of those who are assigned to this unfortunate task the physically strongest break the quartz-rock with iron hammers, applying no skill to the task, but only force, and cutting tunnels through the stone, not in a straight line but wherever the seam of gleaming rock may lead. 6 Now these men, working in darkness as they do because of the bending and winding of the passages, carry lamps bound on their foreheads; and since much of the time they change the position of their bodies to follow the particular character of the stone they throw the blocks, as they cut them out, on the ground; and at this task they labour without ceasing beneath the sternness and blows of an overseer. </p>                        </div>

These branches being by their nature suited to their need, the natives close up the passages and outlets with heaps of great stones, and by means of these, as if with nets, they carry on the catching of the fish. 4 For whenever the flood-tide of the sea sweeps violently over the land, which happens twice daily and usually about the third and ninth hour, the sea covers in its flood all the rocky shore and together with the huge and violent billow carries to the land an incredible multitude of fish of every kind, which at first remain along the coast, wandering in search of food among the sheltered spots and hollow places; but whenever the time of ebb comes, the water flows off little by little through the heaps of rocks and ravines, but the fish are left behind in the hollow places. 5 At this moment the multitude of the natives with their children and women gather, as if at a single word of command, at the rocky shores. And the barbarians, dividing into several companies, rush in bands each to its respective place with a hideous shouting, as if they had come unexpectedly upon some prey. 6 Thereupon the women and children, seizing the smaller fish which are near the shore, throw them on the land, and the men of bodily vigour lay hands upon the fish which are hard to overcome because of their size; for there are driven out of the deep creatures of enormous size, not only sea-scorpions and sea-eels and dogfish, but also <a href=/people/10989 target=_blank>seals</a> and many other kinds which are strange both in appearance and in name. 7 These animals they subdue without the assistance of any skilful device of weapons but by piercing them through with sharp goathorns and by gashing them with the jagged rocks; for necessity teaches Nature everything, as Nature, in her own fashion, by seizing upon the opportunities which lie at hand adapts herself to their hoped-for utilization. </p>                        </div>

And since these stones are red-hot because of the very great heat, they leave the fish there for only a short time and then turn them over, and then, picking them up bodily by the tail, they shake them. 2 And the meat, which has become tender by reason of the warmth, falls away, but backbones are cast into a single spot and form a great heap, being collected for a certain use of which we shall speak a little later. Then placing the meat upon a smooth stone they carefully tread upon it for a sufficient length of time and mix with it the fruit of the Christ's thorn; 3 for when this has been thoroughly worked into the meat the whole of it becomes a glutinous mass, and it would appear that this takes the place among them of a relish. Finally, when this has been well trodden, they mould it into little oblong bricks and place them in the sun; and after these have become thoroughly dry they sit down and feast upon them, eating not according to any measure or weight but according to every man's own wish, inasmuch as they make their physical desire the bounds of their indulgence. 4 For they have at all times stores which are unfailing and ready for use, as though <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> had assumed the task of <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>. <br />But at times a tidal wave of such size rolls in from the sea upon the land, a violent wave that for many days submerges the rocky shores, that no one can approach those regions. 5 Consequently, being short of food at such times, they at first gather the mussels, which are of so great a size that some of them are found that weigh four minas; that is, they break their shells by throwing huge stones at them and then eat the meat raw, its taste resembling somewhat that of oysters. 6 And whenever it comes to pass that the ocean is high for a considerable period because of the continued winds, and the impossibility of coping with that state of affairs prevents them from making their usual catch of fish, they turn, as has been said, to the mussels. But if the food from the mussels fails them, they have recourse to the heap of backbones; 7 that is, they select from this heap such backbones as are succulent and fresh and take them apart joint by joint, and then they grind some at once with their teeth, though the hard ones they first crush with rocks and thus prepare them before they eat them, their level of life being much the same as that of the wild beasts which make their homes in dens. </p>                        </div>

As for their children, the women carry the babies continually in their arms, but the fathers do this after they have been separated from their milk, while those above five years of age lead the way accompanied by their parents, playing as they go and full of joy, as though they were setting out for pleasure of the sweetest kind. 4 For the nature of this people, being as yet unperverted, considers the satisfying of their need to be the greatest possible good, desiring in addition none of the imported pleasures. And so soon as they arrive at the watering-places of the pastoral folk and have their bellies filled with the water, they return, scarcely able to move because of the weight of it. 5 On that day they taste no food, but everyone lies gorged and scarcely able to breathe, quite like a drunken man. The next day, however, they turn again to the eating of the fish; and their way of living follows a cycle after this fashion throughout their lives. <br />Now the inhabitants of the coast inside the Straits lead the kind of life which has been described, and by reason of the simplicity of their food they rarely are subject to attacks of disease, although they are far shorter-lived than the inhabitants of our part of the world. </p>                        </div>

Indeed when a man drew his sword and brandished it at them they did not turn to flight, nor, if they were subjected to insult or even to blows, would they show irritation, and the majority were not moved to anger in sympathy with the victims of such treatment; on the contrary, when at times children or women were butchered before their eyes they remained insensible in their attitudes, displaying no sign of anger or, on the other hand, of pity. 6 In short, they remained unmoved in the face of the most appalling horrors, looking steadfastly at what was taking place and nodding their heads at each incident.

Likewise with respect to their lairs and the safety of their offspring these two kinds of beings place the greatest faith in one another; for the association with animals of a different species continues without any wrongdoing and with peace and complete observance of propriety. Now this manner of life, strange as it is, has been observed by these tribes from very early times, whether it has been fashioned by habit over the long space of time or by a need imposed by necessity because of stress of circumstances. </p>                        </div>

Olive trees grow about these regions in very great numbers and their roots are washed by the sea, but they bear thick foliage and a fruit which resembles the sweet chestnut. 4 These trees they interlace, forming in this way a continuous shade, and live in tents of this peculiar kind; for passing their days as they do on land and in the water at the same time, they lead a pleasurable life, since they avoid the sun by means of the shade cast by the branches and offset the natural heat of the regions with the continual washing of the waves against them, giving their bodies comfort and ease by the pleasant breezes which blow about them. <br />We must speak also about the fourth kind of habitation. 5 From time immemorial there has been heaped up a quantity of seaweed of tremendous proportions, resembling a mountain, and this has been so compacted by the unceasing pounding of the waves that it has become hard and intermingled with sand. Accordingly, the natives dig in these heaps tunnels the height of a man, leaving the upper portion for a roof, and in the lower part they construct passage-ways connected with each other by borings. As they cool themselves in these tunnels they free themselves from all troubles, and leaping forth from them at the times when the waves pour over the shore they busy themselves with the catching of the fish; then, when the ebb-tide sets in, they flee back together into these same passage-ways to feast upon their catch. 6 Their dead, moreover, they bury by leaving the bodies just as they are cast out at the ebb of the tide, and then when the flood-tide sets in they cast the bodies into the sea. Consequently, by making their own interment a nutriment of the fish, they have a life which follows in singular fashion a continuous cycle throughout all eternity. </p>                        </div>

And throughout the entire construction there are doors which are fixed close together and resemble basket-work in the way they are woven, but are furnished with hinges that easily yield to movements of the water in either direction. These doors are opened by the waves as they roll towards the shore at the time of flood-tide, and are closed at ebb-tide as they surge back. 3 Consequently it comes about that every day, when the sea is at flood-tide, the fish are carried in from the deep water with the tide and pass inside through the doors, but when the sea recedes they are unable to pass with the water through the interwoven reeds. As a result it is possible at times to see beside the ocean heaps being formed of gasping fish, which are being picked up unceasingly by those who have been appointed to this work, who have from their catch subsistence in abundance as well as large revenues. 4 And some of the inhabitants of these parts, because the country is both like a plain and low-lying, dig wide ditches leading from the sea over a distance of many stades to their private estates, and setting wicker gates at their openings they open these when the flood-tide is coming inland and close them when the tide changes to the opposite direction.

But as soon as he leans against the tree with his entire weight he at once rolls to the ground along with the tree, and after his fall he remains there lying on his back the night through, since the nature of his body is not fashioned for rising. 4 Then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a> who have sawn the tree gather at dawn, and when they have slain the beast without danger to themselves they pitch their tents at the place and remain there until they have consumed the fallen animal. </p>                        </div>

Its head is weak and small, but it has powerful thighs and legs and its foot is cloven. 3 It is unable to fly in the air because of its weight, but it runs more swiftly than any other animal, barely touching the earth with the tips of its feet; and especially when it raises its wings adown the blasts of the wind it makes off like a ship under full sail; and it defends itself against its pursuers by means of its feet, hurling, as if from a sling, in an astonishing manner, stones as large as can be held in the hand. 4 But when it is pursued at a time of calm, its wings quickly collapse, it is unable to make use of the advantages given it by nature, and being easily overtaken it is made captive. 5 And since these animals abound in the land in multitude beyond telling, the barbarians devise every manner of scheme whereby to take them; moreover, since they are easily caught in large numbers, their meat is used for food and their skins for clothing and bedding. 6 But being constantly warred upon by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a> known as Simi, they are in daily peril from their attackers, and they use as defensive weapons the horns of gazelles; these horns, being large and sharp, are of great service and are found in abundance throughout the land by reason of the multitude of the animals which carry them. </p>                        </div>

For along the border of their land over many stades there extends a ravine of considerable depth and width; this they fill with wood from the forests, which is found in plenty in their land; and then, when the winds blow which we have mentioned and the clouds of the locusts approach, they divide among themselves the whole extent of the ravine and set fire to the brush in it. 3 And since a great volume of pungent smoke rises, the locusts, as they fly over the ravine, are choked by the pungency of the smoke and fall to the ground after they have flown through it only a short space, and as the destruction of them continues over several days, great heaps of them are raised up; moreover, since the land contains a great amount of brine, all the people bring this to the heaps, after they have been gathered together, soak them to an appropriate degree with the brine and thus both give the locusts a palatable taste and make their storage free from rot and lasting for a long time. 4 Accordingly, the food of this people, at the moment and thereafter, consists of these animals; for they possess no herds nor do they live near the sea nor do they have at hand any other resources; and light in body and very swift of foot as they are, they are also altogether short-lived, the oldest among them not exceeding forty years of age. </p>                        </div>

And the person so affected is at first irritated by a kind of itching and insists on scratching himself a bit, the disease at this point offering a satisfaction combined with pain; but after this stage the animals, which have been continuously engendered more and more in the body, break out to the surface and there is a heavy discharge of a thin humour, the sting of which is quite unbearable. 7 Consequently the man who is in the grip of the disease lacerates himself with his nails the more violently, groaning and moaning deeply.

Moreover, whenever any man puts any food into a bronze vessel along with water and sets it in the sun, it quickly boils without fire or wood. 5 Nevertheless, the inhabitants of both the lands which we have mentioned, far from desiring to escape from the excessive evils which befall them, actually, on the contrary, give up their lives of their own accord simply to avoid being compelled to make trial of a different fare and manner of life. 6 Thus it is that every country to which a man has grown accustomed holds a kind of spell of its own over him, and the length of time which he has spent there from infancy overcomes the hardship which he suffers from its climate. 7 And yet countries so different in both ways are separated by no great interval of space. For from Lake <a about=https://topostext.org/place/460370WMai class=place long=37 lat=46>Maeotis</a>, near which certain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> dwell, living in the midst of frost and excessive cold, many sailors of merchant vessels, running before a favourable wind, have made <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a> in ten days, from which they have reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> in four, and from that city many men, sailing by way of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, have reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> in ten, so that from the cold parts of the inhabited world to its warmest parts the sailing time is not more than twenty-four days, if the journey is made without a break. 8 Consequently, the difference in climates in a slight interval being so great, it is nothing surprising that both the fare and the manners of life as well as the bodies of the inhabitants should be very different from such as prevail among us. </p>                        </div>

At the tip of its nostrils it carries a horn which may be described as snub and in hardness is like iron. 3 Since it is ever contesting with the elephant about pasturage it sharpens its horn on stones, and when it opens the fight with this animal it slips under its belly and rips open the flesh with its horn as with a sword. By adopting this kind of fighting it drains the blood of the beasts and kills many of them. But if the elephant has avoided the attempt of the rhinoceros to get under his belly and has seized it beforehand with his trunk, he easily overcomes it by goring it with its tusks and making use of its superior strength. </p>                        </div>

For when certain writers state that they have seen some one hundred cubits long, it may justly be assumed, not only by us but by everybody else, that they are telling a falsehood; indeed they add to this tale, which is utterly distrusted, things far more astonishing, when they say that, since the country is flat like a plain, whenever the largest of these beasts coil themselves up, they make, by the coils which have been wound in circles and rest one upon another, elevations which seen from a distance resemble a hill. 2 Now a man may not readily agree as to the magnitude of the beasts of which we have just spoken; but we shall describe the largest beasts which have actually been seen and were brought to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> in certain well-made receptacles, and shall add a detailed description of the manner in which they were captured. <br />The second <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, who was passionately fond of the hunting of elephants and gave great rewards to those who succeeded in capturing against odds the most valiant of these beasts, expending on this hobby great sums of money, not only collected great herds of war-elephants, but also brought to the knowledge of the Greeks other kinds of animals which had never before been seen and were objects of amazement. 4 Consequently certain of the hunters, observing the princely generosity of the king in the matter of the rewards he gave, rounding up a considerable number decided to hazard their lives and to capture one of the huge <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> and bring it alive to <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>. 5 Great and astonishing as was the undertaking, fortune aided their designs and crowned their attempt with the success which it deserved. For they spied one of the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a>, thirty cubits long, as it loitered near the pools in which the water collects; here it maintained for most of the time its coiled body motionless, but at the appearance of an animal which came down to the spot to quench its thirst it would suddenly uncoil itself, seize the animal in its jaws, and so entwine in its coil the body of the creature which had come into view that it could in no wise escape its doom. And so, since the beast was long and slender and sluggish in nature, hoping that they could master it with nooses and ropes, they approached it with confidence the first time, having ready to hand everything which they might need; 6 but as they drew near it they constantly grew more and more terrified as they gazed upon its fiery eye and its tongue darting out in every direction, caught the hideous sound made by the roughness of its scales as it made its way through the trees and brushed against them, and noted the extraordinary size of its teeth, and the astonishing height of its heap of coils. 7 Consequently, after they had driven the colour from their cheeks through fear, with cowardly trembling they cast the nooses about its tail; but the beast, the moment the rope touched its body, whirled around with so mighty a hissing as to frighten them out of their wits, and raising itself into the air above the head of the foremost man it seized him in its mouth and ate his flesh while he still lived, and the second it caught from a distance with a coil as it fled, drew him to itself, and winding itself about him began squeezing his belly with its tightening bond; and as for all the rest, stricken with terror they sought their safety in flight. </p>                        </div>

Now the company of men who had assembled for the hunt did not dare to draw near it, being warned by the mishaps which had befallen them on the former occasion, but shooting at it from afar, and with many hands aiming at a single target, and a large one at that, they kept hitting it, and when the horsemen appeared and the multitude of bold fighting-<a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>, and then again when the trumpets blared, they got the animal terrified. Consequently, when it retreated to its accustomed lair, they closed in upon it, but only so far as not to arouse it still more. 4 And when it came near the opening which had been stopped up, the whole throng, acting together, raised a mighty din with their arms and thus increased its confusion and fear because of the crowds which put in their appearance and of the trumpets. But the beast could not find the opening and so, terrified at the advance of the hunters, fled for refuge into the mouth of the net which had been prepared near by. 5 And when the woven net began to be filled up as the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> uncoiled itself, some of the hunters anticipated its movements by leaping forward, and before the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> could turn about to face the entrance they closed and fastened with ropes the mouth, which was long and had been shrewdly devised with such swiftness of operation in mind; then they hauled out the woven net and putting rollers under it drew it up into the air. 6 But the beast, enclosed as it was in a straitened place, kept sending forth an unnatural and terrible hissing and tried to pull down with its teeth the reeds which enveloped it, and by twisting itself in every direction created the expectation in the minds of the men who were carrying it that it would leap out of the contrivance which enveloped it. Consequently, in terror, they set the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> down on the ground, and by jabbing it about tail they diverted the attention of the beast from its work of tearing with its teeth to its sensation of pain in the parts which hurt. </p>                        </div>

But as for the parts of the inhabited world which lie to the far north and border on the area which is uninhabited because of the cold, we shall discuss them when we record the deeds of Gaius <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; 3 for he it was who extended the Roman Empire the farthest into those parts and brought it about that all the area which had formerly been unknown came to be included in a narrative of history; 4 but the <a href=/people/275 target=_blank>Arabian</a> Gulf, as it is called, opens into the ocean which lies to the south, and its innermost recess, which stretches over a distance of very many stades in length, is enclosed by the farthermost borders of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195372RTro class=demonym long=37.2 lat=19.5>Trogodyte</a> country. Its width at the mouth and at the innermost recess is about sixteen stades, but from the harbour of Panormus to the opposite mainland is a day's run for a warship. And its greatest width is at the Tyrcaeus mountain and <a href=/people/4593 target=_blank>Macaria</a>, an island out at sea, the mainlands there being out of sight of each other. But from this point the width steadily decreases more and more and continually tapers as far as the entrance. 5 And as a man sails along the coast he comes in many places upon long islands with narrow passages between them, where the current rises full and strong. Such, then, is the setting, in general terms, of this gulf. But for our part, we shall make our beginning with the farthest regions of the innermost recess and then sail along its two sides past the mainlands, in connection with which we shall describe what is peculiar to them and most deserving of discussion; and first of all we shall take the right side, the coast of which is inhabited by tribes of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195372RTro class=ethnic long=37.2 lat=19.5>Trogodytes</a> as far inland as the desert. </p>                        </div>

And after a man has passed these waters, above a great plain there towers a mountain whose colour is like ruddle and blinds the sight of any who gaze steadfastly upon it for some time. Moreover, at the edge of the skirts of the mountain there lies a harbour, known as <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>'s Harbour, which has a winding entrance. 2 Above this harbour are situated three islands, two of which abound in olive trees and are thickly shaded, while one falls short of the other two in respect of the number of these trees but contains a multitude of the birds called <a href=/people/7955 target=_blank>Meleagrides</a>. 3 Next there is a very large gulf which is called Acathartus, and by it is an exceedingly long peninsula, over the narrow neck of which men transport their ships to the opposite sea. 4 And as a man coasts along these regions he comes to an island which lies at a distance out in the open sea and stretches for a length of eighty stades; the name of it is <a href=/people/9939 target=_blank>Ophiodes</a> and it was formerly full of fearful <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a> of every variety, which was in fact the reason why it received this name, but in later times the kings at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> have laboured so diligently on the reclaiming of it that not one of the animals which were formerly there is any longer to be seen on the island. <br />However, we should not pass over the reason why the kings showed diligence in the reclamation of the island. For there is found on it the topaz, as it is called, which is a pleasing transparent stone, similar to glass, and of a marvellous golden hue. 6 Consequently no unauthorized person may set foot upon the island and it is closely guarded, every man who has approached it being put to death by the guards who are stationed there. And the latter are few in number and lead a miserable existence. For in order to prevent any stone being stolen, not a single boat is left on the island; furthermore, any who sail by pass along it at a distance because of their fear of the king; and the provisions which are brought to it are quickly exhausted and there are absolutely no other provisions in the land. 7 Consequently, whenever only a little food is left, all the inhabitants of the village sit down and await the arrival of the ship of those who are bringing the provisions, and when these are delayed they are reduced to their last hopes. 8 And the stone we have mentioned, being found in the rock, is not discernible during the day because of the stifling heat, since it is overcome by the brilliance of the sun, but when night falls it shines in the dark and is visible from afar, in whatever place it may be. 9 The guards on the island divide these places by lot among themselves and stand watch over them, and when the stone shines they put around it, to mark the place, a vessel corresponding in size to the chunk of stone which gives out the light; and when day comes and they go their rounds they cut out the area which has been so marked and turn it over to men who are able by reason of their craftsmanship to polish it properly. </p>                        </div>

Then there appear mountains of all manner of peculiarities until one comes to the Harbour of <a href=/people/2936 target=_blank>Soteria</a>, as it is called, which gained this name from the first Greek sailors who found safety there. 2 From this region onwards the gulf begins to become contracted and to curve toward <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>. And here it is found that the nature of the country and of the sea has altered by reason of the peculiar characteristic of the region; 3 for the mainland appears to be low as seen from the sea, no elevation rising above it, and the sea, which runs to shoals, is found to have a depth of no more than three fathoms, while in colour it is altogether green. The reason for this is, they say, not because the water is naturally of that colour, but because of the mass of seaweed and tangle which shows from under water. 4 For ships, then, which are equipped with oars the place is suitable enough, since it rolls along no wave from a great distance and affords, furthermore, fishing in the greatest abundance; but the ships which carry the elephants, being of deep draft because of their weight and heavy by reason of their equipment, bring upon their crews great and terrible dangers. 5 For running as they do under full sail and often times being driven during the night before the force of the winds, sometimes they will strike against rocks and be wrecked or sometimes run aground on slightly submerged spits. The sailors are unable to go over the sides of the ship because the water is deeper than a man's height, and when in their efforts to rescue their vessel by means of their punting-poles they accomplish nothing, they jettison everything except their provisions; but if even by this course they do not succeed in effecting an escape, they fall into great perplexity by reason of the fact that they can make out neither an island nor a promontory nor another ship near at hand; — for the region is altogether inhospitable and only at rare intervals do men cross it in ships. 6 And to add to these evils the waves within a moment's time cast up such a mass of sand against the body of the ship and heap it up in so incredible a fashion that it soon piles up a mound round about the place and binds the vessel, as if of set purpose, to the solid land. </p>                        </div>

But when such god-sent aid has not been vouchsafed to them and their food fails, then the strong cast the weaker into the sea in order that for the few left the remaining necessities of life may last a greater number of days. But finally, when they have blotted out of their minds all their hopes, these perish by a more miserable fate than those who had died before; for whereas the latter in a moment's time returned to Nature the spirit which she had given them, these parcelled out their death into many separate hardships before they finally, suffering long-protracted tortures, were granted the end of life. 8 As for the ships which have been stripped of their crews in this pitiable fashion, there they remain for many years, like a group of cenotaphs, embedded on every side in a heap of sand, their masts and yard-arms si standing aloft, and they move those who behold them from afar to pity and sympathy for the men who have perished. For it is the king's command to leave in place such evidences of disasters that they may give notice to sailors of the region which works to their destruction. 9 And among the <a href=/people/9557 target=_blank>Ichthyophagi</a> who dwell near by has been handed down a tale which has preserved the account received from their forefathers, that once, when there was a great receding of the sea, the entire area of the gulf which has what may be roughly described as the green appearance became land, and that, after the sea had receded to the opposite parts and the solid ground in the depths of it had emerged to view, a mighty flood came back upon it again and returned the body of water to its former place. </p>                        </div>

Moreover, it is checkered by great plains as well, which bear mallows, cress, and palms, all of unbelievable size; and it also brings forth fruits of every description, which have an insipid taste and are unknown among us. 3 That part which stretches towards the interior is full of elephants and wild <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> and <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> and many other powerful wild beasts of every description.

It is called the Palm-grove and contains a multitude of trees of this kind which are exceedingly fruitful and contribute in an unusual degree to enjoyment and luxury. 3 But all the country round about is lacking in springs of water and is fiery hot because it slopes to the south; accordingly, it was a natural thing that the barbarians made sacred the place which was full of trees and, lying as it did in the midst of a region utterly desolate, supplied their food. And indeed not a few springs and streams of water gush forth there, which do not yield to snow in coldness; and these make the land on both sides of them green and altogether pleasing. 4 Moreover, an altar is there built of hard stone and very old in years, bearing an inscription in ancient letters of an unknown tongue. The oversight of the sacred precinct is in the care of a man and a woman who hold the sacred office for life.

And a natural sweet odour pervades the entire land because practically all the things which excel in fragrance grow there unceasingly. 2 Along the coast, for instance, grow balsam, as called, and cassia and a certain other herb possessing a nature peculiar to itself; for when fresh it is most pleasing and delightful to the eye, but when kept for a time it suddenly fades to nothing. 3 And throughout the interior of land there are thick forests, in which are great trees which yield frankincense and myrrh, as well as palms and reeds, cinnamon trees and every other kind which possesses a sweet odour as these have; for it is impossible to enumerate both the peculiar properties and natures of each one severally because of the great volume and the exceptional richness of the fragrance as it is gathered from each and all. 4 For a divine thing and beyond the power of words to describe seems the fragrance which greets the nostrils and stirs the senses of everyone. Indeed, even though those who sail along this coast may be far from the land, that does not deprive them of a portion of the enjoyment which this fragrance affords; for in the summer season, when the wind is blowing off shore, one finds that the sweet odours exhaled by the myrrh-bearing and other aromatic trees penetrate to the near-by parts of the sea; and the reason is that the essence of the sweet-smelling herbs is not, as with us, kept laid away until it has become old and stale, but its potency is in the full bloom of its strength and fresh, and penetrates to the most delicate parts of the sense of smell. 5 And since the breeze carries the emanation of the most fragrant plants, to the voyagers who approach the coast there is wafted a blending of perfumes, delightful and potent, and healthful withal and exotic, composed as it is of the best of them, seeing that the product of the trees has not been minced into bits and so has exhaled its own special strength, nor yet lies stored away in vessels made of a different substance, but taken at the very prime of its freshness and while its divine nature keeps the shoot pure and undefiled. Consequently those who partake of the unique fragrance feel that they are enjoying the ambrosia of which the myths relate, being unable, because of the superlative sweetness of the perfume, to find any other name that would be fitting and worthy of it. </p>                        </div>

The third group, however, obeying no king and taking no account or even thought of justice, makes robbery its constant practice, and attacking unexpectedly from out of the desert it seizes whatever it has happened upon and quickly withdraws to the place from which it had set out. 3 All the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> of this third group lead a life like that of the wild beasts, spending their days under the open sky and practising the savage in their mode of life; for they have nothing to do with civilized food or clothing, but cover their bodies with the skins of <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>. Their leaders have no cities whatsoever, but only towers near the sources of water, and into these they bring and store away the excess of their booty. Of the peoples who are their subjects they annually exact an oath of obedience to their authority, and to any who have submitted to them they extend their protection as being allies, and such as take no heed of them they first condemn to death and then make war upon them as robbers. 4 Their weapons are appropriate to both the country and their mode of life; for since they are light of body and inhabit a country which is for the most part a level plain, they face the dangers which beset them armed with three spears and stones in leather bags; and they carry neither sword nor helmet nor any other armour, since their aim is to excel in agility both in pursuit and again in withdrawal. 5 Consequently they are expert in running and hurling stones, having brought to full development by practice and habit the advantages accorded them by nature. And, speaking generally, they observe neither justice nor good faith in any respect in dealing with peoples of alien race. </p>                        </div>

Yet it is all these things which are wont, they explain, to generate beginnings, as it were, and gatherings of air-currents. 3 Consequently, when so stifling an atmosphere extends over the arid land the phenomenon which we observe taking place now and then with respect to the clouds on humid days, when every kind of shape is formed, occurs likewise in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, they tell us, the air as it condenses assuming manifold shapes. Now this air is driven along by the weak and sluggish breezes, rising aloft and making quivering motions and impinging upon other bodies of similar character, but when a calm succeeds, it then descends towards the earth by reason of its weight and in the shape which it may chance to have assumed, whereupon, there being nothing to dissipate it, the air clings to such living creatures as accidentally come to be in the way. 4 As for the movements which these shapes make in both directions, these, they say, indicate no volition on their part, since it is impossible that voluntary flight or pursuit should reside in a soulless thing. And yet the living creatures are, unknown to themselves, responsible for this movement through the air; for, if they advance, they push up by their violent motion the air which lies beneath them, and this is the reason why the image which has been formed retreats before them and gives the impression of fleeing; whereas if the living creatures withdraw, they follow in the opposite direction, the cause having been reversed, since that which is empty and rarefied draws the shapes towards itself. 5 Consequently it has the appearance of pursuing men who withdraw before it, for the image is drawn to the empty space and rushes forward in a mass under the influence of the backward motion of the living creature; and as for those who flee, it is quite reasonable that, whether they turn about or stand still, their bodies should feel the light touch of the image which follows them; and this is broken in pieces as it strikes upon the solid object, and as it pours itself out in all directions it chills the bodies of all with whom it comes in contact. </p>                        </div>

For it was the custom among them that the women should practise the arts of war and be required to serve in the army for a fixed period, during which time they maintained their virginity; then, when the years of their service in the field had expired, they went in to the men for the procreation of children, but they kept in their hands the administration of the magistracies and of all the affairs of the state. 2 The men, however, like our married women, spent their days about the house, carrying out the orders which were given them by their wives; and they took no part in military campaigns or in office or in the exercise of free citizenship in the affairs of the community by virtue of which they might become presumptuous and rise up against the women. 3 When their children were born the babies were turned over to the men, who brought them up on milk and such cooked foods as were appropriate to the age of the infants; and if it happened that a girl was born, its breasts were seared that they might not develop at the time of maturity; for they thought that the breasts, as they stood out from the body, were no small hindrance in warfare; and in fact it is because they have been deprived of their breasts that they are called by the Greeks <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a>. </p>                        </div>

For some have handed down the story that there was but one <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, others that there were three, and there are those who state that there was never any birth of him in human form whatsoever, and think that the word <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> means only the gift of wine (oinou dosis). 3 For this reason we shall endeavour to run over briefly only the main facts as they are given by each writer. <br />Those authors, then, who use the phenomena of nature to explain this god and call the fruit of the vine <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> speak like this: The earth brought forth of itself the vine at the same time with the other plants and it was not originally planted by some man who discovered it. 4 And they allege as proof of this fact that to this day vines grow wild in many regions and bear fruit quite similar to that of plants which are tended by the experienced hand of man. </p>                        </div>

Again, the account of his members, which the earth-born treated with despite, being brought together again and restored to their former natural state, shows forth that the vine, which has been stripped of its fruit and pruned at the yearly seasons, is restored by the earth to the high level of fruitfulness which it had before.

The force was divided into two parts, the men having <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> as their general and the women being under the command of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, and coming with their army upon the <a href=/people/206 target=_blank>Titans</a> they joined battle. The struggle having proved sharp and many having fallen on both sides, <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronus</a> finally was wounded and victory lay with <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, who had distinguished himself in the battle. 5 Thereupon the <a href=/people/206 target=_blank>Titans</a> fled to the regions which had once been possessed by <a href=/people/577 target=_blank>Ammon</a>, and <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> gathered up a multitude of captives and returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000LNys class=place long=33.975 lat=28.539>Nysa</a>.

And so, four generations after that time, when <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> was being entertained as a guest, Pholus recalled the orders of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>. 4 Now when the jar had been opened and the sweet odour of the wine, because of its great age and strength, came to the <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a> dwelling near there, it came to pass that they were driven mad; consequently they rushed in a body to the dwelling of Pholus and set about plundering him of the wine in a terrifying manner. </p>                        </div>

He had indeed to struggle with beings who were gods on their mother's side, who possessed the swiftness of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, who had the strength of two bodies, and enjoyed in addition the experience and wisdom of men. The <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a> advanced upon him, some with pine trees which they had plucked up together with the roots, others with great rocks, some with burning firebrands, and still others with axes such as are used to slaughter <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>. 6 But he withstood them without sign of fear and maintained a battle which was worthy of his former exploits. The <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a> were aided in their struggle by their mother <a href=/people/2809 target=_blank>Nephele</a>, who sent down a heavy rain, by which she gave no trouble to those who had four legs, but for him who was supported upon two made the footing slippery. Despite all this <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> maintained an astonishing struggle with those who enjoyed such advantages as these, slew the larger part of them, and forced the survivors to flee. 7 Of the <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a> which were killed the most renowned were <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a>, <a href=/people/3302 target=_blank>Argeius</a>, <a href=/people/393 target=_blank>Amphion</a>, also <a href=/people/5700 target=_blank>Hippotion</a>, Oreius, Isoples, <a href=/people/9775 target=_blank>Melanchaetes</a>, and Thereus, Doupon, and <a href=/people/548 target=_blank>Phrixus</a>. As for those who escaped the peril by flight, every one of them later received a fitting punishment: <a href=/people/10853 target=_blank>Homadus</a>, for instance, was killed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a> when he was attempting to violate <a href=/people/1805 target=_blank>Alcyone</a>, the sister of <a href=/people/247 target=_blank>Eurystheus</a>. And for this feat it came to pass that <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> was marvelled at exceedingly; for though he had private grounds for hating his enemy, yet because he pitied her who was being outraged, he determined to be superior to others in humanity. 8 A peculiar thing also happened in the case of him who was called Pholus, the friend of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>. While he was burying the fallen <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a>, since they were his kindred, and was extracting an arrow from one of them, he was wounded by the barb, and since the wound could not be healed he came to his death. <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> gave him a magnificent funeral and buried him at the foot of the mountain, which serves better than a gravestone to preserve his glory; for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378218LPho class=place long=21.749 lat=37.742>Pholoe</a> makes known the identity of the buried man by bearing his name and no inscription is needed. Likewise <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> unwittingly by a shot from his bow killed the <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaur</a> <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Cheiron</a>, who was admired for his knowledge of healing.

For some say that he captured it by the use of nets, others that he tracked it down and mastered it while it was asleep, and some that he wore it out by running it down. One thing is certain, that he accomplished this Labour by sagacity of mind, without the use of force and without running any perils. 2 <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> then received a Command to drive the birds out of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379225PSty class=demonym long=22.4618 lat=37.8606>Stymphalian</a> Lake, and he easily accomplished the Labour by means of a device of art and by ingenuity. The lake abounded, it would appear, with a multitude of birds without telling, which destroyed the fruits of the country roundabout. Now it was not possible to master the animals by force because of the exceptional multitude of them, and so the deed called for ingenuity in cleverly discovering some device.

These stables contained an enormous mass of dung which had accumulated over a great period, and it was a spirit of insult which induced <a href=/people/247 target=_blank>Eurystheus</a> to lay upon him the command to clean out this dung. <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> declined as unworthy of him to carry this out upon his shoulders, in order to avoid the disgrace which would follow upon the insulting command; and so, turning the course of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376215WAlp class=place long=21.4517 lat=37.6125>Alpheius</a> river, as it is called, into the stables and cleansing them by means of the stream, he accomplished Labour in a single day, and without suffering any insult.

And he stipulated that the prize in them should be only a crown, since he himself had conferred benefits upon the race of men without receiving any monetary reward. 2 All the contests were won by him without opposition by anyone else, since no one was bold enough to contend with him because of his exceeding prowess. And yet the contests are very different one from another, since it is hard for a boxer or one who enters for the Pankration to defeat a man who runs the stadion, and equally difficult for the man who wins first place in the light contests to wear down those who excel in the heavy. Consequently it was fitting that of all Games the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> should be the one most honoured, since they were instituted by a noble man. 3 It would also not be right to overlook the gifts which were bestowed upon <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> by the gods because of his high achievements. For instance, when he returned from the wars to devote himself to both relaxations and festivals, as well as to feasts and contests, each one of the gods honoured him with appropriate gifts; <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> with a robe, <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a> with a war-club and coat of mail, these two gods vying with one another in accordance with the arts they practised, the one with an eye to the enjoyment and delight afforded in times of peace, the other looking to his safety amid the perils of war. As for the other gods, <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> presented him with <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> with a sword, <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> gave him a bow and arrows and taught him their use, and <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a> instituted the Lesser Mysteries in honour of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, that she might purify him of the guilt he had incurred in the slaughter of the <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a>. 4 A peculiar thing also came to pass in connection with the birth of this god. The first mortal woman, for instance, with whom <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> lay was <a href=/people/479 target=_blank>Niobe</a>, the daughter of <a href=/people/817 target=_blank>Phoroneus</a>, and the last was <a href=/people/1123 target=_blank>Alcmene</a>, who, as the writers of myths state in their genealogies, was the sixteenth lineal descendant from <a href=/people/479 target=_blank>Niobe</a>. It appears, then, that <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> began to beget human beings with the ancestors of <a href=/people/1123 target=_blank>Alcmene</a> and ceased with her; that is, he stopped with her his intercourse with mortal women since he had no hope that he would beget in after times one who would be worthy of his former children and was unwilling to have the better followed by the worse. </p>                        </div>

Consequently, when she had given birth, she believed that the safety of her child depended upon the preservation of the brand and so she guarded the brand with every care. 7 Afterward, however, being deeply incensed at the murder of her brothers, she burned the brand and so made herself the cause of the death of <a href=/people/315 target=_blank>Meleager</a>; but as time went on she grieved more and more over what she had done and finally made an end of her life by hanging. </p>                        </div>

As traders, for instance, they sail over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=demonym long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinian</a> and Libyan seas, readily casting themselves into dangers from which there is no succour; for although the vessels they use are more cheaply fashioned than make-shift boats and their equipment is the minimum of that usual on ships, yet to one's astonishment and terror they will face the most fearful conditions which storms create. </p>                        </div>

They were also the authors of that dignity which surrounds rulers, providing their rulers with lictors and an ivory stool and a toga with a purple band; and in connection with their houses they invented the peristyle, a useful device for avoiding the confusion connected with the attending throngs; and these things were adopted for the most part by the Romans, who added to their embellishment and transferred them to their own political institutions. 2 Letters, and the teaching about Nature and the gods they also brought to greater perfection, and they elaborated the art of divination by thunder and lightning more than all other men; and it is for this reason that the people who rule practically the entire inhabited world show honour to these men even to this day and employ them as interpreters of the omens of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> as they appear in thunder and lightning. </p>                        </div>

For <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Iulius</a>, since he was the son of <a href=/people/387 target=_blank>Ascanius</a>, maintained, The rule which my father had belongs to me.

In this struggle of the two groups <a href=/people/845 target=_blank>Silvius</a> finally received the vote of the people and gained the throne. <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Iulius</a>, however, though he lost the supreme power, was made <a href=/people/12031 target=_blank>pontifex maximus</a> and became a kind of second king; and from him we are told, was sprung the <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a> gens which exists in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> even to this day. 9 <a href=/people/845 target=_blank>Silvius</a> accomplished nothing of note during his reign and died after a rule of forty-nine years.

Indeed, when at harvest time there would come incessant peals of heavy thunder, he used to order his soldiers, at the word of command, with one accord to strike their shields with the swords; and he would claim that the noise made in this fashion surpassed that of thunder. But he paid the penalty of his arrogance toward the gods, since he was slain by a stroke of lightning and his entire house was submerged in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127WAlb class=place long=12.67 lat=41.75>Alban lake</a>. And to this day the Romans who dwell near the lake point to evidences of this event in the form of columns which stand up in the lake from the ruins of the royal palace lying in its depths. 12 After <a href=/people/7273 target=_blank>Aramulius</a> the next king to be chosen was Aventius, who ruled thirty-seven years. Once, when pressed back in a war with some neighbours, he withdrew for protection to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LAve class=place long=12.4792 lat=41.8835>Aventine</a> hill, and for this reason the hill received the name <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LAve class=place long=12.4792 lat=41.8835>Aventine</a>. Upon his death he was succeeded in the kingship by his son <a href=/people/4279 target=_blank>Proca</a> <a href=/people/845 target=_blank>Silvius</a>, who reigned twenty-three years. At his death his younger son <a href=/people/795 target=_blank>Amulius</a> seized the kingship by violence, since <a href=/people/772 target=_blank>Numitor</a>, who as his elder brother and his full-brother as well, was away in a distant region. <a href=/people/795 target=_blank>Amulius</a> reigned a little more than forty-three years and was slain by <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a> and <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, who were the founders of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. </p>                        </div>

For all such things belong to those who hold authority, not to subjects; and so, if any man wishes to lay up the good things of life for himself, and for others, to use, he must first of all win freedom. 4 And the oracle commanded that both possessions should be the concern of men, since neither one of them, without the other, can be of advantage to him who has won it; for there is no advantage to men to be brave, if they are at odds among themselves, or to be wholly of one mind, if they are cowards. </p>                        </div>

For this reason his sons, Cissus and <a href=/people/3300 target=_blank>Phalces</a> <a href=/people/6064 target=_blank>Cerynes</a>, became wroth with him and formed a plot against their father by the hands of certain villains; and the latter, at the instigation of the sons, lay in wait for <a href=/people/785 target=_blank>Temenus</a> beside a certain river.
