What I shall write now follows a different plan, supplementing the previous formal chronicle with a disclosure of what really happened throughout the Roman Empire. You see, it was not possible, during the life of certain persons, to write the truth of what they did, as a historian should. If I had, their hordes of spies would have found out about it, and they would have put me to a most horrible death. I could not even trust my nearest relatives. That is why I was compelled to hide the real explanation of many matters glossed over in my previous books. <br />These secrets it is now my duty to tell and reveal the remaining hidden matters and motives. Yet when I approach this different task, I find it hard indeed to have to stammer and retract what I have written before about the lives of <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> and <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>. Worse yet, it occurs to me that what I am now about to tell will seem neither probable nor plausible to future generations, especially as time flows on and my story becomes ancient history. I fear they may think me a writer of fiction, and even put me among the poets. </p>                        </div>

For the men of today, who know best the truth of these matters, will be trustworthy witnesses to posterity of the accuracy of my evidence. <br />Still another thing for a long time deferred my passion to relieve myself of this untold tale. For I wondered if it might be prejudicial to future generations, and the wickedness of these deeds had not best remain unknown to later times: lest future tyrants, hearing, might emulate them. It is deplorably natural that most monarchs mimic the sins of their predecessors and are most readily disposed to turn to the evils of the past. <br />But, finally, I was again constrained to proceed with this history, for the reason that future tyrants may see also that those who thus err cannot avoid retribution in the end, since the persons of whom I write suffered that judgment. Furthermore, the disclosure of these actions and tempers will be published for all time, and in consequence others will perhaps feel less urge to transgress. </p>                        </div>

Her mother was one of the wenches of the theater; and she herself from the first led an utterly wanton life. Acquainted with magic drugs used by her parents before her, she learned how to use those of compelling qualities and became the wedded wife of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, after having already borne many children. <br />Now she was unfaithful as a wife from the start, but was careful to conceal her indiscretions by the usual precautions; not from any awe of her spouse (for she never felt any shame at anything) and fooled him easily with her deceptions), but because she feared the punishment of the Empress. For <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> hated her, and had already shown her teeth. But when that Queen became involved in difficulties, she won her friendship by helping her, first to destroy Silverius, as shall be related presently, and later to ruin John of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>, as I have told elsewhere. After that, she became more and more fearless, and casting all concealment aside, abandoned herself to the winds of desire. </p>                        </div>

On the eve of his expedition to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> baptized this boy in holy water and received him in his arms as a member henceforth of the family, welcoming him with his wife as their son, according to the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> rite of adoption. And Antonina not only embraced <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> with reasonable fondness as her son by holy word, and thus cared for him, but soon, while her husband was away on his campaign, became wildly in love with him; and, out of her senses with this malady, shook off all fear and shame of God and man. She began by enjoying him surreptitiously, and ended by dallying with him in the presence of the men servants and waiting maids. For she was now possessed by passion and, openly overwhelmed with love, could see no hindrance to its consummation. <br />Once, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> caught her in the very act, but allowed himself to be deceived by his wife. Finding the two in an underground room, he was very angry; but she said, showing no fear or attempt to keep anything hidden, I came here with the boy to bury the most precious part of our plunder, where the Emperor will not discover it. So she said by way of excuse, and he dismissed the matter as if he believed her, even as he saw <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>'s trousers belt somewhat immodestly unfastened. For so bound by love for the woman was he, that he preferred to distrust the evidence of his own eyes. <br />As her folly progressed to an indescribable extent, those who saw what was going on kept silent, except one slave, Macedonia by name. When <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a> as the conqueror of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, she made her master swear solemnly never to betray her to her mistress, and then told him the whole story, presenting s witnesses two slave boys attending the bed-chamber. </p>                        </div>
                        <div class="text-right bottommargin-sm">

For most of the servants, inspired by the weakness of the husband's character, were more anxious to please his wife than to show loyalty to him, and so betrayed the order he had given. But <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a>, when he saw <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>'s grief at what had befallen him, sympathized entirely except to comment, I would have tried to kill the woman rather than the young man. Antonina heard of this, and hated him in secret. How malicious was her spite against him shall be shown; for she was a scorpion who could hide her sting. <br />But not long after this, by the enchantment either of philtres or of her caresses, she persuaded her husband that the charges against her were untrue. Without more ado he sent word to <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> to return, and promised to turn Macedonia and the two slave boys over to his wife. She first cruelly cut out their tongues, it is said, and then cut their bodies into little bits which were put into sacks and thrown into the sea. One of her slaves, Eugenius, who had already wrought the outrage on Silverius, helped her in this crime. <br />And it was not long after this that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was persuaded by his wife to kill <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a>. What happened at that time concerning Presidius and the daggers I have narrated in my previous books. For while <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> would have preferred to let <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a> alone, Antonina gave him no peace until his remark, which I have just repeated, was avenged. And as a result of this murder, much enmity was aroused against <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> in the hearts of the Emperor and all the most important of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. <br />So matters progressed.

There <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> became so worried lest the affair became generally known, that he was at his wit's end. He saw it would be impossible to fool everybody, as the woman was no longer able to conceal her passion and indulge it secretly, but thought nothing of being in fact and in reputation an avowed adulteress. <br />Therefore he went back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, and having his head shaved after the religious custom, became a monk. Whereupon Antonina, insane over her loss, exhibited her grief by donning mourning; and went around the house shrieking and wailing, lamenting even in the presence of her husband what a good friend she had lost, how faithful, how tender, how loving, how energetic! In the end, even her spouse was won over to join in her sorrow. And so the poor wretch wept too, calling for his beloved <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>. Later he even went to the Emperor and implored both him and the Empress, till they consented to summon <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> to return, as one who was and would always be a necessity in the house of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. <br />But <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> refused to leave his monastery, saying he was completely resolved to give himself forever to the cloistered life.

My dearest boy, he said, your father, whoever he was, you have never known, for he left you at your mother's breast when the sands of his life were measured. Nor have you even benefited from his estate, since he was not overblessed with wealth. But brought up by me, though I was only your stepfather, you have arrived at an age where it becomes you to avenge my wrongs. I, who have raised you to consular rank, and given you the opportunity of acquiring such riches, might call myself your father and mother and entire kindred, and I would be right, my son. For it is not by their kinship of blood, but by their friendly deeds that men are wont to measure their bonds to one another. <br />Now the hour has come, when you must not only look on me in the ruin of my household and the loss of my greatest treasure, but as one sharing the shame of your mother in the reproach of all mankind. And consider too, that the sins of women injure not only their husbands, but touch even more bitterly their children, whose reputation suffers the greater from this reason, that they are expected to inherit the disposition of those who bore them. <br />Yet remember this of me, that I still love my wife exceedingly well; and if it is in my power to punish the ruiner of my house, to her I shall do no hurt. But while <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> is present, I cannot condone this charge against her. <br />When he had heard this, <a href=/people/6809 target=_blank>Photius</a> agreed to serve him in everything; but at the same time he was afraid lest some trouble might come to himself from it, for he had little confidence in <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>'s strength of will, where his wife was concerned.

For Antonina had betrayed for her one enemy, when she had lately ensnared the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=demonym long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocian</a>; but she ruined, for Antonina's sake, a number of blameless men. Some of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>'s and <a href=/people/6809 target=_blank>Photius</a>'s acquaintances she put to the torture, when the only charge against them was that they were friends of the two (and to this day we do not know what was their ultimate fate), and others she banished into exile on the same accusation. <br />One man who had accompanied <a href=/people/6809 target=_blank>Photius</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, a Senator who was also named <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, not only lost his property but was thrown into a dungeon, where he was, fastened to a manger by a rope around his neck so short that the noose was always tight and could not be slackened. Consequently the poor man had to stand at the manger all the time, whether he ate or sought sleep or performed the other needs of the body. The only difference between him and an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>, was that . he could not bray. The time the man passed in this condition was not less than four months; after which, overcome by melancholy, he went mad, and as such they set him free to die. <br />The reluctant <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> she forced to become reconciled with his wife; while <a href=/people/6809 target=_blank>Photius</a>, after she had him tortured like a slave and scourged on the back and shoulders, was ordered to tell where <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> and the pander were. But in spite of his anguish at the torture he kept silent as he had sworn to do; though he had always been delicate and sickly, had had to be very careful of his health, and was hitherto inexperienced in such outrage and ill treatment. Yet none of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>'s secrets did he divulge. </p>                        </div>

Discovering Calligonus in the neighborhood, <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> handed him over to Antonina, and then had <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> brought back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, where she hid him in her palace. On the day after his arrival she sent for Antonina. My dearest lady, she said, a pearl fell into my hands yesterday, such a one as no mortal has ever seen. If you wish, I will not grudge you a sight of this jewel, but will show it to you. Not knowing what had happened, her friend begged <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> to show her the pearl; and the Empress, leading <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> from the rooms of one of the eunuchs, revealed him. <br />For a moment Antonina, speechless with joy, remained dumb. Then she broke into an ecstasy of gratitude, and called <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> her saviour, her benefactress, and her true mistress. Thereafter, the Empress kept <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> in the palace, wrapping him in every luxury, and declared she would even make him general of all the Roman forces before long. justice, however, intervened. Carried off by a dysentery, he disappeared from the world of men. <br />Now in <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>'s palace were certain secret dungeon rooms: dark, unknown, and remote, wherein there was no difference between day and night. In one of these <a href=/people/6809 target=_blank>Photius</a> languished for a long time. He had the good fortune, however, to escape, not once, but twice. The first time he took refuge in the Church of the Virgin Mother, which is the most holy and famous of the churches in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, and there took his place at the sacred table as a suppliant. But she captured him even here, and had him removed by force. The second time he fled to the Church of St. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290EASo class=place long=28.9802 lat=41.00864>Sophia</a> and sought sanctuary at the holy font, which of all places the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> most reverence. Yet even from here the woman was able to drag him: for to her no spot was too awful or venerable to transgress, and she thought nothing of violating all the sanctuaries put together. Like all the rest of the people, the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> priests were struck dumb with horror, but stood to one side and suffered her to do as she willed. <br />Now for three years <a href=/people/6809 target=_blank>Photius</a> remained thus in his cell; and then the prophet Zechariah came to him in a dream, and ordered him in the name of the Lord to escape, promising to aid him in this. Trusting in the vision, he broke loose again, and unnoticed by anyone made his way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>. Though he passed through countless thousands of men on his flight, not one of them saw the youth. There he shaved his head, assumed the garb of the monks, and was free at last from the punishment of <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>. <br />But <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, disregarding his word of honor, took no measures to avenge his accomplice's suffering of such impious treatment as has been told. And all of his military expeditions from this time on- failed, presumably by the will of God- For his next campaign against <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, who were for the third time invading Roman territory, was severely criticized; though one good thing was said of him, that he had driven the foe back. But when <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> River, took the great city of <a href=/people/2600 target=_blank>Callinicus</a> without a battle, and enslaved myriads of Roman citizens, while <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was careful not even to pursue the enemy when he retired, he won the reputation of being one of two things-either a traitor or a coward. </p>                        </div>

The plague, which I have described elsewhere, became epidemic at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, and the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> was taken grievously ill; it was even said he had died of it. Rumor spread this report till it reached the Roman army camp. There some of the officers said that if the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> tried to establish anyone else at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> as Emperor, they would never recognize him. Presently, the Emperor's health bettered, and the officers of the army brought charges against each other, the generals Peter and John the Glutton alleging they had heard <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and Buzes making the above declaration. <br />This hypothetical mutiny the indignant Queen took as intended by the two men to refer to herself. So she recalled all the officers to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> to investigate the matter; and she summoned Buzes impromptu to her private quarters, on the pretext she wished to discuss with him matters of sudden urgency. <br />Now underneath the palace was an underground cellar, secure and labyrinthian, comparable to the infernal regions, in which most of those who gave offense to her were eventually entombed. And so Buzes was thrown into this oubliette, and there the man, though of consular rank, remained with no one cognizant of his fate. Neither, as he sat there in darkness, could he ever know whether it was day or night, nor could he learn from anyone else; for the man who each day threw him his food was dumb, and the scene was that of one wild beast confronting another. Everybody soon thought him dead, but no one dared to mention even his memory. But after two years and four months, <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> took pity on the man and released him. Ever after he was half blind and sick in body. This is what she did to Buzes. <br /><a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, although none of the charges against him were proved, was at the insistence of the Empress relieved of his command by the Emperor; who appointed <a href=/people/9753 target=_blank>Martinus</a> in his place as General of the armies of the East. <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>'s lancers and shield-bearers, and such of his servants as were of military use, he ordered to be divided between the other generals and certain of the palace eunuchs. Drawing lots for these men and their arms, they portioned them as the chances fell. And his friends, and all who formerly had served him, were forbidden ever to visit <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. It was a bitter sight, and one no one would ever have thought credible, to see <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> a private citizen in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, almost deserted, melancholy and miserable of countenance, and ever expectant of a further conspiracy to accomplish his death. <br />Then the Empress learned he had acquired great wealth in the East, and sent one of the eunuchs of the palace to confiscate it. Antonina, as I have told, was now quite out of temper with her husband, but on the most friendly and intimate terms with the Queen, since she had got rid of John of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>. So, to please Antonina, <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> arranged everything so that the wife would appear to have asked mercy for her husband, and from such peril to have saved his life; and the poor wretch not only became quite reconciled to her, but let her make him her humblest slave for having saved him from the Queen. And this is how that happened. <br />One morning, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> went to the palace as usual with his few and pitiful followers. Finding the Emperor and Empress hostile, he was further insulted in their presence by baseborn and common men. Late in the evening he went home, often turning around as he withdrew and looking in every direction for those who might be advancing to put him to death. Accompanied by this dread, he entered his home and sat down alone upon his couch. His spirit broken, he failed even to remember the time when he was a man; sweating, dizzy and trembling, he counted himself lost; devoured by slavish fears and mortal worry, he was completely emasculated. </p>                        </div>

Meanwhile, an officer of the palace, Quadratus by name, had come as the sun went down, and passing through the outer hall, suddenly stood at the door of the men's apartments to say he had been sent here by the Empress. And when <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> heard that, he drew up his arms and legs onto the couch and lay down on his back, ready for the end. So far had all manhood left him. <br />Quadratus, however, approached only to hand him a letter from the Queen. And thus the letter read: You know, Sir, your offense against us. But because I am greatly indebted to your wife, I have decided to dismiss all charges against you and give her your life. So for the future you may be of good cheer as to your personal safety and that of your property; but we shall know by what happens to you how you conduct yourself toward her. <br />When <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> read this intoxicated with joy and yearning to give evidence of his gratitude, he leapt from his couch and prostrated himself at the feet of his wife. With each hand fondling one of her legs, licking with his tongue the sole of first one of her feet and then the other, he cried that she was the cause of his life and of his safety: henceforth he would be her faithful slave, instead of her lord and master. <br />The Empress then gave thirty gold centenaries of his property to the Emperor, and returned what was left to <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>. This is what happened to the great general to whom destiny had not long before given both <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a> and <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vitiges</a> to be captives of his spear! But the wealth that this subject of theirs had acquired had long ago gnawed jealous wounds in the hearts of <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> and <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>, who deemed it grown too big for any but the imperial coffers. And they said he had concealed most of <a href=/people/12049 target=_blank>Gelimer</a>'s and <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vitiges</a>'s moneys, which by conquest belonged to the State and had handed over only a small fraction, hardly worth accepting by an Emperor. Yet, when they counted the labors the man had accomplished, and the cries of reproach they might arouse among the people, since they had no credible pretext for punishing him, they kept their peace: until now, when the Empress, discovering him out of his senses with terror, at one fell stroke managed to become mistress of all his fortune. <br />To tie him further to her, she betrothed Joannina, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>'s only daughter, to <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a> her nephew. <br /><a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> now asked to be given back his old command, and as General of the East lead the Roman armies once more against <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>; but Antonina would not hear of it. It was there she had been insulted by him before, she said, and she never wanted to see the place again. Accordingly, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> was instead made Count of the imperial remounts, and fared forth a second time to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>; agreeing with the Emperor, they say, not to ask him at any time for money toward this war, but to prepare all the military equipment from his private purse. <br />Now everybody took it for granted that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had arranged this with his wife and made the agreement about the expedition with the Emperor, merely so as to get away from his humiliating position in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>; and that as soon as he had gotten outside the city, he intended to take up arms and retaliate, nobly and as becomes a man, against his wife and those who had done him wrong. Instead, he made light of all he had experienced, forgot or discounted his word of honor to <a href=/people/6809 target=_blank>Photius</a> and his other friends, and followed his wife about in a perfect ecstasy of love: and that when she had now arrived at the age of sixty years. <br />However, as soon as he arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, some new and different trouble happened with each fresh day, for even Providence had turned against him. For the plans this General had laid in the former campaign against <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a> and <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vitiges</a>, though they did not seem to be fitting to the event, usually turned out to his advantage; while now, though he was credited with laying better plans, as was to be expected after his previous experience in warfare, they all turned out badly: so that the final judgment was that he had no sense of strategy. <br />Indeed, it is not by the plans of men, but by the hand of God that the affairs of men are directed; and this men call <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a>, not knowing the reason for what things they see occur; and what seems to be without cause is easy to call the accident of chance. Still, this is a matter every mortal will decide for himself according to his taste. </p>                        </div>

Thus, he even went to <a href=/people/3610 target=_blank>Herodian</a> and asked him for money, and his threats so enraged <a href=/people/3610 target=_blank>Herodian</a> that he rebelled against the Roman army and gave his services, with those of his followers and the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427127USpo class=place long=12.7403 lat=42.7352>Spoletum</a>, to <a href=/people/12113 target=_blank>Totila</a> and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. <br />And now I shall show how it came about that <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> and John, the nephew of Vitalian, became estranged: a division that brought great disaster to Roman affairs. <br />Now so thoroughly did the Empress hate Germanus, and so conspicuously, that no one dared to become a relative of his, though he was the nephew of the Emperor.

But when they had come to an agreement, they bound each other by most solemn oaths to complete the alliance by all means in their power; and this was necessary because neither had any confidence in the good faith of the other. For John knew he was seeking a marriage far above his rank, and Germanus feared that even this man might try to slip out of the contract. <br />The Empress, of course, was unable to contain herself at this: and in every way, by every possible device, however unworthy, tried to hinder the event. When, for all her menaces, she was unable to deter either of them, she publicly threatened to put John to death. After this, on john's return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, fearing Antonina might join the plot against him, he did not dare to meet <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> until she left for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>.

And when he received the monarch's permission to do this, he left straightway in high spirits, bidding a long farewell to the Roman army and to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. He left almost everything in the power of the enemy; and while he was on his way home, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431124UPer class=place long=12.392 lat=43.107>Perusia</a>, hard pressed by a most bitter siege, was captured and submitted to every possible misery, as I have elsewhere related. <br />As if this were not enough, he suffered a further personal misfortune in the following manner. The Empress <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>, desiring to marry the daughter of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> to her nephew, worried the girl's parents with frequent letters. To avoid this alliance, they delayed the ceremony until they could both be present at it, and then, when the Empress summoned them to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, pretended they were unable at the time to leave <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. But the Queen was still determined her nephew should be master of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>'s wealth, for she knew his daughter would inherit it, as <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> had no other child. Yet she had no confidence in Antonina; and fearing that after her own life was ended, Antonina would not be loyal to her house, for all that she had been so helpful in the Empress's emergencies, and that she would break the agreement, <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> did an unholy thing. </p>                        </div>

And they say she forced the girl against her will to submit to his clandestine embrace, so that, being thus deflowered, the girl would agree to the marriage, and the Emperor could not forbid the event. However, after the first ravishing, <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a> and the girl fell warmly in love with each other, and for not less than eight months continued their unmarital relations. <br />But when, after <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>'s death, Antonina came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, she was unwilling to forget the outrage the Queen had committed against her. Not bothering about the fact that if she united her daughter to any other man, she would be making an ex-prostitute out of her, she refused to accept <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>'s nephew as a son-in-law, and by force tore the girl, ignoring her fondest pleadings, from the man she loved. <br />For this act of senseless obstinacy she was universally censured. Yet when her husband came home, she easily persuaded him to approve her course: which should have openly disclosed the character of the man. Still, though he had pledged himself to <a href=/people/6809 target=_blank>Photius</a> and others of his friends, and then broken his word, there were plenty who sympathized with him. For they thought the reason for his perjury was not uxoriousness, but his fear of the Empress. But after <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> died, as I have told, he still took no thought of <a href=/people/6809 target=_blank>Photius</a> or any of his friends; and it was clear he called Antonina his mistress, and Calligonus the pander, his master. And then all men saw his shame, made him a public laughing stock, and reviled him to his face as a nitwit. Now was the folly of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> completely revealed. <br />As for <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a>, son of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a>, and his misdeeds in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, I have described that affair sufficiently in my chapter elsewhere on the subject: how he was most guilty for the disaster there to Roman power, and how he disregarded the gospel oath he had sworn to the Levathae, and criminally put to death their eighty ambassadors. So there remains for me to add now only this, that neither did these men come to <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> with any intention of treachery, nor did <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> have any suspicion that they did; but nevertheless, after inviting them to a banquet under pledge of safety, he put them shamefully to death. This resulted in the loss of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, the Roman Army, and all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a>. For consequent to this affair, especially after <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>'s death, as I have told, neither officer nor soldier was willing to venture the dangers of battle. Most notably John son of Sisinnolus, kept entirely from the field of war because of his hatred of <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a>, until <a href=/people/12066 target=_blank>Areobindus</a> came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. </p>                        </div>

And with the Emperor's consent she even let <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> brother, go scot-free after the murder of Pegasius. How this happened, I shall now relate. <br />After Pegasius had ransomed <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> from the Levathae, and the barbarians had gone home, <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> with Pegasius his ransomer and a few soldiers, set out for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. And on the way Pegasius reminded <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> of the wrong he had done, and said he should thank God for his rescue from the enemy. <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> vexed at being reproached for having been taken captive, straightway slew Pegasius; and this was his requital to the man who saved him. But when <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, the Emperor pardoned him on the ground that the man he killed was a traitor to the Roman state. So <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> this escaping justice, left gladly for the East to visit his native country and his family. Yet God's vengeance overtook him on the very journey, and removed him from the world of men. <br />This is the explanation of the affair between <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> and Pegasius. </p>                        </div>

They made their way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> on foot, carrying on their shoulders their blankets in which were wrapped no other equipment except the biscuits they had baked at home. When they arrived and were admitted into military service, the Emperor chose them for the palace guard; for they were all three fine-looking men. <br />Later, when <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a> succeeded to the throne, war broke out with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=ethnic long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurians</a> when that nation rebelled; and against them <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a> sent a considerable army under John the Hunchback. This John for some offense threw <a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a> into the guardhouse, and on the following day would have sentenced him to death, had he not been stopped by a vision appearing to him in a dream. For in this dream, the general said, he beheld a being, gigantic in size and in every way mightier than mortals: and this being commanded him to release the man whom he had arrested that day. Waking from his sleep, John said, he decided the dream was not worth considering. But the next night the vision returned, and again he heard the same words he had heard before; yet even so he was not persuaded to obey its command. But for the third time the vision appeared in his dreams, and threatened him with fearful consequences if he did not do as the angel ordered: warning that he would be in sore need of this man and his family thereafter, when the day of wrath should overtake him. And this time <a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a> was released. <br />As time went on, this <a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a> came to great power. For the Emperor <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a> appointed him Count of the palace guard; and when the Emperor departed from this world, by the force of his military power <a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a> seized the throne. By this time he was an old man on the verge of the grave, and so illiterate that he could neither read nor write: which never before could have been said of a Roman ruler. It was the custom for an Emperor to sign his edicts with his own hand, but he neither made decrees nor was able to understand the business of state at all. </p>                        </div>

But so that he might have some evidence of the Emperor's hand, he invented the following device for his clerks to construct. Cutting out of a block of wood the shapes of the four letters required to make the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> word, they dipped a pen into the ink used by emperors for their signatures, and put it in the Emperor's fingers. Laying the block of wood I have described on the paper to be signed, they guided the Emperor's hand so that his pen outlined the four letters, following all the curves of the stencil: and thus they withdrew with the writing of the Emperor. This is how the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were ruled under <a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a>. <br />His wife was named Lupicina: a slave and a barbarian, she was bought to be his concubine. With <a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a>, as the sun of his life was about to set, she ascended the throne. <br />Now <a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a> was able to do his subjects neither harm nor good. For he was simple, unable to carry on a conversation or make a speech, and utterly bucolic. His nephew <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, while still a youth, was the virtual ruler-, and the of more and worse calamities to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> than any one man in all their previous history that has come down to us.- For he had no scruples; against murder or the seizing of other persons property; and it was nothing to him to make away with myriads of men, even when they gave him no cause. He had no care for preserving established customs, but was always eager for new experiments, and, in short, was the greatest corrupter of all noble traditions. <br />Though the plague, described in my former books, attacked the whole world, no fewer men escaped than perished of it; for some never were taken by the disease, and others recovered after it had smitten them. But this man, not one of all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> could escape; but as if he were a second pestilence sent from heaven, he fell on the nation and left no man quite untouched. For some he slew without reason, and some he released to struggle with penury, and their fate was worse than that of those who had perished, so that they prayed for death to free them from their misery; and others he robbed of their property and their lives together. <br />When there was nothing left to ruin in the Roman state, he determined the conquest of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, for no other reason than to destroy the people there, as he had those who were already his subjects. <br />Indeed, his power was not ten days old, before he slew Amantius, chief of the palace eunuchs, and several others, on no graver charge than that Amantius had made some rash remark about John, Archbishop of the city. After this, he was the most feared of men. <br />Immediately after this he sent for the rebel Vitalian, to whom he had first given pledges of safety, and partaken with him of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> communion. But soon after he became suspicious and jealous, and murdered Vitalian and his companions at a banquet in the palace: thus showing he considered himself in no way bound by the most sacred of pledges. </p>                        </div>

Not all the Blues were willing to follow his leadership, but there were plenty who were eager for civil war. Yet even these, as the trouble spread, seemed the most prudent of men, for their crimes were less awful than was in their power to commit. Nor did the Green partisans remain quiet, but showed their resentment as violently as they could, though one by one they were continually punished; which, indeed, urged them each time to further recklessness. For men who are wronged are likely to become desperate. <br />Then it was that <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, fanning the flame and openly inciting the Blues to fight, made the whole Roman Empire shake on its foundation, as if an earthquake or a cataclysm had stricken it, or every city within its confines had been taken by the foe. Everything everywhere was uprooted: nothing was left undisturbed by him. Law and order, throughout the State, overwhelmed by distraction, were turned upside down. <br />First the rebels revolutionized the style of wearing their hair. For they had it cut differently from the rest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>: not molesting the mustache or beard, which they allowed to keep on growing as long as it would, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> do, but clipping the hair short on the front of the head down to the temples, and letting it hang down in great length and disorder in the back, as the Massageti do. This weird combination they called the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Hun</a> haircut. <br />Next they decided to wear the purple stripe on their togas, and swaggered about in a dress indicating a rank above their station: for it was only by ill-gotten money they were able to buy this finery. And the sleeves of their tunics were cut tight about the wrists, while from there to the shoulders they were of an ineffable fullness; thus, whenever they moved their hands, as when applauding at the theater or encouraging a driver in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362BHiA class=place long=36.1717 lat=36.2269>hippodrome</a>, these immense sleeves fluttered conspicuously, displaying to the simple public what beautiful and well-developed physiques were these that required such large garments to cover them. They did not consider that by the exaggeration of this dress the meagerness of their stunted bodies appeared all the more noticeable. Their cloaks, trousers, and boots were also different: and these too were called the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Hun</a> style, which they imitated. <br />Almost all of them carried steel openly from the first, while by day they concealed their two-edged daggers along the thigh under their cloaks. Collecting in gangs as soon as dusk fell, they robbed their betters in the open Forum and in the narrow alleys, snatching from passersby their mantles, belts, gold brooches, and whatever they had in their hands. Some they killed after robbing them, so they could not inform anyone of the assault. <br />These outrages brought the enmity of everybody on them, especially that of the Blue partisans who had not taken active part in the discord. When even the latter were molested, they began to wear brass belts and brooches and cheaper cloaks than most of them were privileged to display, lest their elegance should lead to their deaths; and even before the sun went down they went home to hide. But the evil progressed; and as no punishment came to the criminals from those in charge of the public peace, their boldness increased more and more. For when crime finds itself licensed, there are no limits to its abuses; since even when it is punished, it is never quite suppressed, most men being by nature easily turned to error. </p>                        </div>

Some of the opposite party joined this faction so as to get even with the people of their original side who had ill-treated them; others fled in secret to other lands, but many were captured before they could get away, and perished either at the hands of their foes or by sentence of the State. And many other young men offered themselves to this society who had never before taken any interest in the quarrel, but were now induced by the power and possibility of insolence they could thus acquire. For there is no villainy to which men give a name that was not committed during this time, and remained unpunished. <br />Now at first they killed only their opponents. But as matters progressed, they also murdered men who had done nothing against them. And there were many who bribed them with money, pointing out personal enemies, whom the Blues straightway dispatched, declaring these victims were Greens, when as a matter of fact they were utter strangers. And all this went on not any longer at dark and by stealth, but in every hour of the day, everywhere in the city: before the eyes of the most notable men of the government, if they happened to be bystanders. For they did not need to conceal their crimes, having no fear of punishment, but considered it rather to the advantage of their reputation, as proving their strength and manhood, to kill with one stroke of the dagger any unarmed man who happened to be passing by. <br />No one could hope to live very long under this state of affairs, for everybody suspected he would be the next to be killed. No place was safe, no time of day offered any pledge of security, since these murders went on in the holiest of sanctuaries even during divine services. No confidence was left in one's friends or relatives, for many died by conspiracy of members of their own households. Nor was there any investigation after these deeds, but the blow would fall unexpectedly, and none avenged the victim. No longer was there left any force in law or contract, because of this disorder, but everything was settled by violence. The State might as well have been a tyranny: not one, however, that had been established, but one that was being overturned daily and ever recommencing. <br />The magistrates seemed to have been driven from their senses, and their wits enslaved by the fear of one man. The judges, when deciding cases that came up before them, cast their votes not according to what they thought right or lawful, but according as either of the disputants was an enemy or friend of the faction in power. For a judge who disregarded its instruction was sentencing himself to death. And many creditors were forced to receipt the bills they had sent to their debtors without being paid what was due them; and many thus against their will had to free their slaves. <br />And they say that certain ladies were forced by their own slaves to do what they did not want to do; and the sons of notable men, getting mixed up with these young bandits, compelled their fathers, among other acts against their will, to hand over their properties to them. Many boys were constrained, with their fathers' knowledge, to serve the unnatural desires of the Blues; and happily married women met the same misfortune. <br />It is told that a woman of no undue beauty was ferrying with her husband to the suburb opposite the mainland; when some men of this party met them on the water, and jumping into her boat, dragged her abusively from her husband and made her enter their vessel. She had whispered to her spouse to trust her and have no fear of any reproach, for she would not allow herself to be dishonored. Then, as he looked at her in great grief, she threw her body into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411291WBos class=place long=29.0753 lat=41.1194>Bosphorus</a> and forthwith vanished from the world of men. Such were the deeds this party dared to commit at that time in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. <br />Yet all of this disturbed people less than <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>'s offenses against the State. For those who suffer the most grievously from evildoers are relieved of the greater part of their anguish by the expectation they will sometime be avenged by law and authority. Men who are confident of the future can bear more easily and less painfully their present troubles; but when they are outraged even by the government what befalls them is naturally all the more grievous, and by the failing of all hope of redress they are turned to utter despair. And <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>'s crime was that he was not only unwilling to protect the injured, but saw no reason why he should not be the open head of the guilty faction; he gave great sums of money to these young men, and surrounded himself with them: and some he even went so far as to appoint to high office and other posts of honor. </p>                        </div>

But the Emperor was undisturbed by the trouble, even when it went on continually under his own eyes at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362BHiA class=place long=36.1717 lat=36.2269>hippodrome</a>. For he was very complacent and resembled most the silly <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>, which follows, only shaking its ears, when one drags it by the bridle. As such <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> acted, and threw everything into confusion. <br />As soon as he took over the rule from his uncle, his measure was to spend the public money without restraint, now that he had control of it. He gave much of it to the Huns who, from time to time, entered the state; and in consequence the Roman provinces were subject to constant incursions, for these barbarians, having once tasted Roman wealth, never forgot the road that led to it. And he threw much money into the sea in the form of moles, as if to master the eternal roaring of the breakers. For he jealously hurled stone breakwaters far out from the mainland against the onset of the sea, as if by the power of wealth he could outmatch the might of ocean. <br />He gathered to himself the private estates of Roman citizens from all over the Empire: some by accusing their possessors of crimes of which they were innocent, others by juggling their owners' words into the semblance of a gift to him of their property. And many, caught in the act of murder and other crimes, turned their possessions over to him and thus escaped the penalty for their sins. <br />Others, fraudulently disputing title to lands happening to adjoin their own, when they saw they had no chance of getting the best of the argument, with the law against them, gave him their equity in the claim so as to be released from court. Thus, by a gesture that cost him nothing, they gained his favor and were able illegally to get the better of their opponents. <br />I think this is as good a time as any to describe the personal appearance of the man. Now in physique he was neither tall nor short, but of average height; not thin, but moderately plump; his face was round, and not bad looking, for he had good color, even when he fasted for two days. </p>                        </div>

Wherefore she was dearly loved; and the Senate sent for her, when <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> died, and commanded her to ask whatever boon she wished. But she asked only this: to set up in his memory one brass image, wherever she might desire. To this the Senate agreed. Now the lady, wishing to leave a memorial to future time of the savagery of those who had butchered her husband, conceived this plan: collecting the pieces of <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>'s body, she joined them accurately together and sewed the body up again into its original semblance. Taking this to the statue makers, she ordered them to produce the miserable form in brass.

For he was at once villainous and amenable; as people say colloquially, a moron. He was never truthful with anyone, but always guileful in what he said and did, yet easily hoodwinked by any who wanted to deceive him. His nature was an unnatural mixture of folly and wickedness. What in olden times a peripatetic philosopher said was also true of him, that opposite qualities combine in a man as in the mixing of colors.

Then he would immediately break his agreements and pledges, like the vilest of slaves, whom indeed only the fear of torture drives to confess their perjury. A faithless friend, he was a treacherous enemy, insane for murder and plunder, quarrelsome and revolutionary, easily led to anything evil, but never willing to listen to good counsel, quick to plan mischief and carry it out, but finding even the hearing of anything good distasteful to his ears. <br />How could anyone put <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>'s ways into words? These and many even worse vices were disclosed in him as in no other mortal nature seemed to have taken the wickedness of all other men combined and planted it in this man's soul. And besides this, he was too prone to listen to accusations; and too quick to punish. For he decided such cases without full examination, naming the punishment when he had heard only the accuser s side of the matter. Without hesitation he wrote decrees for the plundering of countries, sacking of cities, and slavery of whole nations, for no cause whatever.

And when it was his, he was more than ready to squander it in insane display, or give it as an unnecessary bribe to the barbarians. In short, he neither held on to any money himself nor let anyone else keep any: as if his reason were not avarice, but jealousy of those who had riches. Driving all wealth from the country of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> in this manner, he became the cause Of universal poverty. <br />Now this was the character of <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, so far as I can portray it. </p>                        </div>

This man, during the rule of <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a>, fell sick and died, leaving three daughters named Comito, <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> and Anastasia: of whom the eldest was not yet seven years old. His widow took a second husband, who with her undertook to keep up <a href=/people/2703 target=_blank>Acacius</a>'s family and profession. But <a href=/people/1435 target=_blank>Asterius</a>, the dancing master of the Greens, on being bribed by another, removed this office from them and assigned it to the man who gave him the money. For the dancing masters had the power of distributing such positions as they wished. <br />When this woman saw the populace assembled in the amphitheater, she placed laurel wreaths on her daughters' heads and in their hands, and sent them out to sit on the ground in the attitude of suppliants. The Greens eyed this mute appeal with indifference; but the Blues were moved to bestow on the children an equal office, since their own animal-keeper had just died. <br />When these children reached the age of girlhood, their mother put them on the local stage, for they were fair to look upon; she sent them forth, however, not all at the same time, but as each one seemed to her to have reached a suitable age. Comito, indeed, had already become one of the leading hetaerae [high class prostitutes] of the day. <br /><a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>, the second sister, dressed in a little tunic with sleeves, like a slave girl, waited on Comito and used to follow her about carrying on her shoulders the bench on which her favored sister was wont to sit at public gatherings. Now <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> was still too young to know the normal relation of man with maid, but consented to the unnatural violence of villainous slaves who, following their masters to the theater, employed their leisure in this infamous manner. And for some time in a brothel she suffered such misuse. <br />But as soon as she arrived at the age of youth, and was now ready for the world, her mother put her on the stage. Forthwith, she became a courtesan, and such as the ancient Greeks used to call a common one, at that: for she was not a flute or harp player, nor was she even trained to dance, but only gave her youth to anyone she met, in utter abandonment. </p>                        </div>

For she was very funny and a good mimic, and immediately became popular in this art. There was no shame in the girl, and no one ever saw her dismayed: no role was too scandalous for her to, accept without a blush. <br />She was the kind of comedienne who delights the audience by letting herself be cuffed and slapped on the cheeks, and makes them guffaw by raising her skirts to reveal to the spectators those feminine secrets here and there which custom veils from the eyes of the opposite sex. With pretended laziness she mocked her lovers, and coquettishly adopting ever new ways of embracing, was able to keep in a constant turmoil the hearts of the sophisticated. And she did not wait to be asked by anyone she met, but on the contrary, with inviting jests and a comic flaunting of her skirts herself tempted all men who passed by, especially those who were adolescent. <br />On the field of pleasure she was never defeated. Often she would go picnicking with ten young men or more, in the flower of their strength and virility, and dallied with them all, the whole night through. When they wearied of the sport, she would approach their servants, perhaps thirty in number, and fight a duel with each of these; and even thus found no allayment of her craving. Once, visiting the house of an illustrious gentleman, they say she mounted the projecting corner of her dining couch, pulled up the front of her dress, without a blush, and thus carelessly showed her wantonness. And though she flung wide three gates to the ambassadors of <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Cupid</a>, she lamented that nature had not similarly unlocked the straits of her bosom, that she might there have contrived a further welcome to his emissaries. <br />Frequently, she conceived but as she employed every artifice immediately, a miscarriage was straightway effected. Often, even in the theater, in the sight of all the people, she removed her costume and stood nude in their midst, except for a girdle about the groin: not that she was abashed at revealing that, too, to the audience, but because there was a law against appearing altogether naked on the stage, without at least this much of a fig-leaf. Covered thus with a ribbon, she would sink down to the stage floor and recline on her back. Slaves to whom the duty was entrusted would then scatter grains of barley from above into the calyx of this passion flower, whence geese, trained for the purpose, would next pick the grains one by one with their bills and eat. When she rose, it was not with a blush, but she seemed rather to glory in the performance. For she was not only impudent herself, but endeavored to make everybody else as audacious. Often when she was alone with other actors she would undress in their midst and arch her back provocatively, advertising like a peacock both to those who had experience of her and to those who had not yet had that privilege her trained suppleness. <br />So perverse was her wantonness that she should have hid not only the customary part of her person, as other women do, but her face as well. Thus those who were intimate with her were straightway recognized from that very fact to be perverts, and any more respectable man who chanced upon her in the Forum avoided her and withdrew in haste, lest the hem of his mantle, touching such a creature, might be thought to share in her pollution. For to those who saw her, especially at dawn, she was a bird of ill omen. And toward her fellow actresses she was as savage as a scorpion: for she was very malicious. </p>                        </div>

But finally her death removed this obstacle to <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>'s desire. <br /><a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a>, doting and utterly senile, was now the laughing stock of his subjects; he was disregarded by everyone because of his inability to oversee state affairs; but <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> they all served with considerable awe. His hand was in everything, and his passion for turmoil created universal consternation. <br />It was then that he undertook to complete his marriage with <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>. But as it was impossible for a man of senatorial rank to make a courtesan his wife, this being forbidden by ancient law, he made the Emperor nullify this ordinance by creating a new one, permitting him to wed <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>, and consequently making it possible for anyone else to marry a courtesan. Immediately after this he seized the power of the Emperor, veiling his usurpation with a transparent pretext: for he was proclaimed colleague of his uncle as Emperor of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> by the questionable legality of an election inspired by terror. <br />So <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> and <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> ascended the imperial throne three days before Easter, a time, indeed, when even making visits or greeting one's friends is forbidden. And not many days later <a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a> died of an illness, after a reign of nine years. <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> was now sole .monarch, together, of course, with <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>. <br />Thus it was that <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>, though born and brought up as I have related, rose to royal dignity over all obstacles. For no thought of shame came to <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> in marrying her, though he might have taken his pick of the noblest born, most highly educated, most modest, carefully nurtured, virtuous and beautiful virgins of all the ladies in the whole Roman Empire: a maiden, as they say, with upstanding breasts. Instead, he preferred to make his own :what, had been common to all men, alike, careless of all her revealed history, took in wedlock a woman who was not only guilty of every other contamination but boasted of her many abortions. <br />I need hardly mention any other proof of the character of this man: for all the perversity of his soul was completely displayed in this union; which alone was ample interpreter, witness, and historian of his shamelessness. For when a man once disregards the disgrace of his actions and is willing to brave the contempt of society, no path of lawlessness is thereafter taboo to him; but with unflinching countenance he advances, easily and without a scruple, to acts of the deepest infamy. <br />However, not a single member of even the Senate, seeing this disgrace befalling the State, dared to complain or forbid the event; but all of them bowed down before her as if she were a goddess. Nor was there a priest who showed any resentment, but all hastened to greet her as Highness. And the populace who had seen her before on the stage, directly raised its hands to proclaim itself her slave in fact and in name. Nor did any soldier grumble at being ordered to risk the perils of war for the benefit of <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>: nor was there any man on earth who ventured to oppose her. <br />Confronted with this disgrace, they all yielded, I suppose, to necessity, for it was as if <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a> were giving proof of its power to control mortal affairs as malignantly as it pleases: showing that its decrees need not always be according to reason or human propriety. Thus does Destiny sometimes raise mortals suddenly to lofty heights in defiance of reason, in challenge to all out cries of injustice; but admits no obstacle, urging on his favorites to the appointed goal without let or hindrance. But as this is the will of God, so let it befall and be <br />written. </p>                        </div>

All eternity would not be long enough to allow one to tell her escapades while she was on the stage, but the few details I have mentioned above should be sufficient to demonstrate the woman's character to future generations. <br />What she and her husband did together must now be briefly described: for neither did anything without the consent of the other. For some time it was generally supposed they were totally different in mind and action; but later it was revealed that their apparent disagreement had been arranged so that their subjects might not unanimously revolt against them, but instead be divided in opinion. <br />Thus they split the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> into two parties, each pretending to take the part of one side, thus confusing both, as I shall soon show; and then they ruined both political factions. <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> feigned to support the Blues with all her power, encouraging them to take the offensive against the opposing party and perform the most outrageous deeds of violence; while <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, affecting to be vexed and secretly jealous of her, also pretended he could not openly oppose her orders. And thus they gave the impression often that they were acting in opposition. Then he would rule that the Blues must be punished for their crimes, and she would angrily complain that against her will she was defeated by her husband. However, the Blue partisans, as I have said, seemed cautious, for they did not violate their neighbors as much as they might have done. <br />And in legal disputes each of the two would pretend to favor one of the litigants, and compel the man with the worse case to win: and so they robbed both disputants of most of the property at issue. <br />In the same way, the Emperor, taking many persons into his intimacy, gave them offices by power of which they could defraud the State to the limits of their ambition. And as soon as they had collected enough plunder, they would fall out of favor with <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>, and straightway be ruined. At first he would affect great sympathy in their behalf, but soon he would somehow lose his confidence in them, and an air of doubt would darken his zeal in their behalf. Then <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> would use them shamefully, while he, unconscious as it were of what was being done to them, confiscated their properties and boldly enjoyed their wealth. By such well-planned hypocrisies they confused the public and, pretending to be at variance with each other, were able to establish a firm and mutual tyranny. </p>                        </div>

Whatever had been before by law, he now introduced into the government, while he revoked all established customs: as if he had been given the robes of an Emperor on the condition he would turn everything topsy-turvy. Existing offices he abolished, and invented new ones for the management of public affairs. He did the same thing to the laws and to the regulations of the army; and his reason was not any improvement of justice or any advantage, but simply that everything might be new and named after himself. And whatever was beyond his power to abolish, he renamed after himself anyway. <br />Of the plundering of property or the murder of men, no weariness ever overtook him. As soon as he had looted all the houses of the wealthy, he looked around for others; meanwhile throwing away the spoils of his previous robberies in subsidies to barbarians or senseless building extravagances. And when he had ruined perhaps myriads in this mad looting, he immediately sat down to plan how he could do likewise to others in even greater number. <br />As the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were now at peace with all the world and he had no other means of satisfying his lust for slaughter, he set the barbarians all to fighting each other. And for no reason at all he sent for the <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Hun</a> chieftains, and with idiotic magnanimity gave them large sums of money, alleging he did this to secure their friendship. This, as I have said, he had also done in <a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a>'s time. These Huns, as soon as they had got this money, sent it together with their soldiers to others of their chieftains, with the word to make inroads into the land of the Emperor: so that they might collect further tribute from him, to buy them off in a second peace. Thus the Huns enslaved the Roman Empire, and were paid by the Emperor to keep on doing it. <br />This encouraged still others of them to rob the poor <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>; and after their pillaging, they too were further rewarded by the gracious Emperor. In this way all the Huns, for when it was not one tribe of them it was another, continuously overran and laid waste the Empire. For the barbarians were led by many different chieftains, and the war, thanks to <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>'s senseless generosity, was thus endlessly protracted. Consequently no place, mountain or cave, or any other spot in Roman territory, during this time remained uninjured; and many regions were pillaged more than five times. <br />These misfortunes, and those that were caused by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, <a href=/people/11026 target=_blank>Saracens</a>, Slavs, Antes, and the rest of the barbarians, I described in my previous works. But, as I said in the preface to this narrative, the real cause of these calamities remained to be told here. <br />To <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> also he paid many centenaries in behalf of peace, and then with unreasonable arbitrariness caused the breaking of the truce by making every effort to secure the friendship of Alamandouras and his Huns, who had been in alliance with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>: but this I freely discussed in my chapters on the subject. <br />Moreover, while he was encouraging civil strife and frontier warfare to confound the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, with only one thought in his mind, that the earth should run red with human blood and he might acquire more and more booty, he invented a new means of murdering his subjects. </p>                        </div>

All of these beliefs he ordered to be abolished, and their place taken by the orthodox dogma: threatening, among the punishments for disobedience, loss of the heretic's right to will property to his children or other relatives. <br />Now the churches of these so-called heretics especially those belonging to the Arian dissenters, were almost incredibly wealthy. Neither all the Senate put together nor the greatest other unit of the Roman Empire, had anything in property comparable to that of these churches. For their gold and silver treasures, and stores of precious stones, were beyond telling or numbering: they owned mansions and whole villages, land all over the world, and everything else that is counted as wealth among men. <br />As none of the previous Emperors had molested these churches, many men, even those of the orthodox faith, got their livelihood by working on their estates. But the Emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, in confiscating these properties, at the same time took away what for many people had been their only means of earning a living. <br />Agents were sent everywhere to force whomever they chanced upon to renounce the faith of their fathers. This, which seemed impious to rustic people, caused them to rebel against those who gave them such an order. Thus many perished at the hands of the persecuting faction, and others did away with themselves, foolishly thinking this the holier course of two evils; but most of them by far quitted the land of their fathers, and fled the country. The Montanists, who dwelt in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>, shut themselves up in their churches, set them on fire, and ascended to glory in the flames.

Not long after this, John fell ill and departed from this world, whereupon the Governor of the city forged a letter which, he said, John had written him as a friend not long before, to the effect that he wished his estate to go to the Emperor. <br />I could hardly catalogue all the other people whose estates these two chose to inherit. However, up to the time when the insurrection named Nika took place, they seized rich men's properties one at a time; but when that happened, as I have told elsewhere, they sequestrated at one swoop the estates of nearly all the members of the Senate. On everything movable and on the fairest of the lands they laid their hands and kept what they wanted; but whatever was unproductive of more than the bitter and heavy taxes, they gave back to the previous owners with a philanthropic gesture. Consequently these unfortunates, oppressed by the tax collectors and eaten up by the never-ceasing interest on their debts, found life a burden compared to which death were preferable. <br />Wherefore to me,- and many others of us, these two seemed not to be human beings, but veritable demons, and what the poets call vampires: who laid their heads together to see how they could most easily and quickly destroy the race and deeds of men; and assuming human bodies, became man-demons, and so convulsed the world. And one could find evidence of this in many things, but especially in the superhuman power with which they worked their will. <br />For when one examines closely, there is a clear difference between what is human and what is supernatural. There have been many enough men, during the whole course of history, who by chance or by nature have inspired great fear, ruining cities or countries or whatever else fell into their power; but to destroy all men and bring calamity on the whole inhabited earth remained for these two to accomplish, whom <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a> aided in their schemes of corrupting all mankind. For by earthquakes, pestilences, and floods of river waters at this time came further ruin, as I shall presently show. Thus not by human, but by some other kind of power they accomplished their dreadful designs. <br />And they say his mother said to some of her intimates once that not of Sabbatius her husband, nor of any man was <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> a son. For when she was about to conceive, there visited a demon, invisible but giving evidence of his presence perceptibly where man consorts with woman, after which he vanished utterly as in a dream. <br />And some of those who have been with <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> at the palace late at night, men who were pure of spirit, have thought they saw a strange demoniac form taking his place. One man said that the Emperor suddenly rose from his throne and walked about, and indeed he was never wont to remain sitting for long, and immediately <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>'s head vanished, while the rest of his body seemed to ebb and flow; whereat the beholder stood aghast and fearful, wondering if his eyes were deceiving him. But presently he perceived the vanished head filling out and joining the body again as strangely as it had left it. <br />Another said he stood beside the Emperor as he sat, and of a sudden the face changed into a shapeless mass of flesh, with neither eyebrows nor eyes in their proper places, nor any other distinguishing feature; and after a time the natural appearance of his countenance returned. I write these instances not as one who saw them myself, but heard them from men who were positive they had seen these strange occurrences at the time. </p>                        </div>

On the other hand, he never blushed at the murders he committed. Thus he never revealed a sign of wrath or irritation at any offender, but with a gentle countenance and unruffled brow gave the order to destroy myriads of innocent men, to sack cities, to confiscate any amount of properties. <br />One would think from this manner that the man had the mind of a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a>. If, however, anyone tried to propitiate him and in supplication beg him to forgive his victims, he would grin like a wild beast, and woe betide those who saw his teeth thus bared! <br />The priests he permitted fearlessly to outrage their neighbors, and even took sympathetic pleasure in their robberies, fancying he was thus sharing their divine piety when he judged such cases, he thought he was doing the holy thing when he gave the decision to the priest and let him go free with his ill-gotten booty: justice, in his mind, meant the priests' getting the better of their opponents. When he himself thus illegally got possession of estates of people alive or dead, he would straightway make them over to one of the churches, gilding his violence with the color of piety-and so that his victims could not possibly get their property back. Furthermore he committed an inconceivable number of murders for the same cause: for in his zeal to gather all men into one <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> doctrine, he recklessly killed all who dissented, and this too he did in the name of piety. For he did not call it homicide, when those who perished happened to be of a belief that was different from his own. <br />So quenchless was his thirst for human blood; and with his wife, intent on this end, he neglected no possible excuse for slaughter. For these two were almost twins in their desires, though they pretended to differ: they were both scoundrels, however they affected to oppose each other, and thus destroyed their subjects. The man was lighter in character than a cloud of dust, and could be led to do anything any man wished him to do, so long as the matter did not require philanthropy or generosity. Flattery he swallowed whole, and his courtiers had no difficulty in persuading him that he was destined to rise as high as the sun and walk upon the clouds. </p>                        </div>

Such praise, if not irony, as this he treasured fondly in his mind. <br />Yet if he ever remarked on any man's virtue, he would soon revile him as a villain; and whenever he abused any of his subjects, he would next as inconsistently commend him, with no reason for the change. For what he thought was always the opposite of what he said and wished to seem to think. <br />How he was affected by friendship or enmity I have indicated by the evidence of his actions. For as a foe he was relentless and unswerving, and to his friends he was inconstant. Thus he ruined recklessly most of those who were loyal to him, but never became a friend to any whom he hated. Even those who seemed to be his nearest and dearest associates he betrayed, and after no long time, to please his wife or anybody else, though he was well aware that it was only because of their devotion to him that they perished. For he was openly faithless in everything, except indeed to inhumanity and avarice. From these ideals no man could divert him. Whatever his wife could not otherwise induce him to do, by suggesting the great profits to be hoped for in the matter she intended, she led him willingly to undertake. For if there were an ever infamous, he had no scruple against making a law and then repudiating it. Nor were his decisions made according to the laws himself had written: but whichever way was to his greater advantage, and promised the more elaborate bribe. Stealing, little by little, the property of his subjects, he saw no reason for feeling any shame; when, indeed, he did not somehow grab it all at once, either by bringing some unexpected accusation or by presenting a forged will. <br />There remained, while he ruled the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, no sure faith in God, no hope in religion, no defense in law, no security in business, no trust in a contract. When his officials were given any affair to handle for him, if they killed many of their victims and robbed the rest, they were looked upon by the Emperor with high favor, and given honorable mention for carrying out so perfectly his instructions. But if they showed any mercy and then returned to him, he frowned and was thenceforth their enemy. <br />Despising their qualms as old-fashioned, he called them no more to his service. Consequently many were eager to show him how wicked they were, even when they were really nothing of the sort. He made frequent promises, guaranteed with a sworn oath or by a written confirmation; and then purposely forgot them directly, thinking this summary negligence added to his importance. And <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> acted thus not only to his subjects, but to many of the enemy, as I have already said. </p>                        </div>

Indeed, he would often go without food for two days and nights, especially when the time before the festival called Easter enjoins such fasting. Then, as I have said, he often went without food for two days, living only on a little water and a few wild herbs, sleeping perhaps a single hour, and then spending the rest of the time walking up and down. <br />If, mark you, he had spent these periods in good works, matters might have been considerably alleviated.

In the first place, <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, having no natural aptitude toward the imperial dignity, neither assumed the royal manner nor thought it necessary to his prestige. In his accent, in his dress, and in his ideas he was a barbarian. When he wished to issue a decree, he did not give it out through the Quaestor's office, as is usual, but most frequently preferred to announce it himself, in spite of his barbarous accent; or sometimes he had a whole group of his intimates publish it together, so that those who were wronged by the edict did not know which one to complain against. <br />The secretaries who had performed this duty for centuries were no longer trusted with writing the Emperor's secret dispatches: he wrote them himself and practically everything else, too; so that in the few cases where he neglected to give instructions to city magistrates, they did not know where to go for advice concerning their duties. For he let no one in the Roman Empire decide anything independently, but taking everything upon himself with senseless arrogance, gave the verdict in cases before they came to trial, accepting the story of one of the litigants without listening to the other, and then pronounced the argument concluded; swayed not by any law or justice, but openly yielding to base greed. In accepting bribes the Emperor felt no shame, since hunger for wealth had devoured his decency. <br />Often the decrees of the Senate and those of the Emperor nominally conflicted. The Senate, however, sat only for pictorial effect, with no power to vote or do anything. It was assembled as a matter of form, to comply with the ancient law, and none of its members was permitted to utter a single word. The Emperor and his Consort took upon themselves the decisions of all matters in dispute, and their will of course prevailed. And if anybody thought his victory in such a case was insecure because it was illegal, he had only to give the Emperor more money, and a new law would immediately be passed revoking the former one. And if anybody else preferred the law that had been repealed, the ruler was quite willing to reestablish it in the same manner. <br />Under this reign of violence nothing was stable, but the balance of justice revolved in a circle, inclining to whichever side was able to weight it with the heavier amount of gold. Publicly in the Forum, and under the management of palace officials, the selling of court decisions and legislative actions was carried on. <br />The officers called Referendars were no longer satisfied to perform their duties of presenting to the Emperor the request of petitioners, and referring to the magistrates what he had decided in the petitioner's case; but gathering worthless testimony from all quarters, with false reports and misleading statements, deceived <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, who was naturally inclined to listen to that sort of thing; and then they would go back to the litigants, without telling them what had been said during their interview with the Emperor, to extort as much money as they desired. And no one dared oppose them. <br />The soldiers of the Pretorian guard, attending the judges of the imperial court in the palace, also used their power to influence decisions. Everybody, one might say, stepped from his rank and found he was now at liberty to walk roads where before there had been no path; all bars were down, even the names of former restrictions were lost. The government was like a Queen surrounded by romping children. But I must pass over further illustrations, as I said at the beginning of this chapter. <br />I must, however, mention the man who first taught the Emperor to sell his decisions. This was <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, and devilish eager to enrich himself. This <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> was the prince of flatterers, and apt at insinuating himself into the good will of the ignorant. Gaining the confidence of the Emperor, he turned the tyrant's folly toward the ruin of the people. This man was the first to show <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> how to exchange justice for money. <br />As soon as the latter thus learned how to be a thief, he never stopped; but advancing on this road, the evil grew so great that if anyone wished to win an unjust case against an honest man, he went first to <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, and agreeing that a share of the disputed property would be given to be divided between this man and the monarch, left the palace with his wrongful case already won. And <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> soon built up a great fortune in this way, became the lord of much land, and was most responsible for bringing the Roman state to its knees. <br />There was no security in contracts, no law, no oath, no written pledge, no penalty, no nothing: unless money had first been given to <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> and the Emperor. And even buying <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>'s support gave no certainty, for <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> was quite willing to take money from both sides: he felt no guilt at robbing either party, and then, when both trusted him, he would betray one and keep his promise to the other, at random. He saw nothing disgraceful in such double dealing, if only it brought him gain. That is the sort of person <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> was. </p>                        </div>

What she did, was never to please or obey anyone else; what she willed, she performed of her own accord and with all her might: and no one dared to intercede for any who fell in her way. For neither length of time, fulness of punishment, artifice of prayer, nor threat of death, whose vengeance sent by <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a> is feared by all mankind, could persuade her to abate her wrath. Indeed, no one ever saw <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> reconciled to anyone who had offended her, either while he lived or after he had departed this earth. Instead, the son of the dead would inherit the enmity of the Empress, together with the rest of his father's estate: and he in turn bequeathed it to the third generation. For her spirit was over ready to be kindled to the destruction of men, while cure for her fever there was none. <br />To her body she gave greater care than was necessary, if less than she thought desirable. For early she entered the bath and late she left it; and having bathed, went to breakfast. After breakfast she rested. At dinner and supper she partook of every kind of food and drink; and many hours she devoted to sleep, by day till nightfall, by night till the rising sun. Though she wasted her hours thus intemperately, what time of the day remained she deemed ample for managing the Roman Empire. <br />And if the Emperor entrusted any business to anyone without consulting her, the result of the affair for that officer would be his early and violent removal from favor and a most shameful death. <br />It was easy for <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> to look after everything, not only because of his calmness of temper, but because he hardly ever slept, as I have said, and because he was not chary with his audiences. For great opportunity was given to people, however obscure and unknown, not only to be admitted to the tyrant's presence, but to converse with him, and in private. <br />But to the Queen's presence even the highest officials could not enter without great delay and trouble; like slaves they had to wait all day in a small and stuffy antechamber, for to absent himself was a risk no official dared to take. So they stood there on their tiptoes, each straining to keep his face above his neighbor's, so that eunuchs, as they came out from the audience room, would see them. Some would be called, perhaps, after several days; and when they did enter to her presence in great fear, they were quickly dismissed as soon as they had made obeisance and kissed her feet.

For his smile was not to be trusted, and against her frown nothing could be done. There was this superficial difference between them in attitude and manner; but in avarice, bloodthirstiness, and dissimulation they utterly agreed. They were both liars of the first water. <br />And if anyone who had fallen out of favor with <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> was accused of some minor and insignificant error, she immediately fabricated further unwarranted charges against the man, and built the matter up into a really serious accusation. Any number of indictments were brought, and a court appointed to plunder the victim, with judges selected by her, to compete with themselves to see which one could please her most in fitting his decision to the Empress's inhumanity. And so the property of the victim would be straightway confiscated, and after he was cruelly whipped, even if he perhaps belonged to an ancient and noble family, she would callously have him sentenced to exile or to death. <br />But if any of her favorites happened to be caught in the act of murder or any other serious crime, she ridiculed and belittled the efforts of their accusers, and compelled them, however unwillingly, to quash the charge.

But <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> was warned, and told her eunuchs, as soon as the patrician should be admitted to her presence, to surround him in a body and listen to her words; telling them what to say after she had spoken. And when the patrician was admitted to her private quarters, he kissed her feet in the customary manner and, weeping, addressed her: <br />Highness, it is hard for a patrician to ask for money. For what in other men brings sympathy and pity, in one of my rank is considered disgraceful. Any other man suffering hardships from poverty may plead this before his creditors, and receive immediate relief from his difficulty; but a patrician, not knowing whence he can find the wherewithal to pay his creditors, would be ashamed in the first place to admit it. And if he did say this, he could never persuade them that one of such rank could know penury. And even if he did persuade them, he would be making himself suffer the most shameful and intolerable disgrace imaginable. <br />Yet, Highness, such is my plight. I have creditors to whom I owe money, while others owe money to me. And those whom I owe, who are pressing me for payment, I cannot, for the sake of my reputation, attempt to cheat of their due; while my debtors, for they are not patricians, deny me with unmanly excuses. I charge you, therefore; I beseech and beg of you, to aid me in what is right, and release me from my present trouble. <br />So he said, and the Queen answered musically: <br />Patrician Mr. Such-and-such- whereupon the chorus of eunuchs sang: <br />Your hernia seems to bother you much! <br />And when the man entreated her again, making a second speech similar to his first one, she answered as before, and the chorus sang the same refrain: till, giving it up, the poor wretch bowed and went home. <br />Most of the year the Empress resided in the suburbs on the seashore, especially in the place called Heraeum [Ἡρίῳ - <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412291SHie class=place long=29.094 lat=41.179>Hieron</a>?], and the numerous crowd of her attendants was subjected to great inconvenience.

And accordingly he very soon became the owner of great and ill-gotten wealth. Finding him insolent and always trying to oppose her, <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> denounced him to the Emperor. At first she was unsuccessful; but before long she took the matter in her own hands: embarked the man on a ship, sailing to a determined port, had his head shaved, and compelled him against his will to become a priest. And <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, pretending he knew nothing of the matter, never asked where on earth <a href=/people/1008 target=_blank>Priscus</a> was, nor ever after mentioned him: remaining silent as if he had utterly forgotten him.

Instead of accusing him directly, she decided to have him cruelly whipped in her presence (though they say she was madly in love with the fellow) without explaining her reason for the punishment. What became of the man after that we do not know, nor has any one ever seen him since. For if the Queen wanted to keep any of her actions concealed, it remained secret and unmentioned; and neither was any who knew of the matter allowed to tell it to his closest friend, nor could any who tried to learn what had happened ever find out, no matter how much of a busybody he was. <br />No other tyrant since mankind began ever inspired such fear, since not a word could be spoken against her without her hearing of it: her multitude of spies brought her the news of whatever was said and done in public or in private. And when she decided the time had come to take vengeance on any offender, she did as follows. Summoning the man, if he happened to be notable, she would privately hand him over to one of her confidential attendants, and order that he be escorted to the farthest boundary of the Roman realm. And her agent, in the dead of night, covering the victim's face with a hood and binding him, would put him on board a ship and accompany him to the place selected by <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>.

Basanius, warned of her displeasure, fled to the Church of Michael the Archangel. She immediately sent the Prefect after him, charging Basanius however not with slander, but pederasty. And the Prefect, dragging the man from the church, had him flogged intolerably while all the populace, when they saw a Roman citizen of good standing so shamefully mistreated, straightway sympathized with him, and cried so loud to let him go that <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a> must have heard their reproaches. Whereupon the Empress punished him further, and had him castrated so that he bled to death, and his estate was confiscated; though his case had never been tried. Thus, when this female was enraged, no church offered sanctuary, no law gave protection, no intercession of the people brought mercy to her victim; nor could anything else in the world stop her. <br />Thus she took a hatred of a certain <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>, because he belonged to the Greens: a man urbane and beloved by all, including the Emperor himself. None the less she wrathfully denounced him as homosexual. Bribing two of his servants, she presented them as accusers and witnesses against their master. However, as he was tried publicly and not in secret, as was her usual practise in such cases, the judges chosen were many and of distinguished character, because of <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>'s high rank; and after cross-examination of the evidence of the servants, they decided it was insufficient to prove the case, especially as the latter were only children. <br />So the Empress locked up <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a>, one of <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>'s friends, in one of her private dungeons; and there first with flattery, then with flogging, tried to overwhelm him.

Finding that nothing else could be done, she abandoned the attempt and was compelled to give birth to the child. The father of the baby, seeing that <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> was at her wit's end and vexed because motherhood interfered with her usual recreations, and suspecting with good reason that she would do away with the child, took the infant from her, naming him John, and sailed with the baby to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>. Later, when he was on the verge of death and John was a lad of fourteen, the father told him the whole story about his mother. <br />So the boy, after he had performed the last rites for his departed father, shortly after came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and announced his presence to the Empress's chamberlains. And they, not conceiving the possibility of her acting so inhumanly, reported to the mother that her son John had come. Fearing the story would get to the ears of her husband, <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> bade her son be brought face to face with her. As soon as he entered, she handed him over to one of her servants who was ordinarily entrusted with such commissions. And in what manner the poor lad was removed from the world, I cannot say, for no one has ever seen him since, not even after the Queen died. The ladies of the court at this time were nearly all of abandoned morals. They ran no risk in being faithless to their husbands, as the sin brought no penalty: even if caught in the act, they were unpunished, for all they had to do was to go to the Empress, claim the charge was not proven, and start a countersuit against their husbands. The latter, defeated without a trial, had to pay a fine of twice the dower, and were usually whipped and sent to prison; and the next time they saw their adulterous wives again, the ladies would be daintily entertaining their lovers more openly than ever. Indeed, many of the latter gained promotion and pay for their amorous services. After one such experience, most men who suffered these outrages from their wives preferred thereafter to be complaisant instead of being whipped, and gave them every liberty rather than seem to be spying on their affairs. <br /><a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>'s idea was to control everything in the state to suit herself. Civil and ecclesiastical offices were all in her hand, and there was only one thing she was always careful to inquire about and guard as the standard of her appointments: that no honest gentleman should be given high rank, for fear he would have scruples against obeying her commands. <br />She arranged all marriages as if that were her divine right, and voluntary betrothals before a ceremony were unknown. A wife would suddenly be found for a man, chosen not because she pleased him, which is customary even among the barbarians, but because <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> willed it. And the same was true of brides, who were forced to take men they did not desire. Frequently she even made the bride jump out of her marriage bed, and for no reason at all sent the bridegroom away before he had reached the chorus of his nuptial song; and her only angry words would be that the girl displeased her. </p>                        </div>

For in each of these incursions, I should say, more than two hundred thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were slain or enslaved, so that all this country became a desert like that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a>. <br />Such were the results of the wars in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> and in Europe.

For while <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> himself was bad enough, as I have duly shown elsewhere, <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> was the one who each time gave him an occasion for the war. For he took no heed to fit his policies to an appropriate time, but did everything at the wrong moment: in time of peace or truce he ever craftily contrived to find pretext for war with his neighbors; while in time of war, he unreasonably lost interest, and hesitated too long in preparing for the campaign, grudging the necessary expenses; and instead of putting his mind on the war, gave his attention to stargazing and research as to the nature of God. Yet he would not abandon hostilities, since he was so bloodthirsty and tyrannical, even when thus unable to conquer the enemy because of his negligence in meeting the situation. </p>                        </div>

Since justice and impartial punishment were seldom directed against offenders, and each of the two factions tried to win the favor of the Emperor over the other, neither party kept the peace. Each, according to his smile or his frown, was now terrified, now encouraged. Sometimes they attacked each other in full strength, sometimes in smaller groups, or even lay in ambush against the first single man of the opposite party who came along. For thirty-two years, without ever ceasing, they performed outrages against each other, many of them being punished with death by the municipal Prefect. <br />However, punishment for these offenses was mostly directed against the Greens. <br />Furthermore the persecution of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=ethnic long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaritans</a> and the so-called heretics filled the Roman realm with blood.

For <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a>, who had been the most provident and economical of all monarchs, fearing (which indeed happened) that the inheritor of his Empire should find himself in need of money, would perhaps plunder his subjects, filled all the treasuries to their brim with gold before he completed his span of life. All of this <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> immediately exhausted, between his senseless building program on the coast and his lavish presents to the barbarians; though one might have thought that it would take the most extravagant of Emperors a hundred years to disburse such wealth. For the treasurers and those in charge of the other imperial properties had been able, during <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a>'s rule of more than twenty-seven years over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, easily to accumulate 3,200 gold centenaries; and of all these nothing at all was left, for it had been squandered by this man while <a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a> still lived; as I have already related. <br />What he illegally confiscated and wasted during his lifetime, no tale, no reckoning, no count could ever make manifest. For like an ever flowing river swallowing more each day he pillaged his subjects, to disgorge it straightway on the barbarians. <br />Having thus carried away the public wealth, he turned his eye upon his private subjects. Most of them he immediately robbed of their estates, snatching them arbitrarily by force, bringing false charges against whoever in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and each other city were reputed to be rich. <br />Some he accused of polytheism, others of heresy against the orthodox <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> faith; some of pederasty, others of love affairs with nuns, or other unlawful intercourse; some of starting sedition, or of favoring the Greens, or treason against himself, or anything else; or he made himself the arbitrary heir of the dead and even of the living, when he could. Such were the subtleties of his actions. And how he profited from the insurrection against himself which is called Nika, making himself heir to the Senators, I have already shown; and how, some time before the sedition broke out, he privately robbed each man of his estate. <br />To all the barbarians, on every occasion, he gave great sums: to those of the East and those of the West and to the North and to the South, as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>, and over all the inhabited earth; so that nations whose very names we had never heard of, we now learned to know, seeing their ambassadors for the first time. For when they learned of this man's folly, they came to him and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> in floods from the whole world. And he with no hesitation, but overjoyed at this, and thinking it good luck to drain the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> of their prosperity and fling it to barbarian men or to the waves of the sea, daily sent each one home with his arms full of presents. <br />Thus all the barbarians became masters of all the wealth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, either being presented with it by the Emperor, or by ravaging the Roman Empire, selling their prisoners for ransom, and bartering for truces. And the prophecy of the dream I mentioned above, came to pass in this visible reality. </p>                        </div>

First he appointed a new municipal magistrate, with the power to license shopkeepers to sell their wares at whatever prices they desired: for which privilege they paid an annual tax. Accordingly, people buying their provisions in these shops had to pay three times what the stuff was worth, and complainants had no redress, though great harm was thus done; for the magistrates saw to it that the imperial tax was fattened accordingly, which was to their advantage. Thus the government officials shared in this disgraceful business, while the shopkeepers, empowered to act illegally, cheated unbearably those who had to buy from them, not only by raising their prices many times over, as I have said, but by defrauding customers in other unheard-of ways. <br />Again he licensed many monopolies, as they -are called; selling the freedom of his subjects to those who were willing to undertake this reprehensible traffic, after he had exacted his price for the privilege. To those who made this arrangement with him, he gave the power to manage the business however they pleased; and he sold this privilege openly, even to all the other magistrates. And since the Emperor always got his little share of the plundering, these officials and their subordinates in charge of the work, did their robbing with small anxiety. <br />As if the formerly appointed magistrates were not enough for this purpose, he created two new ones; though the municipal Prefect had formerly been able to look after all criminal charges. His real reason for the change was, of course, so that he could have additional informers, and thus misuse the innocent with more celerity. Of the two new officials, one, nominally appointed to punish thieves, was called Praetor of the People; the other was charged with the punishment of cases of pederasty, illegal intercourse with women, blasphemy, and heresy; and his official name was Quaestor. <br />Now the Praetor, whenever he found anything very valuable among the stolen goods that came to his notice, was supposed to give it to the Emperor and say that no owner had appeared to claim it. In this way the Emperor continually got possession of priceless goods. And the Quaestor, when he condemned persons coming before him, confiscated as much as he pleased of their properties, and the Emperor shared with him each time in the lawlessly gained riches of other people. For the subordinates of these magistrates neither produced accusers nor offered witnesses when these cases came to trial, but during all this time the accused were put to death, and their properties seized without due trial and examination. <br />Later, this murdering devil ordered these officials and the municipal Prefect to deal with all criminal charges on equal terms: telling them to vie with each other to see which of them could destroy the most people in the shortest time. And one of them asked him at once, they say, If somebody is sometime denounced before all three of us, which of us shall have jurisdiction over the case? Whereupon he replied, Whichever of you acts faster than the rest. <br />Thus shamelessly he debased the Quaestor's office, which former emperors almost without exception had held in high regard, taking care that the men they appointed to it were experienced and wise, law-abiding, and uncorruptible by bribes; since otherwise it would be a calamity to the state, if men holding this high office were ignorant or avaricious. <br />But the first man that this Emperor appointed to the office was Tribonian, whose actions I have fully related elsewhere. And when Tribonian departed from this world, <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> seized a portion of his estate, though a son and many other children were left destitute when the fellow ended the final day of his life. Junilus, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=demonym long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyan</a>, was next appointed to this office: a man who had never even heard the law, for he was not a rhetorician; he knew the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> letters, but as far as Greek went, he had never even gone to school, and was unable to speak the language. Frequently when he tried to say a Greek word, he was laughed at by his servants. And he was so damned greedy for base gain, that he thought nothing of publicly selling the Emperor's decrees. For one gold coin he would hold out his palm to anybody without hesitation. And for not less than seven years' time the State shared the ridicule earned by this petty grafter. <br />When Junilus completed the measure of his life, <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a> was appointed Quaestor: a man not unacquainted with law, but exceeding young, and without actual experience in court; and the most thievish bully among men. Of this person <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> was very fond, and became his bosom friend, since through him the Emperor saw he could steal and run the office as he wished. Consequently, <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a> had great wealth in a short time, and assumed an air of prodigious pomp, with his nose in the clouds despising all men; and even those who wanted to offer him large bribes had to entrust them to those who were in his special confidence, to offer him together with their requests; for it was never possible to meet or talk with him, except when he was running to the Emperor or had just left him, and even then he trotted by in a great hurry, lest his time be wasted by somebody who had no money to give him. This is what the Emperor did to the quaestorship. </p>                        </div>

For this <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> left them unpunished, awaiting the time when they should have gained immense riches; as soon as this happened, he brought some charge against them for which there was no defense, and confiscated their entire property all at once, as he had done to John of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>. <br />Everyone appointed to office during this period of course became immensely wealthy at once, with two exceptions: Phocas, whom I have mentioned elsewhere as an utterly honest man, who remained uncorrupted by gain during his office; and <a href=/people/837 target=_blank>Bassus</a>, who was appointed later.

When <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> had collected this money from such bargainers, he gave them complete power over their subjects, by which, pillaging the country and the inhabitants, they were to become rich.

They saw no peril and felt no shame in this conduct; rather, they anticipated that the more they wrongfully killed and plundered, the higher would be their reputation; for the name of murderer and robber would prove the energy of their service.

But the law was not over a year old before he himself, disregarding its words and maledictions, shamelessly put these offices up for sale; and not secretly, but in the public Forum. And the buyers of the offices, breaking their oaths also, plundered more than ever. <br />Later he contrived another unheard-of scheme. The offices which he believed to be the most powerful in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and the other large cities, he decided not to sell any longer as he had been doing, but put them in the hands of picked men on a fixed salary, who were commanded to turn over all revenues to himself. And these men, after receiving their pay, worked fearlessly and carried off everything on earth, going around tin the name of their office to rob the subjects. .

And at the same time nearly all the soldiers, because they had not been given their due pay, assembled mutinously throughout the city and created a great uproar. The Emperor turned now against Peter and decided to remove him from office, because of the above-mentioned complaints, and since he heard he had hidden a devilishly large amount of plunder of which he had robbed the State.

For she herself was utterly savage and bursting with inhumanity, and thought those who served her should be as nearly as possible of a character with herself. They say, too, that she had been involuntarily charmed by magic to become Peter's friend; for this Barsyames was a devotee of sorcerers and demons, and was admittedly a member of the Manichaeans. Although the Empress had heard all this, she did not withdraw her favor from the man, but decided to prefer and favor him all the more on this account. For she herself from childhood had consorted with magicians and sorcerers, as her pursuits inclined her toward them and all her life she believed in the black art and had great confidence in it. <br />They even say that it was not so much by flattery that she made <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> eat from her hand as by demoniac power. For this was not a kindly, just, or good man, to prevail over such machinations, but plainly overmastered by his passion for murder and money; easily yielding to those who deceived and flattered him, and in the midst of his fondest plans he could be diverted with facility, like a bit of dust caught up by the wind. None of his kindred or his friends had any sure confidence in him, and his plans were continually subject to change. Thus, he was an easy mark to sorcery, as I have said, and with no difficulty fell into the power of <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>. And it was for this reason that the Empress regarded Peter, practised in such arts, with great affection. <br />So it was all the Emperor could do to remove him from office; and at <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>'s insistence, soon afterward he made him chief of the treasurers, removing John from this position which he had given him only a few months before. This man John was a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/320350RPal class=place long=35.0001 lat=32.0206>Palestine</a>, exceedingly good and gentle, ignorant of the possibility of increasing his private fortune, and had never wronged a single man. All the people loved him; and therefore he could not please <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> and his wife, who, as soon as they saw among their agents an unexpected decent gentleman, became faint with horror, and determined to get rid of him at the first possible opportunity. <br />So it was that Peter succeeded John as chief of the treasurers, and once more became the cause of great calamities. Embezzling most of, the moneys which had been set apart since the time of a long-past Emperor to be distributed each year to the many poor, he made himself thus unjustly rich at the expense of the people, and handed a share of it to the Emperor. Those who were thus deprived of their dole sat around in great grief. Furthermore, he did not coin the customary amount of gold, but issued a less amount, a thing that had never happened before. And this is how the Emperor dealt with the magistracies. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, during thirty-two years' time, made no such concession to his subjects, and consequently those who were unable to pay had to flee their country and never return. Others, more prosperous, grew weary of trying to answer the continual accusations of the informers that the tax they had always paid was less than required by the present rate on their estates. For these unfortunates feared not so much the imposition of a new tax as that they should be burdened by the unjust weight of additional back taxes for so many years. Many, indeed, preferred to abandon their property to the informers or to the confiscation of the state. <br />Besides, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> and the <a href=/people/11026 target=_blank>Saracens</a> had ravaged most of <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, and the Huns and Slavs all of Europe; captured cities had either been razed to their foundations, or made to pay terrible tribute; men had been carried off into slavery together with all their property, and every district had been deserted by its inhabitants because of the daily raids: yet no tax was remitted, except in the case of cities that had been captured by the enemy, and then only for one year. Yet if, as the Emperor <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a> had done, he had decided to exempt the captured cities from taxation for seven years, even so I believe, he would not have done as much as he should. <br />For <a href=/people/12226 target=_blank>Cabades</a> retired after doing hardly any damage to the buildings, but <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> burned to the foundations everything he took, and left greater ruin in his track. Yet to these remaining sufferers, for whom he made this ridiculous remission of taxes, and to all the others, who had many times been invaded by the army of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, and been continually plundered by the Huns and barbarous <a href=/people/11026 target=_blank>Saracens</a> in the East, and to those <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who had met an equal fate daily from the barbarians in Europe, this Emperor straightway became a more bitter foe than all the barbarians put together. For as soon as the enemy had retreated, the landowners immediately were overwhelmed by new requisitions, imposts and levies. <br />What these were I will now explain. Those who owned land were compelled to feed the Roman army, according to a special assessment determined by the actual emergency but arbitrarily fixed by law. And if sufficient provisions for the soldiers and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> were not to be found on their estates, these unfortunates had to go out and buy them at an excessive price, wherever they could, even if they had to transport them from a distant country to the place where the army was quartered , and then distribute them to the army officials not at a legal price, but at the whim of the commanders. This requisition, called co-operative buying, took the heart out of the landowners. For it made their annual taxes easily ten times what they had been, as they had not only to feed the army, but often to transport grain from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. Barsyames was not the only one who dared this outrage, for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=demonym long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocian</a> before him had done the same, and Barsyames's successors after him. And this is what co-operative buying meant. <br />The impost was an unexpected ruin which suddenly attacked the landowners, pulling up their hope of livelihood by the roots. In the case of estates that had run down and been deserted, whose owners and farmer tenants had either perished or left the country, on account of their misfortunes, and disappeared, a ruthless tax was still laid on those who had already lost all. This was called the impost, levied frequently during this time. <br />The nature of the third levy was briefly as follows: Many losses, especially at this time, were suffered by the cities, whose causes and extents I refrain from describing now, or the tale would be endless. These losses the landowners had to repair, by special assessment on each individual; and their troubles did not even stop there. The pestilence, which had attacked the inhabited world, did not spare the Roman Empire. Most of its farmers had perished of it, so that their lands were deserted; nevertheless <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> did not exempt the owners of these properties. Their annual taxes were not remitted, and they had to pay not only their own, but their deceased neighbors' share. And in addition to all of this, these land-poor wretches had to quarter the soldiers in their best rooms, while they themselves during this time existed in the meanest and poorest part of their dwellings. <br />Such were the constant afflictions of mankind under the rule of <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> and <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>; for there was no release from war or any other of these calamities in all their time. <br />While I am on the subject of quartering, I should not fail to mention that the householders in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> had to quarter seventy thousand barbarians, so that they got no pleasure from their own houses, and were greatly inconvenienced in many ways. </p>                        </div>

Their method each year was as follows. It was the regulation that different ranks in the army receive different pay: the young and newly enlisted received less, those who had seen hard service and had advanced half way up the list received more, and the veterans who should soon retire from service had a still higher rating, so that they could live on their savings as private citizens, and when their span of life was complete, might be able to leave some consolation to their families. In this way, the soldiers step by step arose in rank as their older comrades died or retired, and each man's pay fitted his degree of seniority. <br />But the paymasters forbade the erasing from the lists of the names of soldiers who died, even when many perished together, as frequently happened in the constant wars. Nor did they fill the vacancies in the lists, even after considerable time. <br />The result of this was that the number of soldiers grew continually less, and those who survived their dead comrades were deprived of their proper advancement in rank and pay; while the paymasters handed over to <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> the money that should have gone to these soldiers all this time. <br />Furthermore, they fined the soldiers for other personal and unjust reasons, as a reward for the perils they underwent in the battlefield: on the charge that they were Greeks, as if none of that nation could be brave; or that they were not commissioned by the Emperor to serve, even when they showed his signature to that effect, which the paymasters did not hesitate to question; or that they had been absent from duty for a few days. <br />Later, some of the palace guards were sent throughout the whole Roman Empire to investigate how many on the military lists were unfit for service; and some were relieved of their uniform for being old and use less, so that for the rest of their lives they had to beg their meals of the charitable in the public Forum, exhibiting their tears and lamentations to passersby; and the rest, lest they might suffer a similar fate, handed over their savings as a bribe, with the result that all the soldiers lost heart for their profession, were reduced to poverty, and had no further enthusiasm for campaigning. <br />This was ruinous to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and their authority in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>; and the paymaster <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, sent thither, had the audacity to reproach the soldiers for their poor morale; while he exacted further money from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>, on the pretext of punishing them for their negotiations with Theodoric and the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>. The common soldiers, indeed, were not the only ones to be reduced to poverty and helplessness by these commissioners; for all the staff officers, under the generals, who had formerly been in high esteem, were utterly impoverished and in danger of famine, as they had no money left with which to buy their customary provisions. <br />Speaking of the soldiers reminds me to add further details. The Roman emperors hitherto had stationed large armies on all frontiers of the State to protect its boundaries; and particularly in the East, to repel incursions of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and <a href=/people/11026 target=_blank>Saracens</a>. These border troops <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> used so ill and meanly from the start that their pay became four or five years overdue; and when peace was declared between the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, these poor men, instead of sharing in the fruits of peace, were forced to contribute to the public treasury whatever was owed them; after which they were summarily discharged from the army. Thereafter the boundaries of the Roman Empire were unguarded, and the soldiers were left suddenly on the hands of charity. </p>                        </div>

Originally they were chosen to this preferred company by special merit, from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a>; but from the time when <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> became Emperor, it was possible for anyone, no matter how poor or cowardly a soldier, to wear this uniform. Now when <a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a> came to the throne, this <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> distributed the honor among a large number upon their paying him a considerable price for it. And when he saw there was no further possible vacancy, he enrolled two thousand more, whom he called Supernumeraries. When he himself took over the throne, he immediately disbanded the Supernumeraries, without giving them back any of the money they had paid him. <br />This, however, is what he schemed with reference to the Student Corps. Whenever an army was about to be sent against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, or the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, he ordered them to pack for service with the regulars, though he knew well they were utterly unfit for the campaign. And they, trembling at the possibility of active service, surrendered their pay for the period of the war. The Students had this unpleasant experience more than once. Also Peter, during all the time he was Master of Offices, worried them daily with unheard-of thefts. <br />For he was a gentle seeming and unassuming man, but the biggest thief alive, and simply bursting with sordid meanness. It was this Peter whom I mentioned before as responsible for the murder of Amasaluntha, Theodoric's daughter. <br />There were also others in the palace guard of much higher rank; and the more they paid into the treasury for their commissions, the higher was their military rating. These were called Domestics and Protectors, and had always been exempt from active service. </p>                        </div>

And every five years commissioners had been sent over all the Roman Empire to give each soldier five gold staters. Not to comply with this custom was simply unthinkable.

As time goes on, their rank advances as their superiors die or retire and they replace them, until they reach the topmost dignity. Those who attained this highest rank, according to the long-established rule, were paid more than one hundred gold centenaries a year, so as to have a competence for their old age, and that they might be able to discharge their many debts: which resulted in the affairs of state being competently and smoothly managed. But this Emperor deprived them of nearly all this money, to the great harm of these officials and everybody else. For poverty, attacking them first, soon spread to the others who formerly shared their solvency.

Now in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespontine</a> strait there had been no customhouse, though an officer was stationed by the Emperor at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264PAby class=place long=26.4091 lat=40.1951>Abydus</a>, to see that no ship carrying a cargo of arms should pass to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> without orders from the Emperor, and that no one should set sail from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> without papers signed by the proper officials; for no ship was allowed to leave <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> without permission of the bureau of the Master of Offices.

And he, accordingly, never allowed any of the vessels putting in to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> to leave until their owners either paid clearance fees or submitted to taking a cargo for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. Some of the ship owners, however, refused to submit to this compulsion, preferring to burn their boats rather than sail at such a price; and considered themselves lucky to escape with this sacrifice. Those who had to continue sailing in order to live, on the other hand, charged merchants three times the former rate for carrying their wares: so that the merchants had to recoup these losses by selling their stuff to individual purchasers at a correspondingly high price, with the result that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> nearly died of starvation. This was the state of affairs throughout the Empire. <br />I must not omit, I suppose, mention of what the rulers did to the petty coinage. Formerly the money changers had customarily given two hundred and ten obols, or folleis, for one gold stater; but <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> and <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>, as a scheme for their private profit, ordered that only one hundred and eighty obols should be given for a stater. In this way they clipped off one sixth of each gold coin possessed by the people. <br />By licensing monopolies of nearly all kinds of wares, these rulers daily oppressed the purchasers; the sale of clothes was the only thing they left untouched, and even in this case they contrived the following scheme. </p>                        </div>

This seemed to everybody impossible and futile. For it was not practicable for the merchants who imported silk at a higher price, to sell it to their customers for less. Consequently they decided to stop dealing in it at all, and privately got rid of their present stock as best they could, selling it to such notables as took pleasure in throwing away their money for such finery, or thought they had to wear it. <br />The Empress, hearing what was going on through her whispering spies, without stopping to verify the rumor, immediately confiscated these persons' wares, fining them a centenary in addition.

For he stopped all their living subsidies, which former emperors had paid men of these professions from the public treasury. <br />Also all of the taxes which the municipalities had devoted to public use or entertainments, he transferred arbitrarily to the imperial treasury. No consideration was now given to any physician or teacher; no one dared pay any attention to public buildings; there were no public lights in any city, nor any entertainments for the citizens. For the theaters, hippodromes, and circuses, in which his wife had been born, bred and educated, were all discontinued. Later he even stopped the public spectacles in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, to avoid spending the usual State money on them, by which an almost incalculable number of people had got their livelihood. On these, individually and collectively, ruin and desuetude descended, and as if some cataclysm had fallen on them from <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a>, their happiness was slain. And no other subject was spoken of among men, at home or in public or in the churches, than their calamities, their sufferings, and their overwhelming by the latest misfortune. Such was the state of affairs in the cities. <br />Of what is left to tell, this is worth mentioning. Each year two Roman consuls were appointed: one at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, the other at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. And whoever was called to this honor was expected to spend more than twenty gold centenaries on the public; some of which came from the Consul's private purse, but most was furnished by the Emperor. This money was given to those others whom I have mentioned, but mostly to the poor and those employed in the theater; all of which was to the good of the city. But from the time <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> came to power, these distributions were not made at the customary time; for sometimes a Consul remained in office for year after year, till finally people wearied of hoping for a new one, even in their dreams. As a result, universal poverty was the case, since the usual annual relief was no longer afforded to subjects; and in every way all that they had was taken from them by their ruler. <br />Now I think I have shown sufficiently how this destroyer devoured all the public moneys and robbed each member of the Senate, publicly and privately, of all his estates; and how by bringing false charges he confiscated the properties of everybody else who was reputed to be wealthy, I imagine I have adequately told: as in the case of the soldiers, subordinate officers, and the palace guard; the farmers and landowners; those whose business is in words; merchants, ship owners and sailors; mechanics, artisans, and market dealers; those whose livelihood is in the theater; and indeed everyone else, who was affected in turn by the damage done to these. And now let us see what he did to those in need of alms: the poor, the beggars, and the diseased; for what he did to the priests will be described later. <br />First, as I have said, he took control of all the shops, licensed monopolies of all the wares most necessary to life, and exacted a price of more than triple their worth from the citizens. And other details of what he did I would not even attempt to catalogue in an endless book, since they were simply uncountable. <br />He put a bitter and perpetual tax on the sale of bread, which the day laborers, the poor and the infirm could not help buying. From this source he demanded three centenaries a year, with the result that the bakers filled their loaves with shells and dust; for the Emperor had no scruples against profiting meanly from even this unholy adulteration. Those in charge of the markets, turning this trick to their private gain, with ease became very wealthy and reduced the poor to an unexpected famine even in prosperous times; since it was not permitted to bring in grain from other places, but all were forced to eat bread purchased in the city. </p>                        </div>

On the other hand, he threw away great sums of money senselessly on buildings by the seashore and elsewhere, in all the suburbs, as if the palaces in which all the former emperors had been content to dwell were not enough for this pair. So it was not to save money, but to destroy his subjects, that he refused to rebuild the aqueduct; for no one in all history had ever been born among men more eager than <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> to get hold of money, and then to throw it immediately away again. Through the two things left to them to drink and eat, water and bread, this Emperor injured those who were in the last extremes of poverty; making the one hard to procure at all, and the other too expensive to buy. <br />This he did not only to the poor in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, but to inhabitants elsewhere, as I shall now relate.

He was a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=demonym long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaritan</a>, but so as not to lose his official rank and power, became a nominal <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a>; while his father and brother, encouraged by his authority, continued in their ancestral faith in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325355UScy class=place long=35.5019 lat=32.502>Scythopolis</a>, where, with his consent, they persecuted the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> intolerably.

And following instructions in letters from the Emperor, which came frequently and cogently, <a href=/people/3684 target=_blank>Rhodon</a> ordered the man to be scourged; after which, while he was being racked by the torture, he up and died. <br />When news of this reached the Emperor, at the Empress's instigation he expressed horror at what had been done by Paul, <a href=/people/3684 target=_blank>Rhodon</a> and Arsenius: as if he had forgotten his own instructions to these men. He now appointed <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a>, a patrician from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, Governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, and sent certain priests of good reputation to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, to investigate the matter; among these were the Archdeacon of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, Pelagius, who was commissioned by Pope Vigilius to act as his legate. <br />Paul, convicted of the murder, was removed from the bishopric; <a href=/people/3684 target=_blank>Rhodon</a>, who fled to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, was beheaded by the Emperor and his estates confiscated, although the man produced thirteen letters which the Emperor had written him, insisting and commanding him to serve Paul in everything and never to oppose him, so that he could fulfill his every wish in religious matters. <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a>, at <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>'s order, crucified Arsenius, and the Emperor confiscated his property, though he had no charge to bring against him except that he had been intimate with Paul. Now whether his actions in this matter were just or otherwise, I cannot say; but I shall soon show why I have described the affair. <br />Some time later, Paul came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and offered the Emperor seven gold centenaries if he would reinstate him in the holy office from which, he claimed, he had been illegally removed. <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> genially took the money, treated the man with great respect, and agreed to make him Bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> again very soon, though another now held the office; as if he did not know that he himself had put to death Paul's friends and helpers, and had confiscated their estates. <br />So the <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> zealously extended every effort to arrange this matter, and Paul was generally expected to regain his bishopric one way or another. But Vigilius, who was in the capital at the time, decided not to yield to the Emperor's command in such a case; and he said he could not annul a decision which Pelagius had given as his legate. And the Emperor, whose only idea was to get the money, dismissed the matter. <br />Here is another similar case. </p>                        </div>

There was one <a href=/people/1008 target=_blank>Priscus</a> in the City of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347367UEme class=place long=36.7143 lat=34.7239>Emesa</a>, who was a skilful forger of others' handwriting, and a rare artist in such crime. It happened that the church of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347367UEme class=place long=36.7143 lat=34.7239>Emesa</a> had a long time before inherited the property of a distinguished patrician named Mammian, of illustrious family and of great wealth. During <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>'s reign, <a href=/people/1008 target=_blank>Priscus</a> inventoried all the families of the mentioned city, so as to find which were adequately rich to be worth plundering, and after he investigated their family history, and found ancient letters in their ancestors' handwriting, he forged documents purporting to be their agreements to pay to Mammian large sums of money which were supposed to have been left with them by him as a deposit. <br />The amount of money mentioned as an obligation in these forgeries was not less than one hundred gold centenaries. He also imitated very craftily the writing of a certain notary public whose office was in the Forum during Mammian's lifetime: a man of high reputation for truth and every other virtue, who used to draw up all the citizens' documents, fixing them with his own seal. To those who were in charge of ecclesiastical affairs at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347367UEme class=place long=36.7143 lat=34.7239>Emesa</a> he gave these documents, after they agreed that he would get a share of the money to be obtained from the matter. <br />But since there was a statute of limitations barring action after thirty years, except in mortgages and certain other matters, where the limit was forty years, they formed the following plan. Going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and offering the Emperor large sums of money, they begged him to join in accomplishing the destruction of their innocent fellow citizens. He took the money, and without scruple published a new law, to the effect that the statute of limitations did not apply to the church, but claims connected with that institution might be brought at any time within a hundred years. And this was now the law not only in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347367UEme class=place long=36.7143 lat=34.7239>Emesa</a>, but throughout the whole Roman Empire. </p>                        </div>

This <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a>, whom I recently mentioned, he removed from office and in his stead appointed John, an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a>, surnamed Laxarion. When Pelagius, a particular friend of <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a>'s, heard of this, he asked the Emperor if the report about Laxarion's appointment were true. And he immediately denied it, assuring him he had done nothing of the sort; and gave him a letter to take to <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a> charging him to stick tight to his office and give it over to nobody, as he, <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, had not the slightest idea of removing him from it at this time. <br />Now John had an uncle in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> named Eudemon, of consular rank and great wealth, who was at the time Count of the imperial estates. This Eudemon, when he heard the rumor, also went to the Emperor to inquire if the office were really going to his nephew. And <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, in contradiction of what he had written to <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a>, now wrote a document to John, telling him to take over the office by all means, as his intentions were unchanged. John, trusting in this instruction, ordered <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a> to retire from his office as he had been officially removed. But <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a>, with equal confidence, of course, in the letter he had had from the Emperor, refused. So John went after <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a> with an armed guard, and <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a> with his own guard defended himself. During the fight many were killed, including John himself, the new Governor. <br />Now at Eudemon's instigation, <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a> was summoned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>; the Senate investigated the affair, and acquitted <a href=/people/4186 target=_blank>Liberius</a>, since what he did had been in self-defense. The Emperor, however, did not let him off until he had privately paid him a fine. This shows <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>'s love of truth and how he kept his word. <br />It might not be out of the way for me to tell a sequel of this incident. This Eudemon died a little later, leaving many relatives but no will of any kind. About the same time the chief eunuch of the palace, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>, was released from life, leaving a nephew but no will disposing of his considerable property. The Emperor seized both estates, making himself the arbitrary heir, and did not give as much as a three-obol piece to the legal inheritors. Such was the respect for law and the kinsmen of his friends that this Emperor had. So, also, he seized the estate of Ireneus, who had died some time before, without any proper claim to it of any kind. </p>                        </div>

His daughter was married to a citizen of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a> by the name of Mamilian, of illustrious family. This girl was <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a>'s legal heir, since she was his only child. Now there was an ancient law that when a Senator of any of the cities departed this world, leaving no male issue, one fourth of his estate should go to the Senate of his city, and all the rest to his heirs. Here again the tyrant had showed his true character. He made a new law reversing the rule, decreeing that when a Senator died without male issue, his heirs should get one fourth of his estate, and all the rest should go to the imperial treasury and the local Senate. Never in the memory of man had the treasury or the Emperor shared the estate of a Senator. <br />While this new law was in force, <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a> reached the final day of his life. His daughter was about to divide her inheritance with the treasury and the city Senate according to the law, when she received letters from both the Emperor and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/317345UAsh class=place long=34.5464 lat=31.6601>Ascalon</a> Senate, dismissing all their claims to the property, on the ground they had already all that was properly their just due. <br />Later Mamillan also died, <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a>'s son-in-law, leaving one daughter, who of course inherited his estate. While her mother was still living, this daughter too died, after marrying a man of distinction by whom she had no children, male or female. <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> immediately seized the whole estate, on the remarkable ground that it would be an unholy thing for the daughter of <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a>, an old woman, to become rich on the property of both her father and her husband. But that the woman might not be reduced to beggary, he ordered her to be given one gold stater a day so long as she lived: writing in the decree by which he robbed her of these properties that he was granting her this stater for the sake of religion, for it is my custom to do what is holy and pious. <br />This will have to suffice, in order that my book may not be overfilled with such anecdotes; and indeed, no one man could recall everything he did. </p>                        </div>

There was a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=demonym long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilician</a> named Malthanes, son-in-law of that <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> who was, as I have said, a Referendarius. <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> sent this Malthanes to restore order among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=ethnic long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicians</a>. On this pretext Malthanes inflicted intolerable sufferings on most of his fellow citizens, and robbed them of their money, some of which he sent to the tyrant, enriching himself unjustly with the rest. <br />Now some bore their sufferings in silence; but those of the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349UTar class=place long=34.897 lat=36.9122>Tarsus</a> who were Blues, trusting in the favor of the Empress, assembled in their Forum to insult Malthanes, who was not present. When Malthanes heard of this, he assembled a body of soldiers and arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349UTar class=place long=34.897 lat=36.9122>Tarsus</a> by night; and sending his soldiers into the private houses, ordered them to put the inhabitants to death. Thinking this was an invasion by an enemy, the Blues defended themselves. And among other evils that took place in the darkness, it happened that Damian, a Senator, was killed by an arrow wound. <br />This Damian was president of the local Blues; and when the news came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, the indignant Blues there made a great uproar throughout the city, and gathered in crowds to complain violently to the Emperor, while they uttered terrible threats against <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> and Malthanes. The Emperor pretended to be no less outraged at the affair, and immediately wrote to order an investigation and punishment of Malthanes by his citizens. But <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> gave him a large sum of money, so he stopped inquiry and his interest in the Blues. <br />With the affair thus unsettled, the Emperor received Malthanes at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> with all favor and esteem. As he was leaving the imperial presence, the Blues, who had been on the lookout for him, attacked him in the very palace and would have killed him, if some of their party, who had been bribed by <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, had not stopped them. Who would not call that state most miserable, in which the Emperor accepts bribes to leave an inquiry unfinished, and in which factionists, while the Emperor is in the palace, dare to mutiny against one of their own magistrates and lift violent hands against him? However, no punishment for this was ever brought on either Malthanes or those who attacked him. And from this alone, if you pleased, you could prove the character of <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>. </p>                        </div>

For the preceding Roman emperors, so that they might most quickly and easily have news of enemy invasions into any province, of sedition in the cities or any other unexpected trouble, of the actions of the governors and everyone else everywhere in the Roman Empire, and also so that those bringing in the annual taxes might be kept from delay and danger, had established a system of public couriers everywhere in the following manner. <br />As a day's journey for an active man, they decided on eight stages in some places, in others less, but hardly ever less than five. Forty <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> were kept for each stage, and grooms in proportion to the number of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. By frequent relays of the best mounts, couriers were thus able to ride as long a distance in one day as would ordinarily require ten, and bring with them the news required. Also the landowners in these provinces, especially those whose estates were in the interior, were greatly benefited by the system, as they sold at a high price to the government each year their surplus harvests to feed the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and the grooms. And accordingly the State received the due tribute from each of these, immediately reimbursing them for furnishing it: and this was to the advantage of the whole State. Now this is how things were formerly done. </p>                        </div>

Faring in small boats, such as were usually used for crossing the strait, they were in serious peril if a storm came up. For because speed was demanded of them, they could not wait for calm weather. In the case of the road to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, he permitted the former system to remain; but everywhere else in the East, as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, he reduced the number of stages making a day's journey to one, and provided, instead of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, a few <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a>. Consequently news of what happened in each province was brought with great difficulty, too late to be of any use and long after the event, and the farm owners got no benefit of their crops which either rotted or lay idle. <br />The spies were organized as follows. Many men were formerly supported by the treasury, who visited the enemy, especially the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> court, to find out exactly what was going on; on their return to Roman territory, they were able to report to the Emperors the secrets of the enemy. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, being warned, were on guard and could not be taken by surprise.

But <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> did away with the practice of hiring Roman spies, and in consequence lost much territory to the enemy, including <a href=/people/9676 target=_blank>Lazica</a>, which was taken because the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had no information as to where the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> King was with his army. </p>                        </div>

Thus the peasants did not have to carry burdens, and the soldiers lacked no necessity. But <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> did away with almost all of these animals. Consequently when the Roman army now marches against the enemy, it is impossible for it to be supplied with what it needs. Such was the zeal he displayed for the interests of the State. <br />There is nothing like mentioning one of his ridiculous acts. Among the lawyers at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a> was one Evangelius, a man of no mean distinction, who, favored by the winds of <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a>, became the master of much money and much land. Eventually he bought a village on the seacoast, named Porphyreon, for three gold centenaries. Learning of this, <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> immediately took the place from him, giving him back only a small fraction of the price he had paid, and uttered the remark that it would never do for Evangelius, a mere lawyer, to be the lord of such a village. Well, we must stop somewhere when we begin to recall all these stories. <br />This, however, is worth telling among the innovations of <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> and <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a>. Formerly, when the Senate approached the Emperor, it paid homage in the following manner. Every patrician kissed him on the right breast; the Emperor kissed the patrician on the head, and he was dismissed. Then the rest bent their right knee to the Emperor and withdrew. It was not customary to pay homage to the Queen. </p>                        </div>

Nor did <a href=/people/3976 target=_blank>Theodora</a> refuse this honor; and she even received the ambassadors of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and other barbarians and gave them presents, as if she were in command of the Roman Empire: a thing that had never happened in all previous time. <br />And formerly intimates of the Emperor called him Emperor and the Empress, Empress; and the other officials according to the title of their rank. But if anybody addressed either of these two as Emperor or Empress without adding Your Majesty or Your Highness, or forgot to call himself their slave, he was considered either ignorant or insolent, and was dismissed in disgrace as if he had done some awful crime or committed an unpardonable sin. <br />And before, only a few were sometimes admitted to the palace; but from the time when these two came to power, the magistrates and everybody else had no trouble in fairly living in the palace. This was because the magistrates of old had administered justice and the laws according to their conscience, and made their decisions while in their own offices, while their subjects, neither seeing nor hearing any injustice, of course had little cause to trouble the Emperor. But these two, taking control of everything to the misfortune of their subjects, forced everyone to come to them and beg like slaves. And almost any day one could see the law courts nearly deserted, while in the hall of the Emperor there was a jostling and pushing crowd that resembled nothing so much as a mob of slaves. <br />Those who were supposed to be in the imperial favor would stand there all day and most of the night, sleepless and foodless, until they were exhausted; and this is what their presumed good fortune got them. And those who were free of all this sort of thing, asked each other what would become of the prosperity of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. For some were sure it was already in the hands of the barbarians, and others said the Emperor had hidden it away in his various dwelling places. But only when <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> shall have departed this life, if he be a man, or until he let go of the life of the demon archons, shall they who then happen to survive him discover the truth. </p>                        </div>
