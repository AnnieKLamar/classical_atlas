                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg2003.tlg012:337'><b>&sect; 337</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=/people/543 target=_blank>Anacreon</a> the poet composed many delightful songs; for a luxurious life was allotted to him by the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a>. But the god did not permit <a href=/people/529 target=_blank>Alcaeus</a> nor even <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371252PPar class=place long=25.1483 lat=37.0844>Paros</a> to devote their muse to mirth and pleasure. For constrained as they were to endure toil, now of one sort, now of another, they used their poetry to relieve their toil, and by abusing those who wronged them they lightened the burdens imposed on them by <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a>. But as for me, the law forbids me to accuse by name those who, though I have done them no wrong, try to show their hostility to me; and on the other hand the fashion of education that now prevails among the well-born deprives me of the use of the music that consists in song. For in these days men think it more degrading to study music than once in the past they thought it to be rich by dishonest means. Nevertheless I will not on that account renounce the aid that it is in my power to win from the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. Indeed I have observed that even the barbarians across the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> sing savage songs composed in language not unlike the croaking of harsh-voiced birds, and that they delight in such songs. </p>                        </div>

And with this in mind I often say to myself, like <a href=/people/860 target=_blank>Ismenias</a> - for though my talents are not equal to his, I have as I persuade myself a similar independence of soul - I sing for the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> and myself. <br />However the song that I now sing has been composed in prose, and it contains much violent abuse, directed not, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, against others - how could it be, since the law forbids? - but against the poet and author himself. For there is no law to prevent one's writing either praise or criticism of oneself. Now as for praising myself, though I should be very glad to do so, I have no reason for that; but for criticising myself I have countless reasons, and first I will begin with my face. For though nature did not make this any too handsome or well-favoured or give it the bloom of youth, I myself out of sheer perversity and ill-temper have added to it this long beard of mine, to punish it, as it would seem, for this very crime of not being handsome by nature. For the same reason I put up with the lice that scamper about in it as though it were a thicket for wild beasts. As for eating greedily or drinking with my mouth wide open, it is not in my power; for I must take care, I suppose, or before I know it I shall eat up some of my own hairs along with my crumbs of bread. In the matter of being kissed and kissing I suffer no inconvenience whatever. And yet for this as for other purposes a beard is evidently troublesome, since it does not allow me to press shaven lips to other lips more sweetly [Theocritus, 12.32] - because they are smooth, I suppose - as has been said already by one of those who with the aid of <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a> and <a href=/people/736 target=_blank>Calliope</a> composed poems in honour of <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a>. But you say that I ought to twist ropes from it. Well I am willing to provide you with ropes if only you have the strength to pull them and their roughness does not do dreadful damage to your unworn and tender hands [Od.21.151]. And let no one suppose that I am offended by your satire. </p>                        </div>
                        <div class="text-right bottommargin-sm">

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg2003.tlg012:339'><b>&sect; 339</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;For I myself furnish you with an excuse for it by wearing my chin as <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> do, when I might, I suppose, make it smooth and bare as handsome youths wear theirs, and all women, who are endowed by nature with loveliness. But you, since even in your old age you emulate your own sons and daughters by your soft and delicate way of living, or perhaps by your effeminate dispositions, carefully make your chins smooth, and your manhood you barely reveal and slightly indicate by your foreheads, not by your jaws as I do. <br />But as though the mere length of my beard were not enough, my head is dishevelled besides, and I seldom have my hair cut or my nails, while my fingers are nearly always black from using a pen. And if you would like to learn something that is usually a secret, my breast is shaggy, and covered with hair, like the breasts of <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> who among wild beasts are monarchs like me, and I have never in my life made it smooth, so ill-conditioned and shabby am I, nor have I made any other part of my body smooth or soft. If I had a wart like Cicero, I should tell you so; but as it happens I have none. And by your leave I will tell you something else. I am not content with having my body in this rough condition, but in addition the mode of life that I practise is very strict indeed. I banish myself from the theatres, such a dolt am I, and I do not admit the thymele within my court except on the first day of the year, because I am too stupid to appreciate it; like some country fellow who from his small means has to pay a tax or render tribute to a harsh master. And even when I do enter the theatre I look like a man who is expiating a crime. Then again, though I am entitled a mighty Emperor, I employ no one to govern the mimes and chariot-drivers as my lieutenant or general throughout the inhabited world. And observing this recently, You now recall that youth of his, his wit and wisdom. </p>                        </div>

Therefore I seldom attend them, only during the festivals of the gods; and I do not stay the whole day as my cousin [Constantius] used to do, and my uncle [Count <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a>] and my brother and my father's son [<a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a>]. Six races are all that I stay to see, and not even those with the air of one who loves the sport, or even, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, with the air of one who does not hate and loathe it, and I am glad to get away. <br />But all these things are externals; and indeed what a small fraction of my offences against you have I described! But to turn to my private life within the court. Sleepless nights on a pallet and a diet that is anything rather than surfeiting make my temper harsh and unfriendly to a luxurious city like yours. However it is not in order to set an example to you that I adopt these habits. But in my childhood a strange and senseless delusion came over me and persuaded me to war against my belly, so that I do not allow it to fill itself with a great quantity of food. Thus it has happened to me most rarely of all men to vomit my food. And though I remember having this experience once, after I became Caesar, it was by accident and was not due to over-eating. It may be worth while to tell the story which is not in itself very graceful, but for that very reason is especially suited to me. <br />I happened to be in winter quarters at my beloved <a about=https://topostext.org/place/489023ULut class=place long=2.3499 lat=48.8529>Lutetia</a> - for that is how the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a> call the capital of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/489023ULut class=ethnic long=2.3499 lat=48.8529>Parisii</a>. It is a small island lying in the river; a wall entirely surrounds it, and wooden bridges lead to it on both sides. The river seldom rises and falls, but usually is the same depth in the winter as in the summer season, and it provides water which is very clear to the eye and very pleasant for one who wishes to drink. For since the inhabitants live on an island they have to draw their water chiefly from the river. </p>                        </div>

Whether from this or from some other cause obscure to me, the fact is as I say, that those who live in that place have a warmer winter. And a good kind of vine grows thereabouts, and some persons have even managed to make fig-trees grow by covering them in winter with a sort of garment of wheat straw and with things of that sort, such as are used to protect trees from the harm that is done them by the cold wind. As I was saying then, the winter was more severe than usual, and the river kept bringing down blocks like marble. You know, I suppose, the white stone that comes from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>; the blocks of ice were very like it, of great size, and drifted down one after another; in fact it seemed likely that they would make an unbroken path and bridge the stream. The winter then was more inclement than usual, but the room where I slept was not warmed in the way that most houses are heated, I mean by furnaces underground; and that too though it was conveniently arranged for letting in heat from such a fire. But it so happened I suppose, because I was awkward then as now, and displayed inhumanity first of all, as was natural, towards myself. For I wished to accustom myself to bear the cold air without needing this aid. And though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my servants to heat the house, because I was afraid of drawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And since my head was filled with the fumes, I was almost choked. </p>                        </div>

For the blush of modesty befits the unmanly, but manly fellows like you it befits to begin your revels at dawn, to spend your nights in pleasure, and to show not only by your words but by your deeds also that you despise the laws. For indeed it is only by means of those in authority that the laws inspire fear in men; so that he who insults one who is in authority, over and above this tramples on the laws. And that you take pleasure in this sort of behaviour you show clearly on many occasions, but especially in the market-places and theatres; the mass of the people by their clapping and shouting, while those in office show it by the fact that, on account of the sums they have spent on such entertainments, they are more widely known and more talked about by all men than <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> ever was on account of his interview with <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> the king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=ethnic long=28 lat=38.5>Lydians</a>.

For pleasure is here in abundance, and delights whose fruits one could only enjoy continuously; for instance the sight of men and pretty boys dancing, and any number of charming women. <br />When I take all this into account, I do indeed congratulate you on your good fortune, though I do not reproach myself.

You know of course the tale that is told about the king who gave his name to this city - or rather whose name the city received when it was colonised, for it was founded by <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>, though it takes its name from the son of <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> -; they say then that out of excessive softness and luxury the latter was constantly falling in love and being loved, and finally he conceived a dishonourable passion for his own step-mother. And though he wished to conceal his condition he could not, and little by little his body began to waste away and to become transparent, and his powers to wane, and his breathing was feebler than usual. But what could be the matter with him was, I think, a sort of riddle, since his malady had no visible cause, or rather it did not even appear what was its nature, though the youth's weakness was manifest. Then the physician of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a> was set a difficult problem, namely to discover what was the nature of the malady. Now he, suspecting from the words of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> [Hesiodus, Op_66]what is the nature of cares that devour the limbs, and that in many cases it is not a bodily weakness but an infirmity of soul that causes a wasting of the body; and seeing moreover that the youth was very susceptible to love because of his time of life and his habits, he took the following way of tracking down the disease. He sat near the youth's couch and watched his face, after ordering handsome youths and women to walk past him, beginning with the queen herself. Now when she entered, apparently to see how he was, the young man at once began to show the symptoms of his malady. He breathed like one who is being choked; for though he was very anxious to control his agitated breathing, he could not, but it became disordered, and a deep blush spread over his face. </p>                        </div>

Then <a href=/people/763 target=_blank>Erasistratus</a> saw what ailed him and told the king, and he out of love for his son said that he would give up his wife to him. Now the youth for the moment refused; but when his father died not long after, he sought with the greatest vehemence the favour which he had so honourably refused when it was first offered to him. <br />Now since this was the conduct of <a href=/people/2146 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, I have no right to be angry with his descendants when they emulate their founder or him who gave his name to the city.

For, in your judgment, true beauty of soul consists in a wanton life. I, however, was taught by my tutor to look on the ground when I was on my way to school; and as for a theatre, I never saw one until I had more hair on my chin than on my head, and even at that age it was never on my own account and by my own wish, but three or four times, you must know, the governor who was my kinsman and near relative, doing a favour to <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a>, ordered me to attend; it was while I was still a private individual. Therefore forgive me. For I hand over to you instead of myself one whom you will more justly detest, I mean that curmudgeon my tutor who even used to harass me by teaching me to walk in one straight path and now he is responsible for my quarrel with you. It was he who wrought in my soul and as it were carved therein what I did not then desire, though he was very zealous in implanting it, as though he were producing some charming characteristic; and boorishness he called dignity, lack of taste he called sobriety, and not yielding to one's desires or achieving happiness by that means he called manliness. I assure you, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, that while I was still a mere boy my tutor would often say to me: Never let the crowd of your playmates who flock to the theatres lead you into the mistake of craving for such spectacles as these. Have you a passion for <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> races? There is one in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, very cleverly described. Take the book and study it.

He was a barbarian, by the gods and goddesses; by birth he was a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a>, and he had the same name as the man who persuaded <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> to invade Greece. Moreover he was a eunuch, a word which, twenty months ago, was constantly heard and revered, though it is now applied as an insult and a term of abuse. He had been brought up under the patronage of my grandfather, in order that he might instruct my mother in the poems of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> and Hesiodus. And since she, after giving birth to me her first and only child, died a few months later, snatched away while she was still a young girl by the motherless maiden from so many misfortunes that were to come, I was handed over to him after my seventh year. From that time he won me over to these views of his, and led me to school by one straight path; and since neither he himself desired to know any other nor allowed me to travel by any other path, it is he who has caused me to be hated by all of you. However, if you agree, let us make a truce with him, you and I, and make an end of our quarrel. For he neither knew that I should visit you nor did he anticipate that, even supposing I was likely to come here, it would be as a ruler, and that too over so great an empire as the gods bestowed on me; though they did not do so, believe me, without using great compulsion both towards him who offered and him who accepted it. For neither of us had the air of being willing; since he who offered that honour or favour or whatever you may please to call it, was unwilling to bestow it, while he who received it was sincere in steadily refusing it. This matter, however, is and shall be as the gods will. </p>                        </div>

Habit, as the saying goes, is second nature. But to fight with nature is hard; and to shake off the training of thirty years is very difficult, especially when it was carried on with such painful effort, and I am already more than thirty years old. Well and good, you answer, but what is the matter with you that you try to hear and decide cases about contracts? For surely your tutor did not teach you this also, since he did not even know whether you would govern. Yes, it was that terrible old man who convinced me that I ought to do so; and you also do well to help me to abuse him, since he is of all men most responsible for my way of life; though he too, you must know, had in his turn been misled by others. Theirs are names that you have often met when they are ridiculed in Comedy - I mean <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> and <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> and <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>. This old man in his folly was first convinced by them, and then he got hold of me, since I was young and loved literature, and convinced me that if I would emulate those famous men in all things I should become better, not perhaps than other men - for it was not with them that I had to compete - but certainly better than my former self. Accordingly, since I had no choice in the matter, I obeyed him, and now I am no longer able to change my character, though indeed I often wish I could, and I blame myself for not granting to all men impunity for all wrong-doing. But then the words of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> stranger in <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> occur to my mind [Laws_730d]: Though he who does no wrong himself is worthy of honour, he who does not allow the wicked to do wrong is worthy of more than twice as much honour. For whereas the former is responsible for one man only, the latter is responsible for many others besides himself, when he reports to the magistrates the wrong-doing of the rest. </p>                        </div>

And we ought to utter the same eulogy with regard to temperance also, and wisdom and all the other good qualities that such a man possesses, and which are such that he is able not only to have them himself but also to impart them to other men. <br />These things he taught me when he thought that I should be a private citizen. For he certainly did not foresee that there would be assigned to me by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> this lot in life to which the god has now brought me and has set me therein. But I, because I was ashamed to be less virtuous as a ruler than I had been as a private citizen, have unconsciously given you the benefit of my own boorishness, though there was no necessity. And another of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s laws has made me take thought for myself and so become hateful in your eyes: I mean the law which says that those who govern, and also the older men, ought to train themselves in respect for others and in self-control, in order that the masses may look to them and so order their own lives aright. Now since I alone, or rather in company with a few others, am now pursuing this course, it has had a very different result and has naturally become a reproach against me. For we here are only seven persons, strangers and newcomers in your city, - though indeed one of our number is a fellow-citizen of yours, a man dear to <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> and to me, an excellent craftsman of discourses. And we have business dealings with no man, nor do we go by any road that does not lead to the temples of the gods; and seldom, and then not all of us, do we go to the theatres, since we have adopted the most inglorious line of conduct and the most unpopular aim and end of life. The wise men of Greece will surely allow me to repeat some of the sayings current among you; for I have no better way of illustrating what I mean. We have stationed ourselves in the middle of the road, so highly do we prize the opportunity to collide with you and to be disliked, when we ought rather to try to please and flatter you.

Have you not even observed what great independence exists among the citizens, even down to the very <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> and <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a>? The men who hire them out lead even these animals through the porticoes as though they were brides.

And yet you think that even the charming youths in the city ought to keep quiet and, if possible, think whatever you like, but at any rate utter only what is agreeable for you to hear!

For it is evident that uttering them gives pleasure to the former, while the latter rejoice to hear jests of this sort. I share your pleasure in this unanimity, and you do well to be a city of one mind in such matters, since it is not at all dignified or an enviable task to restrain and chastise the licentiousness of the young. For if one were to rob human beings of the power to do and say what they please, that would be to take away, and to curtail the first principle of independence. Therefore, since you knew that men ought to be independent in all respects, you acted quite rightly, in the first place when you permitted the women to govern themselves, so that you might profit by their being independent and licentious to excess; secondly, when you entrusted to them the bringing up of the children, for fear that if they had to experience any harsher authority they might later turn out to be slaves; and as they grew up to be boys might be taught first of all to respect their elders, and then under the influence of this bad habit might show too much reverence for the magistrates, and finally might have to be classed not as men but as slaves; and becoming temperate and well-behaved and orderly might be, before they knew it, altogether corrupted. Then what effect have the women on the children? They induce them to reverence the same things as they do by means of pleasure, which is, it seems, the most blessed thing and the most highly honoured, not only by men but by beasts also. It is for this reason, I think, that you are so very happy, because you refuse every form of slavery; first you begin by refusing slavery to the gods, secondly to the laws, and thirdly to me who am the guardian of the laws. And I should indeed be eccentric if, when the gods suffer the city to be so independent and do not chastise her, I should be resentful and angry. </p>                        </div>

Now the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a> never made the acquaintance of the cotylist, since he was at once admitted into the palace; but when the dancers began to display their art in the theatre, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a> left them alone because they thought that they were like men stricken with nympholepsy.

But when I entered the shrine I found there no incense, not so much as a cake, not a single beast for sacrifice. For that moment I was amazed and thought that I was still outside the shrine and that you were waiting the signal from me, doing me that honour because I am supreme pontiff. But when I began to inquire what sacrifice the city intended to offer to celebrate the annual festival in honour of the god, the priest answered, I have brought with me from my own house a goose as an offering to the god, but the city this time has made no preparations. <br />Thereupon, being fond of making enemies, I made in the Senate a very unseemly speech which perhaps it may now be pertinent to quote to you. It is a terrible thing, I said, that so important a city should be more neglectful of the gods than any village on the borders of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>. Your city possesses ten thousand lots of land privately owned, and yet when the annual festival in honour of the god of her forefathers is to be celebrated for the first time since the gods dispelled the cloud of atheism, she does not produce on her own behalf a single bird, though she ought if possible to have sacrificed an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> for every tribe, or if that were too difficult, the whole city in common ought at any rate to have offered to the god one <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> on her own behalf. Yet every one of you delights to spend money privately on dinners and feasts; and I know very well that many of you squandered very large sums of money on dinners during the May festival. Nevertheless, on your own behalf and on behalf of the city's welfare not one of the citizens offers a private sacrifice, nor does the city offer a public sacrifice, but only this priest! Yet I think that it would have been more just for him to go home carrying portions from the multitude of beasts offered by you to the god. For the duty assigned by the gods to priests is to do them honour by their nobility of character and by the practice of virtue, and also to perform to them the service that is due; </p>                        </div>

Now I do not know how any good man could endure to see such things in your city, and for my part I am sure that it is displeasing to the gods also. <br />This is what I remember to have said at the time, and the god bore witness to the truth of my words - would that he had not! - when he forsook your suburb which for so long he had protected, and again during that time of storm and stress when he turned in the wrong direction the minds of those who were then in power and forced their hands. But I acted foolishly in making myself odious to you. For I ought to have remained silent as, I think, did many of those who came here with me, and I ought not to have been meddlesome or found fault. But I poured down all these reproaches on your heads to no purpose, owing to my headlong temper and a ridiculous desire to flatter, - for it surely is not to be believed that out of goodwill towards you I spoke those words to you then; but I was, I think, hunting after a reputation for piety towards the gods and for sincere good-will towards you, which is, I think, the most absurd form of flattery. </p>                        </div>

Next, after you had sent an embassy to me - and it arrived not only later than all the other embassies, but even later than that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> who dwell in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, - I remitted large sums of gold and of silver also, and all the tribute money for you separately apart from the other cities; and moreover I increased the register of your Senate by two hundred members and spared no man; for I was planning to make your city greater and more powerful. <br />I therefore gave you the opportunity to elect and to have in your Senate the richest men among those who administer my own revenues </p>                        </div>

You however did not elect the capable men among these, but you seized the opportunity to act like a city by no means well-ordered, though quite in keeping with your character. Would you like me to remind you of a single instance? You nominated a Senator, and then before his name had been placed on the register, and the scrutiny of his character was still pending, you thrust this person into the public service. Then you dragged in another from the market-place, a man who was poor and who belonged to a class which in every other city is counted as the very dregs, but who among you, since of your excessive wisdom you exchange rubbish for gold, enjoys a moderate fortune; and this man you elected as your colleague. Many such offences did you commit with regard to the nominations, and then when I did not consent to everything, not only was I deprived of the thanks due for all the good I had done, but also I have incurred your dislike on account of all that I in justice refrained from. <br />Now these were very trivial matters and could not so far make the city hostile to me. But my greatest offence of all, and what aroused that violent hatred of yours, was the following. When I arrived among you the populace in the theatre, who were being oppressed by the rich, first of all cried aloud, Everything plentiful; everything dear! On the following day I had an interview with your powerful citizens and tried to persuade them that it is better to despise unjust profits and to benefit the citizens and the strangers in your city. And they promised to take charge of the matter, but though for three successive months I took no notice and waited, they neglected the matter in a way that no one would have thought possible. And when I saw that there was truth in the outcry of the populace, and that the pressure in the market was due not to any scarcity but to the insatiate greed of the rich, </p>                        </div>

And since the citizens had everything else in great abundance, wine, for instance, and olive oil and all the rest, but were short of corn, because there had been a terrible failure of the crops owing to the previous droughts, I decided to send to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360370UCha class=place long=37.0432 lat=35.9878>Chalcis</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365379UHie class=place long=37.9477 lat=36.527>Hierapolis</a> and the cities round about, and from them I imported for you four hundred thousand measures of corn. And when this too had been used, I first expended five thousand, then later seven thousand, and now again ten thousand bushels - modii as they are called in my country - all of which was my very own property; moreover I gave to the city corn which had been brought for me from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>; and the price which I set on it was a silver piece, not for ten measures but for fifteen, that is to say, the same amount that had formerly been paid for ten measures. And if in summer, in your city, that same number of measures is sold for that sum, what could you reasonably have expected at the season when, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=demonym long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotian</a> poet says, It is a cruel thing for famine to be in the house. Would you not have been thankful to get five measures for that sum, especially when the winter had set in so severe? <br />But what did your rich men do? They secretly sold the corn in the country for an exaggerated price, and they oppressed the community by the expenses that private persons had to incur. And the result is that not only the city but most of the country people too are flocking in to buy bread, which is the only thing to be found in abundance and cheap. And indeed who remembers fifteen measures of corn to have been sold among you for a gold piece, even when the city was in a prosperous condition? It was for this conduct that I incurred your hatred, because I did not allow people to sell you wine and vegetables and fruit for gold, or the corn which had been locked away by the rich in their granaries to be sold for their benefit. </p>                        </div>

And the city now enjoys plenty only as regards bread, and nothing else. <br />Now I knew even then when I acted thus that I should not please everybody, only I cared nothing about that. For I thought it was my duty to assist the mass of the people who were being wronged, and the strangers who kept arriving in the city both on my account and on account of the high officials who were with me. But since it is now, I think, the case that the latter have departed, and the city is of one mind with respect to me - for some of you hate me and the others whom I fed are ungrateful - I leave the whole matter in the hands of <a href=/people/1436 target=_blank>Adrasteia</a> and I will betake myself to some other nation and to citizens of another sort. Nor will I even remind you how you treated one another when you asserted your rights nine years ago; how the populace with loud clamour set fire to the houses of those in power, and murdered the Governor [<a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a>]; and how later they were punished for these things because, though their anger was justified, what they did exceeded all limits. <br />Why, I repeat, in <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a>'s name, am I treated with ingratitude? Is it because I feed you from my own purse, a thing which before this day has never happened to any city, and moreover feed you so generously? Is it because I increased the register of Senators? Or because, when I caught you in the act of stealing, I did not proceed against you? Let me, if you please, remind you of one or two instances, so that no one may think that what I say is a pretext or mere rhetoric or a false claim. You said, I think, that three thousand lots of land were uncultivated, and you asked to have them; and when you had got them you all divided them among you though you did not need them. This matter was investigated and brought to light beyond doubt. Then I took the lots away from those who held them unjustly, and made no inquiries about the lands which they had before acquired, and for which they paid no taxes, </p>                        </div>

This is due in the first place to the judgment and management of my uncle and namesake but also to my own kindness; and since this is the way in which I punish rascals and thieves, I naturally seem to you to be turning the world upside down. For you know very well that clemency towards men of this sort increases and fosters wickedness among mankind. <br />Well then, my discourse has now come round again to the point which I wished to arrive at. I mean to say that I am myself responsible for all the wrong that has been done to me, because I transformed your graciousness to ungracious ways. This therefore is the fault of my own folly and not of your licence.
