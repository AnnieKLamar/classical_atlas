Many authors have written of the previous eight hundred and twenty-two years since the founding of the city, and with equal eloquence and freedom of the Roman Republic: but after the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389207LAkt class=place long=20.68 lat=38.942>Actium</a> (31BC) when peace demanded all power be conferred on one man, writers of equal ability vanished. At the same time, truth was impaired in a host of ways, initially because the people treated politics as outside their concern, later out of a desire to flatter, or conversely to show their dislike of their rulers. So that, between the subservient and the hostile, the needs of posterity were ignored. For people quickly lose interest in writers who look to win favour, while they readily give a hearing to detraction and envy, flattery being charged with a shameful display of servility, while malice grants a false show of liberty. <br />As for myself, I received neither kindness nor injury from <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>, <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a>, or <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>. I cannot deny that my career was initiated by <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, advanced by Titus, and prolonged by <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>: but those who are faithful to the truth must speak of none simply through affection or hatred. Though, should my life be long, I have reserved for my old age the deified <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a>’s reign and <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>’s rule, fertile and less dangerous material, the rare blessing of a time when one may think what one wishes and say what one thinks. </p>                        </div>

Four emperors died by the sword: there were three civil conflicts and even more foreign wars, both often taking place at the same time. There was success in the East, adversity in the West. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> was turbulent, the Gallic provinces wavered, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a> was subdued then steadily relinquished, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490315RSar class=ethnic long=31.5 lat=49>Sarmatians</a> and <a href=/people/11067 target=_blank>Suevi</a> rose against us, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=ethnic long=25 lat=44.5>Dacians</a> won fame by defeats suffered and inflicted, and even the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> were almost roused to warfare by the pretensions of one who claimed to be <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>. Moreover <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> was troubled by fresh disasters, or by those re-experienced after a lapse of ages. Cities on the fertile shores of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a> were overwhelmed and buried, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was devastated by fire, her ancient shrines consumed, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> itself set alight by her citizens. The sacred rites were corrupted, with widespread adultery: the sea bore a host of exiles, the cliffs were foul with corpses. <br />There was greater savagery still in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>: birth, wealth, the refusal or the performance of office, led to accusations of guilt, and virtue was the surest way to ruin. The rewards given to informers were as detestable as their crimes, some being granted priesthoods and consulships as their prize, while others as imperial agents or powerful at court worked everywhere to inspire hatred and terror. Slaves were corrupted to betray their masters, freedmen their patrons; and those who lacked enemies were destroyed by their friends. </p>                        </div>

Mothers accompanied their children in fleeing, wives followed husbands into exile: relatives showed courage, sons-in-law steadfastness, slaves a loyalty that even withstood torture. The eminent met the final necessity with fortitude, emulating the glorious deaths of antiquity. <br />Besides the many disasters that beset humanity, there were strange events in the heavens and on earth, flashes of lightning in warning, and presages of things to come, joyful or sad, ambiguous or clear. Never was it more fully shown, by the dreadful things experienced by the Roman people and by incontestable signs, that it is not our well-being that the gods desire, but our punishment. </p>                        </div>

When they realised that the gifts promised in <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>’s name were denied them, and that the opportunities for distinguished merit and reward were not available in peacetime as they were in war, and that the legions had the favour of an Emperor they had made, then being inclined as they were to fresh revolution, they were roused anew by Nymphidius <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a>’ criminal actions, he being a prefect who was eager to rule as Emperor himself. <br />True, Nymphidius was destroyed in the attempt, but though the leader of the mutiny was eliminated, many of the soldiers were conscious of guilty involvement, and there was no lack of open criticism of <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>’s decrepitude and avarice. His severity also, which had once been praised and celebrated among the soldiers, now angered them, vexed by the former discipline, since they had been led by <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, for fourteen years, to love the Imperial vices no less than they had once revered the virtues. <br />Moreover there was a saying of <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>’s, noble as regards the state but dangerous to himself for everything else was at odds with such an idea, that he chose his soldiers, he did not buy them. </p>                        </div>

The Gallic provinces remained under an obligation, not merely because of the memory of <a href=/people/1489 target=_blank>Vindex</a>’s failure, but also on account of the recent grant of Roman citizenship, and a reduction in their future taxes, but the Gallic tribes bordering our forces in <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a> were not so treated, some even losing their land, equally aggrieved in weighing their neighbours’ gains or their own injury. Our soldiers in <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a> were also roused in anger, a dangerous situation in so large a force, stirred by pride in their recent uprising but also by fear in having favoured the loser.

For you have an older brother, of the same rank as yourself, worthy of the role if you were not the finer man. <br />You are already of an age that is free of youth’s passions; your life is such that you need not apologise for the past. So far you have experienced much adversity; yet good fortune tests the spirit more acutely, because misfortune is simply suffered, but success opens us to corruption. You may adhere, as loyally as before, to honour, liberty, and friendship, the greatest blessings of the human spirit, but others will encroach upon them, by their servility. Flattery, adulation, and self-interest, the worst poison to afflict the honest mind, will find their point of entry.

Under <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a> and <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, our position was a kind of family inheritance: now we initiate election to the role there will be a kind of freedom, and with the <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a> and Claudian houses no more whoever is best must be chosen for adoption. For to be conceived by and born of a noble house is mere chance, and of no greater significance than that, but the judgement shown in adoption is impartial and, if one would choose, consensus points the way. <br /> Keep <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>’s example before your eyes, swollen as he was with his pride in the long line of Caesars. It was not <a href=/people/1489 target=_blank>Vindex</a>, with a harmless province, nor I with my single legion that drove him from power, but his own savagery and extravagance; and before that there was no precedent for condemning an Emperor to death. <br />We who are raised by war and men’s esteem will be subject to envy however worthy we might be. Nor should you fear a legion or two that are still in turmoil, given that the world has been shaken to its foundations. I did not come to the throne without risk, but on the news of your adoption I shall cease to seem an old man, the sole charge now made against me. The worst of men will always long for <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, you and I must take care that the good do not wish for him too. <br />Further advice is not appropriate now, and all advice is needless if I have chosen well. The best and quickest way to distinguish between good and bad is to think what you would desire or oppose under some other Emperor. For there is not with us, as there is among nations ruled by kings, a certain house that rules while all the rest are slaves, rather you will command men who can neither tolerate utter servitude, nor utter freedom.’ <br />Then <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a> spoke further in this manner, as if he were still in the process of adopting his successor, while everyone else conversed as if it were already a fact. </p>                        </div>

For what others call crimes he calls remedies; names cruelty falsely as severity; avarice as frugality; the insults and punishment you suffer, discipline! <br />It is seven months since <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> met his end, and <a href=/people/7801 target=_blank>Icelus</a> has already stolen more than ever those freedmen <a href=/people/2437 target=_blank>Polyclitus</a>, Vatinus, and Aegialus wasted. Titus <a href=/people/6048 target=_blank>Vinius</a> could have proceeded with no more greed or licence if he were emperor himself; now he holds us subject as if we were his slaves and worthless as any other.

His brother <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a> had been executed by <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, his brother <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> by <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>. He himself, long an exile, Caesar for a mere four days, by his hasty adoption gained this sole advantage over his remaining elder brother, that he was killed first. <br />Titus <a href=/people/6048 target=_blank>Vinius</a>, a contradictory character, had lived fifty-seven years. His father was of praetorian origins, his maternal grandfather one of the proscribed. He was notorious for his first period of military service under the legate <a href=/people/1469 target=_blank>Calvisius</a> <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a>, when the legate’s wife driven by a shameful urge to visit the camp, entered it at night, dressed as a soldier. After she had lewdly seduced both the guard and the other men from their duty, she dared to commit adultery in the general’s headquarters. Titus <a href=/people/6048 target=_blank>Vinius</a> was implicated in the crime, and so, loaded with chains, was imprisoned by <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a>, to be released later when times changed. <br />After an uninterrupted progression in office, having served as praetor, he was placed in command of a legion. Though successful he later stained his reputation with an action worthy of a slave, in stealing a gold wine-cup at a banquet given by <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, such that <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, on the following day, ordered <a href=/people/6048 target=_blank>Vinius</a> alone among the other guests to be served with earthenware. <br />Yet as proconsul of Gallia Narbonensis, <a href=/people/6048 target=_blank>Vinius</a> ruled strictly and honestly; it was later, as a friend of <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>, that he was raised to dangerous heights. Bold, clever, effective, crooked or diligent according to inclination, he was always vigorous. <br />Titus <a href=/people/6048 target=_blank>Vinius</a>’ will was set aside because of the magnitude of his gains. <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>’s poverty, in contrast, ensured that his last wishes were fulfilled. </p>                        </div>

Neither indifferent to fame nor seeking it, he was not covetous of others’ property, frugal with his own, careful with the state’s.

Once <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> <a href=/people/1489 target=_blank>Vindex</a> and his entire force had been destroyed, his army, proud of its glory and spoils, since it had achieved a highly profitable outcome without danger or effort, chose to continue fighting, for gain rather than mere pay. They had long tolerated a period of service that was harsh and unrewarding, due to the nature of the terrain, the climate, and the strictness of their discipline. But though rigorous in peacetime, discipline is eroded by civil conflict, since there is corruption on all sides, and treachery goes unpunished. <br /> There was an abundance of troops, weapons, and mounts, for use and display; and while, before the conflict, the men knew only their own centuries and squadrons, since armies were deployed within the boundaries of each province, once the legions had mobilised against <a href=/people/1489 target=_blank>Vindex</a> they became aware of their and the Gallic provinces’ strength. They raised their weapons one more, seeking fresh discord; it was no longer a question of friends, as before, but of conquerors and conquered. Nor did that section of the army of the Gallic provinces along the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> fail to align itself to the same faction, or show itself a fierce adversary of the ‘Galbans’; coining that name in disdain for <a href=/people/1489 target=_blank>Vindex</a>. Thus their spirits craved the storming of towns, ravaging of fields, and looting of houses, beginning with those of the <a href=/people/12012 target=_blank>Sequani</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469043UAug class=ethnic long=4.299 lat=46.945>Aedui</a>, followed by the other tribes in order of their wealth. <br />They were not driven simply by arrogance and greed, faults common to the stronger party, but also by Gallic insolence; the Gauls boasting, as an insult to the army, that <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a> had remitted a quarter of their tribute monies, and rewarded them from the State coffers. <br />Rumours were cleverly spread, and mindlessly credited, that the legions were being decimated, and the most resolute centurions dismissed. There was dreadful news from every quarter, and troubling reports from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; the colony of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458048ULug class=place long=4.8197 lat=45.7597>Lyon</a> was hostile and, persisting in its loyalty to <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, a hotbed of rumours. But the most fertile soil for the soldiers’ imaginings and false beliefs was within the camp itself, in their own hatreds and fears or, when they regarded their own strength, their self-confidence. </p>                        </div>

Many men had their rank restored, their disgrace expunged, and the marks against them erased. Much of this was for his own ends, some through his sense of justice, including the rightful amendment of promotions and demotions in rank which Fronteius <a href=/people/903 target=_blank>Capito</a> had made through meanness or avarice. <br />The measures he took were received by all as more significant than those merely of a consular legate. And while the strictest disciplinarians called it demeaning, his supporters called it kindness and affability when he gave away his own wealth, without bound or distinction, and squandered that of others; their desire for power at once translating his very faults into virtues. <br />There were many in both armies who were quiet and obedient, and many who were active and intent on wrongdoing, the commanders of the legions, Alienus <a href=/people/2213 target=_blank>Caecina</a> and <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> <a href=/people/466 target=_blank>Valens</a>, in particular being men of boundless ambition and unusual temerity, of whom <a href=/people/466 target=_blank>Valens</a> was hostile to <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>, since he considered <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a> had displayed ingratitude at the disclosure of <a href=/people/2676 target=_blank>Verginius</a>’ indecision, and his crushing of <a href=/people/903 target=_blank>Capito</a>’s plans.

But his father’s three consulships and censorship as colleague to the Emperor <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, had long since granted <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> imperial dignity, and denied him the security of being merely a subject. <br /><a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> was roused to ambition by this, more than to expectation. </p>                        </div>

And after declaring these reasons for hatred, they pointed to the wealth of potential plunder, no longer in secret exhortation but in public appeals. The soldiers should march as avengers, and raze the seat of war in Gaul; everything there being foreign and inimical to them: while they themselves, being a Roman colony, a part of the army, friends in prosperity or adversity, must not be abandoned to irate enemies, should fortune prove adverse. </p>                        </div>

Numbering nine thousand horsemen, their temperament and easy success made them more intent on plunder than war. <br />While they were thus scattered and inattentive, the third legion with added auxiliaries suddenly attacked. On the Roman side, all was disposed for battle. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490315RSar class=demonym long=31.5 lat=49>Sarmatian</a> forces were either dispersed, or since in their desire for plunder they were weighed under heavy burdens and the treacherous paths robbed their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> of speed, were cut down as easily as if they were fettered and chained. For strange to say, all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490315RSar class=ethnic long=31.5 lat=49>Sarmatians</a>’ courage seems due to external factors.

Now, does the nature of our situation or the speed of events lend itself to the broadcasting of every item of news openly, or the making of plans with every man present? It is as vital for soldiers not to know certain things, as to know others: a leader’s authority requires such strict discipline to be maintained that often even centurions and tribunes must simply obey orders. If every individual is allowed to query their orders, with discipline gone power itself is ended. <br />Suppose you have to take up arms in the dead of night?

Now it was the tribunes who caused trouble, now the consuls became too strong, and civil war stirred in the forum and throughout the city. <br />Later <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, of humblest plebeian birth, and <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, the cruellest of nobles, turned liberty, conquered by force, to tyranny. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> followed, stealthier but no better than they, and from then on the only aim was power.

Legates and tribunes either imitate a commander’s character in severity or delight in extravagant banquets; and likewise the soldiers exhibit self-control or licence. In <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>’s army all was disorder, intoxication, night revels and bacchanalian orgies, rather than the discipline proper to a military camp. <br />Thus, two soldiers, a legionary of the Fifth and a Gallic auxiliary, challenged each other to a wrestling match, in sport, but when the legionary was thrown and mocked at by the Gaul the crowd who had gathered to watch took sides, the legionaries began killing auxiliaries, and two cohorts were massacred. The result of this riot was a second riot. Armed men and a cloud of dust were spied in the distance: and a sudden cry arose that the Fourteenth legion had retraced its line of march and was set for a fight: however it was simply the rear-guard, recognition of which quelled the panic. <br />Meanwhile one of <a href=/people/2676 target=_blank>Verginius</a>’s slaves who chanced to be passing was taken for an assassin, <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> being the target, and the soldiers ran to the banquet to demand <a href=/people/2676 target=_blank>Verginius</a>’s death. Though even <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>, who was fearful and suspicious of everything, never doubted his innocence. It was difficult nevertheless to calm those who called for the execution of this ex-consul who had once been their own commander. No one was so often threatened on every riotous occasion than <a href=/people/2676 target=_blank>Verginius</a>: admiration for the man and his reputation remained strong, but the troops hated him for disdaining their offer of power. </p>                        </div>

For the rest, success and failure will have differing results where we are concerned; if we win I shall accept the honours you grant, risks and dangers will be shared alike. Or, better still, you direct the forces, and leave the fighting and the vicissitudes of battle to me. <br />At this moment, the conquered rather than the conquerors show better discipline. The defeated are roused to bold action by anger, hatred and eagerness for revenge: the victors are weakened by pride and obstinacy. War itself will open and lay bare the hidden swollen wounds of the victorious party. I have no less confidence in your vigilance, caution and wisdom than in <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>’s torpor, carelessness and savagery. Besides, our cause is better served by war than peace; for those who plan rebellion, are already rebels.’ </p>                        </div>

Nor was he free of such superstitions, who later as emperor openly retained a certain astrologer, <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>, as his oracle and guide. Previous omens sprang to mind: a cypress tree of great height on his estate had suddenly collapsed, but rose as tall the next day, at the same spot, spreading wider than before. <br />This, the soothsayers agreed, was a great and favourable omen, and promised the highest honour for <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, still then a youth. His glorious success in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>, his triumph, and the consulship seemed to him at first to have fulfilled the omen’s promise: yet having so achieved, he then believed himself destined for imperial power. <br />Between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a> lies Carmel: so they name the mountain and the god.

When <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> made sacrifice there, as he was pondering his secret hopes, <a href=/people/5500 target=_blank>Basilides</a> the priest, after carefully inspecting the entrails proclaimed: ‘<a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, should you plan to raise your house, enlarge your estate, or increase the number of your servants, a mighty dwelling will be granted you, wide boundaries, and a host of men.’ This oracle which rumour had seized upon at the time, now bore interpretation; and nothing sprang to the lips of the masses more readily.

He had been found guilty by the courts and condemned for fraud in <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>’s reign, but one among the many evils of war had been his recovery of senatorial rank. <br />Though <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a> had placed him in charge of the Seventh legion, he is thought to have written to <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a> offering his services as a general in <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a>’s cause, but overlooked by <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a> played no role in that war. Now <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>’s fortunes were in doubt, he sided with <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> and added significant momentum to his cause, being energetic in action, ready of speech, skilful at sowing animosity among others, prone to stirring discord and sedition, a robber, active in bribery, the worst of men in peacetime, but not to be scorned in war. <br />The alliance of the armies in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440205RMys class=place long=20.5 lat=44>Moesia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=place long=19 lat=45>Pannonia</a> won over the troops in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a>, though the ex-consuls who governed the provinces were uninvolved.

Espousing <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>’s cause he now brought all his fiery energy to the war: rather than the rewards danger might bring it was the danger itself that delighted him, preferring whatever was new, uncertain and filled with risk to old established interests. <br />So the movers and shakers began to rouse the discontented everywhere.

But the troops, sensing a ruse, pushed aside those guarding the platform, and prepared to use extreme force. <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, drawing his sword and pointing it at his breast, swore he would die by his own hand not theirs, and called by name to everyone in sight whom he knew or who bore a battle honour to come to his aid. <br />Then, turning towards the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> and the images of the gods of war, he prayed that they might inspire this madness and discord in the enemy’s army rather than their own, until at last the mutiny died away, and as twilight fell, the soldiers slipped away each to their own quarters. <br />On setting off from the camp, that very night, <a href=/people/4531 target=_blank>Flavianus</a> met with a despatch from <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> absolving him of all such charges. </p>                        </div>

When they said not, he asked: ‘Can anyone undermine, or hack through, walls with spears and swords? If earthworks need raising, or we need to defend ourselves with hurdles and roofing, must we stand here a useless improvident crew, admiring the enemy’s high towers and battlements?

Then he dug a grave and performed the last rites for his parent. <br />Those nearby saw him, then others heard of it: until there came cries of horror and grief throughout the ranks, as they cursed against this cruellest of wars.

He now wished to be called Caesar, a title which he had indeed previously rejected, but which was now welcome because of its associations for the superstitious, for in time of fear the murmurs of the crowd are given equal weight with the counsels of the wise. <br />Yet, as all directives that spring from ill-conceived motives are strong at first but later weaken, the senators and knights gradually became dilatory, hesitating at first then, shortly, when <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> was not present, showing contempt and indifference, until in shame at the ineffectiveness of his dictum he excused them from an effort they failed to make. </p>                        </div>

Word was brought concerning the mood of the people and the threats of the German cohorts. But he had already gone too far to retreat, and everyone urged the reluctant prefect to take up arms, fearing lest the Vitellians attack the Flavian forces while scattered and weak: though, as usually happens in such situations, advice was offered by all but few took up the challenge. <br />As <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a> and his armed guard were descending by the reservoir of <a href=/people/4153 target=_blank>Fundanus</a>, they were met by the most forward of the Vitellians.

There were some ancient colonnades on the right as you climb, on whose roof the defenders made a stand showering tiles and stones on the Vitellians. <br />The latter were unarmed except for swords, and realising it would take too long to fetch artillery and missiles they threw firebrands onto the projecting portico, followed the flames and, burning the gates of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, would have penetrated, if <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a> had not ordered the statues everywhere, raised in honour of our ancestors, toppled and piled up to barricade the entrance.

Yet it had stood firm while we fought for our country. <br />Our king, <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> <a href=/people/1008 target=_blank>Priscus</a>, at war with the <a href=/people/11083 target=_blank>Sabines</a>, vowed its creation, and laid its foundations in hope of future greatness rather than according to the, as yet modest, means of the Roman people. Its later construction was due to <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> with help from eager allies, and then to <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> <a href=/people/2188 target=_blank>Superbus</a> with the proceeds of spoils taken when <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412139USue class=place long=13.9307 lat=41.2346>Suessa</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416128UPom class=place long=12.8263 lat=41.594>Pometia</a> (the Volscian city) was captured from the enemy. But the glory of completion was reserved for liberty. After the expulsion of the kings, <a href=/people/274 target=_blank>Horatius</a> Pulvillus dedicated it, in his second consulship (507BC); its magnificence such that the vast later wealth of the Roman people served rather to adorn than increase its splendour. <br />After an interval of four hundred and twenty five years, it was burned to the ground in the consulship (83BC) of Lucius <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> and Gaius <a href=/people/1374 target=_blank>Norbanus</a>, but was rebuilt on the same spot, the victorious <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> undertaking the work but not dedicating it: ‘the only thing denied his happiness’. That was left to <a href=/people/1512 target=_blank>Lutatius</a> <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a> (in 69BC) whose name remained inscribed there, amidst the great works of the Caesars, down to <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>’s day.

All however agree that, until the time <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> won power, he was the glory of their house. We hear that his death gave pleasure to <a href=/people/1246 target=_blank>Mucianus</a>.

When the gates were finally destroyed, a solid mass of survivors opposed the victors, and fell dealing blow for blow, facing the enemy, so anxious were they in dying to win a glorious end. <br />On the city being captured, <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> was carried in a sedan chair through the rear of the Palace to his wife’s house on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LAve class=place long=12.4792 lat=41.8835>Aventine</a>, so that if he survived the day without being discovered he might escape to his brother and his forces at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413133UTar class=place long=13.2486 lat=41.292>Terracina</a>. But his inconstant mind and the nature of great fear, which always makes the present situation seem most threatening to those who fear everything, drew him back to the empty Palace, seemingly deserted by even the lowliest servants who had slipped away or perhaps took care to avoid meeting him. <br />He feared the solitude and the silent spaces; trying the closed doors, he shuddered to find only echoing rooms; weary of wandering in a state of gloom, he hid himself in shameful concealment, but was dragged forth by Julius <a href=/people/5909 target=_blank>Placidus</a>, the cohort tribune. With his arms tied behind his back, his clothes torn, he was led away, a melancholy sight, many crying out against him, none in tears: the distastefulness of the final scene dispelling pity. <br />A soldier from <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a> came upon him and struck at him, perhaps in anger, perhaps to remove him more swiftly from insult, perhaps aiming at the tribune, it is uncertain: but he sliced off the tribune’s ear and was immediately run through. </p>                        </div>

The Germans at once sent envoys to offer help: while <a href=/people/12168 target=_blank>Civilis</a> sought to win over the Gallic provinces by bribery and cunning, sending the captured prefects back to their own states, while granting the soldiers composing their cohorts permission to go or stay as they preferred. <br />Those who stayed were offered honourable military service, those who left plunder taken from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>: at the same time <a href=/people/12168 target=_blank>Civilis</a> reminded them in private of the ills they had suffered for so many years, in mistaking a wretched servitude for peace. ‘The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/518059UBat class=ethnic long=5.8698 lat=51.8481>Batavians</a>,’ he said, ‘though free from paying tribute, have nevertheless taken arms against our mutual oppressors; these <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were defeated and routed in the first encounter. <br />If the Gallic provinces were to throw off the yoke, what strength remains to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>?

And the Nervian cohorts, through fear or treachery, left our flanks naked: thus our defence rested on the legions who, their standards lost, were being cut down inside the ramparts when fresh reinforcements suddenly altered the outcome of the conflict. <br />Cohorts of <a href=/people/12186 target=_blank>Vascones</a>, raised in the past by <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a> and summoned earlier, on nearing the camp and hearing the noise of battle had attacked the enemy, engaging them from the rear, causing wider terror than their numbers justified, some of their opponents believing that the whole force from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/512067UNov class=place long=6.7219 lat=51.1839>Novaesium</a>, others that the troops from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/500083UMog class=place long=8.2507 lat=49.9893>Mogontiacum</a> had appeared. <br />This error on the part of the enemy inspired the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and trusting in the strength of others, they regained their own.

If <a href=/people/12168 target=_blank>Civilis</a> had increased the strength of his lines he would not have been outflanked by a few cohorts, but would have penetrated and destroyed the Roman camp. While <a href=/people/12027 target=_blank>Vocula</a>, failing to detect the enemy’s approach, was beaten the moment he left camp; then lacking confidence in victory spent useless days before moving against the enemy, while if he had been quick to press on and follow the flow of events, he could have raised the siege of the legions at a blow. <br />In the meantime, <a href=/people/12168 target=_blank>Civilis</a> tested the spirits of the besieged, feigning that all was lost with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and victory was his, parading Roman banners and standards, and even exhibiting prisoners. One of these, with outstanding courage, called out and exposed the reality, only to be killed by the Germans, which act of theirs was the greater witness to his loyalty; while the devastation and flames of burning farms announced the approach of the victorious Roman troops. <br />Though in sight of camp, <a href=/people/12027 target=_blank>Vocula</a> ordered the standards to be set in place and surrounded by a ditch and rampart, and the baggage and kit to be deposited there, so as to fight unencumbered. There was an immediate outcry against the general, demanding battle; and threatening him as they had become accustomed to do. <br />Without even waiting to form line, subject still to disorder and fatigue, they took up the fight; while <a href=/people/12168 target=_blank>Civilis</a> was prepared also, trusting no less in the enemy’s failings than his own warriors’ bravery. <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> fluctuated on the Roman side, for though the most seditious proved cowards there were those who, remembering their recent success, held fast. They struck at the enemy, encouraged each other and those nearest, and reforming their line signalled to their besieged comrades to seize the moment.

However <a href=/people/1555 target=_blank>Curtius</a> <a href=/people/3430 target=_blank>Montanus</a> spoke bitterly, going so far as to accuse <a href=/people/512 target=_blank>Regulus</a> of rewarding <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>’s assassin, after <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>’s murder, and of savaging <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>’s head with his teeth. ‘That is not something, surely,’ he said, ‘<a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> forced you to, that savage act in no way procured your life and safety. Shall we accept the defence of those who would rather ruin others than risk themselves? Your father’s exile and the division of his estate among his creditors left you secure, not old enough to hold office and with nothing of yours <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> might covet, nothing for him to fear from you. Through lust for slaughter and hunger for reward you stained your record with his noble blood, seizing the consular spoils, fattening yourself on seventy thousand gold pieces, and with priestly splendour involving in that same ruin innocent children, eminent men and noble women. <br />You accused <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> himself of lack of effort, of wearying himself and his informers with attacking lone houses, when the whole senate could be overthrown with a single word. Gentlemen of the senate, let us preserve this fellow with his ready counsel, let us enlist his services, that every age may be instructed by his example, and let our youths imitate <a href=/people/512 target=_blank>Regulus</a> as their elders did a <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> or a <a href=/people/1533 target=_blank>Crispus</a>! Wrongdoing finds its emulators, even in misfortune: what then if it should flourish and grow strong? If we do not dare touch this fellow as a mere quaestor, how will we dare do so when he is praetor, or consul? Think you that <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> will be the last tyrant? Those who outlived <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> and <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a> thought the same, while one more cruel, more infamous, rose to view! We do not fear <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, such is his maturity, his moderation, but precedents endure longer than morals. We grow weak, fellow-senators, we are no longer that senate which on the death of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> demanded punishment for his minions and informers, in the manner of our ancestors. The best moment to seize, after a worthless emperor’s reign, is the first.’ </p>                        </div>

Those men who had been dismissed by <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> and had gathered to <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> sought to re-enlist in the praetorian cohorts. And the legionaries who had been selected, having that same expectation, demanded the pay promised. Even the Vitellians who had surrendered could not be expelled without much bloodshed, but it would have cost a large amount to maintain such a vast force. <br /><a href=/people/1246 target=_blank>Mucianus</a> visited the camp to review each man’s service, parading the victors with their correct insignia and weapons and leaving a modest space between the separate companies.

Then, as they began to be placed apart, all became fearful, the German soldiers being the most affected, thinking themselves by this manoeuvre destined for slaughter. They threw themselves on the breasts of their erstwhile comrades, clasped their necks, sought a parting embrace, begged them not to abandon them nor, as men sharing their cause, allow them to suffer a different fate. <br />They appealed now to <a href=/people/1246 target=_blank>Mucianus</a>, now to the absent emperor, and then to the heavens and the gods, until <a href=/people/1246 target=_blank>Mucianus</a>, saying they were all bound by the same oath, soldiers of the same emperor, condemned their needless panic, while the cheers of the victors were added to the tears of the rest.

Prayers indeed, but ones which could not be gainsaid: thus they were received into the ranks of the praetorians. <br />Then those whose age and length of service so justified were dismissed with honour. Others, who were at fault, were released progressively, one by one, the safest way of dispersing a large and like-minded crew. </p>                        </div>

He said that wars could be started even by cowards, but are carried out with risks even to the bravest, and the legions were now upon them.

His advent inspired hope; he himself being eager for battle, and more inclined to scorn an enemy than beware of one. He roused his soldiers with fierce words, declaring that he would not hesitate a moment once he could engage the enemy. <br />He sent home to their individual states those troops that been levied throughout Gaul, ordering them to announce that the legions sufficed to maintain the empire. The allies were to return to their peacetime duties, with confidence, since when Roman forces undertook a campaign it was already as good as ended. This action helped to ensure the Gauls’ compliance, since once they had their young men back they tolerated the tribute, accepting their responsibilities more readily once their aggression was ignored. <br />When <a href=/people/12168 target=_blank>Civilis</a> and <a href=/people/12169 target=_blank>Classicus</a> heard of Tutor’s defeat, the slaughter of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/498066UCol class=ethnic long=6.644 lat=49.7597>Treviri</a>, and the enemy’s success everywhere, they were alarmed, and rushed to gather their scattered forces, sending a host of messages to <a href=/people/3712 target=_blank>Valentinus</a>, warning him of the danger of a decisive battle. <br />This prompted <a href=/people/12170 target=_blank>Cerialis</a> to send officers to the <<a about=https://topostext.org/place/491062UDiv class=ethnic long=6.1756 lat=49.1202>Mediomatrici</a>, to direct the legions against the enemy by a shorter route, while he united the forces accompanying him with the troops at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/500083UMog class=place long=8.2507 lat=49.9893>Mainz</a>. After a three day march he reached Rigodulum, which <a href=/people/3712 target=_blank>Valentinus</a> had occupied with a large force of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/498066UCol class=ethnic long=6.644 lat=49.7597>Treviri</a>.

These defences failed to deter the Roman general from ordering an infantry assault, or sending his cavalry onto the hills above, since he despised the enemy, believing their hastily gathered forces would enjoy less advantage from their position than his own men would from their abilities. <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were a little delayed in their ascent while exposed to enemy missiles, but as soon as they came to close quarters the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/498066UCol class=ethnic long=6.644 lat=49.7597>Treviri</a> were demolished like a ruined building.

They stood there, eyes downcast, conscious of their guilt: when the armies met there was no mutual welcome; the soldiers failed to respond to encouragement or consolation, they hid in their tents and avoided the light of day.

This day was to be regarded as the first day of their military service and their oath: neither he nor the emperor would recall their past misdeeds. Then the men were received in camp with the rest, and an edict was read out in each company forbidding any soldier’s taunting of a comrade, in the course of quarrel or dispute, with accusations of murder or sedition. </p>                        </div>

He prayed the emperor might deign to moisten his eyes and cheeks with spit. Another whose hand was paralysed, at the promptings of the same divinity, beseeched Caesar to set his foot on it and massage it. <br />At first <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, laughingly treated them with scorn; when they persisted, on the one hand he feared the discredit that might arise from failure, on the other he was inspired, by their appeals and the encouragement of his courtiers, to anticipate success. In the end, he ordered the physicians to advise on whether such blindness or debility could be cured by human aid. <br />The doctors suggested opposing treatments: in the first case the power of seeing had not been destroyed, and would return if the impediments to it were removed; in the second the wrist was out of joint, but could be reset with the application of salutary pressure. Such, they said, might be the gods’ desire, and the emperor chosen for this divine ministration; and then the glory would be Caesar’s if a remedy was achieved, while failure would merely bring down ridicule on the wretched suppliants. <br />So <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, with a smile on his face, amid an excited crowd of bystanders, did as suggested, believing his good fortune capable of anything, and nothing now impossible. The hand was immediately restored to use, and daylight flooded the blind. Both events are still recalled by those present, even now when there is no reward for lying. </p>                        </div>

This would be a blessing for the kingdom, and the city that received the image would become great and famous.

He was torn between fear of the god coupled with the threats and opposition of his people, and the recurring temptation of the ambassadors’ gifts and promises. Three years passed thus, with <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> no less eager or ready with his requests. He sent more imposing ambassadors, a larger fleet, and more gold. <br />At length, a menacing vision appeared to Scydrothemis, warning him to thwart the god’s purpose no longer. While he still hesitated, they were beset by various disasters and diseases, the god’s anger being evident and weighing more heavily day by day. He summoned an assembly, and spoke of the god’s command, the visions granted to himself and <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, and their growing misfortunes. But the people opposed their king: resistant towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and afraid for themselves, they surrounded the god’s temple. <br />Now the story told becomes stranger, for the god himself embarked of his own accord on a ship lying onshore, and wonderful to relate crossed the high seas to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> in two days. A temple, fit for that great city, was erected on the site called <a href=/people/10175 target=_blank>Rhacotis</a>, where was an ancient shrine dedicated to <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Serapis</a> and <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>. Such is the most celebrated account of the god’s origins and arrival. <br />Yet I am not unaware that some say the god was brought from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361359USel class=place long=35.9347 lat=36.1222>Seleucia</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, in the reign of <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> III (<a href=/people/8221 target=_blank>Euergetes</a>, 247-222BC); while others claim that same <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> imported him from the site of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>, once the famous capitol of ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. Many consider the god to be <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Aesculapius</a> himself, because he heals the sick; some think him <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> the most ancient god of those peoples; a greater number see him as <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, lord of all things; but the majority, from his statue’s attributes or their own conjecture, consider him to be Dis Pater, Father Dis. </p>                        </div>

They adopted the practice of circumcision to distinguish themselves from other nations. Those who convert to their ways follow the same rite, and they are first taught to despise their previous gods, disown their native country, and hold the parents, children and brothers they have left behind as of no account. <br />However they take care to increase their numbers, regarding it as sinful to kill any unwanted child, and believing that the spirits of those killed in battle or by execution are immortal; hence their love of generation and their contempt for death.

Its waters are not disturbed by the wind, and neither fish nor water-birds can tolerate them. Its lifeless waves support whatever is thrown onto them, like solid ground. <br />At a certain time of year, bitumen rises, which experience has taught the collection of, as it teaches us our other skills. Bitumen (or asphalt) is by nature a dark liquid (or semi-solid form of petroleum) which coagulates when sprinkled with vinegar, and floats on the surface. The tale told by ancient authors is that those who are concerned with it capture a segment with their hands and haul it aboard: then it flows in, without assistance, and weighs the boat down, until the stream is cut off: you cannot cut it with bronze or iron, but it shrinks from menstrual blood, or a cloth stained with it. However those who know the country say that floating masses of bitumen are driven by the wind or drawn by hand to shore, then once dried by the hot vapours from the ground or by the sun they are split with axe and wedge just like wood or stone. </p>                        </div>

Some cavalry and light-infantry were sent against them but the engagement was indecisive.

There is an ever-flowing spring, the hills are tunnelled below ground and pools and cisterns hold rainwater. The city’s founders foresaw many wars due to the uniqueness of their customs and way of life, therefore they built the whole in anticipation of long siege, and during <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>’s assault on the city, anxiety and experience taught them a great deal. Then too, Roman greed in <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>’ day, had bought them the right to fortifications, walls built in peace as if for war. <br /> At this time, there was a large influx of dissidents from other defeated cities, since the most obstinate rebels had taken refuge here, and sedition was rife. There were three leaders, and three resistance forces: the outermost and widest of the walls was defended by <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a> (bar Giora), the centre of the city by John (of Giscala), and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>Temple</a> by <a href=/people/1398 target=_blank>Eleazar</a> (ben <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a>).

They chose a dark cloudy night and slipping downstream entered the camp unopposed. <br />Cunning aided their attempt at first: cutting the tent-ropes they killed the men who were buried under their own canvas. A separate force assaulted the boats, hurling grappling irons and dragging the vessels away; deceiving initially by silence, once the slaughter began they added to the panic with their clamour. <br />Roused by the onslaught, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> sought their weapons, running through the camp, few fully equipped to fight, most with their clothing draped round their bodies and their swords drawn.

But <a href=/people/12170 target=_blank>Cerialis</a> had spent the night elsewhere, as many believe, on account of his affair with a Ubian woman, <a href=/people/1822 target=_blank>Claudia</a> Sacrata. <br />The sentries used his behaviour to excuse their own dereliction of duty, saying they were ordered to be silent in order not to disturb him, and thus the trumpet-calls and challenges had been omitted and they had fallen asleep themselves. <br />The enemy sailed away in broad daylight with the captured vessels, taking the flagship up the river Lippe as a gift for <a href=/people/12029 target=_blank>Veleda</a>. </p>                        </div>
