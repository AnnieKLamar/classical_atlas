I could not, indeed, refuse to write of him, inasmuch as I had already written of others, emperors created in tumult, I mean, and princes of no importance, all in that book which I composed about the thirty pretenders and which now includes even a descendant of <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> and a Victoria; 2 for things had come to such a pass that, for the sake of comparison with <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, I was forced to write even the lives of women. 3 And, in fact, it would not be right to leave unmentioned an emperor who left us such a scion of his race, who ended the war against the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> by his own valour, who as victor laid a healing hand upon the public miseries, who, though not the contriver of the plan, nevertheless thrust <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, that monstrous emperor, from the helm of the state, himself destined to rule for the good of the human race, who, finally, had he but tarried longer in this commonwealth, would by his strength, his counsel, and his foresight have restored to us the <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipios</a>, the Camilli, and all those men of old. </p>                        </div>

He loved his parents; what wonder in that? He loved also his brothers; that, indeed, may seem worthy of wonder. He envied none, but he punished evil-doers. 7 Judges guilty of theft he condemned openly and in public; but to the stupid he extended a sort of careless indulgence. He enacted most excellent laws. 8 Indeed, so great a man did he show himself in public affairs, that the greatest princes chose a descendant of his to hold the imperial power, and a bettered senate desired him. </p>                        </div>

For a great multitude, the survivors of the barbarian tribes, who had gathered in Haemimontum, were so stricken with famine and pestilence that <a href=/people/11041 target=_blank>Claudius</a> now scorned to conquer them further. 4 And so at length that most cruel of wars was brought to an end, and the Roman nation was freed from its terrors. <br />5 Now good faith forces me to speak the truth, and also the desire of showing to those who wish me to appear as a flatterer that I am not concealing what history demands should be told: 6 namely, that at the time when the victory was won in full, a number of <a href=/people/11041 target=_blank>Claudius</a>' soldiers, puffed up with success — which weakens the mind of even the wise — turned to plundering; for they did not reflect that, while busied in mind and in body, they gave themselves up to seizing their prey, a very few could put them to flight. 7 And so, at the very moment of victory, about two thousand soldiers were slain by a few barbarians, who had already been routed. 8 When <a href=/people/11041 target=_blank>Claudius</a> learned this, however, he assembled his army and seized all those who had shown a rebellious spirit, and he even sent them to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> in chains to be used in the public spectacles. So, whatever damage either fortune or the soldiers had caused was made good through the courage of the excellent prince, and not only was victory won from the enemy, but revenge was taken as well. 9 In this war, throughout its whole length, the valour of the Dalmatian horsemen stood out as especially great, because it was thought that <a href=/people/11041 target=_blank>Claudius</a> claimed that province as his original home; others, however, declared that he was a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420313RDar class=demonym long=21.32 lat=42.03>Dardanian</a> and derived his descent from <a href=/people/995 target=_blank>Ilus</a>, a king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> and, in fact, even from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401264UDar class=place long=26.3725 lat=40.086>Dardanus</a> himself. </p>                        </div>
