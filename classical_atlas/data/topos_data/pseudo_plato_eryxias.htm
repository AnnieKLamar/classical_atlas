                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg038:392'><b>&sect; 392</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;It happened by chance that <a href=/people/2161 target=_blank>Eryxias</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379240DSte class=person long=24.0107 lat=37.8982>Steirian</a> was walking with me in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BSZe class=place long=23.722163 lat=37.975843>Stoa of Zeus Eleutherios</a>, when there came up to us <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a> and <a href=/people/763 target=_blank>Erasistratus</a>, the latter the son of <a href=/people/2063 target=_blank>Phaeax</a>, who was the nephew of <a href=/people/763 target=_blank>Erasistratus</a>. Now <a href=/people/763 target=_blank>Erasistratus</a> had just arrived from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> and that part of the world. As they approached, he said, Hail, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>!<br />SOCRATES: The same to you, I said; have you any good news from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> to tell us?<br />ERASISTRATUS: Most excellent. But, if you please, let us first sit down; for I am tired with my yesterday’s journey from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=place long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megara</a>.<br />SOCRATES: Gladly, if that is your desire.<br />ERASISTRATUS: What would you wish to hear first? he said. What the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a> are doing, or how they are disposed towards our city? To my mind, they are very like <a href=/people/10963 target=_blank>wasps</a>: so long as you only cause them a little annoyance they are quite unmanageable; you must destroy their nests if you wish to get the better of them. And in a similar way, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=ethnic long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracusans</a>, unless we set to work in earnest, and go against them with a great expedition, will never submit to our rule. The petty injuries which we at present inflict merely irritate them enough to make them utterly intractable. And now they have sent ambassadors to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, and intend, I suspect, to play us some trick. — While we were talking, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=demonym long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracusan</a> envoys chanced to go by, and <a href=/people/763 target=_blank>Erasistratus</a>, pointing to one of them, said to me, That, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, is the richest man in all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. For who has larger estates or more land at his disposal to cultivate if he please? And they are of a quality, too, finer than any other land in Hellas. Moreover, he has all the things which go to make up wealth, slaves and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> innumerable, gold and silver without end.<br />I saw that he was inclined to expatiate on the riches of the man; so I asked him, </p>                        </div>

Surely there is no one who would not prefer to be poor and well, rather than to have all the King of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>’s wealth and to be ill. And this proves that men set health above wealth, else they would never choose the one in preference to the other.<br />ERASISTRATUS: True.<br />SOCRATES: And if anything appeared to be more valuable than health, he would be the richest who possessed it?<br />ERASISTRATUS: He would.<br />SOCRATES: Suppose that some one came to us at this moment and were to ask, Well, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> and <a href=/people/2161 target=_blank>Eryxias</a> and <a href=/people/763 target=_blank>Erasistratus</a>, can you tell me what is of the greatest value to men? Is it not that of which the possession will best enable a man to advise how his own and his friend’s affairs should be administered? — What will be our reply?<br />ERASISTRATUS: I should say, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, that happiness was the most precious of human possessions.<br />SOCRATES: Not a bad answer. But do we not deem those men who are most prosperous to be the happiest?<br />ERASISTRATUS: That is my opinion.<br />SOCRATES: And are they not most prosperous who commit the fewest errors in respect either of themselves or of other men?<br />ERASISTRATUS: Certainly.<br />SOCRATES: And they who know what is evil and what is good; what should be done and what should be left undone; — these behave the most wisely and make the fewest mistakes? </p>                        </div>

Where would be the advantage of wisdom then? Or how could he be the richest of men who might even have to go begging, because he had not wherewithal to live?<br />I thought that what <a href=/people/2161 target=_blank>Eryxias</a> was saying had some weight, and I replied, Would the wise man really suffer in this way, if he were so ill-provided; whereas if he had the house of Polytion, and the house were full of gold and silver, he would lack nothing?<br />ERYXIAS: Yes; for then he might dispose of his property and obtain in exchange what he needed, or he might sell it for money with which he could supply his wants and in a moment procure abundance of everything.<br />SOCRATES: True, if he could find some one who preferred such a house to the wisdom of <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>. But if there are persons who set great store by wisdom like <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>’s and the advantages accruing from it, to sell these, if he were so disposed, would be easier still. Or is a house a most useful and necessary possession, and does it make a great difference in the comfort of life to have a mansion like Polytion’s instead of living in a shabby little cottage, whereas wisdom is of small use and it is of no importance whether a man is wise or ignorant about the highest matters? Or is wisdom despised of men and can find no buyers, although cypress wood and marble of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381239LPen class=place long=23.8831 lat=38.0807>Pentelicus</a> are eagerly bought by numerous purchasers? Surely the prudent pilot or the skilful physician, or the artist of any kind who is proficient in his art, is more worth than the things which are especially reckoned among riches; and he who can advise well and prudently for himself and others is able also to sell the product of his art, if he so desire. </p>                        </div>

And yet, although you claimed to be wiser about things of real importance, you would not any the more be richer than he.<br />I dare say, <a href=/people/2161 target=_blank>Eryxias</a>, I said, that you may regard these arguments of ours as a kind of game; you think that they have no relation to facts, but are like the pieces in the game of draughts which the player can move in such a way that his opponents are unable to make any countermove. And perhaps, too, as regards riches you are of opinion that while facts remain the same, there are arguments, no matter whether true or false, which enable the user of them to prove that the wisest and the richest are one and the same, although he is in the wrong and his opponents are in the right. There would be nothing strange in this; it would be as if two persons were to dispute about letters, one declaring that the word <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> began with an S, the other that it began with an A, and the latter could gain the victory over the former.<br /><a href=/people/2161 target=_blank>Eryxias</a> glanced at the audience, laughing and blushing at once, as if he had had nothing to do with what had just been said, and replied — No, indeed, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, I never supposed that our arguments should be of a kind which would never convince any one of those here present or be of advantage to them. For what man of sense could ever be persuaded that the wisest and the richest are the same? The truth is that we are discussing the subject of riches, and my notion is that we should argue respecting the honest and dishonest means of acquiring them, and, generally, whether they are a good thing or a bad.<br />Very good, I said, and I am obliged to you for the hint: in future we will be more careful. But why do not you yourself, as you introduced the argument, and do not think that the former discussion touched the point at issue, tell us whether you consider riches to be a good or an evil?<br />I am of opinion, he said, that they are a good. He was about to add something more, when <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a> interrupted him: — Do you really suppose so, <a href=/people/2161 target=_blank>Eryxias</a>?<br />Certainly, replied <a href=/people/2161 target=_blank>Eryxias</a>; I should be mad if I did not: and I do not fancy that you would find any one else of a contrary opinion.<br />And I, retorted <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a>, should say that there is no one whom I could not compel to admit that riches are bad for some men. </p>                        </div>

For I should be ashamed if I were present and did not do what I could to prevent your difference. And I should do the same if you were quarrelling about any other art and were likely, unless you agreed on the point in dispute, to part as enemies instead of as friends. But now, when we are contending about a thing of which the usefulness continues during the whole of life, and it makes an enormous difference whether we are to regard it as beneficial or not — a thing, too, which is esteemed of the highest importance by the Hellenes: — (for parents, as soon as their children are, as they think, come to years of discretion, urge them to consider how wealth may be acquired, since by riches the value of a man is judged): — When, I say, we are thus in earnest, and you, who agree in other respects, fall to disputing about a matter of such moment, that is, about wealth, and not merely whether it is black or white, light or heavy, but whether it is a good or an evil, whereby, although you are now the dearest of friends and kinsmen, the most bitter hatred may arise betwixt you, I must hinder your dissension to the best of my power. If I could, I would tell you the truth, and so put an end to the dispute; but as I cannot do this, and each of you supposes that you can bring the other to an agreement, I am prepared, as far as my capacity admits, to help you in solving the question. Please, therefore, <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a>, try to make us accept the doctrines which you yourself entertain.<br />CRITIAS: I should like to follow up the argument, and will ask <a href=/people/2161 target=_blank>Eryxias</a> whether he thinks that there are just and unjust men?<br />ERYXIAS: Most decidedly.<br />CRITIAS: And does injustice seem to you an evil or a good?<br />ERYXIAS: An evil.<br />CRITIAS: Do you consider that he who bribes his neighbour’s wife and commits adultery with her, acts justly or unjustly, and this although both the state and the laws forbid?<br />ERYXIAS: Unjustly.<br />CRITIAS: And if the wicked man has wealth and is willing to spend it, he will carry out his evil purposes? whereas he who is short of means cannot do what he fain would, and therefore does not sin? </p>                        </div>

For he thought that he had been robbed of a great possession when it became obvious to him that he had been wrong in his former opinion about wealth. I observed his vexation, and feared that they would proceed to abuse and quarrelling: so I said — I heard that very argument used in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BLyk class=place long=23.7433 lat=37.974>Lyceum</a> yesterday by a wise man, <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376243IKeo class=person long=24.3333 lat=37.6167>Ceos</a>; but the audience thought that he was talking mere nonsense, and no one could be persuaded that he was speaking the truth. And when at last a certain talkative young gentleman came in, and, taking his seat, began to laugh and jeer at <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a>, tormenting him and demanding an explanation of his argument, he gained the ear of the audience far more than <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a>.<br />Can you repeat the discourse to us? Said <a href=/people/763 target=_blank>Erasistratus</a>.<br />SOCRATES: If I can only remember it, I will. The youth began by asking <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a>, In what way did he think that riches were a good and in what an evil? <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> answered, as you did just now, that they were a good to good men and to those who knew in what way they should be employed, while to the bad and the ignorant they were an evil. The same is true, he went on to say, of all other things; men make them to be what they are themselves.

Not that he concerns himself at all with these other things, but he has converted my ignorance into wisdom. If, for example, a person teach me grammar or music, he will at the same time teach me all that relates to grammar or music, and so when he makes me good, he makes things good to me.<br /><a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> did not altogether agree: still he consented to what was said.<br />And do you think, said the youth, that doing good things is like building a house — the work of human agency; or do things remain what they were at first, good or bad, for all time?<br /><a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> began to suspect, I fancy, the direction which the argument was likely to take, and did not wish to be put down by a mere stripling before all those present: — (if they two had been alone, he would not have minded): — so he answered, cleverly enough: I think that doing good things is a work of human agency.<br />And is virtue in your opinion, <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a>, innate or acquired by instruction?<br />The latter, said <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a>.<br />Then you would consider him a simpleton who supposed that he could obtain by praying to the Gods the knowledge of grammar or music or any other art, which he must either learn from another or find out for himself?<br /><a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> agreed to this also.<br />And when you pray to the Gods that you may do well and receive good, you mean by your prayer nothing else than that you desire to become good and wise: — if, at least, things are good to the good and wise and evil to the evil. But in that case, if virtue is acquired by instruction, it would appear that you only pray to be taught what you do not know.<br />Hereupon I said to <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> that it was no misfortune to him if he had been proved to be in error in supposing that the Gods immediately granted to us whatever we asked: — if, I added, whenever you go up to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAkr class=place long=23.7257 lat=37.9717>Acropolis</a> you earnestly entreat the Gods to grant you good things, although you know not whether they can yield your request, it is as though you went to the doors of the grammarian and begged him, although you had never made a study of the art, to give you a knowledge of grammar which would enable you forthwith to do the business of a grammarian.<br />While I was speaking, <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> was preparing to retaliate upon his youthful assailant, intending to employ the argument of which you have just made use; </p>                        </div>

Had <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> been present and said what you have said, the audience would have thought him raving, and he would have been ejected from the gymnasium. But you have argued so excellently well that you have not only persuaded your hearers, but have brought your opponent to an agreement. For just as in the law courts, if two witnesses testify to the same fact, one of whom seems to be an honest fellow and the other a rogue, the testimony of the rogue often has the contrary effect on the judges’ minds to what he intended, while the same evidence if given by the honest man at once strikes them as perfectly true.

But why, as you have begun your argument so prettily, do you not go on with the rest? There is still something lacking, now you have agreed that (wealth) is a good to some and an evil to others. It remains to enquire what constitutes wealth; for unless you know this, you cannot possibly come to an understanding as to whether it is a good or an evil. I am ready to assist you in the enquiry to the utmost of my power: but first let him who affirms that riches are a good, tell us what, in his opinion, is wealth.<br />ERASISTRATUS: Indeed, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, I have no notion about wealth beyond that which men commonly have. I suppose that wealth is a quantity of money; and this, I imagine, would also be <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a>’ definition.<br />SOCRATES: Then now we have to consider, What is money?

And yet if any one among us had a mass of such coins he would be no wealthier than if he had so many pebbles from the mountain. At <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemon</a>, again, they use iron by weight which has been rendered useless: and he who has the greatest mass of such iron is thought to be the richest, although elsewhere it has no value. In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> engraved stones are employed, of which a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonian</a> could make no use.

These are useful and yet they are not wealth.<br />SOCRATES: Clearly we have not yet answered the question, What is wealth? That wealth must be useful, to be wealth at all — thus much is acknowledged by every one. But what particular thing is wealth, if not all things? Let us pursue the argument in another way; and then we may perhaps find what we are seeking. What is the use of wealth, and for what purpose has the possession of riches been invented — in the sense, I mean, in which drugs have been discovered for the cure of disease? Perhaps in this way we may throw some light on the question. It appears to be clear that whatever constitutes wealth must be useful, and that wealth is one class of useful things; and now we have to enquire, What is the use of those useful things which constitute wealth? For all things probably may be said to be useful which we use in production, just as all things which have life are animals, but there is a special kind of animal which we call ‘man.’ Now if any one were to ask us, What is that of which, if we were rid, we should not want medicine and the instruments of medicine, we might reply that this would be the case if disease were absent from our bodies and either never came to them at all or went away again as soon as it appeared; and we may therefore conclude that medicine is the science which is useful for getting rid of disease. But if we are further asked, What is that from which, if we were free, we should have no need of wealth? can we give an answer? If we have none, suppose that we restate the question thus: — If a man could live without food or drink, and yet suffer neither hunger nor thirst, would he want either money or anything else in order to supply his needs?<br />ERYXIAS: He would not.<br />SOCRATES: And does not this apply in other cases? If we did not want for the service of the body the things of which we now stand in need, and heat and cold and the other bodily sensations were unperceived by us, there would be no use in this so-called wealth, if no one, that is, had any necessity for those things which now make us wish for wealth in order that we may satisfy the desires and needs of the body in respect of our various wants. And therefore if the possession of wealth is useful in ministering to our bodily wants, and bodily wants were unknown to us, we should not need wealth, and possibly there would be no such thing as wealth.<br />ERYXIAS: Clearly not.<br />SOCRATES: Then our conclusion is, as would appear, that wealth is what is useful to this end?<br /><a href=/people/2161 target=_blank>Eryxias</a> once more gave his assent, but the small argument considerably troubled him.<br />SOCRATES: And what is your opinion about another question: </p>                        </div>

And the argument applies equally in other cases.<br />ERYXIAS: Clearly.<br />SOCRATES: And therefore conditions which are not required for the existence of a thing are not useful for the production of it?<br />ERYXIAS: Of course not.<br />SOCRATES: And if without gold or silver or anything else which we do not use directly for the body in the way that we do food and drink and bedding and houses — if without these we could satisfy the wants of the body, they would be of no use to us for that purpose?<br />ERYXIAS: They would not.<br />SOCRATES: They would no longer be regarded as wealth, because they are useless, whereas that would be wealth which enabled us to obtain what was useful to us?<br />ERYXIAS: O <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, you will never be able to persuade me that gold and silver and similar things are not wealth. But I am very strongly of opinion that things which are useless to us are not wealth, and that the money which is useful for this purpose is of the greatest use; not that these things are not useful towards life, if by them we can procure wealth.<br />SOCRATES: And how would you answer another question? There are persons, are there not, who teach music and grammar and other arts for pay, and thus procure those things of which they stand in need?<br />ERYXIAS: There are.<br />SOCRATES: And these men by the arts which they profess, and in exchange for them, obtain the necessities of life just as we do by means of gold and silver?<br />ERYXIAS: True.<br />SOCRATES: Then if they procure by this means what they want for the purposes of life, that art will be useful towards life? For do we not say that silver is useful because it enables us to supply our bodily needs?<br />ERYXIAS: We do.<br />SOCRATES: Then if these arts are reckoned among things useful, the arts are wealth for the same reason as gold and silver are, for, clearly, the possession of them gives wealth.

Are not certain things useful to the builder when he is building a house?<br />CRITIAS: They are.<br />SOCRATES: And would you say that those things are useful which are employed in house building — stones and bricks and beams and the like, and also the instruments with which the builder built the house, the beams and stones which they provided, and again the instruments by which these were obtained?<br />CRITIAS: It seems to me that they are all useful for building.<br />SOCRATES: And is it not true of every art, that not only the materials but the instruments by which we procure them and without which the work could not go on, are useful for that art?<br />CRITIAS: Certainly.<br />SOCRATES: And further, the instruments by which the instruments are procured, and so on, going back from stage to stage ad infinitum — are not all these, in your opinion, necessary in order to carry out the work? </p>                        </div>

For we have already laid down the principle that things cannot be at one time useful and at another time not, in the same process.<br />CRITIAS: But in that respect your argument and mine are the same. For you maintain if they are useful to a certain end, they can never become useless; whereas I say that in order to accomplish some results bad things are needed, and good for others.<br />SOCRATES: But can a bad thing be used to carry out a good purpose?<br />CRITIAS: I should say not.<br />SOCRATES: And we call those actions good which a man does for the sake of virtue?<br />CRITIAS: Yes.<br />SOCRATES: But can a man learn any kind of knowledge which is imparted by word of mouth if he is wholly deprived of the sense of hearing?<br />CRITIAS: Certainly not, I think.<br />SOCRATES: And will not hearing be useful for virtue, if virtue is taught by hearing and we use the sense of hearing in giving instruction?<br />CRITIAS: Yes.<br />SOCRATES: And since medicine frees the sick man from his disease, that art too may sometimes appear useful in the acquisition of virtue, e.g. when hearing is procured by the aid of medicine.<br />CRITIAS: Very likely.<br />SOCRATES: But if, again, we obtain by wealth the aid of medicine, shall we not regard wealth as useful for virtue?<br />CRITIAS: True.<br />SOCRATES: And also the instruments by which wealth is procured?<br />CRITIAS: Certainly.<br />SOCRATES: Then you think that a man may gain wealth by bad and disgraceful means, and, having obtained the aid of medicine which enables him to acquire the power of hearing, may use that very faculty for the acquisition of virtue?<br />CRITIAS: Yes, I do.<br />SOCRATES: But can that which is evil be useful for virtue?<br />CRITIAS: No.<br />SOCRATES: It is not therefore necessary that the means by which we obtain what is useful for a certain object should always be useful for the same object: for it seems that bad actions may sometimes serve good purposes? </p>                        </div>

Can ignorance, for instance, be useful for knowledge, or disease for health, or vice for virtue?<br />CRITIAS: Never.<br />SOCRATES: And yet we have already agreed — have we not? — that there can be no knowledge where there has not previously been ignorance, nor health where there has not been disease, nor virtue where there has not been vice?<br />CRITIAS: I think that we have.<br />SOCRATES: But then it would seem that the antecedents without which a thing cannot exist are not necessarily useful to it. Otherwise ignorance would appear useful for knowledge, disease for health, and vice for virtue.<br /><a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a> still showed great reluctance to accept any argument which went to prove that all these things were useless. I saw that it was as difficult to persuade him as (according to the proverb) it is to boil a stone, so I said: Let us bid ‘good-bye’ to the discussion, since we cannot agree whether these things are useful and a part of wealth or not. But what shall we say to another question: Which is the happier and better man — he who requires the greatest quantity of necessaries for body and diet, or he who requires only the fewest and least? The answer will perhaps become more obvious if we suppose some one, comparing the man himself at different times, to consider whether his condition is better when he is sick or when he is well?<br />CRITIAS: That is not a question which needs much consideration.<br />SOCRATES: Probably, I said, every one can understand that health is a better condition than disease. But when have we the greatest and the most various needs, when we are sick or when we are well?<br />CRITIAS: When we are sick.<br />SOCRATES: And when we are in the worst state we have the greatest and most especial need and desire of bodily pleasures?<br />CRITIAS: True.<br />SOCRATES: And seeing that a man is best off when he is least in need of such things, does not the same reasoning apply to the case of any two persons, of whom one has many and great wants and desires, and the other few and moderate? For instance, some men are gamblers, some drunkards, and some gluttons: and gambling and the love of drink and greediness are all desires?<br />CRITIAS: Certainly.<br />SOCRATES: But desires are only the lack of something: and those who have the greatest desires are in a worse condition than those who have none or very slight ones? </p>                        </div>
