None the less, we shall bring forward what we have discovered in various historical works — and they shall be facts that are worthy to be related. 2 For there is no man who has not done something or other every day of his life; it is the business of the biographer, however, to relate only those events that are worth the knowing. 3 <a href=/people/514 target=_blank>Junius</a> <a href=/people/6382 target=_blank>Cordus</a>, indeed, was fond of publishing the lives of those emperors whom he considered the more obscure. 4 He did not, however, accomplish much; for he found but little information and that not worth noting. He openly declared that he would search out the most trivial details, as though, in dealing with a <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>, a <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a>, or a Marcus, it should be known how often he went out walking, when he varied his diet, and when he changed his clothes, whom he advanced in public life and at what time. 5 By searching out all this sort of thing and recording it, he filled his books with gossip, whereas either nothing at all should be said of petty matters or certainly very little, and then only when light can thereby be thrown on character. It is character, of course, that we really want to know, but only to a certain extent, that from this the rest may be inferred. </p>                        </div>

Though of humble origin and shameless in spirit as well as in countenance, and though hated by all, both civilians and soldiers, he nevertheless proclaimed himself now <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> and now <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. 2 Then he set out at once for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> war and thus gave no opportunity either for the soldiers to form an opinion of him, or for the gossip by which he was beset to gain its full strength. 3 The senators, however, out of hatred for <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a>, received him as emperor gladly, and in all the senate there was but the one cry: 4 Anyone rather than the fratricide, anyone rather than the incestuous, anyone rather than the filthy, anyone rather than the slayer of the senate and people! <br />5 It may perhaps seem to all a matter for wonder that <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> wished his son <a href=/people/11050 target=_blank>Diadumenianus</a> to receive the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, when he himself, it was reported, was responsible for the murder of an <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. </p>                        </div>

The priestess of Caelestis at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> was wont, when inspired by the goddess, to predict the truth. Now once, in the reign of <a href=/people/12361 target=_blank>Antoninus Pius</a>, she was foretelling the future to the proconsul, who, according to custom, was consulting about the public welfare as well as his own hopes of power, and when she came to the emperors she bade him in a loud voice count the number of times she said <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. Then, to the amazement of all, she uttered the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> eight times. 2 All interpreted this to mean that <a href=/people/12361 target=_blank>Antoninus Pius</a> would reign for eight years, but he exceeded this number and those who had faith in the priestess, either then or later, felt sure that her words had some different meaning. 3 And in fact, if all who bore the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> be counted, this will be found to be their number. 4 For <a href=/people/12361 target=_blank>Pius</a> first, <a href=/people/809 target=_blank>Marcus</a> second, <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> third, <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> fourth, <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> fifth, <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a> sixth, <a href=/people/11050 target=_blank>Diadumenianus</a> seventh, <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> eighth — all bore the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>; 5 while the two Gordians, on the other hand, must not be placed among the Antonini, for they either had only their praenomen or were called <a href=/people/3137 target=_blank>Antonii</a>, not Antonini. 6 Hence it came about that <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> called himself <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, as most writers relate, and <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> too and <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a>, and likewise <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>; 7 and the Antonines themselves, who were the true successors of <a href=/people/12361 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, used this name rather than their own personal names. Thus some have related it. 8 Others, however, assert that <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> gave the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> to his son <a href=/people/11050 target=_blank>Diadumenianus</a> merely for the purpose of removing the soldiers' suspicion that he himself had slain <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. 9 Others, again, declare that so great was the love for this name that the people and soldiers would not deem a man worthy of the imperial power did they not hear him called by the name <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. </p>                        </div>

For many have said that he fought in a gladiatorial combat, received the honorary staff, and then went to Africa; 6 that he was first of all a huntsman in the arena, then a notary, and after that a pleader for the privy-purse — an office from which he was advanced to the very highest honours. 7 Then, when prefect of the guard, after his colleague was banished, he slew his emperor, <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a>, employing such treachery that it did not appear that the Emperor had been slain by him. 8 For by bribing the imperial equerry and holding out great hopes, he caused the report to spread that the Emperor was killed by a conspiracy of the soldiers, because he had incurred their displeasure through his fratricide or his incest. </p>                        </div>

Such, indeed, is the way of men, for they say that they are forced to accept what they get for themselves, even through crime. 5 <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> moreover, feared also his colleague, lest he too might desire to rule; for all hoped that he would, and, had he received the support of a single company of soldiers, he himself would not have been unwilling. All, indeed, would most gladly have had him because of their hatred for <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> on account of his evil life or his humble origin, for all former emperors had been noble in birth. 6 Furthermore, he emblazoned himself with the name of <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a>, although not connected with him by any tie of kin. 7 Hence arose the jest, <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> is as much as a <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a> as <a href=/people/11050 target=_blank>Diadumenianus</a> is an <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>. Nevertheless, in order to prevent an uprising among the soldiers, he at once presented a donative to both the legionaries and the praetorians, rewarding them more liberally than was customary, and as a man would who sought to mitigate the crime of having slain the emperor. 8 Thus did money, as often happens, avail a man whom innocence could not have availed. For <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> kept himself in power for some time, though addicted to every kind of evil. <br />9 He then sent the senate a letter relating the death of <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, in which he gave him the title of the Deified, at the same time clearing himself of guilt and swearing that he knew nothing of the murder. Thus to his crime (as is the manner of evil men) he added perjury — an act with which it well became a scoundrel to begin. </p>                        </div>

For the army has deemed no one a more worthy avenger of the murder of <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> than his own prefect, whom he himself would certainly have charged with the punishing of the conspiracy, could it have been in his power to detect it while yet alive. 5 And farther on: They have offered me the imperial power, O Conscript Fathers, and for the time being I have accepted its guardianship, but I will retain its governance only if you also desire what has been the desire of the soldiers, to whom I have already ordered a donative to be given as well as all other things, according to the custom of emperors. 6 Likewise, farther on: To my son <a href=/people/11050 target=_blank>Diadumenianus</a>, who is known to you, the soldiers have given both the imperial power and the name — for they have called him <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> — that he might be honoured, first with this name, but also with the office of monarch. 7 And this act we beseech you, O Conscript Fathers, to approve with all good and prospering auspices, in order that you may still have with you the name of the Antonines, which you so greatly love. 8 Likewise, farther on: For <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, moreover, both the soldiers have decreed divine honours and we decree them, and we request you — though by our power as emperor we might command you — to decree them also, and we ourselves shall dedicate to him statues, two on horseback, two on foot clad in the garb of a soldier, and two seated clad in civil garb, and likewise to the Deified <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> two, clad in the robes of a triumphant general. 9 These measures, O Conscript Fathers, you will order to be carried out in accordance with our dutiful solicitation in behalf of our predecessors. </p>                        </div>

This last was an expression of his own, for he used to say that he was merciful in putting to death only one in a hundred, whereas they deserved to have one in ten or one in twenty put to death. 3 It would be too long to relate all his acts of brutality, but nevertheless I will describe one, no great one in his belief, yet one which was more distressing than all his tyrannical cruelties. 4 There were some soldiers who had had intercourse with their host's maid-servant, who for some time had led a life of ill-repute. Learning of their offence through one of his spies, 5 he commanded them to be brought before him and questioned them as to whether it were really true. When their guilt was proved, he gave orders that two <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> of extraordinary size should be cut open rapidly while still alive, and that the soldiers should be thrust one into each, with their heads protruding so that they could talk to each other.

Those guilty of adultery he always burned alive, fastening their bodies together. A slave who had fled from his master and had been found he would sentence to a combat with the sword in the public games. 11 A public informer, if he could not make good his accusation, he would condemn to death; if he could make it good, he would present him with his reward in money and send him away in disgrace. </p>                        </div>

In the Greek they are very well written, but they seem to me to have been translated by come commonplace poet. 4 When they were read to <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> he composed iambics, which have not been preserved but are said to have been most delightful. 5 They were, for that matter, destroyed in that same uprising in which he himself was slain, when all his possessions were overrun by the soldiers. </p>                        </div>
