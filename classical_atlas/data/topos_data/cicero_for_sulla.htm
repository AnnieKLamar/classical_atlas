                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi015:1'><b>&sect; 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have been very glad, O judges, if Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> had been able formerly to retain the honour of the dignity to which he was appointed, and had been allowed, after the misfortune which befell him, to derive some reward from his moderation in adversity. But since his unfriendly fortune has brought it about that he has been damaged, even at a time of his greatest honour, by the unpopularity ensuing not only from the common envy which pursues ambitious men, but also by the singular hatred in which <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a> is held, and that even in this sad and deplorable wreck of his former fortunes, he has still some enemies whose hostility he is unable to appease by the punishment which has fallen upon him; although I am very greatly concerned at his distresses, yet in his other misfortunes I can easily endure that an opportunity should be offered to me of causing virtuous men to recognise my lenity and merciful disposition, which was formerly known to every one, but which has of late been interrupted as it were; and of forcing wicked and profligate citizens, being again defeated and vanquished, to confess that, when the republic was in danger, I was energetic and fearless; now that it is said, I am lenient and merciful. [2] And since Lucius <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, O judges, my own most intimate friend, O judges, has thought that if he violated our friendship and intimacy somewhat in his speech for the prosecution, he could by that means detract a little from the authority of my defence, I will unite with my endeavours to ward off danger from my client a defence of my own conduct in the discharge of my duty. Not that I would employ that sort of speech at present, O judges, if my own interest alone were concerned, for on many occasions and in many places I have had, and I often shall have, opportunities of speaking of my own credit. But as he, O judges, has thought that the more he could take away from my authority, the more also he would be diminishing my client's means of protection; I also think, that if I can induce you to approve of the principles of my conduct and my wisdom in this discharge of my duty and in undertaking this defence, I shall also induce you to look favourably on the cause of Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>. [3] And in the first place, O <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, I ask you this why you should separate me from the other illustrious and chief men of this city, in regard to this duty, and to the right of defending clients? For what is the reason why the act of Quintus <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> a most illustrious man and a most accomplished citizen, is not blamed by you, and mine is blamed? For if a design of firing the city, and of extinguishing this empire, and of destroying this city, was entertained by Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> ought not such projects to raise greater indignation and greater hatred against their authors in me than in Quintus <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>? Ought not my opinion to be more severe in such a matter, as to whom I should think fit to assist in these causes, whom to oppose, whom to defend, and whom to abandon? No doubt, says he, for it was you who investigated, you who laid open the whole conspiracy. </p>                        </div>

Wherefore that conspiracy, if it was laid open by me, is now as evident in all its particulars to <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> as it is to me. And when you see that he, a man of such rank, and authority, and virtue, and wisdom, has not hesitated to defend this innocent Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, I ask why the access to the cause which was open to <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>, ought to be closed against me? I ask this also, — if you think that I, who defend him, am to he blamed, what do you think of those excellent men and most illustrious citizens, by whose zeal and dignified presence you perceive that this trial is attended, by whom the cause of my client is honoured, by whom his innocence is upheld? For that is not the only method of defending a man's cause which consists in speaking for him. All who countenance him with their presence, who show anxiety in his behalf, who desire his safety, all, as far as their opportunities allow or their authority extends, are defending him. [5] Ought I to be unwilling to appear on these benches on which I see these lights and ornaments of the republic, when it is only by my own numerous and great labours and dangers that I have mounted into their rank, and into this lofty position and dignity which I now enjoy? And that you may understand, O <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, whom you are accusing, if you are offended that I, who have defended no one on inquiries of this sort do not abandon Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, remember also the other men, whom you see countenancing this man by their presence. You will see that their opinion and mine has been one and the same about this man's case, and about that of the others. Who of us stood by Varguntius? No one. Not even this Quintus <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>, the very man who had formerly been his only defender when prosecuted for corruption. For he did not think himself connected by any bond of duty with that man, when he, by the commission of such enormous wickedness, had broken asunder the ties of all duties whatever. Who of us countenanced <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>? who ***? who of us thought Marcus <a href=/people/6585 target=_blank>Laeca</a> or Caius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> fit to be defended? who of all the men whom you see here gave the countenance of his presence to any one of those criminals? [6] No one. Why was that? Because in other causes good men think that they ought not to refuse to defend even guilty men, if they are their own intimate personal friends; but in this prosecution, there would not only be the fault of acting lightly, but there would be even some infection of wickedness which would taint one who defended that man whom he suspected of being involved in the guilt of planning the parricide of his country. [7] What was the case of <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a>? did not his companions, did not his own colleagues, did not his former friends, of whom he had at one time an ample number, did not all these men, who are the chief men in the republic, abandon him? Yes, and many of them even damaged him with their evidence. They made up their minds that it was an offence of such enormity, that they not only were bound to abstain from doing anything to conceal it, but that it was their duty to reveal it, and throw all the light that they were able upon it. </p>                        </div>

Unless you wish me to be considered a man of eminent ferocity before all other men, a man savage, inhuman, and endowed with an extraordinary cruelty and barbarity of disposition. [8] If this be the character which, on account of all my exploits, you wish now to fix upon my whole life, O <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, you are greatly mistaken. Nature made me merciful, my country made me severe; but neither my country nor nature has ever required me to be cruel. Lastly, that same vehement and fierce character which at that time the occasion and the republic imposed upon me, my own inclination and nature itself has now relieved me of; for my country required severity for a short time, my nature requires clemency and lenity during my whole life. [9] There is, therefore, no pretence for your separating me from so numerous a company of most honourable men. Duty is a plain thing, and the cause of all men is one and the same. You will have no reason to marvel hereafter, whenever you see me on the same side as you observe these men. For there is no side in the republic in which I have a peculiar and exclusive property. The time for acting did belong more peculiarly to me than to the others but the cause of indignation, and fear, and danger was common to us all. Nor, indeed, could I have been at that time as I was the chief man in providing for the safety of the state if others had been unwilling to be my companions. Wherefore it is inevitable that that which, when I was consul, belonged to me especially above all other men, should, now that I am a private individual, belong to me in common with the rest. Nor do I say this for the sake of sharing my unpopularity with others, but rather with the object of allowing them to partake of my praises. I will give a share of my burden to no one; but a share of my glory to all good men. [10] “You gave evidence against <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a>,” says he, “and you are defending <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>.” All this, O judges, has this object to prove that if I am an inconstant and fickle-minded man, my evidence ought not to be credited, and my defence ought not to carry any authority with it. But if there is found in me a proper consideration for the republic, a scrupulous regard to my duty, and a constant desire to retain the good-will of virtuous men, then there is nothing which an accuser ought less to say than that <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> is defended by me, but that <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a> was injured by my evidence against him. For I think that I not only carry with me zeal in defending causes, but also that my deliberate opinion has some weight; which, however, I will use with moderation, O judges, and I would not have used it at all if he had not compelled me. </p>                        </div>

In each of these you say that <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> was implicated. You know that I was not acquainted with the counsels of your father, a most brave man, and a most excellent consul. You know, as there was the greatest intimacy between you and me, that I knew nothing of what happened, or of what was said in those times; I imagine, because I had not yet become a thoroughly public character, because I had not yet arrived at the goal of honour which I proposed to myself; and because my ambition and my forensic labours separated me from all political deliberations. [12] Who, then, was present at your counsels? All these men whom you see here, giving <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> the countenance of their presence; and among the first was Quintus <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> — who, by reason of his honour and worth, and his admirable disposition towards the republic, and because of his exceeding intimacy with and excessive attachment to your father, was greatly moved by the thoughts of the common danger, and most especially by the personal peril of your father. Therefore, he was defended from the charge of being implicated in that conspiracy by that man who was present at and acquainted with all your deliberations, who was a partner in all your thoughts and in all your fears; and, elegant and argumentative as his speech in repelling this accusation was, it carried with it as much authority as it displayed of ability. Of that conspiracy, therefore, which is said to have been formed against you, to have been reported to you, and to have been revealed by you, I was unable to say anything as a witness. For I not only found out nothing, but scarcely did any report or suspicion of that matter reach my ears. [13] They who were your counselors, who became acquainted with these things in your company, — they who were supposed to be themselves menaced with that danger, who gave no countenance to <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a>, who gave most important evidence against him, — are now defending Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, are countenancing him by their presence here; now that he is in danger they declare that they were not deterred by the accusation of conspiracy from countenancing the others, but by the guilt of the men. But for the time of my consulship, and with respect to the charge of the greatest conspiracy, <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> shall be defended by me. And this partition of the cause between <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> and me has not been made by chance, or at random, O judges, but as we saw that we were employed as defenders of a man against those accusations in which we might have been witnesses, each of us thought that it would be best for him to undertake that part of the case, concerning which he himself had been able to acquire some knowledge, and to form some opinions with certainty. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi015:5'><b>&sect; 5</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;[14] And since you have listened attentively to <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>, while speaking on the charge respecting the former conspiracy, now, I beg you, listen to this first statement of mine respecting the conspiracy which was formed in my consulship. <br />When I was consul I heard many reports, I made many inquiries, I learnt a great many circumstances concerning the extreme peril of the republic. No messenger, no information, no letters, no suspicion ever reached me at any time in the least affecting <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>. Perhaps this assertion ought to have great weight when coming from a man who as consul had investigated the plots laid against the republic with prudence, had revealed them with sincerity had chastised them with magnanimity and who says that he himself never heard a word against Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> and never entertained a suspicion of him. But I do not as yet employ this assertion for the purpose of defending him I rather use it with a view to clear myself in order that <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a> may cease to wonder that I, who would not appear by the side of <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a>, am now defending <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>. [15] For what was the cause of <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a>? and what is the cause of <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>? The former tried to disturb and get rid of a prosecution for bribery by raising in the first instance a sedition among gladiators and runaway slaves, and after that as we all saw, by stoning people, and collecting a violent mob. <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, if his own modesty and worth could not avail him, sought no other assistance. The former, when he had been convicted, behaved in such a manner, not only in his secret designs and conversation, but in every look and in his whole countenance, as to appear an enemy to the most honourable orders in the state, hostile to every virtuous man, and a foe to his country. The latter considered himself so bowed down, so broken down by that misfortune, that he thought that none of his former dignity was left to him, except what he could retain by his present moderation. [16] And in this conspiracy, what union was ever so close as that between <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a> and <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a>, between <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a> and <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>? What combination was there ever between any men for the most virtuous purposes, so intimate as his connection with them for deeds of wickedness, lust and audacity? — what crime is there which <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> did not plot with <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a>? — what atrocity did <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a> ever commit without his assistance? while, in the meantime, <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> not only abstained from seeking the concealment of night and solitude in their company, but he had never the very slightest intercourse with them, either in conversation or in casual meetings. [17] The <a href=/people/11071 target=_blank>Allobroges</a>, those who gave us the truest information on the most important matters, accused <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a>, and so did the letters of many men, and many private witnesses. All that time no one ever accused <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>; no one ever mentioned his name. Lastly, after <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a> had been driven out or allowed to depart out of the city, <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a> sent him arms, trumpets, bugles, scythes, standards, legions. He who was left in the city, but expected out of it though checked by the punishment of <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, gave way at times to feelings of fear, but never to any right feelings or good sense. <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, on the other hand, was so quiet, that all that time he was at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>, where it is not supposed that there were any men who were implicated in or suspected of this crime; and the place itself is one not so well calculated to excite the feelings of men in distress, as to console them. </p>                        </div>

For <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a> came to me, and he was constantly coming to me, with many tears, as a suppliant, to beg me to defend him, and he used to remind me that he had been my school-fellow in my childhood, my friend in my youth, and my colleague in the quaestorship. He used to enumerate many services which I had done him, and some also which he had done me. By all which circumstances, O judges, I was so much swayed and influenced, that I banished from my recollection all the plots which he had laid against me myself; that I forgot that Caius <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> had been lately sent by him for the purpose of killing me in my own house, in the sight of my wife and children. And if he had formed these designs against me alone, such is my softness and lenity of disposition, that I should never have been able to resist his tears and entreaties; [19] but when the thoughts of my country, of your dangers, of this city, of all those shrines and temples which we see around us, of the infant children, and matrons, and virgins of the city occurred to me, and when those hostile and fatal torches destined for the entire conflagration of the whole city, when the arms which had been collected, when the slaughter and blood of the citizens, when the ashes of my country began to present themselves to my eyes, and to excite my feelings by the recollection, then I resisted him, then I resisted not only that enemy of his country, that parricide himself, but I withstood also his relations the <a href=/people/2425 target=_blank>Marcelli</a>, father and son, one of whom was regarded by me with the respect due to a parent, and the other with the affection which one feels towards a son. And I thought that I could not, without being guilty of the very greatest wickedness, defend in their companion the same crimes which I had chastised in the case of others, when I knew him to be guilty. [20] And, on the same principle, I could not endure to see Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> coming to me as a suppliant, or these same <a href=/people/2425 target=_blank>Marcelli</a> in tears at his danger nor could I resist the entreaties of Marcus <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messala</a>, whom you see in court, a most intimate friend of my own. For neither was his cause disagreeable to my natural disposition nor had the man or the facts anything in them at variance with my feelings of clemency his name had never been mentioned, there was no trace whatever of him in the conspiracy; no information had touched him, no suspicion had been breathed of him. I undertook his cause, O <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>; I undertook it, and I did so willingly, in order that, while good men had always, as I hope, thought me virtuous and firm, not even bad men might he able to call me cruel. </p>                        </div>

What is the meaning of my kingly power, O <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>? I suppose you mean the power I exerted in my consulship; in which I did not command at all, but on the contrary, I obeyed the conscript fathers, and all good men. In my discharge of that office, O judges, kingly power was not established by me, but put down. Will you say that then, when I had such absolute power and authority over all the military and civil affairs of the state, I was not a king, but that now, when I am only a private individual, I have the power of a king? Under what title? “Why, because,” says he, “those against whom you gave evidence were convicted, and the man whom you defend hopes that he shall be acquitted.” Here I make you this reply, as to what concerns my evidence: that if I gave false evidence, you also gave evidence against the same man; if my testimony was true, then I say, that persuading the judges to believe a true statement, which one has made on oath, is a very different thing from being a king. And of the hopes of my client, I only say, that Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> does not expect from me any exertion of my influence or interest, or, in short, anything except to defend him with good faith. [22] “But unless you,” says he, “had undertaken his cause, he would never have resisted me, but would have fled without saying a word in his defence.” Even if I were to grant to you that Quintus <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>, being a man of such wisdom as he is, and that all these men of high character, rely not on their own judgment but on mine; if I were to grant to you, what no one can believe, that these men would not have countenanced Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> if I had not done so too; still, which is the king, he whom men, though perfectly innocent, cannot resist, or he who does not abandon men in misfortune? But here too, though you had not the least occasion for it, you took a fancy to be witty, when you called me Tarquin, and <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a>, and the third foreign king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. I won't say any more about the word king; but I should like to know why you called me a foreigner. For, if I am such, then it is not so marvellous that I should be a king, — because, as you say yourself, foreigners have before now been kings at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, — as that a foreigner should be a consul at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. “This is what I mean,” says he, “that you come from a municipal town.” [23] I confess that I do, and I add, that I come from that municipal town from which salvation to this city and empire has more than once proceeded. But I should like exceedingly to know from you, how it is that those men who come from the municipal towns appear to you to be foreigners. For no one ever made that objection to that great man, Marcus <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> the elder, though he had many enemies, or to Titus <a href=/people/4127 target=_blank>Coruncanius</a>, or to Marcus <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a>, or even to that great hero of our own times, Caius <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, through many men envied him. In truth, I am exceedingly delighted that I am a man of such a character that, when you were anxious to find fault with me, you could still find nothing to reproach me with which did not apply also to the greater part of the citizens. </p>                        </div>

If you would know the truth, they do not all even wish to be so; nor do those of your own age think that you ought on that account to have precedence over them. [24] And if we seem to you to be foreigners, we whose name and honours have now become familiar topics of conversation and panegyric throughout the city and among all men, how greatly must those competitors of yours seem to be foreigners, who now, having been picked out of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, are contending with you for honour and for every dignity! And yet take care that you do not call one of these a foreigner, lest you should be overwhelmed by the votes of the foreigners. For if they once bring their activity and perseverance into action, believe me they will shake those arrogant expressions out of you, and they will frequently wake you from sleep, and will not endure to be surpassed by you in honours, unless they are also excelled by you in virtue. [25] And if, O judges, it is fit for me and you to be considered foreigners by the rest of the patricians, still nothing ought to be said about this blot by <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>. For he himself is on his mother's side, a citizen of a municipal town; a man of a most honourable and noble family, but still he comes from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/429136UAsc class=place long=13.5687 lat=42.8537>Asculum</a>.

So do not for the future call me a foreigner, lest you meet with a sterner refutation; and do not call me a king, lest you be laughed at. Unless, indeed, it appears to be the conduct of a king to live in such a manner as not to be slave not only to any man, but not even to any passion; to despise all capricious desires; to covet neither gold nor silver, nor anything else; to form one's opinions in the senate with freedom; to consider the real interests of the people, rather than their inclinations; to yield to no one, to oppose many men. If you think that this is the conduct of a king, then I confess that I am a king. If my power, if my sway, it lastly, any arrogant or haughty expression of mine moves your indignation, then you should rather allege that, than stoop to raise odium against me by a name, and to employ mere abuse and insult. </p>                        </div>

If I were to ask, that they would keep all honours, and commands, and provinces, and triumphs, and all the other insignia of eminent renown to themselves, and that they would allow me to enjoy the sight of the city which I had saved, and a tranquil and quiet mind? — What, however, if I do not ask this? what, if my former industry, my anxiety, my assistance, my labour, my vigilance is still at the service of my friends, and ready at the call of every one?

Concerning which deeds of mine, illustrious and immortal as they are, O judges, I can say thus much — that I, who have saved this city, and the lives of all the citizens, from the most extreme dangers, shall have gained quite reward enough, if no danger arises to myself out of the great service which I have done to all men. <br /> [28] In truth, I recollect in what state it is that I have done such great exploits, and in what city I am living.

Unless you think that they were only a few men, who were able to attempt or to hope that they might be able to destroy so vast an empire. I was able to take away their firebrands, to wrest their torches from their hands, as I did; but their wicked and impious inclinations I could neither cure nor eradicate. Therefore I am not ignorant in what danger I am living among such a multitude of wicked men, since I see that I have undertaken single-handed an eternal war against all wicked men. </p>                        </div>

[30] But why do I wonder if any wicked thing is said of me by wicked men, where Lucius <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a> himself, after having in the first place laid such a foundation of virtue as he did in his youth, after having proposed to himself the hope of the most honourable dignity in the state, and, in the second place, being the son of Lucius <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, a most intrepid consul a most virtuous senator, and at all times a most admirable citizen, is sometimes run away with by impetuosity of language? For when he had spoken in a low voice of the wickedness of Publius <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, and of the audacity of all the conspirators, so that only you, who approve of those things, could hear what he said, he spoke with a loud querulous voice of the execution of Publius <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> and of the prison; [31] in which there was, first of all, this absurdity, that when he wished to gain your approval of the inconsiderate things which he had said, but did not wish those men, who were standing around the tribunal, to hear them, he did not perceive that, while he was speaking so loudly, those men whose favour he was seeking to gain could not hear him, without your hearing him too, who did not approve of what he was saying; and, in the second place, it is a great defect in an orator not to see what each cause requires. For nothing is so inconsistent as for a man who is accusing another of conspiracy, to appear to lament the punishment and death of conspirators; which is not, indeed, strange to any one, when it is done by that tribune of the people who appears to be the only man left to bewail those conspirators; for it is difficult to be silent when you are really grieved. But, if you do anything of that sort, I do greatly marvel at you, not only because you are such a young man as you are, but because you do it in the very cause in which you wish to appear as a punisher of conspiracy.

[35] Do you not see now, how I deliver you from the danger of any sudden popularity among the wicked, and reconcile you to all good men? who love you, and cherish you, and who always will cherish you; nor, if perchance you for a while abandon me, will they on that account allow you to abandon them and the republic and your own dignity. <br />But now I return to the cause; and I call you, O judges, to hear witness to this; — that this necessity of speaking of myself was imposed on me by him. For if <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a> had been content with accusing <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, I too at the present time should have done nothing beyond defending him who had been accused; but when he, in his whole speech, inveighed against me, and when, in the very beginning, as I said, he sought to deprive my defence of all authority, even if my indignation had not compelled me to speak, still the necessity of doing justice to my cause would have demanded this speech from me. </p>                        </div>

They said that Lucius <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> had said that, among other men, <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a> was favourable to their designs. I ask, did <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> say that <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> was? Never. They say that they themselves inquired of <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> what <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>'s opinions were. Observe the diligence of the Gauls. They, knowing nothing of the life or character of the man, but only having heard that he and <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a> had met with one common disaster, asked whether his inclinations were the same? what then? Even if <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> had made answer that <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> was of the same opinion, and was favourable to their views, still it would not seem to me that that reply ought to be made matter of accusation against him. How so? Because, as it was his object to instigate the barbarians to war, it was no business of his to weaken their expectations, or to acquit those men of whom they did entertain some suspicions. [37] But yet he did not reply, that <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> was favourable to their designs. And, in truth, it would have been an absurdity, after he had named every one else of his own accord, to make no mention of <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> till he was reminded of him and asked about him. Unless you think this probable, that Lucius <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> had quite forgotten the name of Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>. Even if the high rank of the man, and his unfortunate condition, and the relics of his ancient dignity had not made him notorious, still the mention of <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a> must have recalled <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> to his recollection. In truth, it is my opinion that when <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> was enumerating the authority of the chief men of the conspiracy for the purpose of exciting the minds of the <a href=/people/11071 target=_blank>Allobroges</a> as he knew that the foreign nations are especially moved by an illustrious name he could not have named <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a> before <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, if he had been able to name <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> at all. [38] But no one can be induced to believe this, — that the Gauls, the moment that <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a> was named, should have thought, on account of the similarity of their misfortunes, that it was worth their while to make inquiries about <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, but that <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, if he really was implicated in this wickedness, should never have once recollected <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, even after he had named <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a>. However, what was the reply which <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> made about <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>? He said that he was not sure. “He does not acquit him,” says <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>. I have said before, that, even if he had accused him, when he was interrogated in this manner, his reply ought not to have been made matter of accusation against <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>. [39] But I think that, in judicial proceedings and examinations, the thing to be inquired is, not whether any one is exculpated, but whether any one is inculpated. And in truth, when <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> says that he does not know, is he seeking to exculpate <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, or proving clearly enough that he really does not know? He is unwilling to compromise him with the Gauls. Why so? That they may not mention him in their information? what? If he had supposed that there was any danger of their ever giving any information at all, would he have made that confession respecting himself? He did not know it. I suppose, O judges, <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> was the only person about whom <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> was kept in the dark. For he certainly was well informed about every one else; and it was thoroughly proved that a great deal of the conspiracy was hatched at his house. As he did not like to deny that <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> made one of the conspirators, his object being to give the Gauls as much hope as possible, and as he did not venture to assert what was absolutely false, he said that he did not know. But this is quite evident, that as he, who knew the truth about every one, said that he did not know about <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, the same weight is due to this denial of his as if he had said that be did know that he had nothing to do with the conspiracy. For when it is perfectly certain that a man is acquainted with all the conspirators, his ignorance of any one ought to be considered an acquittal of him. But I am not asking now whether <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> acquits <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>; this is quite sufficient for me, that there is not one word to implicate <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> in the whole information of the <a href=/people/11071 target=_blank>Allobroges</a>. </p>                        </div>

He says that I have made an entry in the public registers of a different statement from that which was really made. O ye immortal gods! (for I will give you what belongs to you; nor can I attribute so much to my own ability, as to think that I was able, in that most turbulent tempest which was afflicting the republic, to manage, of my own power, so many and such important affairs, — affairs arising so unexpectedly, and of such various characters,) it was you, in truth, who then inflamed my mind with the desire of saving my country; it was you who turned me from all other thoughts to the one idea of preserving the republic; it was you who, amid all that darkness of error and ignorance, held a bright light before my mind! [41] I saw this, O judges, that unless, while the recollection of the senate on the subject was still fresh, I bore evidence to the authority and to the particulars of this information by public records, hereafter some one, not <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, nor any one like <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, (for in that indeed I have been much deceived,) but some one who had lost his patrimony, some enemy of tranquillity, some foe to all good men, would say that the information given had been different; in order the more easily, when some gale of odium had been stirred up against all virtuous men, to be able, amid the misfortunes of the republic, to discover some harbour for his own broken vessel. Therefore, having introduced the informers into the Senate, I appointed senators to take down every statement made by the informers, every question that was asked, and every answer that was given. [42] And what men they were! Not only men of the greatest virtue and good faith, of which sort of men there are plenty in the senate, but men, also, who I knew from their memory, from their knowledge, from their habit and rapidity of writing, could most easily follow everything that was said. I selected Caius <a href=/people/3566 target=_blank>Cosconius</a>, who was praetor at the time; Marcus <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messala</a>, who was at the time standing for the praetorship; Publius <a href=/people/734 target=_blank>Nigidius</a>, and <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>.

As I knew that the information was by these means entered among the public documents, but yet that those records would be kept in the custody of private individuals, according to the customs of our ancestors, I did not conceal it; I did not keep it at my own house; but I caused it at once to be copied out by several clerks, and to be distributed everywhere, and published and made known to the Roman people. I distributed it all over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, I sent copies of it into every province; I wish no one to be ignorant of that information, by means of which safety was procured for all. [43] And I took this precaution, though at so disturbed a time, and when all opportunities of acting were so sudden and so brief at the suggestion of some divine providence, as I said before, and not of my own accord, or of my own wisdom; taking care, in the first instance, that no one should be able to recollect of the danger to the republic, or to any individual, only as much as he pleased; and in the second place, that no one should be able at any time to find fault with that information, or to accuse us of having given credit to it rashly; and lastly, that no one should ever put any questions to me, or seek to learn anything from my private journals, lest I might be accused of either forgetting or remembering too much, and lest any negligence of mine should be thought discreditable, or lest any eagerness on my part might seem cruel. <br /> [44] But still, O <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, I ask you, as your enemy was mentioned in the information, and as a full senate and the memory of all men as to so recent an affair was a witness of that fact; as my clerks would have communicated the information to you, my intimate friend and companion, if you had wished for it, even before they had taken a copy of it; when you saw that there were any incorrectnesses in it, why were you silent, why did you permit them? Why did you not make a complaint to me or to some friend of mine? or why did you not at least, since you are so well inclined to inveigh against your friends, expostulate passionately and earnestly with me? Do you, when your voice was never once heard at the time, when, though the information was read, and copied out, and published, you kept silence then, — do you, I say, now on a sudden dare to bring forward a statement of such importance? and to place yourself in such a position that before you can convict me of having tampered with the information, you must confess that you are convicted yourself of the grossest negligence, on your own information bid against yourself? </p>                        </div>

But if I had been forgetful of my own severity and of my own virtue, was I so mad, as, when letters are things which have been devised for the sake of posterity, in order to be a protection against forgetfulness, to think that the fresh recollection of the whole senate could be beaten down by my journal? [46] I have been bearing with you, O <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, for a long time. I have been bearing with you; and sometimes I, of my own accord, call back and check my inclination, when it has been provoked to chastise your speech. I make some allowance for your violent temper; I have some indulgence for your youth, I yield somewhat to our own friendship, I have some regard to your father. But unless you put some restraint upon yourself you will compel me to forget our friendship, in order to pay due regard to my own dignity. No one ever attempted to attach the slightest suspicion to me, that I did not defeat him; but I wish you to believe me in this; — those whom I think that I can defeat most easily, are not those whom I take the greatest pleasure in answering.

Do not think that that power has been entirely lost, because I show some consideration for; and indulgence towards you. In the first place, the excuses which I make to myself for your injurious conduct, your violent temper; your age, and our friendship, have much weight with me; and, in the next place, I do not yet consider you a person of sufficient power to make it worth my while to contend and argue with you.

And if you begin to consider whether it was more necessary for me to do this or for you to do that, you will perceive that you could with more credit fix a limit to your enmities than I could to my humanity. <br /> [49] But when the greatest honours of your family were at stake, that is to say, the consulship of your father that wise man your father was not angry with his most intimate friends for defending and praising <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>.

But since <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> himself even now hesitates about giving information against him, he, as you say, contents himself with filling up the outline of his son's information what then does he say about that night, when, according to the orders of <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a>, he came into the Scythemakers' street, to the house of Marcus Lecca, that night which followed the sixth of November; in my consulship? that night which of all the moments of the conspiracy was the most terrible and the most miserable. Then the day in which <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a> should leave the city, then the terms on which the rest should remain behind, then the arrangement and division of the whole city, with regard to the conflagration and the massacre, was settled. Then your father, O <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a>, as he afterwards confessed, begged for himself that especial employment of going the first in the morning to salute me as consul, in order that, having been admitted, according to my usual custom and to the privilege which his friendship with me gave him, he might slay me in my bed. </p>                        </div>

Was he at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>? No, he was very far away. Was he in those districts to which <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a> was betaking himself? He was still further from them. Was he in the Camertine, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=demonym long=13.5 lat=43>Picenian</a>, or Gallic district? lands which the disease, as it were, of that frenzy had infected most particularly. Nothing is further from the truth; for he was, as I have said already, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>. He was in that part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> which above all others was free from all suspicion of being implicated in that business. [54] What then does he state in his information, or what does he allege — I mean <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a>, or you who bring these messages from him? He says that gladiators were bought, under pretence of some games to be exhibited by <a href=/people/1629 target=_blank>Faustus</a>, for the purposes of slaughter and tumult. — Just so; — the gladiators are mentioned whom we know that he was bound to provide according to his father's will. “But he seized on a whole household of gladiators; and if he had left that alone, some other troop might have discharged the duty to which <a href=/people/1629 target=_blank>Faustus</a> was bound.” I wish this troop could satisfy not only the envy of parties unfavourable to him, but even the expectations of reasonable men. “He was in a desperate hurry, when the time for the exhibition was still far off.” As if in reality, the time for the exhibition was not drawing very near. This household of slaves was got without <a href=/people/1629 target=_blank>Faustus</a> having any idea of such a step; for he neither knew of it nor wished it. [55] But there are letters of <a href=/people/1629 target=_blank>Faustus</a>'s extant, in which he begs and prays Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> to buy gladiators, and to buy this very troop: and not only were such letters sent to Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, but they were sent also to Lucius <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, to Quintus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, and to Gains <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, by whose advice the whole business was managed. But <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> was appointed to manage the troop. If in the respect of the purchase of this household of gladiators no suspicion attaches to the circumstances, it certainly can make no difference that he was appointed to manage them afterwards. But still, he in reality only discharged the servile duty of providing them with arms; but he never did superintend the men themselves; that duty was always discharged by <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>, a freedman of <a href=/people/1629 target=_blank>Faustus</a>. </p>                        </div>

In the first place, O judges, <a href=/people/2545 target=_blank>Sittius</a> departed, in the consulship of Lucius <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> and Caius <a href=/people/2162 target=_blank>Figulus</a>, some time before this mad business of <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a>'s, and before there was any suspicion of this conspiracy. In the second place, he did not go there for the first time, but he had already been there several years before, for the same purpose that he went now. And he went not only with an object but with a necessary object having some important accounts to settle with the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=place long=-5 lat=35>Mauritania</a>. But then, after he was gone, as <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> managed his affairs as his agent he sold many of the most beautiful farms of Publius <a href=/people/2545 target=_blank>Sittius</a>, and by this means paid his debts; so that the motive which drove the rest to this wickedness, the desire, namely, of retaining their possessions, did not exist in the case of <a href=/people/2545 target=_blank>Sittius</a>, who had diminished his landed property to pay his debts. [57] But now, how incredible, how absurd is the idea that a man who wished to make a massacre at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and to burn down this city, should let his most intimate friend depart, should send him away into the most distant countries! Did he so in order the more easily to effect what he was endeavoring to do at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, if there were seditions in Spain? — “But these things were done independently, and had no connection with one another.” Is it possible, then, that he should have thought it desirable, when engaged in such important affairs, in such novel and dangerous, and seditious designs, to send away a man thoroughly attached to himself, his most intimate friend, one connected with himself by reciprocal good offices and by constant intercourse? It is not probable that he should send a way, when in difficulty, and in the midst of troubles of his own raising, the man whom he had always kept with him in times of prosperity and tranquillity. <br /> [58] But is <a href=/people/2545 target=_blank>Sittius</a> himself (for I must not desert the cause of my old friend and host) a man of such a character, or of such a family and such a school as to allow us to believe that he wished to make war on the republic? Can we believe that he, whose father when all our other neighbours and borderers revolted from us behaved with singular duty and loyalty to our republic, should think it possible himself to undertake a nefarious war against his country? A man whose debts we see were contracted not out of luxury but from a desire to increase his property which led him to involve himself in business and who, though he owed debts at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, had very large debts owing to him in the provinces and in the confederate kingdoms and when he was applying for them he would not allow his agents to be put in any difficulty by his absence but preferred having all his property sold and being stripped himself of a most beautiful patrimony, to allowing any delay to take place in satisfying his creditors. And of men of that sort I never, O judges, had any fear when I was in the middle of that tempest which afflicted the republic. The sort of men who were formidable and terrible were those who clung to their property with such affection that you would say it was easier to tear their limbs from them than their lands but <a href=/people/2545 target=_blank>Sittius</a> never thought that there was such a relationship between him and his estates, and therefore he cleared himself, not only from all suspicion of such wickedness as theirs, but even from being talked about not by arms, but at the expense of his patrimony. </p>                        </div>

Do the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407145PPom class=place long=14.4848 lat=40.7493>Pompeii</a> appear to have joined the conspiracy? Who has ever said so? or when was there the slightest suspicion of this fact? “He separated then,” says he, “from the settlers, in order that when he had excited dissensions and divisions within, he might be able to have the town and nation of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407145PPom class=place long=14.4848 lat=40.7493>Pompeii</a> in his power.” In the first place, every circumstance of the dissension between the natives of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407145PPom class=place long=14.4848 lat=40.7493>Pompeii</a> and the settlers was referred to the patrons of the town, being a matter of long standing, and having been going on many years. In the second place, the matter was investigated by the patrons in such a way, that <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> did not in any particular disagree with the opinions of the others. And lastly, the settlers themselves understand that the natives of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407145PPom class=place long=14.4848 lat=40.7493>Pompeii</a> were not more denuded by <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> than they themselves were. [61] And this, O judges, you may ascertain from the number of settlers, most honourable men, here present; who are here now, and are anxious and above all things desirous that the man, the patron, the defender, the guardian of that colony, (if they have not been able to see him in the safe enjoyment of every sort of good fortune and every honour,) may at all events, in the present misfortune by which he is attacked, be defended and preserved by your means. The natives of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407145PPom class=place long=14.4848 lat=40.7493>Pompeii</a> are here also with equal eagerness, who are accused as well as he is by the prosecutors; men whose differences with the settlers about walks and about votes have not gone to such lengths as to make them differ also about their common safety. [62] And even this virtue of Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> appears to me to be one which ought not to be passed over in silence; — that though that colony was originally settled by him, and though the fortune of the Roman people has separated the interests of the settlers from the fortunes of the native citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407145PPom class=place long=14.4848 lat=40.7493>Pompeii</a>, he is still so popular among, and so much beloved by both parties, that he seems not so much to have dispossessed the one party of their lands as to have settled both of them in that country. </p>                        </div>

[63] And <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> is accused by Lucius <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>, in that business in which both of them deserve praise. In the first place <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>, for having proposed a law in which he appeared to wish to rescind an unjust decision; and <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, who reproved him, and chose to abide by the decision. For the constitution of the republic derives its principal consistency from formal legal decisions. Nor do I think that any one ought to yield so much to his love for his brother as to think only of the welfare of his own relations, and to neglect the common safety of all. He did not touch the decision already given, but he took away the punishment for bribery which had been lately established by recent laws. And, therefore, by this motion he was seeking, not to rescind a decision, but to correct a defect in the law. When a man is complaining of a penalty, it is not the decision with which he is finding fault but the law. For the conviction is the act of judges, and that is let stand; the penalty is the act of the law, and that may be lightened. [64] Do not therefore, alienate from your cause the inclinations of those orders of men which preside over the courts of justice with the greatest authority and dignity. No one, has attempted to annul the decision which has been given; nothing of that sort has been proposed. What <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a> always thought while grieved at the calamity which had befallen his brother, was, that the power of the judges ought to be preserved unimpaired, but that the severity of the law required to be mitigated. </p>                        </div>

[65] The law was proposed only a few days; it was never begun to be put in train to be carried; it was laid on the table in the senate. On the first of January, when we had summoned the senate to meet in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, nothing took precedence of it; and Quintus <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> the praetor said, that what he was saying was by the command of <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>; that <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> did not wish such a motion to be brought forward respecting his case. From that time forward <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a> applied himself to many measures for the advantage of the republic; he declared that he by his intercession would stop the agrarian law, which was in every part of it denounced and defeated by me. He resisted infamous attempts at corruption; he never threw any obstacles in the way of the authority of the senate. He behaved himself in his tribuneship in such a manner, that, laying aside all regard for his own domestic concerns, he thought of nothing for the future but the welfare of the republic. [66] And even in regard to this very motion, who was there of us who had any fears of <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> or <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a> attempting to carry any point by violence? Did not all the alarm that existed at that time, all the fear and expectation of sedition, arise from the villainy of <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a>? It was his expressions and his threats which were bruited abroad; it was the sight of him, the multitudes that thronged to him, the crowd that escorted him, and the bands of his abandoned followers, that caused all the fear of sedition which agitated us. Therefore, Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, as this most odious man was then his comrade and partner, not only in honour but also in misfortune, was compelled to lose his own good fortune, and to remain under a cloud without any remedy or alleviation. </p>                        </div>

Whose ears were ever unwilling to believe in this attempt on the part of a man who had spent his whole life, from his boyhood upwards, not only in intemperance and debauchery, but who had devoted all his energies and all his zeal to every sort of enormity, and lust, and bloodshed? Who marveled that that man died fighting against his country, whom all men had always thought born for civil war?

We know that he had been accustomed to drive men from their estates, to murder his neighbors, to plunder the temples of the allies, to disturb the courts of justice by violence and arms; in prosperity to despise every body, in adversity to fight against all good men; never to regard the interests of the republic, and not to yield even to fortune herself.

Has there ever been any act or exploit of his which has seemed to any one, I will not say audacious, but even rather inconsiderate? Do I say any act? Has any word ever fallen from his lips by which any one could be offended? Yes, even in that terrible and disorderly victory of Lucius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, who was found more gentle or more merciful than Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>? How many men's wives did he not save by begging them of Lucius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>! How many men are there of the highest rank and of the greatest accomplishments, both of our order and of the equestrian body, for whose safety he laid himself under obligations to Lucius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>! whom I might name, for they have no objection; indeed they are here to countenance him now, with the most grateful feelings towards him. But because that service is a greater one than one citizen ought to be able to do to another, I entreat of you to impute to the times the fact of his having such power, but to give him himself the credit due to his having exerted it in such a manner. [73] Why need I speak of the other virtues of his life? of his dignity? of his liberality? of his moderation in his own private affairs? of his splendour on public occasions? For, though in these points he has been crippled by fortune, yet the good foundations laid by nature are visible. What a house was his! what crowds frequented it daily! How great was the dignity of his behaviour to his friends! How great was their attachment to him! What a multitude of friends had he of every order of the people! These things which had been built up by long time and much labour, one single hour deprived him of; Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, O judges, received a terrible and a mortal wound; but still it was an injury of such a sort as his way of life and his natural disposition might seem liable to be exposed to. He was judged to have too great a desire for honour and dignity. If no one else was supposed to have such desires in standing for the consulship, then he was judged to be more covetous than the rest. But if this desire for the consulship has existed in some other men also, then, perhaps, fortune was a little more unfavourable to him than to others. [74] But, after this misfortune, who ever saw Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> otherwise than grieving, dejected, and out of spirits? Who ever suspected that he was avoiding the sight of men and the light of day, out of hatred, and not rather out of shame? For though he had many temptations to frequent this city and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a>, by reason of the great attachment of his friends to him, the only consolation which remained to him in his misfortunes, still he kept out of your sight; and though he might have remained here as far as the law went he almost condemned himself to banishment. </p>                        </div>

Look at the man himself; behold his countenance. Compare the accusation with his course of life. Compare his life, which has been laid open before you from his birth up to this day, with this accusation. [75] I say nothing of the republic, to which <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> has always been most devoted. Did he wish these friends of his, being such men as they are, so attached to him, by whom his prosperity had been formerly adorned, by whom his adversity is now comforted and relieved, to perish miserably, in order that he himself might be at liberty to pass a most miserable and infamous existence in company with <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, and <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a>, and <a href=/people/965 target=_blank>Cethegus</a>, with no other prospect for the future but a disgraceful death? That suspicion is not consistent, — it is, I say, utterly at variance with such habits, with such modesty, with such a life as his, with the man himself. That sprang up, a perfectly unexampled sort of barbarity; it was an incredible and amazing insanity. The foulness of that unheard of wickedness broke out on a sudden, taking its rise from the countless vices of profligate men accumulated ever since their youth. <br /> [76] Think not, O judges, that that violence and that attempt was the work of human beings; for no nation ever was so barbarous or so savage, as to have (I will not say so many, but even) one implacable enemy to his country. They were some savage and ferocious beasts, born of monsters, and clothed in human form. Look again and again, O judges; for there is nothing too violent to be said in such a cause as this. Look deeply and thoroughly into the minds of <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a>, <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a>, <a href=/people/965 target=_blank>Cethegus</a>, <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, and the rest. What lusts you will find in these men, what crimes, what baseness, what audacity, what incredible insanity, what marks of wickedness, what traces of parricide, what heaps of enormous guilt! Out of the great diseases of the republic, diseases of long standing, which had been given over as hopeless, suddenly that violence broke out in such a way, that when it was put down and got rid of, the state might again be able to become convalescent and to be cured; for there is no one who thinks that if those pests remained in the republic, the Constitution could continue to exist any longer. Therefore they were some Furies who urged them on, not to complete their wickedness, but to atone to the republic for their guilt by their punishment. </p>                        </div>

Will you transfer him from this body of citizens, and from the familiar dignity in which he lives with them, to the party of impious men, to that crew and company of parricides? What then will become of that most impregnable defence of modesty? in what respect will the purity of our past lives be of any use to us? For what time is the reward of the character which a man has gained to be reserved, if it is to desert him at his utmost need, and when he is engaged in a contest in which all his fortunes are at stake — if it is not to stand by him and help him at such a crisis as this? [78] Our prosecutor threatens us with the examinations and torture of our slaves; and though we do not suspect that any danger can arise to us from them, yet pain reigns in those tortures; much depends on the nature of every one's mind, and the fortitude of a person's body. The inquisitor manages everything; caprice regulates much, hope corrupts them, fear disables them, so that, in the straits in which they are placed, there is but little room left for truth. <br />Is the life of Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, then, to be put to the torture? is it to be examined to see what lust is concealed beneath it? whether any crime is lurking under it, or any cruelty, or any audacity? There will be no mistake in our cause, O judges, no obscurity, if the voice of his whole life, which ought to be of the very greatest weight, is listened to by you. [79] In this cause we fear no witness; we feel sure that no one knows, or has ever seen, or has ever heard anything against us. But still, if the consideration of the fortune of Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> has no effect on you, O judges, let a regard for your own fortune weigh with you. For this is of the greatest importance to you who have lived in the greatest elegance and safety, that the causes of honourable men should not be judged of according to the caprice, or enmity, or worthlessness of the witnesses; but that in important investigations and sudden dangers, the life of every man should be the most credible witness. And do not you, O judges, abandon and expose it, stripped of its arms, and defenceless, to envy and suspicion. Fortify the common citadel of all good men, block up the ways of escape resorted to by the wicked. Let that witness be of the greatest weight in procuring either safety or punishment for a man, which is the only one that, from its own intrinsic nature, can with ease be thoroughly examined, and which cannot be suddenly altered and remodelled. </p>                        </div>

Shall this authority, (for I must continually speak of that though I will speak of it with timidity and moderation,) — shall, I say, this authority of mine, when I have kept aloof from the cause of every one else accused of this conspiracy, and have defended <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> alone, be of no service to my client? This is perhaps a bold thing to say, O judges; a bold thing, if we are asking for anything; a bold thing, if, when every one else is silent about us, we will not be silent ourselves. But if we are attacked, if we are accused, if we are sought to be rendered unpopular, then surely, O judges, you will allow us to retain our liberty, even if we cannot quite retain all our dignity. [81] All the men of consular rank are accused at one swoop; so that the name of the most honourable office in the state appears now to carry with it more unpopularity than dignity. “They stood by <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a>,” says he, “and praised him.” At that time there was no conspiracy known of or discovered. They were defending a friend. They were giving their suppliant the countenance of their presence. They did not think the moment of his most imminent danger a fit time to reproach him with the infamy of his life. Moreover, even your own father, O <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, when consul, was the advocate of <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a> when he was prosecuted on a charge of extortion: he knew he was a bad man, but he was a suppliant; perhaps he was an audacious man, but he had once been his friend. And, as he stood by him after information of that first conspiracy had been laid before him, he showed that he had heard something about him, but that he had not believed it. [82] “But he did not countenance him by his presence at the other trial, when the rest did.” If he himself had afterwards learnt something, of which he had been ignorant when consul, still we must pardon those men who had heard nothing since that time. But if the first accusation had weight, it ought not to have had more weight when it was old than when it was fresh. But if your parent, even when he was not without suspicion of danger to himself, was still induced by pity to do honour to the defence of a most worthless man by his curule chair, by his own private dignity, and by that of his office as consul, then what reason is there for reproaching the men of consular rank who gave <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a> the countenance of their presence? “But the same men did not countenance those who were tried for their accession to this conspiracy before <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>.” Certainly not; they resolved that no aid, no assistance, no support ought to be given by them to men implicated in such wickedness. And that I may speak for a moment of their constancy and attachment to the republic, whose silent virtue and loyalty bears witness in behalf of every one of them, and needs no ornaments of language from any one, — can any one say that any time there were men of consular rank more virtuous, more fearless, or more firm, than those who lived in these critical and perilous times, in which the republic was nearly overwhelmed? Who of them did not, with the greatest openness, and bravery, and earnestness, give his whole thoughts to the common safety? Nor need I confine what I say to the men of consular rank. For this credit is due to all those accomplished men who have been praetors, and indeed to the whole senate in common; so that it is plain that never, in the memory of man, was there more virtue in that order, greater attachment to the republic, or more consummate wisdom, But because the men of consular rank were especially mentioned, I thought I ought to say thus much in their behalf; and that that would be enough, as the recollection of all men would join me in bearing witness, that there was not one man of that rank who did not labour with all his virtue, and energy, and influence, to preserve the republic. </p>                        </div>

If, O judges, the republic itself, which has been preserved by my labours and dangers, did not by its dignity recall me to wisdom and consistency, still it is an instinct implanted by nature, to hate for ever the man whom you have once feared, with whom you have contended for life and fortune, and from whose plots you have escaped. But when my chief honours and the great glory of all my exploits are at stake; when, as often as any one is convicted of any participation in this wickedness, the recollection of the safety of the city having been secured by me is renewed, shall I be so mad as to allow those things which I did in behalf of the common safety to appear now to have been done by me more by chance and by good fortune than by virtue and wisdom? [84] “What, then, do you mean? Do you,” some one will say, perhaps, “claim that a man shall be judged innocent, just because you have defended him?” But I, O judges, not only claim nothing for myself to which any one can object, but I even give up and abandon pretensions which are granted and allowed me by every one. I am not living in such a republic — I have not exposed my life to all sorts of dangers for the sake of my country at such a time, — they whom I have defeated are not so utterly extinct, — nor are those whom I have preserved so grateful, that I should think it safe to attempt to assume more than all my enemies and enviers may endure. [85] It would appear an offensive thing for him who investigated the conspiracy, who laid it open, who crushed it, whom the senate thanked in unprecedented language, to whom the senate decreed a supplication, which they had never decreed to any one before for civil services, to say in a court of justice, “I would not have defended him if he had been a conspirator.” I do not say that, because it might be offensive; I say this, which in these trials relating to the conspiracy I may claim a right to say, speaking not with authority but with modesty, “I who investigated and chastised that conspiracy would certainly not defend <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, if I thought that he had been a conspirator.” I, O judges, say this, which I said at the beginning, that when I was making a thorough inquiry into those great dangers which were threatening everybody, when I was hearing many thing; not believing everything, but guarding against everything, not one word was said to me by any one who gave information, nor did any one hint any suspicion, nor was there the slightest mention in any one's letters, of Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>. </p>                        </div>

I, when consul, found out nothing about this man, I suspected nothing, I heard of nothing. [87] Therefore I, the same person who have seemed to be vehement against some men, inexorable towards the rest of the conspirators, (I paid my country what I owed seemed to be vehement against some men, inexorable towards I heard of nothing. Therefore I, the same person who have seemed to be vehement against some men, inexorable towards the rest of the conspirators, (I paid my country what I owed her; what I am now doing is due to my own invariable habits and natural disposition,) am as merciful, O judges, as you yourselves. I am as gentle as the most soft-hearted among you. As far as I was vehement in union with you, I did nothing except what I was compelled to do: I came to the assistance of the republic when in great danger; I raised my sinking country; influenced by pity for the whole body of citizens, we were then as severe as was necessary. The safety of all men would have been lost for ever in one night, if that severity had not been exercised; but as I was led on to the punishment of wicked men by my attachment to the republic, so now I am led to secure the safety of the innocent by my own inclination. <br /> [88] I see, O judges, that in this Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> there is nothing worthy of hatred, and many circumstances deserving our pity. For he does not now, O judges, flee to you as a suppliant for the sake of warding off calamity from himself, but to prevent his whole family and name from being branded with the stigma of nefarious baseness. For as for himself, even if he be acquitted by your decision, what honours has he, what comfort has he for the rest of his life, in which he can find delight or enjoyment? His house, I suppose, will be adorned; the images of his ancestors will be displayed; he himself will resume his ornaments and his usual dress. All these things, O judges, are lost to him; all the insignia and ornaments of his family, and his name, and his honour, were lost by the calamity of that one decision. But he is anxious not to be called the destroyer, the betrayer, the enemy of his country; he is fearful of leaving such disgrace to a family of such renown; he is anxious that this unhappy child may not be called the son of a conspirator, a criminal and a traitor. He fears for this boy, who is much dearer to him than his own life, anxious, though he cannot leave him the undiminished inheritance of his honours, at all events not to leave him the undying recollection of his infamy. [89] This little child entreats you, O judges, to allow him occasionally to congratulate his father, if not with his fortunes unimpaired, at least to congratulate him in his affliction. The roads to the courts of justice and to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a> are better known to that unhappy boy, than the roads to his playground or to his school. I am contending now, O judges, not for the life of Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, but for his burial. His life was taken from him at the former trial; we are now striving to prevent his body from being cast out.

Now, stripped of all his dignity, he does not seek to recover what has been taken away from him; but he does entreat you, O judge; not to take from him the little which fortune has left him in his disasters, — namely, the permission to bewail his calamities in company with his parent, with his children, with his brother; and with his friends.

But now that, together with his honour, everything else has been taken from him, — now that he is desolate, crushed by this miserable and grievous fortune, what is there which you can wish for more? Do you wish to deprive him of the enjoyment of the light of day, full as it is to him of tears and grief, in which he now lives amid the greatest grief and torment? He would gladly give it up, if you would release him from the foul imputation of this most odious crime. Do you seek to banish him as an enemy, when, if you were really hard-hearted, you would derive greater enjoyment from seeing his miseries than from hearing of them? [91] Oh, wretched and unhappy was that day on which Publius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> was declared consul by all the centuries! O how false were the hopes! how fleeting the good fortune! how blind the desire! how unreasonable the congratulations! How soon was all that scene changed from joy and pleasure to mourning and tears, when he, who but a short time before had been consul elect, had on a sudden no trace left of his previous dignity. For what evil was there which seemed then to be wanting to him when he was thus stripped of honour, and fame, and fortune? or what room could there be left for any new calamity? The same fortune continues to pursue him which followed him from the first; she finds a new source of grief for him; she will not allow an unfortunate man to perish when he has been afflicted in only one way, and by only one disaster. </p>                        </div>
