So being compelled he gave over the cause, and the judges under <a href=/people/654 target=_blank>Phalaris</a> nulled the proceedings; which the young man taking ill, said he was wronged, and discovered his resentment thereof to his friend, praying him to joyn with him in a plot against the tyrant, intending also to ingage some other young men, whom he knew proper and ready for such an attempt. <a href=/people/3154 target=_blank>Chariton</a> seeing him inraged and inflamed with fury, and knowing that none of the citizens would joyn in the design through fear of the tyrant, said that he also had formerly the same intention, and should ever be ready above all things to free his country from slavery; but it was dangerous to communicate such things to many persons: wherefore he intreated <a href=/people/3495 target=_blank>Melanippus</a> to consider it more deliberately, and to permit him to find out an opportunity proper for the attempt. The young man yielded. <a href=/people/3154 target=_blank>Chariton</a> thereupon undertook the whole business himself, not willing to engage his friend in it; that if he were taken and discovered, he alone might bear the punishment, and his friend not share in the danger. He provided himself of a falchion to assault the tyrant when he should see a fit occasion. This could not be carried so privately, but that he was apprehended by the guard, watchful of such things. Being carried to prison, and tortured to make discovery of his complices, he couragiously endured the torment. But this continuing a long time, <a href=/people/3495 target=_blank>Melanippus</a> went to <a href=/people/654 target=_blank>Phalaris</a>, and confessed that he was not only a conspirator, but author of the treason. The King demanding the cause that moved him to it, he declared the whole business from the beginning; how he was obstructed in his suit, and that this was it which provoked him. The tyrant wondering hereat set them both at liberty; but commanded them immediately to depart, not only out of all cities belonging to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373136PAkr class=ethnic long=13.5855 lat=37.2906>Agrigentines</a>, but quite out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>.

Wherefore they began, by making trial in less things, to sound how the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> would entertain a charge against his life: for to have accused him upon the very first, he conceived unsafe, as well as for the reason already mentioned, as lest the friends and followers of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> should divert the anger of the judges upon them, for falsly accusing a person so far from being guilty of any wrong to the state, that he was the only ornament of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. What then do they contrive? They suborn <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> a comic poet, whose only business was to raise mirth, to bring <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> upon the stage, taxing him with crimes which most men knew him free from impertinent discourse, making an ill cause by argument seem good, introducing new and strange deities, whilst himself believed and reverenced none: hereby to insinuate an ill opinion of him even into those who most frequented him. <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> taking this theme, interweaves it with much abusive mirth and pleasant verses; taking for his subject the best man of the Grecians. The argument of his play was not against <a href=/people/285 target=_blank>Cleon</a>; he did not abuse the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a>, or <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a> himself; but a person dear to all the Gods, especially to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>. At first (by reason of the novelty of the thing, the unusual personating of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> upon the stage) the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, who expected nothing less, were struck with wonder: Then (being naturally envious, apt to detract from the best persons, not only such as bore office in the commonwealth, but any that were eminent for learning or virtue) they begun to be taken with the CLOUDS,[so was the play named] and cried up the poet with more applause then ever any before, giving him with many shouts the victory, and sending word to the judges to set the name of <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in the highest place. <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> came seldom to the theatre, unless when <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> the Tragic poet contested with any new tragedian, then he used to go: And when <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> contended in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Piraeus</a>, he went thither also, for he loved the man as well for his wisdom, as the sweetness of his verse. Sometimes <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a> son of <a href=/people/545 target=_blank>Clinias</a> and <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a> son of <a href=/people/2503 target=_blank>Callaeschrus</a> would invite him to a comedy, and in a manner compell him: for he was so far from esteeming, that he did greatly condemn those persons that were abusive and scurrilous in their language, (being himself a temperate, just, good and discreet person) which hugely troubled the comedians. And this was the ground (as well as other things suggested by Antyus and <a href=/people/5113 target=_blank>Melitus</a>) of <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> his comedy; who, it is likely too, got a great sum of money by it, they being eager in prosecution of their design, and he prepared by want and malice to receive their impression: But this he best knows. In fine, the play got extraordinary credit, that of <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Cratinus</a> being verified, <br />The theatre was then <br />filled with malicious men. <br />It being at that time the feast of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, a multitude of Grecians went to see the play. <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> being personated on the stage, and often named, (nor was it much the players should represent him, for the potters frequently did it upon their stone jugs) the strangers that were present (not knowing whom the comedy abused) raised a hum and whisper, every one asking who that <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> was. Which he observing, (for he came not thither by chance, but because he knew himself should be abused in the play, had chosen the most conspicuous seat in the theatre) to put the strangers out of doubt, he rose up, and all the while the play lasted continued in that posture. So much did <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> despise the comedy and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> themselves. </p>                        </div>

It is a place situated betwixt <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398227LOss class=place long=22.6869 lat=39.7969>Ossa</a>. These are mountains of extraordinary height, and disjoyned as it were by providence. They include a plain whose length extends to forty stadia; its breadth in some places is a plethrum, in others somewhat more. Through the middle runs the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399227WPen class=place long=22.7094 lat=39.9298>Peneus</a>, into which other rivers flow, and by communicating their water make <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399227WPen class=place long=22.7094 lat=39.9298>Peneus</a> great. It affords various places of delight of all kinds, not wrought by the hand of man, but spontaneous works of nature, which contributed much to the beauty and glory of the place from its first beginning. For ivy full of down abounds and flourisheth there, which like generous vines creepeth up the high trees and groweth with them. There is also plenty of smallage, which climbing up the hill shadoweth the rock, so that it lies hid under it, nothing being seen but the green herb, which yields a pleasant entertainment to the eye. In this plain there are divers groves and large cupbords, which in the summer afford grateful shelter to travellers and refreshment. It is full of little brooks and springs of water, cool and pleasant to the tast. These waters, they say, benefit such as wash in them, and conduce much to health. Birds are dispersed about every-where, especially the musical, which yield extraordinary pleasure to the ear, and by continual warbling invite and delight the very passenger. On each side of the river are those pleasantnesses which I mentioned before, and places fit for repose and diversion. Through the middle of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399227LTem class=place long=22.576 lat=39.877>Tempe</a> runneth the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399227WPen class=place long=22.7094 lat=39.9298>Peneus</a> gently and smoothly like oil. This is much shaded by the thick branches of the adjoining trees, which for the greatest part of the day keep off the sun's beams, and afford to those that sail a cool passage. All the neighbouring people meet with one another there, and offer sacrifice, converse, and feast. Whence there being many that sacrifice and perform divine rites continually, it happeneth that such as travel thither either on foot or by water perceive very sweet odours. This unintermitted worship of the gods makes the place sacred. Here the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> say that <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> <a href=/people/4284 target=_blank>Pythius</a>, having slain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pytho</a> with his arrows at that time possessed of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> when the goddess <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> held the oracles, was by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>'s command purified; and that then the son of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Latona</a> crowned with this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399227LTem class=demonym long=22.576 lat=39.877>Tempian</a> laurel, and bearing a branch thereof in his hand, came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> and took possession of the oracle. There is also an altar in that place where he was crowned, and took away the branch. Whereupon even to this time the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225PDel class=ethnic long=22.5056 lat=38.4806>Delphians</a> every ninth year send youths of noble birth with an Architheorus, who is one of their own. These coming to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399227LTem class=place long=22.576 lat=39.877>Tempe</a> sacrifice magnificently, and having made garlands of that laurel which the god then so loved as to crown himself with it, depart. They pass that way which is called <a href=/people/1757 target=_blank>Pythias</a>, and goeth through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413216UPel class=place long=21.6107 lat=41.3133>Pelagonia</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388223LOit class=place long=22.25 lat=38.801>Oeta</a>, and the countries of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404229PAin class=ethnic long=22.8341 lat=40.4754>Aenians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388224RMal class=ethnic long=22.4 lat=38.8>Melians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor class=ethnic long=22.4 lat=38.7>Dorians</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384222ROzo class=ethnic long=22.2 lat=38.4>Hesperian Locrians</a>. They carry these youths thither with no less respect and reverence, then those who with sacred presents from the <a href=/people/801 target=_blank>Hyperboreans</a> pay homage to the same God.

This <a href=/people/344 target=_blank>Silenus</a> was son of a <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymph</a>, inferior by nature to the Gods only, superior to men and <a href=/people/257 target=_blank>Death</a>. Amongst other things, <a href=/people/344 target=_blank>Silenus</a> told <a href=/people/410 target=_blank>Midas</a> that Europe, Asia and Africa were Islands surrounded by the Ocean: That there was but one Continent only, which was beyond this world, and that as to magnitude it was infinite: That in it were bred, besides other very great creatures, men twice as big as those here, and they lived double our age: That many great cities are there, and peculiar manners of life; and that they have laws wholly different from those amongst us: That there are two cities far greater then the rest, nothing to like each other; one named Machimus, warlike, the other <a href=/people/7679 target=_blank>Eusebes</a>, Pious: That the Pious people live in peace, abounding in wealth, and reap the fruits of the <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> without ploughs or <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, having no need of tillage or sowing. They live, as he said, free from sickness, and die laughing, and with great pleasure: They are so exactly just, that the Gods many times vouchsafe to converse with them. The inhabitants of the city Machimus are very warlike, continually armed and fighting: They subdue their neighbours, and this one city predominates over many. The inhabitants are not fewer then two hundred myriads: they die sometimes of sickness, but this happens very rarely, for most commonly they are killed in the wars by stones or wood, for they are invulnerable by steel. They have vast plenty of gold and silver, insomuch that gold is of less value with them then iron with us. He said that they once designed a voyage to these our Islands, and sailed upon the Ocean, being in number a thousand myriads of men, till they came to the <a href=/people/801 target=_blank>Hyperboreans</a>; but understanding that they were the happiest men amongst us, they contemned us as persons that led a mean inglorious life, and therefore thought it not worth their going farther. He added what is yet more wonderful, that there are men living amongst them called Meropes, who inhabit many great cities; and that at the farthest end of their country there is a place named Anostus, (from whence there is no return) which resembles a Gulf; it is neither very light nor very dark, the air being dusky intermingled with a kind of red: That there are two rivers in this place, one of pleasure, the other of grief; and that along each river grow trees of the bigness of a plane-tree. Those which grow up by the river of grief bear fruit of this nature; If any one eat of them, he shall spend all the rest of his life in tears and grief, and so die. The other trees which grow by the river of pleasure produce fruit of a contrary nature, for who tasts thereof shall be eased from all his former desires: If he loved any thing, he shall quite forget it; and in a short time shall become younger, and live over again his former years: he shall cast off old age, and return to the prime of his strength, becoming first a young man, then a child, lastly, an infant, and so die. This, if any man think the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=demonym long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chian</a> worthy credit, he may believe.

She was bred up in poverty, but modestly and virtuously. She had many times a dream which foretold her that she should be married to an excellent person. Whilest she was yet young, she chanced to have a swelling under her chin, loathsome to sight, whereat both the father and the maid were much afflicted. Her father brought her to a physician: he offered to undertake the cure for three staters; the other said he had not the money. The physician replied, he had then no physick for him. Hereupon <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a> departed weeping; and holding a looking-glass on her knee, beheld her face in it, which much increased her grief. Going to rest without supping, by the reason of the trouble she was in, she had an opportune dream; a dove seemed to appear to her as she slept, which being changed to a woman, said, Be of good courage, and big a long farewell to physicians and their medicines: Take of the dried rose of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> Garlands, which being pounded apply to the swelling. After the <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Maid</a> had understood and made trial of this, the tumor was wholly assuaged; and <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a> recovering her beauty by means of the most beautiful goddess, did once again appear the fairest amongst her virgin-companions, enriched with <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a> far above any of the rest. Of hair yellow, locks a little curling, she had great eyes, somewhat hawk-nosed, ears short, skin delicate, complexion like roses; whence the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=ethnic long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocians</a>, whilest she was yet a child, called her <a href=/people/7977 target=_blank>Milto</a>. Her lips were red, teeth whiter then snow, small insteps, such as of those women whom <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> calls καλλισφύρους. Her voice was sweet and smooth, that whosoever heard her might justly say he heard the voice of a <a href=/people/605 target=_blank>Siren</a>. She was averse from womanish curiosity in dressing: Such things are to be supplied by wealth. She being poor, and bred up under a poor father, used nothing superfluous or extravagant to advantage for her <a href=/people/1588 target=_blank>Beauty</a>. On a time <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a> came to <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, son of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> and <a href=/people/898 target=_blank>Parysatis</a>, brother of <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a>, not willingly nor with the consent of her father, but by compulsion, as it often happens upon the taking of cities, or the violence of tyrants and their officers. One of the officers of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> brought her with other virgins to <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, who immediately preferred her before all his concubines, for simplicity of behaviour, and modesty; whereto also contributed her beauty without artifice, and her extraordinary discretion, which was such, that <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> many times asked her advice in affairs, which he never repented to have followed. When <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a> came first to <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, it happened that he was newly risen from supper, and was going to drink after the Persian manner: for after they have done eating, they betake themselves to wine, and fall to their cups freely, encountring drink as an adversary. Whilest they were in the midst of their drinking, four Grecian virgins were brought to <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, amongst whom was <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=person long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocian</a>. They were finely attired; three of them had their heads neatly drest by their own women which came along with them, and had painted their faces. They had been also instructed by their governesses how to behave themselves towards <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, to gain his favour; not to turn away when he came to them, not to be coy when he touched them, to permit him to kiss them, and many other amatory instructions practised by women who exposed their beauty to sale. Each contended to outvie the other in handsomeness. only <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a> would not endure to be clothed with a rich robe, nor to put on a various-coloured vest, nor to be washed; but calling upon the Grecian and Eleutherian Gods, she cried out upon her father's name, execrating herself to her father. She thought the robe which she should put on was a manifest sign of bondage. At last being compelled with blows she put it on, and was necessitated to behave herself with greater liberty then beseemed a virgin. When they came to <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, the rest smiled, and expressed chearfulness in their looks. But <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a> looking on the ground, her eyes full of tears, did every way express an extraordinary bashfulness. When he commanded them to sit down by him, the rest instantly obeyed; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=demonym long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocian</a> refused, until the officer caused her to sit down by force. When <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> looked upon or touched their eyes, cheeks and fingers, the rest freely permitted him; but she would not suffer it: For if <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> did but offer to touch her, she cried out, saying, he should not go unpunished for such actions. <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> was herewith extremely pleased; and when upon his offering to touch her breast, she rose up, and would have run away, <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> much taken with her native ingenuity, which was not like the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, turning to him that bought [sic] them, This Maid only, saith he, of those which you have brought me is free and pure; the rest are adulterate in face, but much more in behaviour. Hereupon <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> loved her above all the women he ever had. Afterwards there grew a mutual love between them, and their friendship proceeded to such a height that it almost arrived at parity, not differing from the concord and modesty of Grecian marriage. Hereupon the fame of his affection to <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a> was spread to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a> and throughout Greece; <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a> also was filled with discourses of the love betwixt <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> and her. The report went even to the great King [of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>,] for it was conceived that <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, after his acquaintance with her, kept company with no other woman. From these things <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a> recollected the remembrance of her old apparition, and of the dove, and her words, and what the Goddess foretold her. Hence she conceived that she was from the very beginning particularly regarded by her. She therefore offered sacrifice of thanks to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>. And first caused a great image of gold to be erected to her, which she called the image of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, and by it placed the picture of a dove beset with jewels, and every day implored the favour of the Goddess with sacrifice and prayer. She sent to <a href=/people/2316 target=_blank>Hermotimus</a> her father many rich presents, and made him wealthy. She lived continently all her life, as both the Grecian and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> women affirm. On a time a necklace was sent as a present to <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> from <a href=/people/815 target=_blank>Scopas</a> the younger, which had been sent to <a href=/people/815 target=_blank>Scopas</a> out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. The necklace was of extraordinary workmanship, and variety. All therefore to whom <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> shewed it admiring it, he was much taken with the jewel, and went immediately to <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a>, it being about noon. Finding her asleep, he lay down gently by her, watching quietly whilest she slept. As soon as she awaked, and saw <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, she embraced him after her usual manner. He taking the necklace out of a box, said, This is a worthy either the daughter or the mother of a King. To which she assenting; I will give it you, said he, for your own use, let me see your neck adorned with it. But she received not the gift, prudently and discreetly answering, How will <a href=/people/898 target=_blank>Parysatis</a> your mother take it, this being a gift fit for her that bare you? Send it to her, <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, I will shew you a neck handsome enough without it. <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a> from the greatness of her mind acted contrary to other royal queens, who are excessively desirous of rich ornaments. <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> being pleased with this answer, kissed <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a>. All these actions and speeches <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> writ in a Letter which he sent together with the chain to his mother; and <a href=/people/898 target=_blank>Parysatis</a> receiving the present was no less delighted with the news then with the gold, for which she requited <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a> with great and royal gifts; for this pleased her above all things, that though <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a> were chiefly affected by her son, yet in the love of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> she desired to be placed beneath his mother. <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a> praised the gifts, but said she had no need of them; (for there was much money sent with the presents) but sent them to <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, saying, To you who maintain many men this may be useful: For me it is enough that you love me and are my ornament. With these things, as it seemeth, she much astonished <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>. And indeed the woman was without dispute admirable for her personal beauty, but much more for the nobleness of her mind. When <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> was slain in the fight against his brother, and his army taken prisoners, with the rest of the prey she was taken; not falling accidentally into the enemies hands, but sought for with much diligence by King <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a>, for he had heard her fame and virtue. When they brought her bound, he was angry, and cast those that did it into prison. He commanded that a rich robe should be given her: which she hearing, entreated with tears and lamentation that she might not put on the garment the King appointed, for she mourned exceedingly for <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>. But when she had put it on, she appeared the fairest of all women, and <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a> was immediately surprised and inflamed with love of her. He valued her beyond all the rest of his women, respecting her infinitely. He endeavoured to ingratiate himself into her favour, hoping to make her forget <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, and to love him no less then she had done his brother; but it was long before he could compass it. For the affection of <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a> to <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> had taken so deep impression, that it could not easily be rooted out. Long after this, Teridates the eunuch died, who was the most beautiful youth in Asia. He had full surpassed his childhood, and was reckoned among the youths. The King was said to have loved him exceedingly: he was infinitely grieved and troubled at his death, and there was an universal mourning throughout Asia, every one endeavouring to gratify the King herein; and none durst venture to come to him and comfort him, for they thought his passion would not admit any consolation. Three days being past, <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a> taking a mourning robe as the King was going to the bath, stood weeping, her eyes cast on the ground. He seeing her, wondered, and demanded the reason of her coming. She said, I come, O King, to comfort your grief and affliction, if you so please; otherwise I shall go back. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> pleased with this care, commanded that she should retire to her chamber, and wait his coming. As soon as he returned, he put the vest of the eunuch upon <a href=/people/808 target=_blank>Aspasia</a>, which did in a manner fit her: And by this means her beauty appeared with greater splendour to the King's eye, who much affected the youth. And being once pleased herewith, he desired her to come always to him in that dress, until the height of his grief were allayed: which to please him she did. Thus more then all his other women, or his own son and kindred, she comforted <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a>, and relieved his sorrow; the King being pleased with her care, and prudently admitting her consolation. </p>                        </div>

But he to whom she was given to be exposed did not kill her, but going into the Mountain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373228LPar class=place long=22.549 lat=37.489>Parthenius</a> laid her down by a spring, where there was a rock with a cave, over which there was a place full of oaks; thus the infant was destined to death, but not deserted by <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>: For soon after a she-bear robbed by huntsmen of her whelps, her udder swollen and opprest with fulness of milk, came by a certain divine providence, taking delight in the child gave it suck; whereby at once the beast eased her own pain, and nourished the infant: and came again, being opprest with milk; and being no longer mother of her own, became nurse to one that nothing belonged to her. The same huntsmen who before had taken her whelps watched her, and searching every part of the thicket, when the Bear according to her custom was gone to the pastures to get food, stole away <a href=/people/697 target=_blank>Atalanta</a>, not yet so called (for they gave her that name afterwards) and she was bred up amongst them with wild food: And by degrees her stature increased with her years, and she affected virginity, and shunned the conversation of men, and delighted in the desert, making choice of the highest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a> Mountains, where there was a valley well furnished with water and tall oaks, as also fresh gales and a thick wood. Why should it seem tedious to hear the description of <a href=/people/697 target=_blank>Atalanta</a>'s cave, more then that of <a href=/people/829 target=_blank>Calypso</a> in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>? In the hollow of the cliff there was a cave very deep fortified at the entrance with a great precipice; along it crept ivy, and twined about the young trees, upon which it climbed. Saffron also grew about the place in a young thick Grove, with which also sprung up the Hyacinths, and many other flowers of various colours, which not only feasted the eye, but the odours which they exhaled round about into the air, did afford a banquet also to the smell. Likewise there were many laurels, which being ever verdant were very delightful to the sight; vines also growing thick and full of Bunches before the cave, attested the industry of <a href=/people/697 target=_blank>Atalanta</a>, springs ever running clear and cool to the touch and taste flowed there abundantly. These contributed much benefit to the trees we speak of, watering them and enlivening them continually. In fine, the place was full of beauty and majesty, such as argued the prudence of the virgin. <br />The skins of beasts were <a href=/people/697 target=_blank>Atalanta</a>'s bed, their flesh her food, her drink water. She wore a careless vest, such as <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> not disdained. For she said that she imitated her as well in this as in determining to live always a virgin. She was exceeding swift of foot, so that not any beast could run away from her, nor any man that layed wait for her, was able (if she would run away) to overtake her. She was beloved, not only of all those who saw her, but also of those who heard the report of her. If therefore it be not tedious we will describe her person. But tedious it cannot be, since hereby we may arrive at some degree of skill in Rhetorick. Whilest she was yet a child, she exceeded in stature those who were women grown; for <a href=/people/1588 target=_blank>Beauty</a> she went beyond all other of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=demonym long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesian</a> virgins of that time. Her look was masculine and fierce, occasioned partly by eating the flesh of wild beasts, (for she was very couragious) partly by her exercise on the Mountains. She had nothing of an effeminate loose disposition, neither did she come out of the Thalamus [where virgins are educated] nor was one of those who are brought up by mothers or nurses. She was not corpulent; for by hunting and other exercise she preserved herself in a good Constitution. Her hair was yellow, not by any womanish art or dye, but by nature. Her face was of a ruddy Complexion, somewhat tanned by the Sun. What flower is so beautiful as the countenance of a modest virgin? She had two admirable properties, an irresistible <a href=/people/1588 target=_blank>Beauty</a>, and an awfulness. No timid person could fall in love with her, for such durst not look upon her, so much did her splendour dazle the beholders. That which caused her to be admired, besides other things, was her reservedness. For she exposed not her self to view, unless accidentally in following the chase, or defending herself from some man; in which action she broke forth like lightning, then immediately hid herself in the thickest of the wood. On a time it happened that two bold young-men of the neighbouring country, <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a>, <a href=/people/7780 target=_blank>Hyleus</a> and Rhecus, in love with her, came in a frolic to her. They had no players on the flute in this frolick, nor such things as the young men use in cities upon the like occasion, but took with them lighted Torches, the sight whereof might have frighted a multitude, much more a lone Maiden. Then breaking boughs from the Pine trees, they twined them about them, and made themselves Garlands of them, and with continual clashing of weapons as they went along the Mountains, set fire on the trees in their way to her, presenting her with injuries instead of Nuptial gifts. She was aware of their Plot, for she beheld the fire from her cave, and knowing who those revellers were, was nothing terrified with the sight: but drawing her bow, and letting fly an arrow, chanced to kill the first, who falling down, the other assaulted her, not in mirth, but as an enemy to revenge his friend and satisfie his passion. But he met with another vindictive arrow from her hand. Thus much of <a href=/people/697 target=_blank>Atalanta</a> daughter of Jasion. </p>                        </div>

A stranger coming to him, and giving him a great sum of money to lay up, in the inner part of the temple; Macareus digging a hole, hid the gold in the ground. Afterwards the stranger returning, demanded his money; he leading him in as if he meant to restore it murdered him, digging up the gold buried the man in the place, thinking that what he did was hid as well from God as from men; but it proved otherwise, for not long after, within a few days came the triennial solemnity. Whilest he was busied in the celebrating the Rites of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> in much state, his two sons that were left at home, imitating their father's sacrificing, went to the altar, where the brands were yet burning. The younger held out his neck, the elder finding a knife left there by accident, slew his brother as a victim. They of the family seeing this cried out. The mother hearing the cry, rushed forth, and seeing one of her sons slain, the other standing by with a bloody sword, snatched a brand from the altar, and killed her surviving son. The news was brought to Macareus, who giving over sacrifice, with all speed and eagerness ran to his own house, and with the Thyrsus which he had in his hand, killed his wife. This wickedness was publicly known: Macareus was taken, and being tortured, confessed what he had perpetrated in the temple. In the midst of these tortures he gave up the ghost. But the other who was murdered unjustly, had public honour, and was interred by the appointment of God. Thus Macareus suffered due revenge, as the poet saith, with his own head, and his wives, and his childrens. </p>                        </div>
