They admit that the will in favor of <a href=/people/3234 target=_blank>Pherenicus</a>, <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a>, and <a href=/people/2540 target=_blank>Poseidippus</a>, and produced by these persons, was the genuine will of <a href=/people/599 target=_blank>Cleonymus</a>, and was deposited by <a href=/people/599 target=_blank>Cleonymus</a> with the magistrates at a time when he was angry with their guardian <a href=/people/1777 target=_blank>Deinias</a>; they allege, however, that he subsequently tried to annul the will, and after having sent for the police-magistrate, died suddenly. They further allege that <a href=/people/2653 target=_blank>Polyarchus</a>, their grandfather and <a href=/people/599 target=_blank>Cleonymus</a>'s father, instructed the latter, if anything should happen to him, to leave his property to them. The question at issue is a decision between the conflicting claims of the two parties, one basing their claim on the original will, the other relying on the last acts of <a href=/people/599 target=_blank>Cleonymus</a>, and alleging that he sent for the magistrate in order to annul the will. <br />Great indeed, gentlemen, is the change which the death of <a href=/people/599 target=_blank>Cleonymus</a> has brought upon me. In his lifetime he devised his property to us; his death has exposed us to the danger of losing it. While he lived, we were so discreetly brought up by him that we never entered a law court even as listeners; now we have come here to fight for all that we possess; for our opponents claim not only <a href=/people/599 target=_blank>Cleonymus</a>'s property, but also our patrimony, alleging that we owe his estate money as well.</p>                        </div>
