Straightway they broke the line they had formed for battle and not only refrained from destroying the city, but even gave back those whom they had captured outside by right of war. Then they made a truce and returned to their own country. </p>                        </div>

He taught them logic and made them skilled in reasoning beyond all other races; he showed them practical knowledge and so persuaded them to abound in good works. By demonstrating theoretical knowledge he urged them to contemplate the twelve signs and the courses of the planets passing through them, and the whole of astronomy. He told them how the disc of the moon gains increase or suffers loss, and showed them how much the fiery globe of the sun exceeds in size our earthly planet.

While his sister's daughter <a href=/people/2633 target=_blank>Marcia</a> was bathing in the stream called Potamus--a river of great clearness and purity that rises in the midst of the city--she wished to draw some water from it and by chance dropped into its depths the golden pitcher she was carrying. Yet though very heavy from its weight of metal, it emerged from the waves a long time afterwards. It surely is not a usual thing for an empty vessel to sink; much less that, when once swallowed up, it should be cast up by the waves and float again. <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> marvelled at hearing this and believed there was some divinity in the stream. So he built a city and called it <a about=https://topostext.org/place/432276UMar class=place long=27.5851 lat=43.2253>Marcianople</a> after the name of his sister. </p>                        </div>
