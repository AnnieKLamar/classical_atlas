Where my Ars Amatoria stood, there’s your place. <br />Perhaps you’ll ask why they come, while they’re a novelty. <br />Whatever the reason, accept them, so long as it’s not for love! <br />You’ll find, though the title’s not about anything sad, <br />this book’s no less sad than the ones that went before. <br />The same theme, different title: and each letter shows <br />whom it was sent to without hiding the name. <br />You don’t like it, but you can’t prevent it: <br />my obliging <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> comes against your will. <br />Whatever it is, add it to my works. Nothing stops <br />an exile’s children enjoying the city if they keep the law. <br />There’s nothing to fear. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>’s writings are read, <br />and Marcus <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, the learned, has shelves waiting. <br />I’m not so foolish as to compare myself with such men: <br />still, I’ve not employed fierce weapons against the gods, <br />In short <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, though he doesn’t need it himself, <br />lacks no honour in any book of mine. <br />If you’re dubious about me, admit praise of a god, <br />and accept my poetry after removing the name. <br />The peaceful olive branch is helpful in wartime: <br />is it not beneficial to contain the creator of peace? <br />When <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> carried his father on his shoulders, <br />they say the very flames made way for the hero: <br />so won’t all paths open to a book bearing <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>’s scion? <br />Indeed one’s father of a country, the other only of a hero. </p>                        </div>

Make way for the bearer of holy symbols! <br />The right’s not claimed by me, but by a mighty god. <br />Because I’ve earned and experienced the prince’s anger, <br />don’t think I’d not wish, for my part, to worship him. <br />I’ve seen one who confessed to outraging the divinity <br />of linen-robed <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> kneeling before <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>’s altar. <br />Another, robbed of sight for a similar reason, <br />shouted, through the streets, that he’d deserved it. <br />The gods delight in instances of such testimony, <br />since they, thereby, give witness of their powers. <br />They often ease punishments and restore the sight <br />they’ve taken, when they see true penitence for sin. <br />Oh, I repent! If anything the wretched say’s believed, <br />I repent, and feel the real torment of my actions. <br />Though exile is grief, my offence is more so: <br />and deserving punishment’s worse than suffering it. <br />If the gods favoured me, and he most visible of them <br />should annul my sentence, the fault still exists forever. <br />At least death will make me, when it comes, no longer an exile: <br />but death can’t arrange things so I never offended either. <br />So it’s no wonder if my mind’s decaying, <br />melting like water dripping from the snow. <br />It’s gnawed at as a ship’s weakened by hidden molluscs: <br />as waves of salt water carve away the cliffs: <br />as heaps of iron are eaten by corroding rust: <br />as a shelved book feeds the worm’s mouth, <br />so my heart feels the constant bite of care, <br />which will never make an end. Not before <br />life itself will these pangs leave my mind: <br />he who grieves will die sooner than the grief. <br />If the gods above, whose I am, believe me, <br />perhaps I’ll be thought worthy of a little help, <br />and be sent to a place free of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> bows. <br />If I asked for more, it would be sheer effrontery. </p>                        </div>

I fear you’ll be hardened on seeing <br />the name, and you’ll read what’s left with a hostile mind. <br />You be the judge. I’ll dare to confess I’ve written to you <br />(..in the hope that you might be able to lessen my ills….?) <br />I, who, though admittedly deserving of a heavier <br />punishment, can scarcely experience a heavier one. <br />I live among enemies, surrounded with dangers, <br />as if peace was taken from me with my native land: <br />they double the chance of death from a cruel wound, <br />by smearing every arrow-head with viper’s gall. <br />Equipped so, the horseman circles our anxious walls, <br />in the same way that a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> circles the penned <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>: <br />and once that light bow’s strung with <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>’s sinew <br />it remains taut, held by its fastenings, forever. <br />The rooftops bristle, covered by the coating of arrows <br />fixed there, and the heavy-barred gate hardly prevents attack. <br />Add that the face of the land, is covered with neither shrubs <br />nor trees, and that lifeless winter merges into winter. <br />Here a fourth winter wearies me, contending as I am <br />with cold, with arrows, and with my own fate. <br />My tears are endless, unless numbness checks them: <br />and a lethargy like death grips my thoughts. <br />Though she saw so many deaths, <a href=/people/479 target=_blank>Niobe</a> was happy, <br />losing her sense of feeling, turned to stone by her sorrows! <br />And you, <a href=/people/273 target=_blank>Phaethon</a>’s sisters, whose mouths the poplar <br />closed with fresh bark, as you cried over your brother! <br />I’m one not allowed to enter any kind of tree: <br />I’m one who wishes in vain to become stone. <br />Let <a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Medusa</a> herself appear before my eyes, <br /><a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Medusa</a> herself will lose all her power. <br />In living I never lose the bitterness of sensation, <br />and my punishment’s worse for its long duration. <br />So <a href=/people/992 target=_blank>Tityus</a>’s liver, never consumed, is always whole, <br />renewed so that it can perish again, forever. <br />I imagine, when rest and sleep, care’s common healer, <br />are here, that night might be free of my usual ills. <br />But dreams that imitate real dangers terrify me, <br />and my senses wake to my own torment. <br />Either I believe myself dodging <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490315RSar class=demonym long=31.5 lat=49>Sarmatian</a> arrows, <br />or offering my hands, captive, to the cruel chains. <br />Or when I’m deceived by the semblance of kinder dreams, <br />I see the roofs of the homeland I’ve left behind. <br />And sometimes I speak with you, honoured friends, <br />and sometimes, at length, with my beloved wife. <br />So, when I’ve known this brief and unreal joy, <br />remembering the happiness, my state is worse. </p>                        </div>

You were fit to be their leader <br />not companion, not to find an exemplar but to be one. <br />You, who accept the exile only made a mistake, <br />delight in virtue and duty for their own sake. <br />Goodness, in your judgement, is free of reward: <br />sought for itself, unaccompanied by outward benefit. <br />You think it’s wrong to drive a friend away who’s wretched, <br />or prevent him being one because he’s been unlucky. <br />It’s kinder to support his weary chin with only a finger, <br />than to push the swimmer’s face beneath the clear wave. <br />See what <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> did for his dead friend <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a>: <br />and think, that to live this life of mine is like death. <br /><a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a> went with <a href=/people/1493 target=_blank>Pirithous</a> to the Stygian waves: <br />how far distant is my death from those Stygian waters? <br /><a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a>, maddened, was helped by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387268UPho class=person long=26.7532 lat=38.6704>Phocean</a> <a href=/people/663 target=_blank>Pylades</a>: <br />and my offence was not without a touch of madness. <br />You too should receive, as you are doing, the praise due <br />to mighty heroes, and bring what help you can to the fallen. </p>                        </div>

Yet courage conquers all: <br />It even causes the body to acquire strength. <br />To support the burden you must strive with head unbowed, <br />if you allow your strength to falter you will fall. <br />The hope too that time might soften the prince’s wrath, <br />warns me against aversion to life, losing heart. <br />And you give no small comfort to me, <br />whose loyalty’s been tested by my troubles. <br />Please hold to what you’ve started, don’t desert the ship <br />at sea, defend me and your decision in one. </p>                        </div>

Ask yourself, surely: <br />you’ll find out, if you truly desire to know. <br />It’s not enough to wish: you must long to achieve, <br />and the anxiety should shorten your hours asleep. <br />I think many wish it: who’d be so unfair to me <br />as to desire me to have no peace in my exile? <br />You should work for me day and night, strain <br />with a full heart and with every sinew. <br />And you must win our friends, so others help, <br />wife, and appear the leader of your party. <br />The role imposed on you in my books is a great one: <br />you’re spoken of as the model of a good wife. <br />Take care you don’t slip from that position. See you <br />guard what fame has achieved, so my claim is true. <br />Though I don’t complain myself, fame, as she should, will <br />complain when I’m silent, if you don’t show care for me. <br /><a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a> has exposed me to the public gaze, <br />and given me more notoriety than before. <br /><a href=/people/552 target=_blank>Capaneus</a> was made more famous when the lightning struck: <br /><a href=/people/284 target=_blank>Amphiaraus</a> when his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> were swallowed by the earth. <br /><a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> would have been less known if he’d wandered less: <br /><a href=/people/448 target=_blank>Philoctetes</a>’ great fame derived from his wound. <br />If there’s a place for the humble among such names, <br />I too am made conspicuous by my ruin. <br />And my writings won’t let you pass unknown, <br />you, whose name’s no less than <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369273PKos class=demonym long=27.2859 lat=36.8914>Coan</a> Bittis’. <br />So whatever you do will be seen on a mighty stage, <br />and you’ll be a virtuous wife before many witnesses. <br />Believe me, whenever you’re praised in my verse <br />he who reads that praise asks if you’re worthy of it. <br />And though many, I think, approve those virtues, <br />not a few women will carp at your deeds. <br />It’s for you to ensure that jealousy can’t say: <br />‘She’s indifferent to her poor husband’s safety.’ </p>                        </div>

What city do you come from? <br />What journey do you make in your ill-fated vessel?” <br />So she spoke, then the sacred virgin, hearing the name <br />of her native country, found them to be men of her own city. <br />“Let one of you die, a victim of these rites,” she said, <br />“let the other carry the news to the fatherland.” <br /><a href=/people/663 target=_blank>Pylades</a>, intent on being the one to die, orders his dear <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a><br />to go: he refuses, and each in turn argue about their dying. <br />This remains the only thing they ever disagreed on: <br />on all else they were as one, and without dispute. <br />While the handsome youths act out their loving quarrel, <br />she pens pages of writing to her brother. <br />She was sending word to her brother, and he to whom <br />it was given (such is human fate!) was her brother. <br />So, without delay, they took <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a>’s image from the temple, <br />and were carried in secret over the boundless sea in their boat. <br />The youths’ love was wonderful: though many years <br />have passed, they still have great fame here in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a>.’ <br />After he had finished telling this well-known story, <br />everyone there praised acts of loyal devotion. <br />Even on this shore, and there’s none that is wilder, <br />it’s clear that friendship’s name moves savage hearts. <br />If such actions stir the harsh <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435268RGet class=ethnic long=26.8 lat=43.5>Getae</a>, what should they <br />do to you, who are born of an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> city? <br />Added to which you have a spirit that’s always gentle, <br />and a character that’s witness to your high nobility, <br />that <a href=/people/10490 target=_blank>Volesus</a>, founder of your father’s line, would recognise, <br />or on your mother’s side, that <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> would not disown, <br />and the Cottas, added to your natal line, a house and name <br />that would perish but for your existence, would approve. <br /><a href=/people/1220 target=_blank>Hero</a>, worthy of this ancestry, consider it in keeping <br />with such things to support a fallen friend. </p>                        </div>

I also ensured by a foolish poem <br />that you wouldn’t be inexperienced in my Arts. <br />The reward of exile was dealt me for it, wretchedly, <br />and that in a remote place, never peaceful. <br />Chionian <a href=/people/793 target=_blank>Eumolpus</a> was not such to <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>, <br />nor <a href=/people/873 target=_blank>Olympus</a> to <a href=/people/2464 target=_blank>Marsyas</a>, the <a href=/people/185 target=_blank>Satyr</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=person long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>, <br />nor did <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Chiron</a> receive such a prize from <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, <br />nor did <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a>, they say, harm <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>. <br />Not to list all the names collected down the ages, <br />I’m the only one ruined by my disciple. <br />This is the reward the master has, with you as pupil, <br />because I gave you weapons, and taught you, wanton. <br />Yet you know, and could swear with a clear <br />conscience, that I’ve never troubled lawful beds. <br />I wrote for those whose chaste hair was never <br />touched by ribbons, nor their feet by the long robe. <br />Say, I beg you, did you ever at my command <br />learn how to cheat brides, and make paternity uncertain? <br />Hasn’t every woman the law protects from seducers <br />been strictly excluded from all those works? <br />Still, what use is that if it’s thought I’ve composed <br />notes on adultery, which is forbidden by harsh laws? <br />But don’t let <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>’s anger at me be implacable, <br />who’s of your kin, through <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> your brother, <br />so may you carry the arrows that strike us all, <br />so may your torches never lack their swift fire, <br />so may he rule the empire, and control all lands: <br />let him wish to punish me in a pleasanter place.’ <br />So it seemed I spoke to the winged boy, <br />so he seemed to reply to me in these words: <br />‘I swear by my weapons, my torches and arrows, <br />by my mother, and by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>’s life, I’ve learnt <br />nothing save what’s legal from your teaching, <br />and there’s nothing criminal in your arts. <br />I wish I could defend you on other charges, as in this! <br />You know there’s another thing that harms you more. <br />Whatever it is (since the painful thing shouldn’t be told, <br />and you can’t say that you are free from blame) <br />though you try to hide the crime under the guise of error, <br />your judge’s anger was no more than you deserved. <br />Yet my wings have glided over endless ways <br />to see you, and console you in your misery. <br />I first saw this place when, at my mother’s request, <br />I pierced the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=demonym long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasian</a> girl, <a href=/people/165 target=_blank>Medea</a>, with my arrow. <br />The reason why I’m here again after long ages <br />is you, O fond soldier of my army. <br />So forget your fears: <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>’s anger will relent, <br />and a gentler hour will come, at your prayer. <br />Don’t be scared at the delay, the time we wish is near, <br />and the triumph has filled everyone with joy. <br />While the house, the children, their mother <a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a>, rejoice, <br />while you rejoice, great father of our leader and our land, <br />while the people congratulate themselves, and every altar <br />burns with fragrant fires throughout the city, <br />while the sacred powers offer an easy approach, <br />it’s to be hoped our prayers might have some worth.’ <br />He spoke, and either he slid away into thin air, <br />or my senses themselves began to wake. <br />If I doubted your approval of these words, <a href=/people/271 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, <br />I might believe that swans were black as <a href=/people/1491 target=_blank>Memnon</a>. <br />But milky liquid can’t be altered to dark pitch, <br />nor can shining ivory become purple terebinth. <br />Your birth suits your spirit, since you have a noble <br />heart, and the straightforwardness of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>. <br />Livid malice, vice of fear, won’t show itself in noble <br />natures, but slides like a hidden <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> along the earth. <br />Your mind towers high above your birth itself, <br />for your name’s no greater than your genius. <br />So let others hurt the wretched, and choose to be feared, <br />and carry points dipped in bitter poison: <br />Your house, at least, is used to helping suppliants, <br />be willing, please, for me to be among their number. </p>                        </div>

Nothing is to hand. <br />What portion of such things could rumour bring <br />or someone writing to me about it? <br />The more you ought to forgive me, O reader, <br />if I’ve made errors in it, or neglected anything. <br />Add that my lyre, always dwelling on it’s master’s moans, <br />can barely turn itself to happy songs. <br />Cheerful words, though searched for, hardly come to mind, <br />and delight in anything seems novel to me. <br />Just as eyes shun the unaccustomed sunlight, <br />so my mind was slow to delight. <br />Novelty’s the most dearly-loved of all things, too, <br />and thanks are lacking for service made late by delay. <br />Others have competed together in writing of the great triumph, <br />and I suspect people have read them widely, for some time. <br />The thirsty reader drank them: he’s sated by my cup: <br />that drink was fresh, my water will be tepid. </p>                        </div>

My <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> speaks only for herself. <br />Poets, you and I have rites in common: <br />if the wretched are allowed to be of your choir. <br />You spent a large part of your spirit with me, friends: <br />I cherish you now in that way, even though I’m absent. <br />So let my verse be sealed with your approval <br />since I cannot speak on its behalf myself. <br />Often writings are made pleasing by death, since envy <br />hurts the living, gnaws with the tooth of injustice. <br />If to live wretchedly is like dying, earth delays <br />me, and my destiny only lacks a tomb. <br />Though the outcome of my efforts is faulted in the end, <br />by everyone, there’ll be no one to deny my sense of duty. <br />Though strength is lacking, yet the will’s to be praised: <br />I divine that the gods will be content with that. <br />It ensures that a poor man’s welcome at the altars: <br />a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a>’s no less acceptable than a sacrificial <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>. <br />It was a great enough thing too to make it a heavy task <br />even for the noble author of the Aeneid. <br />Anyway, weak elegiacs couldn’t carry the weight <br />of so great a triumph on their disparate wheels. <br />My judgement’s uncertain as to what metre to use now: <br />since a second triumph’s near, concerning you, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>. <br />The prophecies of inspired poets are not vain: <br /><a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> will be granted laurel, while the first’s still green. <br />It’s not my words you read, I’m banished to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Danube</a>, <br />waters that the as yet un-pacified <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435268RGet class=ethnic long=26.8 lat=43.5>Getae</a> drink: <br />this is the voice of a god, a god is in my heart, <br />this I prophesy, led by a god’s command. <br /><a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a>, why hesitate, to ready a retinue and chariot <br />for a triumph? Already war allows you no delay. <br />Traitorous <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a> throws away the hated spears, <br />soon you’ll admit my omen carries weight. <br />Believe, and truth will shortly arrive.

Seal it, Citizens! <br />The power of the law’s not needed: I say it myself. <br />Set me down, a humble possession, amongst your family <br />wealth: I’m a part of your estate, however insignificant. <br />Just like those <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> lands of yours, and those in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, <br />like your house next to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFAu class=place long=12.4869 lat=41.8944>Forum</a> of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, <br />like your <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=demonym long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campanian</a> estate, dear to your eyes, <br />whatever was left to you, Sextus, or you’ve bought: <br />so I am yours as well, and by this sad gift <br />you can’t say you own nothing in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>. <br />I wish you could, and a pleasanter field be granted you, <br />so you could own your investment in a better location! <br />Given that it’s up to the gods, try and woo those powers <br />with prayer, that you worship with a constant devotion, <br />since it’s hard to make out whether you are more <br />a confirmation of my error, or a remedy for it. <br />I don’t ask because I doubt: but, following the stream, <br />the flow of the current’s often speeded by using oars. <br />I’m ashamed and anxious, always making the same request, <br />in case weariness with me, rightly, fills your mind. <br />But what can I do? My desire’s immoderate. <br />Kind friend, forgive this fault of mine. <br />Wanting to write otherwise, I fall to speaking the same: <br />my letters of their own accord set the theme. <br />Whether your influence achieves its effect, or whether <br />harsh fate orders me to die beneath the frozen pole, <br />I’ll always recall your gifts to me, with a dutiful mind, <br />and my homeland will hear how I am yours. <br />It will be known by every place beneath the sky <br />(if my <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> travels well beyond the savage <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435268RGet class=ethnic long=26.8 lat=43.5>Getae</a>) <br />that you’re the reason for, and guardian of, my well-being, <br />I’m yours no less than if the bronze and scales weighed me. </p>                        </div>
