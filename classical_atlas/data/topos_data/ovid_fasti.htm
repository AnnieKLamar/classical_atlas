Spurn not the honour slight, but come propitious as a god to take the homage vowed to thee. Here shalt thou read afresh of holy rites unearthed from annals old, and learn how every day has earned its own peculiar mark. There too shalt thou find the festivals pertaining to thy house; often the names of thy sire and grandsire will meet thee on the page. The laurels that are theirs and that adorn the pained calendar, thou too shalt win in company with thy brother <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>.

Approve my effort to rehearse the praises of thy kin, and cast out quaking terrors from my heart. Show thyself mild to me; so shalt thou lend vigour to my song: at thy look my <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> must stand or fall.

On thy accomplished lips what eloquence attends, we have seen, when it took civic arms in defence of trembling prisoners at the bar. And when to poetry thy fancy turns, we know how broad the current of thy genius flows. If it is right and lawful, guide a poet's reins, thyself a poet, that under thy auspices the year may run its entire course happy. </p>                        </div>

To be sure, <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, thou wert better versed in swords than stars, and to conquer thy neighbours was thy main concern. Yet, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, there is a reason that may have moved him, and for his error he might urge a plea. The time that suffices for a child to come forth from its mother's womb, he deemed sufficient for a year. For just so many months after her husband's funeral a wife supports the signs of sorrow in her widowed home. These things, then, <a href=/people/773 target=_blank>Quirinus</a> in his striped gown had in view, when to the simple folk he gave his laws to regulate the year. The month of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> was the first, and that of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> the second; she was the author of the race, and he his sire. The third month took its name from the old, and the fourth from the young; the months that trooped after were distinguished by numbers. But <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> overlooked not <a href=/people/983 target=_blank>Janus</a> and the ancestral shades, and so to the ancient months he prefixed two. </p>                        </div>

The reason, too, unfold why alone of all the heavenly one thou doest see both back and front. While thus I mused, the tablets in my hand, methought the house grew brighter than it was before. Then of a sudden sacred <a href=/people/983 target=_blank>Janus</a>, in his two-headed shape, offered his double visage to my wondering eyes. A terror seized me, I felt my hair stiffen with fear, and with a sudden chill my bosom froze. He, holding in his right hand his staff and in his left the key, to me these accents uttered from his front mouth: Dismiss thy fear, thy answer take, laborious singer of the days, and mark my words. The ancients called me <a href=/people/1434 target=_blank>Chaos</a>, for a being from of old am I; observe the long, long ages of which my song shall tell. Yon lucid air and the three others bodies, fire, water, earth, were huddled all in one. When once, through the discord of its elements, the mass parted, dissolved, and went in diverse ways to seek new homes, flame sought the height, air filled the nearer space, while earth and sea sank in the middle deep. 'Twas then that I, till that time a mere ball, a shapeless lump, assumed the face and members of a god. And even now, small index of my erst chaotic state, my front and back look just the same. Now hear the other reason for the shape you ask about, that you may know it and my office too. Whate'er you see anywhere — sky, sea, clouds, earth — all things are closed and opened by my hand. The guardianship of this vast universe is in my hands alone, and none but me may rule the wheeling pole. When I choose to send forth peace from tranquil halls, she freely walks the ways unhindered. But with blood and slaughter the whole world would welter, did not the bars unbending hold the barricadoed wars. I sit at heaven's gate with the gentle Hours; my office regulates the goings and the comings of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> himself. Hence <a href=/people/983 target=_blank>Janus</a> is my name; but when the priest offers me a barley cake and spelt mingled with salt, you would laugh to hear the names he gives me, for on his sacrificial lips I'm now <a href=/people/10011 target=_blank>Patulcius</a> and now Clusius called. Thus rude antiquity made shift to work my changing functions with the change of name. My business I have told. Now learn the reason for my shape, though already you perceive it in part. Every door has two fronts, this way and that, whereof one faces the people and the other the house-god; and just as your human porter, seated at the threshold of the house-door, sees who goes out and in, so I, the porter of the heavenly court, behold at once both East and West. Thou seest <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a>'s faces turned in three directions that she may guard the crossroads where they branch three several ways; and lest I should lose time by twisting my neck, I am free to look both ways without budging. </p>                        </div>

Then all things flower, then time renews his age, and new from out the teeming vine-shoot swells the bud; in fresh-formed leaves the tree is draped, and from earth's surface sprouts the blade of corn. Birds with their warblings winnow the warm air; the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> frisk and wanton in the meads.

Why, even in <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a>'s reign I hardly saw a soul who did not in his heart find lucre sweet. As time went on the love of pelf grew, till now it is at its height and scarcely can go farther. Wealth is more valued now than in the years of old, when the people were poor, when <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was new, when a small hut sufficed to lodge <a href=/people/773 target=_blank>Quirinus</a>, son of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, and the river sedge supplied a scanty bedding. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> had hardly room to stand upright in his cramped shrine, and in his right hand was a thunderbolt of clay.

They strive to gain that they may waste, and then to repair their wasted fortunes, and thus they feed their vices by ringing the changes on them. So he whose belly swells with dropsy, the more he drinks, the thirstier he grows. Nowadays nothing but money counts: fortune brings honours, friendships; the poor man everywhere lies low.

The day may take its name from the attendant who, in garb succinct, fells at a blow the victim of the gods; for just before he dyes the brandished knife in the warm blood, he always asks if he is to proceed (agatne), and not until he is bidden does he proceed. Some believe that the day is named Agonal from the driving of the victims, because the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> do not come but are driven (agantur) to the altar. Others think the ancients called this festival Agnalia (festival of the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a>), dropping a single letter from its proper place. Or perhaps, because the victim fears the knives mirrored in the water before they strike, the day may have been so styled from the brute's agony. It may be also that he day took a Greek name from the games (agones) which were wont to be held in olden times. In the ancient tongue, too, agonia meant a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, and that last, in my judgement, is the true reason of the name. And though that is not certain, still the King of the Sacred Rites is bound to placate the divinities by sacrificing the mate of a woolly ewe.

Fierce <a href=/people/12088 target=_blank>Cacus</a> had dragged the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> backwards into his cave, <a href=/people/12088 target=_blank>Cacus</a> the terror and shame of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LAve class=place long=12.4792 lat=41.8835>Aventine</a> wood, to neighbours and to strangers no small curse. Grim was his aspect, huge his frame, his strength to match; the monster's sire was <a href=/people/3212 target=_blank>Mulciber</a>. For house he had a cavern vast with long recesses, hidden so that hardly could the wild beasts themselves discover it. Above the doorway skulls and arms of men were fastened pendent, while the ground bristled and bleached with human bones. The son of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> was going off with the loss of part of the herd, when the stolen <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> lowed hoarsely. I accept the recall, quoth he, and following the sound he came, intent on vengeance, through the woods to the unholy cave. But the robber had blocked the entrance with a barricade of crag, scarcely could twice five yoke of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> have stirred that mass. <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> shoved it with his shoulders — the shoulders on which the sky itself had once rested — and by the shock he loosened the vast bulk. Its overthrow was followed by a crash that startled even the upper air, and the battered ground sank under the ponderous weight. At first <a href=/people/12088 target=_blank>Cacus</a> fought hand to hand, and waged battle fierce with rocks and logs. But when these naught availed him, worsted he had recourse to his sire's tricks, and belched flames from his roaring mouth; at every blast you might deem that <a href=/people/1031 target=_blank>Typhoeus</a> blew, and that a sudden blaze shot out from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377150LAit class=place long=15.001 lat=37.748>Etna</a>'s fires. But <a href=/people/12214 target=_blank>Alcides</a> was too quick for him; up he heaved the triple-knotted club, and brought it thrice, yea four times down full on the foeman's face. He fell, vomiting smoke mixed with blood, and dying beat the ground with his broad breast. </p>                        </div>

The pontiffs ask the King and the Flamen for woolen cloths, which in the tongue of the ancients had the name of februa. When houses are swept out, the toasted spelt and crumbs which the officer gets as means of cleansing are called by the same name. The same name is given to the bough, which, cut from a pure tree, wreathes with its leaves the holy brows of the priests. I myself have seen the Flamen's wife (Flaminica) begging for februa; at her request for februa a twig of pine was given her. In short, anything used to cleanse our bodies went by that name in the time of our unshorn forefathers. The month is called after these things, because the <a href=/people/12178 target=_blank>Luperci</a> purify the whole ground with strips of hide, which are their instruments of cleansing, or because the season is pure when once peace-offerings have been made at the graves and the days devoted to the dead are past.

No sooner had she reached the grove — the grove where the thick holm-oaks cast a gloom and in the midst a deep fountain of cool water rose — than the goddess spake: Here in the wood, quoth she, let's bathe, thou maid of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcady</a>. At the false name of maid the other blushed. The goddess spoke to the nymphs as well, and they put off their robes. <a href=/people/1033 target=_blank>Callisto</a> was ashamed and bashfully delayed. But when she doffed her tunic, too plainly, self-convicted, her big belly betrayed the weight she bore. To whom the goddess spake: Daughter of <a href=/people/717 target=_blank>Lycaon</a> forsworn, forsake the company of maids and defile not the pure waters. Ten times the horned moon had filled her orb afresh, when she who had been thought a maid was proved a mother. The injured <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a> raged and changed the damsel's shape. Why so? Against her will <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> ravished her. And when in the leman she beheld the ugly features of the brute, quoth <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>, Let <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> now court her embraces. But she, who of late had been beloved by highest <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>, now roamed, a shaggy she-bear, the mountains wild. The child she had conceived in sin was now in his third lustre when his mother met him. She indeed, as if she knew him, stood distraught and growled; a growl was all the mother's speech. Her the stripling with his sharp javelin would have pierced, but that hey both were caught up into the mansions on high. As constellations they sparkle beside each other.

A single house had undertaken the defence and burden of the city: the right hands of a single clan proffered and drew their swords. From the same camp a noble soldiery marched forth, of whom any one was fit to be a leader. The nearest way is by the right-hand arch of <a href=/people/2504 target=_blank>Carmentis</a>' gate: go not that way, whoe'er thou art: 'tis ominous. By it, the rumour runs, the three hundred <a href=/people/2229 target=_blank>Fabii</a> went forth. No blame attaches to the gate, but still 'tis ominous. When at quick pace they reached the rushing <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420124WCre class=place long=12.4153 lat=42.0095>Cremera</a> (it flowed turbid with winter rain) they pitched their camp on the spot, and with drawn swords broke through the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenian</a> array right valiantly, even as <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> of the Libyan breed attack herds scattered through spacious fields. The foemen flee dispersed, stabbed in the back with wounds dishonourable: with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscan</a> blood the earth is red. So yet again, so oft they fall. When open victory was denied them, they set an ambush of armed men in wait. A plain there was, bounded by hills and forest, where the mountain beasts could find commodious lair. In the midst the foe left a few of their number and some scattered herds: the rest of the host lurked hidden in the thickets. Lo, as a torrent, swollen by rain or snow which the warm <a href=/people/444 target=_blank>West Wind</a> has melted, sweeps across the cornfields, across the roads, nor keeps its waters pent within the wonted limit of its banks, so the <a href=/people/2229 target=_blank>Fabii</a> rushed here and there broadcast about the vale; all that they saw they felled; no other fear they knew. Whither away, ye scions of an illustrious house? 'Tis ill to trust the foe. O noble hearts and simple, beware of treacherous blades! By fraud is valour vanquished: from every hand the foe leaps forth into the open plain, and every side they hold. What can a handful of the brave do against so many thousands? Or what help is left for them in such extremity? As a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>, driven afar from the woods by the pack, scatters the swift <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> with thunderous snout, but soon himself is slain, so do they die not unavenged, giving and taking wounds alternately.

A fig-tree stood loaded with fruit still unripe: the raven tried it with his beak, but it was not fit to gather. Unmindful of his orders he perched, 'tis said, under the tree to wait till the fruit should sweeten lingeringly. And when at last he ate his fill, he snatched a long water-<a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> in his black talons, and returning to his master brought back a lying tale: This <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> was the cause of my delay: he blocked the living water: he kept the spring from flowing and me from doing my duty.

You ask, Why then do the <a href=/people/12178 target=_blank>Luperci</a> run? and why do they strip themselves and bear their bodies naked, for so it is their wont to run? The god himself loves to scamper, fleet of foot, about the high mountains, and he himself takes suddenly to flight.

She gave him gauzy tunics in <a href=/people/12044 target=_blank>Gaetulian</a> purple dipped; she gave him the dainty girdle, which but now had girt her waist. For his belly the girdle was too small; he undid the claps of the tunics to thrust out his big hands. The bracelets he had broken, not made to fit those arms; his fig feet split the little shoes. She herself took the heavy club, the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>'s skin, and the lesser weapons stored in their quiver.

He entered and, rash lecher, he wandered to and fro; with hands outstretched before him he felt his cautious way. At last he reached by groping the beds, where they were spread, and at his first move fortune smiled on hi.

Hither when they were come, for farther they could not go, one or other of them said: But how like they are! how beautiful is each! Yet of the two this one has more vigour. If lineage may be inferred from features, unless appearances deceive me, I fancy that some god is in you — but if some god were indeed the author of your being, he would come to your rescue in so perilous an hour; surely their mother would bring aid, if only aid she lacked not, she who as borne and lost her children in a single day. Ye bodies, born together to die together, together pass beneath the waves! He ended, and from his bosom he laid down the twins. Both squalled alike: you would fancy they understood. With wet cheeks the bearers wended their homeward way. The hollow ark in which the babes were laid supported them on the surface of the water: ah me! how big a fate the little plank upbore! The ark drifted towards a shady wood, and, as the water gradually shoaled, it grounded on the mud. There was a tree (traces of it still remain), which is now called the Rumina fig-tree, but was once the Romulan fig-tree. A she-<a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> which had cast her whelps came, wondrous to tell, to the abandoned twins: who could believe that the brute would not harm the boys? Far from harming, she helped them; and they whom ruthless kinsfolk would have killed with their own hands were suckled by a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>!

The reason for the name is trifling but apt. The earth of old was tilled by men unlearned: war's hardships wearied their active frames. More glory was to be won by the sword than by the curved plough; the neglected farm yielded its master but a small return. Yet spelt the ancients sowed, and spelt they reaped; of the cut spelt they offered the first-fruits to <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a>. Taught by experience they toasted the spelt on the fire, and many losses they incurred through their own fault. For at one time they would sweep up the black ashes instead of spelt, and at another time the fire caught the huts themselves. So they made the oven into a goddess of that name (Fornax); delighted with her, the farmers prayed that she would temper the heat to the corn committed to her charge.

KAL. 23rd When the night had passed, see to it that the god who marks the boundaries of the tilled lands receives his wonted honour. O <a href=/people/12191 target=_blank>Terminus</a>, whether thou art a stone or stump buried in the field, thou too hast been deified from days of yore. Thou art crowned by two owners on opposite sides; they bring thee two garlands and two cakes. An altar is built. Hither the husbandman's rustic wife brings with her own hands on a potsherd the fire which she has taken from the warm hearth. The old man chops wood, and deftly piles up the billets, and strives to fix the branches in the solid earth: then he nurses the kindling flames with dry bark, the boy stands by and holds the broad basket in his hands. When from the basket he had thrice thrown corn into the midst of the fire, the little daughter presents the cut honeycombs. Others hold vessels of wine. A portion of each is cast into the flames. The company dressed in white look on and hold their peace. <a href=/people/12191 target=_blank>Terminus</a> himself, at the meeting of the bounds, is sprinkled with the blood of a slaughtered <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a>, and grumbles not when a suckling <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> is given him. The simple neighbours meet and hold a feast, and sing thy praises, holy <a href=/people/12191 target=_blank>Terminus</a>: Thou dost set bounds to peoples and cities and vast kingdoms; without thee every field would be a root of wrangling. Thou courtest no favour thou art bribed by no gold: the lands entrusted to thee thou dost guard in loyal good faith. If thou of old hadst marked the bounds of the <a href=/people/10405 target=_blank>Thyrean</a> land, three hundred men had not been done to death, nor had the name of <a href=/people/3918 target=_blank>Othryades</a> been read on the piled arms.

Why, the whole company of gods withdrew before <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> and made room for him; but <a href=/people/12191 target=_blank>Terminus</a>, as the ancients relate, remained where he was found in the shrine, and shares the temple with great <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>. Even to this day there is a small hole in the roof of the temple, that he may see naught above him but the stars. From that abide in that station in which thou hast been placed. Yield not an inch to a neighbour, though he ask thee, lest thou shouldst seem to value man above <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>. And whether they beat thee with ploughshares or with rakes, cry out, 'This is thy land, and that is his.'

The last to reign over the Roman people was <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquin</a>, a man unjust, yet puissant in arms. He had taken some cities and overturned others, and had made <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419127UGab class=place long=12.7173 lat=41.8871>Gabii</a> his own by foul play. For the king's three sons the youngest, true scion of his proud sire, came in the silent night into the midst of the foes. They drew their swords. Slay an unarmed man! said he. 'Tis what my brothers would desire, and <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquin</a>, my sire, who gashed my back with cruel scourge. In order that he might urge this plea, he had submitted to a scourging. The moon shone. They beheld the youth and sheathed their swords, for they saw the scars on his back, where he drew down his robe. They even wept and begged that he would side with them in war. The cunning knave assented to their unwary suit. No sooner was the installed in power than he sent a friend to ask his father to show him the way of destroying <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419127UGab class=place long=12.7173 lat=41.8871>Gabii</a>. Below the palace lay a garden trim of odoriferous plants, whereof the ground was cleft by a book of purling water: there <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquin</a> received the secret message of his son, and with his staff he mowed the tallest lilies. When the messenger returned and told of the cropped lilies, I take, quoth the son, my father's bidding. Without delay, he put to the sword the chief men of the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419127UGab class=place long=12.7173 lat=41.8871>Gabii</a> and surrendered the walls, now bereft of their native leaders. </p>                        </div>

An oracle was delivered in these terms: He who shall first have kissed his mother will be victorious. Each one of the credulous company, not understanding the god, hasted to kiss his mother. The prudent <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> feigned to be a fool, in order that from thy snares, <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquin</a> the Proud, dread king, he might be safe; lying prone he kissed his mother <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>, but they thought he had stumbled and fallen. Meantime the Roman legions had compassed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416125UArd class=place long=12.5496 lat=41.6112>Ardea</a>, and the city suffered a long and lingering siege. While there was naught to do, and the foe feared to join battle, they made merry in the camp; the soldiers took their ease. Young <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquin</a> entertained his comrades with feast and wine: among them the king's son spake: While <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416125UArd class=place long=12.5496 lat=41.6112>Ardea</a> keeps us here on tenterhooks with sluggish war, and suffers us not to carry back our arms to the gods of our fathers, what of the loyalty of the marriage-bed? and are we as dear to our wives as they to us? Each praised his wife: in their eagerness dispute ran high, and every tongue and heart grew hot with the deep draughts of wine. Then up and spake the man who from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419127UCol class=place long=12.6671 lat=41.9252>Collatia</a> took his famous name: No need of words! <a href=/people/2182 target=_blank>Trust</a> deeds!

They saying pleased them; the steeds are bridled and bear their masters to the journey's end. The royal palace first they seek: no sentinel was at the door. Lo, they find the king's daughters-in-law, their necks draped with garlands, keeping their vigils over the wine. Thence they galloped to <a href=/people/12037 target=_blank>Lucretia</a>, before whose bed were baskets full of soft wool. By a dim light the handmaids were spinning their allotted stints of yarn. Amongst them the lady spoke on accents soft: Haste ye now, haste, my girls! The cloak our hands have wrought must to your master be instantly dispatched. But what news have ye? For more news comes your way. How much do they say of the war is yet to come? Hereafter thou shalt be vanquished and fall: <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416125UArd class=place long=12.5496 lat=41.6112>Ardea</a>, thou dost resist thy betters, thou jade, that keepest perforce our husbands far away! If only they came back! But mine is rash, and with drawn sword he rushes anywhere. I faint, I die, oft as the image of my soldier spouse steals on my mind and strikes a chill into my breast. She ended weeping, dropped the stretched yarn, and buried her face in her lap. The gesture was becoming; becoming, too, her modest tears; her face was worthy of its peer, her soul. Fear not, I've come, her husband said. She revived and on her spouse's neck she hung, a burden sweet. </p>                        </div>

Now had the bird, the herald of the dawn, uttered his chant, when the young men retraced their steps to camp. Meantime the image of his absent love preyed on his senses crazed. 'Twas thus she sat, 'twas thus she dressed, 'twas thus she spun the yarn, 'twas thus her tresses lay fallen on her neck; that was her look, these were her words, that was her colour, that her form, and that her lovely face.

Her lover foe is urgent with prayers, with bribes, with threats; but still he cannot move her by prayers, by bribes, by threats. Resistance is vain, said he, I'll rob thee of honour and of life. I, the adulterer, will bear false witness to thine adultery. I'll kill a slave, and rumour will have it that thou wert caught with him. Overcome by fear of infamy, the dame gave way.

When they saw her plight, they asked why she mourned, whose obsequies she was preparing, or what ill had befallen her. She was long silent, and for shame hid her face in her robe: her tears flowed like a running stream. On this side and on that her father and her spouse did soothe her grief and pray her to tell, and in blind fear they wept and quaked. Thrice she essayed to speak, and thrice gave o'er, and when the fourth time she summoned up courage she did not for that lift up her eyes. Must I owe this too to <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquin</a>? Must I utter, quoth she, must I utter, woe's me, with my own lips my own disgrace? And what she can she tells. The end she left unsaid, but wept and a blush o'erspread her matron cheeks. Her husband and her sire pardoned the deed enforced. She said, The pardon that you give, I do refuse myself. Without delay, she stabbed her breast with the steel she had hidden, and weltering in her blood fell at her father's feet. Even then in dying she took care to sink down decently: that was her thought even as she fell. Lo, heedless of appearances, the husband and father fling themselves on her body, moaning their common loss. <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> came, and then at last belied his name; for form the half-dead body he snatched the weapon stuck in it, and holding the knife, that dripped with noble blood, he fearless spake these words of menace: By this brave blood and chaste, and by the ghost, who shall be god to me, I swear to be avenged on <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquin</a> and on his banished brood. Too long have I dissembled my manly worth. At these words, even as she lay, she moved her lightless eyes and seemed by the stirring of her hair to ratify the speech. They bore her to burial, that matron of manly courage; and tears and indignation followed in her train. The gaping wound was exposed for all to see. With a cry <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> assembled the Quirites and rehearsed the king's foul deeds. <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquin</a> and his brood were banished.

When she had come to where the path ran gently down the sloping bank, she set down her earthenware pitcher from her head. Weary, she sat her on the ground and opened her bosom to catch the breezes, and composed her ruffled hair. While she sat, the shady willows and the tuneful birds and the soft murmur of the water induced to sleep. Sweet slumber overpowered and crept stealthily over her eyes, and her languid hand dropped from her chin. <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> saw her; the sight inspired him with desire, and his desire was followed by possession, but by his power divine he hid his stolen joys. <a href=/people/422 target=_blank>Sleep</a> left her; she lay big, for already within her womb there was <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>'s founder. Languid she rose, nor knew why she rose so languid, and leaning on a tree she spake these words: Useful and fortunate, I pray, may that turn out which I saw in a vision of sleep. Or was the vision too clear for sleep? Methought I was by the fire of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a>, when the woolen fillet slipped from my hair and fell before the sacred hearth. From the fillet there sprang a wondrous sight — two palm-trees side by side. Of them one was the taller and by its heavy boughs spread a canopy over the whole world, and with its foliage touched the topmost stars. Lo, mine uncle wielded an axe against the trees; the warning terrified me and my heart did throb with fear. A woodpecker — the bird of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> and a she-<a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> fought in defence of the twin trunks, and by their help both of the palms were saved. She finished speaking, and by a feeble effort lifted the full pitcher; she had filed it while she was telling her vision.

When <a href=/people/795 target=_blank>Amulius</a> learned of this, scorner of justice that he was (for he had vanquished his brother and robbed him of power), he ordered the twins to be sunk in the river. The water shrank from such a crime, and the boys were left on dry land.

Thrice six years old was the progeny of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, and already under their yellow hair sprouted a fresh young beard: to all the husbandmen and masters of herds the brothers, sons of <a href=/people/11007 target=_blank>Ilia</a>, gave judgement by request. Often they came home glad at blood of robbers spilt, and to their own domain drove back the raided <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>kine</a>. When they heard the secret of their birth, their spirits rose with the revelation of their sire, and they thought shame to have a name in a few huts. <a href=/people/795 target=_blank>Amulius</a> fell, pierced by the sword of <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, and the kingdom was restored to their aged grandfather. Walls were built, which, small though they were, it had been better for <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a> not to have overleaped. And now what of late had been woods and pastoral solitudes was a city, when thus the father of the eternal city spake: Umpire of war, from whose blood I am believed to have sprung (and to confirm that belief I will give many proofs), we name the beginning of the Roman year after thee; the first month shall be called by my father's name. The promise was kept; he did call the month by his father's name: this pious deed is said to have been well pleasing to the god.

The stars ran their courses free and unmarked throughout the year; yet everybody agreed that they were gods. Heaven's gliding ensigns were beyond their reach, not so their own, to lose which was a great crime. Their ensigns were of hay, but as deep reverence was paid to hay as now you see paid to the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a>. A long pole carried the hanging bundles (maniples); from them the private (maniplaris) soldier takes his name. Hence through ignorance and lack of science they reckoned lustres, each of which was too short by ten months. A year was counted when the moon had returned to the full for the tenth time: that number was then in great honour, whether because that is the number of fingers by which we are wont to count, or because a woman brings forth in twice five months, or because the numerals increase up to ten, and from that we start a fresh round. Hence <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> divided the hundred senators into ten groups, and instituted ten companies of spear-men (hastate); and just so many companies there were of first-line men (principes), and also of javelin-men (pilani); and so too with the men who served on <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> furnished by the state. Nay, <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> assigned just the same number of divisions to the tribes, the Titienses, the Ramnes, as they are called, and the Luceres.

Already the armies were drawn up in array, alert for carnage; already the bugle was about to give the signal for battle, when the ravished wives interposed between their fathers and husbands, bearing at their bosom the dear pledges of love, their babes. When with their streaming hair they reached the middle of the plain, they knelt down on the ground, and the grandchildren stretched out their little arms to their grandfathers with winsome cries, as if they understood.

Then with his folk he hid him close within a cave. To their accustomed springs the woodland spirits came, and slaked their thirst with copious draughts of wine. <a href=/people/422 target=_blank>Sleep</a> followed the debauch; from the chill cave <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> came forth and thrust the sleeper's hands into tight shackles.

When he came to himself, King and father of the high gods, he said, vouchsafe expiations sure for thunderbolts, if with pure hands we have touched thine offerings, and if for that which now we ask a pious tongue doth pray. The god granted his prayer, but hid the truth in sayings dark and tortuous, and alarmed the man by an ambiguous utterance. Cut off the head, said he. The king answered him, We will obey. We'll cut an onion, dug up in my garden. The god added, A man's. Thou shalt get, said the other, his hair. The god demanded a life, and <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> answered him, A fish's life. The god laughed and said, See to it that by these things thou dost expiate my bolts, O man whom none may keep from converse with the gods!

He spake, and in a loud peal of thunder was wafted above the riven sky, leaving <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> worshipping.

And thus he spoke: The time has come to receive the promised boon; fulfil thy promise, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>. Even while he spoke, the sun had already lifted his full orb above the horizon, and a loud crash rang out from heaven's vault. Thrice did the god thunder from a cloudless sky, thrice did he hurl his bolts. Take my word for it: what I say is wonderful but true. At the zenith the sky began to yawn; the multitude and their leader lifted up their eyes. Lo, swaying gently in the light breeze, a shield fell down. The people sent up a shout that reached the stars. The king lifted from the ground the gift, but not till he had sacrificed a heifer, which had never submitted her neck to the burden of the yoke, and he called the shield ancile, because it was cut away (recisum) on all sides, and there was no angle that you could mark. Then, remembering that the fate of empire was bound up with it, he formed a very shrewd design. He ordered that many shields should be made, wrought after the same pattern, in order to deceive a traitor's eyes.

It was through the fault of <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a> that <a href=/people/421 target=_blank>Ariadne</a> was made a goddess. Already had she happily exchanged a perjured spouse for <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a>, she who gave to a thankless man a clue to gather up. Joying in her lot of love, Why like a rustic maiden did I weep? quoth she; his faithlessness has been my gain. Meantime <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Liber</a> had conquered the straight-haired <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> and returned, loaded with treasure, from the eastern world. Amongst the fair captive girls there was one, the daughter of a king, who pleased <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a> all too well. His loving spouse wept, and pacing the winding shore with dishevelled locks she uttered these words: Lo, yet again, ye billows, list to my like complaint! Lo, yet again, ye sands, receive my tears! I used to say, I remember, 'Foresworn and faithless <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>!' He deserted me: now <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a> does me the same wrong. Now again I will cry, 'Let no woman trust a man!' My case has been repeated, only the name is changed. Would that my lot had ended where it first began! So at this moment had I been no more. Why, <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Liber</a>, didst thou save me to die on desert sands? I might have ended my griefs once and for all. <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a>, thou light o' love! lighter than the leaves that wreathe thy brows! <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a>, whom I have known only that I should weep! Hast thou dared to trouble our so harmonious loves by bringing a leman before mine eyes? Ah, where is plighted troth? Where are the oaths that thou wast wont to swear? Woe's me, how often must I speak these self-same words! Thou wast wont to blame <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>; thou was twont thyself to dub him deceiver; judged by thyself, thine is the fouler sin. Let no man know of this, and let me burn with pangs unuttered, lest they should think that I deserve to be deceived so oft. Above all I would desire the thing were kept from <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>, that he may not joy to know thee a partner in his guilt. But I suppose a leman fair has been preferred to dusky me: — may that hue fall to my foes! But what does that matter? She is dearer to thee for the very blemish. What art thou about? She defiles thee by her embrace. <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a>, keep faith, nor prefer any woman to a wife's love. I have learned to love my love for ever. The horns of a handsome <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> won my mother's heart, thine won mine. But my love was cause for praise: hers was shameful. Let me not suffer for my love; thou thyself, <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a>, didst not suffer for avowing thy flame to me. No wonder that thou dost make me burn; they say thou wert born in the fire and wert snatched from the fire by thy father's hand. I am she to whom thou wert wont to promise heaven. Ah me! what guerdon to I reap instead of heaven! She finished speaking. Long time had <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Liber</a> heard her plaint, for as it chanced he followed close behind. He put his arms about her, with kisses dried her tears, and Let us fare together, quoth he, to heaven's height. As thou hast shared my bed, so shalt thou share my name, for in thy changed state they name shall be <a href=/people/2628 target=_blank>Libera</a>; and I will see to it that with thee there shall be a memorial of thy crown, that crown which <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Vulcan</a> gave to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>, and she to thee. He did as he had said and changed the nine jewels of her crown into fires. Now the golden crown doth sparkle with nine stars. </p>                        </div>

When Anna had been but lately made a goddess, the Marching God (Gradivus) came to her, and taking her aside spoke as follows: Thou art worshipping in my month, I have joined my season to thine: I have great hope in the serve that thou canst render me. An armed god myself, I have fallen in love with the armed goddess <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>; I burn and for a long time have nursed this wound. She and I are deities alike in our pursuits; contrive to unite us. That office well befits thee, kind old dame. So he spoke. She duped the god by a false promise, and kept him dangling on in foolish hope by dubious delays. When he often pressed her, I have done thy bidding, said she, she is conquered and has yielded at last to thine entreaties. The lover believed her and made ready the bridal chamber. Thither they escorted Anna, like a bride, with a veil upon her face. When he would have kissed her, <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> suddenly perceived Anna; now shame, now anger moved the god befooled. The new goddess laughed at dear <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>'s lover. Never did anything please <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> more than that. So old jokes are cracked and ribald songs are sung, and people love to remember how Anna choused the great god. </p>                        </div>

When the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilian</a> sire was putting the long year on record, he saw the relationship and commemorated the authors of thy race: and as he gave the first lot in order of the months to fierce <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, because he was the immediate cause of his own birth, so he willed that the place of the second month should belong to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>, because he traced his descent from her through many generations. In seeking the origin of his race, he turned over the roll of the centuries and came at last to the gods whose blood he shared.

Now at last have we come to the lucky name of Julus, through whom the <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a> house reaches back to Teucrian ancestors. He had a son <a href=/people/2121 target=_blank>Postumus</a>, who, because he was born in the deep woods, was called <a href=/people/845 target=_blank>Silvius</a> among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> folk.

And when <a href=/people/1971 target=_blank>Tiberinus</a> possessed his father's kingdom after the death of Calpetus, he was drowned, it is said, in a deep pool of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscan</a> river.

She wished that he should be kept for herself and should guard her temple, and she said, 'Resolve to be a boy for ever.' He promised obedience, and, 'If I lie,' quoth he, 'may the love for which I break faith be my last love of all.' He broke faith; for, meeting the nymph Sagaritis, he ceased to be what he had been before. For that the angry goddess wreaked vengeance. By wounds inflicted on the tree she cut down the <a href=/people/952 target=_blank>Naiad</a>, who perished thus; for the fate of the <a href=/people/952 target=_blank>Naiad</a> was bound up with the tree. <a href=/people/1108 target=_blank>Attis</a> went mad, and, imagining that the roof of the chamber was falling in, he fled and ran for the top of Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393318LDin class=place long=29.697 lat=38.94>Dindymus</a>.

He mangled, too, his body with a sharp stone, and trailed his long hair in the filthy dust; and his cry was, 'I have deserved it! With my blood I pay the penalty that is my due. Ah, perish the parts that were my ruin! Ah, let them perish,' still he said. He retrenched the burden of his groin, and of a sudden was bereft of every sign of manhood. His madness set an example, and still his unmanly ministers cut their vile members while they toss their hair.

They say that what he found ran thus: 'The Mother is absent; thou Roman, I bid thee seek the Mother. When she shall come, she must be received by chaste hands.' The ambiguity of the dark oracle puzzled the senators to know who the Parent was, and where she was to be sought. Paean was consulted and said, 'Fetch the <a href=/people/11088 target=_blank>Mother of the Gods</a>; she is to be found on Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397268LIda class=place long=26.8423 lat=39.6922>Ida</a>.'

Wonders to tell, the earth trembled and rumbled long, and in her shrine thus did the goddess speak: 'Twas my own will that they should send for me. Tarry not: let me go, it is my wish. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> is a place meet to be the resort of every god.'

All the knights and gave senators, mixed up with the common folk, came to meet her at the mouth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tuscan</a> river. With them walked mothers and daughters and brides, and the virgins who tended the sacred hearths. The men wearied their arms by tugging lustily at the rope; hardly did the foreign ship make head against the stream. A drought had long prevailed; the grass was parched and burnt; the loaded bark sank in the muddy shallows. Every man who lent a hand toiled beyond his strength and cheered on the workers by his cries. Yet the ship stuck fast, like an island firmly fixed in the middle of the sea. Astonished at the portent, the men did stand and quake. <a href=/people/1822 target=_blank>Claudia</a> Quinta traced her descent from <a href=/people/3560 target=_blank>Clausus</a> of old, and her beauty matched her nobility. Chaste was she, though not reputed so. <a href=/people/1271 target=_blank>Rumour</a> unkind had wronged her, and a false charge had been trumped up against her: it told against her that she dressed sprucely, that she walked abroad with her hair dressed in varied fashion, that she had a ready tongue for gruff old men. Conscious of innocence, she laughed at fame's untruths; but we of the multitude are prone to think the worst. When she had stepped forth from the procession of the chaste matrons, and taken up the pure water of the river in her hands, she thrice let it drip on her head, and thrice lifted her palms to heaven (all who looked on her thought that she was out of her very mind), and bending the knee she fixed her eyes on the image of the goddess, and with dishevelled hair uttered these words: 'Thou fruitful <a href=/people/11088 target=_blank>Mother of the Gods</a>, graciously accept thy suppliant's prayers on one condition. They say I am not chaste. If thou dost condemn me, I will confess my guilt; convicted by the verdict of the goddess, I will pay the penalty with my life. But if I am free of crime, give by thine act a proof of my innocency, and, chaste as thou art, do thou yield to my chaste hands.' She spoke, and drew the rope with a slight effort. My story is a strange one, but it is attested by the stage. The goddess was moved, and followed her leader, and by following bore witness in her favour: a sound of joy was wafted to the stars. They came to a bend in the river, where the stream turns away to the left; men of old named it the Halls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>. Night drew on; they tied the rope to an oaken stump, and after a repast disposed themselves to slumber light. At dawn of day they loosed the rope from the oaken stump; but first they set down a brazier and put incense on it, and crowned the poop, and sacrificed an unblemished heifer that had known neither the yoke nor the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>. There is a place where the smooth <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WAlm class=place long=12.5116 lat=41.8665>Almo</a> flows into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, and the lesser river loses its name in the great one.

The attendants howled, the mad flute blew, and hands unmanly beat the leathern drums. Attended by a crowd, <a href=/people/1822 target=_blank>Claudia</a> walked in front with joyful face, her chastity at last vindicated by the testimony of the goddess.

There was a pause to give me time to put the rest of my questions. Why, said I, does the goddess collect money in small coins? The people contributed their coppers, with which <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> built her fane, said she; hence the custom of giving a small coin abides. I asked why then more than at other times people entertain each other to feasts and hold banquets for which they issue invitations. Because, said she, the Berecyntian goddess luckily changed her home, people try to get the same good luck by going from house to house. 40 I was about to ask why the <a href=/people/7948 target=_blank>Megalesia</a> are the first games of the year in our city, when the goddess took my meaning and said, She gave birth to the gods. They gave place to their parent, and the Mother has the honour of precedence. Why then do we give the name of Galii to the men who unman themselves, when the Gallic land is so far from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>?

Who drinks of it goes mad. Far hence depart, ye who care to be of sound mind. Who drinks of it goes mad. They think no shame, said I, to set a dish of herbs on the tables of the Mistress. Is there a good reason at the bottom of it? People of old, she answered, are reported to have subsisted on pure milk and such herbs as the earth bore of its free will. White cheese is mixed with pounded herbs, that the ancient goddess may know the ancient foods. </p>                        </div>

There is no need to declare the reason; the bounty and the services of the goddess are manifest. The bread of the first mortals consisted of the green herbs which the earth yielded without solicitation; and now they plucked the living grass from the turf, and now the tender leaves of tree-tops furnished a feast. Afterwards the acorn became known; it was well when they had found the acorn, and the sturdy oak offered a splendid affluence. <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a> was the first who invited man to better sustenance and exchanged acorns for more useful food. She forced <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> to yield their necks to the yoke; then for the first time did the upturned soil behold the sun.

Cool <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153WAre class=place long=15.2929 lat=37.0573>Arethusa</a> had invited the mothers of the gods, and the yellow-haired goddess had also come to the sacred banquet. Attended as usual by her wonted damsels, her daughter roamed bare-foot through the familiar meadows. In a shady vale there is a spot moist with the abundant spray of a high waterfall. All the hues that nature owns were there displayed, and the pied earth was bright with various flowers. As soon as she espied it, Come hither, comrades, she said, and with me bring home lapfuls of flowers. The bauble booty lured their girlish minds, and they were too busy to feel fatigue. One filled baskets plaited of supple withes, another loaded her lap, another the loose folds of her robe; one gathered marigolds, another paid heed to beds of violets; another nipped off the heads of poppies with her nails; some are attracted by the hyacinth, others lingered over amaranth; some love thyme, others corn poppies and melilot; full many a rose was culled, and flowers without a name. <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Persephone</a> herself plucked dainty crocuses and white lilies. Intent on gathering, she, little by little, strayed far, and it chanced that none of her companions followed their mistress. Her father's brother saw her, and no sooner did he see her than he swiftly carried her off and bore her on his dusky steeds into his own realm. She in sooth cried out, Ho, dearest mother, they are carrying me away! and she rent the bosom of her robe. Meantime a road is opened up for Dis; for his steeds can hardly brook the unaccustomed daylight. But when the band of playmates attending her had heaped their baskets with flowers, they cried out, <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Persephone</a>, come to the gifts we have for thee! When she answered not their call, they filled the mountain with shrieks, and smote their bare bosoms with their sad hands. </p>                        </div>

There for the first time she sat her down most rueful on a cold stone: that stone even now the <a href=/people/2850 target=_blank>Cecropids</a> call the Sorrowful. For many days she tarried motionless under the open sky, patiently enduring the moonlight and the rain. Not a place but has its own peculiar destiny: what now is named the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235PEle class=place long=23.5415 lat=38.0441>Eleusis</a> of <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a> was then the plot of land of aged <a href=/people/1644 target=_blank>Celeus</a>. He carried home acorns and blackberries, knocked from bramble bushes, and dry wood to feed the blazing hearth. A little daughter drove two nanny-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> back from the mountain, and an infant son was sick in his cradle. Mother, said the maid — the goddess was touched by the name of mother — what does thou all alone in solitary places? The old man, too, halted, despite the load he bore, and prayed that she would pass beneath the roof of his poor cottage. She refused. She had disguised herself as an old dame and covered her hair wit ha cap. When he pressed her, she answered thus: Be happy! may a parent's joy be thine for ever! My daughter has been taken from me. Alas! how much betters is thy lot than mine! She spoke, and like a tear (for gods can never weep) a crystal drop fell on her bosom warm. They wept with her, those tender hearts, the old man and the maid; and these were the words of the worthy old man: So may the ravished daughter, whose loss thou weepest, be restored safe to thee, as thou shalt arise, nor scorn the shelter of my humble hut. The goddess answered him. Lead on; thou hast found the way to force me; and she rose from the stone and followed the old man. As he led her and she followed, he told her how his son was sick and sleepless, kept wakeful by his ills. As she was about to pass within the lowly dwelling, she plucked a smooth, a slumberous poppy that grew on the waste ground; and as she plucked, 'tis said she tasted it forgetfully, and so unwitting stayed her long hunger. Hence, because she broke her fast at nightfall, the initiates time their meal by the appearance of the stars. When she crossed the threshold, the saw the household plunged in grief; all hope of saving the child was gone. The goddess greeted the mother (her name was <a href=/people/6669 target=_blank>Metanira</a>) and deigned to put her lips to the child's lips. His pallor fled, and strength of a sudden was visibly imparted to his frame; such vigour flowed from lips divine. There was joy in the whole household, that is, in mother, father, and daughter; for they three were the whole household. Anon they set out a repast — curds liquefied in milk, and apples, and golden honey in the comb. Kind <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a> abstained, and gave the child poppies to drink in warm milk to make him sleep. It was midnight, and there reigned the silence of peaceful sleep; the goddess took up <a href=/people/702 target=_blank>Triptolemus</a> in her lap, and thrice she stroked him with her hand, and spoke three spells, spells not to be rehearsed by mortal tongue, and on the hearth she buried the boy's body in live embers, that he fire might purge away the burden of humanity. His fond-foolish mother awoke from sleep and distractedly cried out, What doest thou? and she snatched his body from the fire. To her the goddess said: Meaning no wrong, thou hast done grievous wrong: my bounty has been baffled by a mother's fear. That boys of yours will indeed by mortal, but he will be the first to plough and <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> and reap a guerdon from the turned-up soil. </p>                        </div>

By wandering round the world I have learned naught but the knowledge of the wrong: the ravisher enjoys the reward of his crime. But neither did <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Persephone</a> deserve a robber husband, nor was it meet that in this fashion we should find a son-in-law. What worse wrong could I have suffered if <a href=/people/870 target=_blank>Gyges</a> had been victorious and I his captive, than now I have sustained while thou art sceptered king of heaven? But let him escape unpunished; I'll put up with it nor ask for vengeance; only let him restore her and repair his former deeds by new. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> soothed her, and on the plea of love excused the deed. He is not a son-in-law, said he, to put us to shame: I myself am not a white more noble: my royalty is in the sky, another owns the waters, and another void of chaos. But if haply thy mind is set immutably, and thou art resolved to break the bonds of wedlock, once contracted, come let us try to do so, if only she has kept her fast; if not, she will be the wife of her infernal spouse. The Herald God received his orders and assumed his wings: he flew to <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a> and returning sooner than he was looked for brought tidings sure of what he had seen. The ravished Maid, said he, did break her fast on three grains enclosed in the tough rind of a pomegranate. Her rueful parent grieved no less than if her daughter had just been reft from her, and it was long before she was herself again, and hardly then.

Forda is a <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a> with calf and fruitful, so called from ferendo (bearing): they think that fetus is derived from the same root. Now are the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> big with young; the ground, too, is big with seed: to teeming <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> is given a teeming victim.

But when the attendants have torn the calves from the bowels of their dams, and put the cut entrails on the smoking hearths, the eldest (Vestal) Virgin burns the calves in the fire, that their ashes may purify the people on the day of Pales. When <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> was king, the harvest did not answer to the labour bestowed on it; the husbandman was deceived, and his prayers were offered in vain. For at one time the year was dry, the north winds blowing cold; at another time the fields were rank with ceaseless rain; often at its first sprouting the crop balked its owner, and the light oats overran the choked soil, and the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> dropped their unripe young before the time, and often the ewe perished in giving birth to her <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a>.

He to the quiet mind gave answers in the silence of the night. Here <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> sacrificed two ewes. The first fell in honour of <a href=/people/800 target=_blank>Faunus</a>, the second fell in honour of gentle <a href=/people/422 target=_blank>Sleep</a>: the fleeces of both were spread on the hard ground. Twice the king's unshorn head was sprinkled with water from a spring; twice he veiled his brows with beechen leaves. He refrained from the pleasures of love; no flesh might be served up to him at table; he might wear no ring on his fingers. Covered with a rough garment he laid him down on the fresh fleeces after worshipping the god in the appropriate words. Meantime, her clam brow wreathed with poppies, Night drew on, and in her train brought darkling dreams. <a href=/people/800 target=_blank>Faunus</a> was come, and setting his hard hoof on the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>'s fleeces uttered these words on the right side of the bed: O King, thou must appease <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> by the death of two <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a>, let one heifer yield two lives in sacrifice. Fear banished sleep: <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> pondered the vision, and revolved in his mind the dark sayings and mysterious commands.

My host was wont to tell me many things, and among them matters which were to be embodied in my present work. In yonder plain, said he, and he pointed it out, a thrifty countrywoman had a small croft, she and her sturdy spouse. He tilled his own land, whether the work called for the plough, or the curved sickle, or the hoe. She would now sweep the cottage, supported on props; now she would set the eggs to be hatched under the plumage of the brooding hen; or she gathered green mallows or white mushrooms, or warmed the low hearth with welcome fire. And yet she diligently employed her hands at the loom, and armed herself against the threats of winter. She had a son, in childhood frolicsome, who now had seen twice five years and two more. He in a valley at the end of a willow copse caught a vixen <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>fox</a> which had carried off many farmyard fowls. The captive brute he wrapped in straw and hay, and set a light to her; she escaped the hands that would have burned her. Where she fled, she set fire to the crops that clothed the fields, and a breeze fanned the devouring flames. The incident is forgotten, but a memorial of it survives; for to this day a certain law of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421130UCar class=place long=13.0443 lat=42.0817>Carseoli</a> forbids to name a <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>fox</a>; and to punish the species a <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>fox</a> is burned at the festival of <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a>, thus perishing itself in the way it destroyed the crops. </p>                        </div>

Deck the sheepfold with leaves and branches fastened to it; adorn the door and cover it with a long festoon.

Count it not against me if I have sheltered my flock in a rustic shrine till the hail left off, and may I not suffer for having troubled the pools: forgive it, nymphs, if the trampling of hoofs has made your waters turbid.

The multitude of explanations creates doubt and thwarts me at the outset. Devouring fire purges all things and melts the dross from out the metals; therefore it purges the shepherd and the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>. Or are we to suppose that, because all things are composed of opposite principles, fire and water — those two discordant deities — therefore our fathers did conjoin these elements and though meet to touch the body with fire and sprinkled water? Or did they deem these two important because they contain the source of life, the exile loses the use of them, and by them the bride is made a wife?78 Some suppose (though I can hardly do so) that the allusion is to <a href=/people/273 target=_blank>Phaethon</a> and <a href=/people/10993 target=_blank>Deucalion</a>'s flood. Some people also say that when shepherds were knocking stones together, a spark suddenly leaped forth; the first indeed was lost, but the second was caught in straw; is that he reason of the flame at the <a href=/people/3225 target=_blank>Parilia</a>? Or is the custom rather based on the piety of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, whom, even in the hour of defeat, the fire allowed to pass unscathed? Or is it haply nearer the truth that, when <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was founded, orders were given to transfer the household gods to the new houses, and in changing homes the husbandmen set fire to their country houses and to the cottages they were about to abandon, and that they and their <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> leaped through the flames?

We have arrived at the foundation of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>City</a>. Great <a href=/people/773 target=_blank>Quirinus</a>, help me to sing thy deeds. Already the brother of <a href=/people/772 target=_blank>Numitor</a> had suffered punishment, and all the shepherd folk were subject to the twins. The twins agreed to draw the swains together and found a city; the doubt was which of the two should found it. <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> said, There needs no contest. Great faith is put in birds; let's try the birds. The proposal was accepted. One of the two betook him to the rocks of the wooded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LPal class=place long=12.4884 lat=41.8896>Palatine</a>; the other hied at morn to the top of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LAve class=place long=12.4792 lat=41.8835>Aventine</a>. <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a> saw six birds; <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> saw twice six, one after the other: they stood by their compact, and <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> was accorded the government of the city. A suitable day was chosen on which he should mark out the line of the walls with the plough. The festival of Pales was at hand; on that day the work began. A trench was dug down to the solid rock; fruits of the earth were thrown into the bottom of it, and with them earth fetched from the neighbouring soil. The trench was filled up with mould, and on the top was set an altar, and a fire was duly lit on a new hearth. Then pressing on the plough-handle he drew a furrow to mark out the line of the walls: the yoke was borne by a white <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a> and snow-white steer. The king spoke thus: O <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, and Father <a href=/people/2895 target=_blank>Mavors</a>, and Mother <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a>, stand by me as I found the city! O take heed, all ye gods whom piety bids summon! Under your auspices may this my fabric rise! May it enjoy long life and dominion over a conquered world! May East and West be subject unto it! So he prayed. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> vouchsafed omens by thunder on the left and lightnings flashing in the leftward sky. Glad at the augury, the citizens laid the foundations, and in short time the new wall stood. The work was urged on by <a href=/people/1743 target=_blank>Celer</a>, whom <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> himself had named and said, <a href=/people/1743 target=_blank>Celer</a>, be this thy are; let no man cross the walls nor the trench which the share hath made: who dares to do so, put him to death. Ignorant of this, <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a> began to mock the lowly walls and say, Shall these protect the people? And straightway he leaped across them. Instantly <a href=/people/1743 target=_blank>Celer</a> struck the rash man with a shovel. Covered with blood, <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a> sank on the stony ground. When the king heard of this, he smothered the springing tears and kept his grief locked up within his breast. He would not weep in public; he set an example of fortitude, and So fare, quoth he, the foe who shall cross my walls. Yet he granted funeral honours, and could no longer bear to check his tears, and the affection which he had dissembled was plain to see. When they set down the bier, he gave it a last kiss, and said, Snatched from they brother, loath to part, brother, farewell! With that he anointed the body before committing it to the flames. <a href=/people/12127 target=_blank>Faustulus</a> and <a href=/people/2488 target=_blank>Acca</a>, her mournful hair unbound, did the same. Then the Quirites, though not yet known by that name, wept for the youth, and last of all a light was put the pyre, wet with their tears. A city arose destined to set its victorious foot upon the neck of the whole earth; who at that time could have believed such a prophecy? Rule the universe, O <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and mayest thou often have several of that name, and whenso'er thou standest sublime in a conquered world, may all else reach not up to thy shoulders! </p>                        </div>

The <a href=/people/1141 target=_blank>Rutulians</a> consented. <a href=/people/1189 target=_blank>Mezentius</a> donned his arms, <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> donned them too, and thus he spoke to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>.

A flamen was on his way to the grove of ancient Mildew (Robigo), to throw the entrails of a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> and the entrails of a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> into the flames. Straightway I went up to him to inform myself of the rite. Thy flamen, O <a href=/people/773 target=_blank>Quirinus</a>, pronounced these words: Thou scaly Mildew, spare the sprouting corn, and let he smooth top quiver on the surface of the ground. O let the crops, nursed by the stars of a propitious sky, grow till they are ripe for the sickle. No feeble power is thine: the corn on which thou hast set thy mark, the sad husbandman gives up for lost. Nor winds, nor showers, nor glistening frost, that nips the sallow corn, harm it so much as when the sun warms the wet stalks; then, dread goddess, is the hour to wreak thy wrath. O spare, I pray, and take thy scabby hands from off the harvest! Harm not the tilth; 'tis enough that thou hast the power to harm. Grip not the tender crops, but rather grip the hard iron. Forestall the destroyer. Better that thou shouldst gnaw at swords and baneful weapons. There is no need of them: the world is at peace. Now let the rustic gear, the rakes, and the hard hoe, and the curved share be burnished bright; but let rust defile the arms, and when one essays to draw the sword from the scabbard, let him feel it stick from long disuse. But do not thou profane the corn, and ever may the husbandman be able to pay his vows to thee in thine absence. So he spoke. On his right hand hung a napkin with a loose nap, and he had a bowl of wine and a casket of incense. The incense, and wine, and <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>'s guts, and the foul entrails of a filthy <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, he put upon the hearth — we saw him do it. Then to me he said, Thou askest why an unwonted victim is assigned to these rites? Indeed, I had asked the question. Learn the cause, the flamen said.

Declare to me, ye who haunt the springs of Aganippian <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383230WHip class=place long=23.031 lat=38.319>Hippocrene</a>, those dear traces of the Medusaean steed. The goddesses disagreed; of them <a href=/people/5352 target=_blank>Polyhymnia</a> began the first; the others were silent, and noted her saying in their mind. After chaos, as soon as the three elements were given to the world, and the whole creation resolved itself into new species, the earth subsided by its own weight, and drew the seas after it, but the sky was borne to the highest regions by its own lightness; the sun, too, not checked by gravity, and the stars, and you, ye <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> of the moon, ye bounded high. But for a long time neither did <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> yield pride of place to Sky, nor did the other heavenly bodies to <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a>; their honours were all equal. Often someone of the common sort of gods would dare to sit upon the throne which thou, <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a>, didst own; not one of the upstart deities took the outer side of Ocean, and <a href=/people/554 target=_blank>Themis</a> was often relegated to the lowest place, until Honour and comely Reverence with her calm look united in lawful wedlock. From them sprang Majesty, them the goddess reckons her parents, she who became great on the very day she was born. Without delay she took her seat high in the midst of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a>, a golden figure far seen in purple vest. With her sat <a href=/people/2825 target=_blank>Modesty</a> and Fear. You might see every divinity modelling his aspect upon hers. Straightway respect for dignities made its way into their minds; the worthy got their due, and nobody though much of himself. This state of things in heaven lasted for many a year, till fate banished the elder god from heaven's citadel. <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> brought forth the <a href=/people/11034 target=_blank>Giants</a>, a fierce brood, enormous monsters, who durst assault <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>'s mansion; she gave them a thousand hands, and <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> for legs, and said, 'Take arms against the great gods.' They set themselves to pile up the mountains to the topmost stars and to harass great <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> in war. From heaven's citadel <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> hurled thunderbolts and turned the ponderous weights upon their movers. These weapons of the gods protected Majesty well; she survived and has been worshipped ever since. Hence she sits beside <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, she is <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>'s most faithful guardian: she assures to him his sceptre's peaceful tenure. She came also to earth. <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> and <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> worshipped her, and other after them, each in his time. She keeps fathers and mothers in honour due; she bears boys and maidens company; she enhances the lictor's rods and the ivory chair of office; she rides aloft in triumph on the festooned steeds. </p>                        </div>

Great was of old the reverence for the hoary head, and wrinkled eld was valued at its true worth. Martial exploits and doughty wars were work for youths, who in defence o their own gods kept watch and ward. In strength unequal, and for arms unfit, age often stood the country in good stead by its advice. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate-house</a> was then open only to men of mature years, and the very name of senate signifies a ripe old age. The elders legislated for the people, and certain laws defined the age at which office might be sought. An elder man used to walk between younger men, at which they did not repine, and if he had only one companion, the elder walked on the inner side. Who would dare to talk bawdy in the presence of an old man? Old age conferred a right of censorship. This <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> perceived, and on the men of his choice he bestowed the title of Fathers: on them the government of the new city was conferred. Hence I incline to think that the elders (maiores) gave their own name to the month of May: they considered the interests of their own class. And <a href=/people/772 target=_blank>Numitor</a> may have said, '<a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, grant this month to the old men,' and the grandson may not have been able to resist his grandsire.

Holy <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a> grieved that <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> had not needed her services when <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a> was born without a mother. She went to complain of her husband's doings to Ocean; tired by the journey, she halted at my door. As soon as I set eyes on her, 'What brings thee here,' I said, 'daughter of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a>?' She set forth her journey's goal, adding its reason. I consoled her with friendly words. 'My grief,' quoth she, 'is not to be assuaged with words. If <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> has become a father without the use of a wife, and unites both titles in his single person, why should I despair of becoming a mother without a husband, and of bringing forth without contact with a man, always supposing that I am chaste? I will try all the drugs in the wide world, and I will explore the seas and the depths of <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a>.' Her speech would have flowed on, but on my face there was a sudden look of doubt. 'Thou seemest, nymph,' said she, 'the to have some power to help me.' Thrice did I wish to promise help, but thrice my tongue was tied: the anger of great <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> filled me with fear. 'Help me, I pray,' she said, 'the helper's name will be kept secret, and I will call on the divinity of the Stygian water to be my witness.' 'Thy wish,' quoth I, 'will be accomplished by a flower that was sent me from the fields of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382216POle class=place long=21.6406 lat=38.1537>Olenus</a>. It is the only flower of the kind in my garden.' He who gave it me said, 'Touch also with this a barren heifer; she will be a mother.' I touched, and without delay she was a mother. Straightway I plucked with my thumb the clinging flower and touched <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>, and she conceived when it touched her bosom.

But she said, Thou art free to learn the answers to any questions thou mayest put. Say, goddess, I replied, what is the origin of the games. Scarce had I ended when she answered me. The other instruments of luxury were not yet in vogue: the rich man owned either <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> or broad lands; hence came the name for rich, and hence the name for money itself. But already some amassed wealth from unlawful sources: it had become a custom to graze the public pastures, the thing was suffered long, and no penalty was exacted. Common folk had no champion to protect their share in public property; and at last it was deemed the sign of a poor spirit in a man to graze his <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> on his own land. Such licence was brought to the notice of the plebeian aediles, the Publicii; till then men's hearts had failed them. The case was tried before the people: the guilty were fined: the champions were praised for their public spirit. Part of the fine was given to me; and the winners of the suit instituted new games with great applause. With part of the fine they contracted for making a way up the slope, which then was a steep rock: now it is a serviceable road, and they call it the Publician road. </p>                        </div>

We, too, are touched by honour; we delight in festivals and altars; we heavenly beings are a greedy gang. Often by sinning has a man disposed the gods against him, and a sacrificial victim has been a sop for crimes. Often have I seen <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, when he was just about to launch his thunderbolts, hold his hand on the receipt of incense. But if we are neglected, we avenge the wrong by heavenly penalties, and our wrath exceeds just bounds. Remember Thestiades: he was burnt by flames afar; the reason was that no fire blazed on <a href=/people/1280 target=_blank>Phoebe</a>'s altar.

'Twere long to tell of cases of forgetfulness redressed by forfeitures. I myself was once neglected by the Roman senate. What was I to do? By what could I show my resentment? What punishment exact for the slight put on me? In my gloom I relinquished my office. I guarded no the countryside, and the fruitful garden was naught to me. The lilies had dropped; you might see the violets withering, and the tendrils of the crimson saffron languishing. Often Zephry said to me, 'Spoil not thine own dowry.' But my dowry was worthless in my sight. The olive-trees were in blossom; the wanton winds blighted them: the crops were in blossom; the crop was blasted by the hail: the vines were promising; the sky grew black under the south wind, and the leaves were shaken down by a sudden shower. I did not will it so, nor am I cruel in my anger; but I did not care to ward of these ills. The senate assembled and voted an annual festival to my divinity if the year should prove fruitful. I accepted the vow. The consuls <a href=/people/2321 target=_blank>Laenas</a> and <a href=/people/419 target=_blank>Postumius</a> celebrated the games which had been vowed to me. </p>                        </div>

The brows of wassailers are wreathed with stitched garlands, and the polished table is buried under a shower of roses. Maudlin the guest dances, his hair bound with linden bark, and all unwitting plies the tipsy art. Maudlin the lover sings at the hard threshold of his lady fair: soft garlands crown his perfumed locks. No serious business does he do whose brow is garlanded; no water of the running brook is quaffed by such as twine their hair with flowers: so long s they stream, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383211WAch class=place long=21.1067 lat=38.3388>Achelous</a>, was dashed with no juice of grapes, none cared to pluck the rose. <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a> loves flowers; that he delights in a floral crown, you may know from <a href=/people/421 target=_blank>Ariadne</a>'s clustered stars.

She is none of your glum, none of your high-flown ones: she wishes her rites to be open to the common herd; and she warns us to use life's flower, while it still blooms: for the thorn, she reminds us, is flouted when the roses have fallen away. </p>                        </div>

The year was formerly shorter, and the pious rites of purification (februa) were unknown, and thou, two-headed <a href=/people/983 target=_blank>Janus</a>, wast not the leader of the months. Yet even then people brought gifts to the ashes of the dead, as their due, and the grandson paid his respects to the tomb of his buried grandsire. It was the month of May, so named after our forefathers (maiores), and it still retains part of the ancient custom. When midnight has come and lends silence to sleep, and <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> and all ye varied fowls are hushed, the worshipper who bears the olden rite in mind and fears the gods arises; no knots constrict his feet; and he makes a sign with his thumb in the middle of his closed fingers, lest in his silence an unsubstantial shade should meet him. And after washing his hands clean in spring water, he turns, and first he receives black beans and throws them away with face averted; but while he throws them, he says: These I cast; with these beans I redeem me and min. This he says nine times, without looking back: the shade is thought to gather the beans, and to follow unseen behind. Again he touches water, and clashes <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390162UTem class=demonym long=16.159 lat=39.035>Temesan</a> bronze, and asks the shade to go out of his house.

Son of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiad</a>, thou reverend master of the puissant wand, inform me: oft hast thou seen the palace of the Stygian <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>. At my prayer the Bearer of the Herald's Staff (Caducifer) was come. Learn the cause of the name; the god himself made it known. When <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> had buried his brother's ghost in the grave, and the obsequies had been paid to the too nimble <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a>, unhappy <a href=/people/12127 target=_blank>Faustulus</a> and <a href=/people/2488 target=_blank>Acca</a>, with streaming hair, sprinkled the burnt bones with their tears. Then at twilight's fall they sadly took the homeward way, and flung themselves on their hard couch, just as it was. The gory ghost of <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a> seemed to stand at the bedside and to speak these words in a faint murmur: Look on me, who shared the half, the full half of your tender care, behold what I am come to, and what I was of late! A little while ago I might have been the foremost of my people, if but the birds had assigned the throne to me. Now I am an empty wrath, escaped from the flames of the pyre; that is all that remains of the once great <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a>. Alas, where is my father <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>? If only you spoke the truth, and it was he who sent the wild beast's dugs to suckle the abandoned babes. A citizen's rash hand undid him whom the she-<a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> saved; O how far more merciful was she! Ferocious <a href=/people/1743 target=_blank>Celer</a>, mayest thou yield up thy cruel soul through wounds, and pass like me all bloody underneath the earth! My brother willed not this: his love's a match for mine: he let fall upon my death — 'twas all he could — his tears. Pray him by your tears, by your fosterage, that he would celebrate a day by signal honour done to me. As the ghost gave this charge, they yearned to embrace him and stretched forth their arms; the slippery shade escaped the clasping hands. When the vision fled and carried slumber with it, the pair reported to the king his brother's words. <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> complied, and gave the name Remuria to the day on which due worship is paid to buried ancestors. In the course of ages the rough letter, which stood at the beginning of the name, was changed into the smooth; and soon the souls of the silent multitude were also called Lemures: that is the meaning of the word, that is the force of the expression. But the ancients shut the temples on these days, as even now you see them closed at the season sacred to the dead. The times are unsuitable for the marriage both of a widow and a maid: she who marries then, will not live long. For the same reason, if you give weight to proverbs, the people say bad women wed in May. But these three festivals fall about the same time, though not on three consecutive days. </p>                        </div>

I must now sing of the cause of the constellation. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, and his brother who reigns in the deep sea, and <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a>, were journeying together. It was the time when the yoked <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>kine</a> draw home the upturned plough, and the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a> lies down and drinks the milk of the full ewe. An old man <a href=/people/2476 target=_blank>Hyrieus</a>, who cultivated a tiny farm, chanced to see them as he stood before his little cottage; and thus he spoke: Long is the way, but short the hours of daylight left, and my door is open to strangers. He enforced his words by a look, and again invited them. They accepted the offer and dissembled their divinity. They passed beneath the old man's roof, begrimed with black smoke; a little fire was glimmering in the log of yesterday. He knelt and blew up the flames with his breath, and drawing forth the stumps of torches he chopped them up. Two pipkins stood on the fire; the lesser contained beans, the other kitchen herbs; both boiled, each under the pressure of its lid. While he waited, he served out red wine with shaky hand. The god of the sea received the first cup. When he had drained it, Now serve the drink, said he, to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> in order. At the word <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> the old man paled. When he recovered himself, he sacrificed the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> that ploughed his poor land, and he roasted it in a great fire; and the wine which s a boy he had laid up in his early years, he brought forth stored in its smoky jar. And straightway they reclined on mattresses stuffed with river sedge and covered with linen, but lowly still. The table shone, now with the viands, now with the wine set down on it: the bowl was of red earthenware, the cups were beechen wood. Quoth <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>: If thou has any fancy, choose: all will be thine. The clam old man thus spoke: I had a dear wife, whose love I won in the flower of early youth. Where is she now? you ask. The urn her ashes holds. To her I swore, an called you gods to witness, 'Thou shalt be my only spouse.' I gave my word, and I keep it. But a different wish is mine: I would be, not a husband, but a father. All the gods assented; all took their stand at the bullock's hide — I am ashamed to describe what followed — then they covered the reeking hide by throwing earth on it: when ten months had passed, a boy was born. Him <a href=/people/2476 target=_blank>Hyrieus</a> called Urion on account of the mode of his begetting: the first letter of his name has lost its ancient sound. He grew to an enormous size; the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253SSan class=demonym long=25.2666 lat=37.4004>Delian</a> goddess took him to be her companion; he was her guardian, he her attendant. Heedless words excite the wrath of gods. There is no wild beast, said he, which I cannot master. <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> egged on a scorpion: its mission was to attack the Goddess Mother of Twins with its hooked fangs. <a href=/people/297 target=_blank>Orion</a> threw himself in the way. <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Latona</a> set him among the shining stars, and said, Take thy well-earned reward. </p>                        </div>

I err not, there was a clash of arms, <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> comes, and at his coming he gave the sign of war. The Avenger descends himself from heaven to behold his own honours and his splendid <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SMUl class=place long=12.4869 lat=41.8942>temple</a> in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFAu class=place long=12.4869 lat=41.8944>forum</a> of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>. The god is huge, and so is the structure: no otherwise ought <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> to dwell in his son's city. That shrine is worthy of trophies won from giants; from its might the Marching God fitly open his fierce campaigns, whether an impious foe shall assail us from the eastern world or whether another will have to be vanquished where the sun goes down. The god of arms surveys the pinnacles of the lofty edifice, and approves that the highest places should be filled by the unconquered gods. He surveys on the doors weapons of diverse shapes, and arms of lands subdued by his soldiery. On this side he sees <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> laden with his dear burden, and many an ancestor of the noble <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a> line. On the other side he sees <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> carrying on his shoulders the arms of the conquered leader, and their famous deeds inscribed beneath the statues arranged in order. He beholds, too, the name of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> on the front of the temple; and the building seems to him still greater, when he reads the name of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar Augustus</a> has vowed it in his youth at the time when he took up arms in duty's cause. Deeds so great were worthy to inaugurate a prince's reign. While the loyal troops stood on the one side, and the conspirators on the other, he stretched forth his hands and spoke these words: If my father, <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a>'s priest, is my warrant for waging war, and I do now prepare to avenge both his divinity and hers, come, <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, and glut the sword with knavish blood, and grant thy favour to the better cause. Thou shalt receive a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SMUl class=place long=12.4869 lat=41.8942>temple</a>, and shalt be called Avenger, when victory is mine. So he vowed, and returned rejoicing from the routing of the foe. Nor is he content to have earned once for all the surname of Avenger for <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>: he tracks down the standards detained by the hands of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>. These were a nation whom their plains, their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and their arrows rendered safe, and surrounding rivers made inaccessible. The pride of the nation had been fostered by the deaths of <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> and his son, when soldiers, general, and standards perished together. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> kept the Roman standards, the glory of war, and a foe was the standard-bearer of the Roman <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>. That shame would have endured till now, had not Ausonia's empire been guarded by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s powerful arms. He put an end to the old reproach, to the disgrace of the whole generation: the recovered standards knew their true owners again. What now availed thee, thou <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a>, the arrows thou art wont to shoot behind thy back? What availed thy deserts?

When thou shalt see, he answered, that as many days of the month remain over as are the labours of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>. Tell me, I replied, the cause of this constellation. The god in answer explained the cause in eloquent speech. The brother Tyndarids, the one a horseman, the other a boxer, had ravished and carried away <a href=/people/1280 target=_blank>Phoebe</a> and <a href=/people/1280 target=_blank>Phoebe</a>'s sister. <a href=/people/719 target=_blank>Idas</a> and his brother prepare for war and demand the restitution of their brides; for both of them had convenanted with <a href=/people/935 target=_blank>Leucippus</a> to be his sons-in-law. <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a> prompts the one pair to demand the restitution of their brides; for both of them had covenanted with <a href=/people/935 target=_blank>Leucippus</a> to be his sons-in-law. <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a> prompts the one pair to demand the restitution, the other to refuse it; each pair is spurred on to fight by the like motive. The Oibalids might have escaped their pursuers by superior speed; but it seemed base to win by rapid flight. There is a place free from trees, a suitable ground for a fight: in that place they took their stand (its name is <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381239DAph class=place long=23.8792 lat=38.1871>Aphidna</a>). Pierced through the breast by the sword of Lycneus — a wound he had not looked for — <a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a> fell to the ground. <a href=/people/327 target=_blank>Pollux</a> comes up to avenge him, and runs <a href=/people/6078 target=_blank>Lynceus</a> through with his spear at the point where the neck joins on to and presses upon the shoulders. <a href=/people/719 target=_blank>Idas</a> attacked him, and scarcely was repulsed by the fire of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>; yet they say that his weapon was not wrested from his right hand by the thunderbolt. And already the lofty heavens opened its door for thee, <a href=/people/327 target=_blank>Pollux</a>, when thou sadist, Hear my words, O Father. The heaven that thou dost give to me alone, O share between us two; one-half the gift will be greater than the whole.

Of these there was one, the sister of her husband: she it was, I recognized, who stands within <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>'s citadel. I shivered, and, speechless though I was, my pallid hue betrayed my feeling; then the goddess herself removed the fears she had inspired. For she said, O poet, minstrel of the Roman year, thou who hast dared to chronicle great things in slender couplets, thou hast won for thyself the right to look upon a celestial divinity by undertaking to celebrate the festivals in thy numbers. But lest thou should be ignorant and led astray by vulgar error, know that June takes its name from mine. It is something to have married <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> and to be <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>'s sister. I know not whether I am prouder of him as brother or as husband. If descent is considered, I was the first to call <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a> by the name of father: I was the first child whom fate bestowed on him. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was once named <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427115UAur class=place long=11.5048 lat=42.6662>Saturnia</a> after my sire: this land was the next he came to after heaven. If the marriage-bed counts for much, I am called the consort of the Thunderer, and my temple is joined to that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LTrp class=person long=12.4815 lat=41.8914>Tarpeian</a> <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>. If a leman could give her name to the month of May, shall a like honour be grudged to me? To what purpose, then, am I called Queen and chief of goddesses? Why did they put a golden sceptre in my right hand? Shall the days (luces) make up a month and I be called <a href=/people/1705 target=_blank>Lucina</a> after them, and yet shall I take a name from not a single month? Then indeed might I repent of having loyally laid aside my anger at the offspring of <a href=/people/388 target=_blank>Electra</a> and the Dardanian house. I had a double cause of anger: I fretted at the rape of <a href=/people/1283 target=_blank>Ganymede</a>, and my beauty was misprized by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352248LIda class=demonym long=24.7708 lat=35.2263>Idaean</a> judge. It might repent me that I cherish not the battlements of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, since my chariot and arms are there.

Nevertheless it is not <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> alone that does me that honour: the inhabitants of neighbouring towns pay me the same compliment.

She is the goddess of the hinge: by her divine power she opens what is closed, and closes what is open.

Near to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> lies an ancient grove of <a href=/people/8761 target=_blank>Alernus</a>; the pontiffs still bring sacrifices thither. There a nymph was born (men of old named her <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368226IKra class=place long=22.5736 lat=36.7543>Cranae</a>), often wooed in vain by many suitors. Her wont it was to scour the countryside and chase the wild beasts with her darts, and in the hollow vale to stretch the knotty nets. No quiver had she, yet they thought that she was <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a>' sister; and, <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a>, thou needst not have been ashamed of her. If any youth spoke to her words of love, she straightway made him this answer: In this place there is too much of light, and with the light too much of shame; if thou wilt lead to a more retired cave, I'll follow. While he confidingly went in front, she no sooner reached the bushes than she halted, and hid herself, and was nowise to be found. <a href=/people/983 target=_blank>Janus</a> had seen her, and the sight had roused his passion; to the hard-hearted nymph he used soft words. The nymph as usual bade him seek a more sequestered cave, and she pretended to follow at his heels, but deserted her leader. Fond fool! <a href=/people/983 target=_blank>Janus</a> sees what goes on behind his back; vain is thine effort; he sees thy hiding-place behind him. Vain is thine effort, lo! said I. For he caught thee in his embrace as thou didst lurk beneath a rock, and having worked his will he said: In return for our dalliance be thine the control of hinges; take that for the price of thy lost maidenhood. So saying, he gave her a thorn — and white it was — wherewith she could repel all doleful harm from doors. </p>                        </div>

Big is their head, goggle their eyes, their beaks are formed for rapine, their feathers blotched with grey, their claws fitted with hooks. They fly by night and attack nurseless children, and defile their bodies, snatched from their cradles. They are said to rend the flesh of sucklings with their beaks, and their throats are full of the blood which they have drunk. Screech-<a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a> is their name, but the reason of the name is that they are wont to screech horribly by night. Whether, therefore, they are born birds, or are made such by enchantment and are nothing but beldames transformed into fowls by a <a href=/people/1401 target=_blank>Marsian</a> spell, they came into the chambers of <a href=/people/4279 target=_blank>Proca</a>. In the chambers <a href=/people/4279 target=_blank>Proca</a>, a child five days old, was a fresh prey for the birds. They sucked the infant with their greedy tongues, and the poor child squalled and craved help. Alarmed by the cry of her fosterling, the nurse ran to him and found his cheeks scored by their rigid claws. What was she to do? The colour of the child's face was like the common hue of late leaves nipped by an early frost. She went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368226IKra class=place long=22.5736 lat=36.7543>Cranae</a> and told what had befallen. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368226IKra class=place long=22.5736 lat=36.7543>Cranae</a> said, Lay fear aside; thy nursling will be safe. She went to the cradle; mother and father were weeping. Restrain your tears, she said, I myself will heal the child. Straightway she thrice touched the doorposts, one after the other, with arbutus leaves; thrice with arbutus leaves she marked the threshold. She sprinkled the entrance with water (and the water was drugged), and she held the raw inwards of a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> just two months old. And thus she spoke: Ye birds of night, spare the child's inwards: a small victim falls for a small child. Take, I pray ye, a heart for a heart, entrails for entrails. This life we give you for a better life. When she had thus sacrificed, she set the severed inwards in the open air, and forbade those present at the sacrifice to look back at them. A rod of <a href=/people/983 target=_blank>Janus</a>, taken from the white-thorn, was placed where a small window gave light to the chambers. After that, it is said that the birds did not violate the cradle, and the boy recovered his former colour. </p>                        </div>

In thy service now ope my lips, if it is lawful for me to come to thy sacred rites. I was wrapt up in prayer; I felt the heavenly deity, and the glad ground gleamed with a purple light. Not indeed that I saw thee, O goddess (far from me be the lies of poets!), nor was it meet that a man should look upon thee; but my ignorance was enlightened and my errors corrected without the help of an instructor. They say that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> had forty times celebrated the <a href=/people/3225 target=_blank>Parilia</a> when the goddess, Guardian of Fire, was received in her <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SVes class=place long=12.48621 lat=41.89171>temple</a>; it was the work of that peaceful king, than whom no man of more god-fearing temper was ever born in <a href=/people/11083 target=_blank>Sabine</a> land. The buildings which now you see roofed with bronze you might then have seen roofed with thatch, and the walls were woven of tough osiers. This little spot, which now supports the Hall of <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a>, was then the great palace of unshorn <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a>. Yet the shape of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SVes class=place long=12.48621 lat=41.89171>temple</a>, as it now exists, is said to have been its shape of old, and it is based on a sound reason. <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a> is the same as the <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>; under both of them is a perpetual fire; the earth and the hearth are symbols of the home. The earth is like a ball, resting on no prop; so great a weight hangs on the air beneath it. Its own power of rotation keeps its orb balanced; it has no angle which could press on any part; and since it is placed in the middle of the world and touches no side more or less, if it were not convex, it would be nearer to some part than to another, and the universe would not have the earth as its central weight. There stands a globe hung by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=demonym long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracusan</a> art in closed air, a small image of the vast vault of heaven, and the earth is equally distant from the top and bottom. That is brought about by its round shape. The form of the temple is similar: there is no projecting angle in it; a dome protects it from the showers of rain. </p>                        </div>

The other two married; both are reported to have had offspring; of the three one remained, who refused to submit to a husband. What wonder if a virgin delights in a virgin minister and allows only chaste hands to touch her sacred things? Conceive of <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a> as naught but the living flame, and you see that no bodies are born of flame.

But the hearth (focus) is so named from the flames, and because it fosters (fovet) all things; yet formerly it stood in the first room of the house. Hence, too, I am of opinion that the vestibule took its name; it is from there that in praying we begin by addressing <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a>, who occupies the first place: it used to be the custom of old to sit on long benches in front of the hearth and to suppose that the gods were present at the table; even now, when sacrifices are offered to ancient <a href=/people/10468 target=_blank>Vacuna</a>, they stand and sit in front of her hearths.

Lo, loaves are hung on <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> decked with wreaths, and flowery garlands veil the rough millstones. Husbandmen used formerly to toast only spelt in the ovens, and the goddess of ovens has her own sacred rites: the hearth of itself baked the bread that was put under the ashes, and a broken tile was laid on the warm floor.

She invited all the satyrs and those rural divinities, the nymphs. <a href=/people/344 target=_blank>Silenus</a> came, though nobody had asked him. It is unlawful, and it would be tedious, to narrate the banquet of the gods: the livelong night was passed in deep potations.

But the ruddy guardian of gardens courted nymphs and goddesses, and to and fro he turned his roving steps. He spied <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a> too; it is doubtful whether he took her for a nymph or knew her to be <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a>; he himself said that he knew her not. He conceived a wanton hope, and tried to approach her furtively; he walked on tiptoe with throbbing heart. It chanced that old <a href=/people/344 target=_blank>Silenus</a> had left the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>, on which he rode, on the banks of a babbling brook.

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> was surrounded and hard pressed by fierce Gauls: the long siege had already caused a famine. Having summoned the celestial gods to his royal throne, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> said to <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, Begin. Straightway <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> made answer, Forsooth, nobody knows the plight of my people, and this my sorrow needs to find utterance in complaint. But if thou dost require me to declare in brief the sad and shameful tale: <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> lies at the foot of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=demonym long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alpine</a> foe.

Already she had crushed her neighbours and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Etruscan</a> hosts. <a href=/people/1068 target=_blank>Hope</a> was in full career, but now she is driven from her own hearth and home. We have seen old men decked in embroidered robes — the symbol of the triumphs they had won — cut down within their bronze-lined halls. We have seen the pledges of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=person long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilian</a> <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a> removed from their proper seat: plainly the Romans think that some gods exist. But if they were to look back to the citadel in which ye dwell, and to see so many of your homes beleaguered, they would know that the worship of the gods is of no avail, and that incense offered by an anxious hand is thrown away. And would that they could find a clear field of battle! Let them take arms, and, if they cannot conquer, then let them fall! As it is, starving and dreading a coward's death, they are shut up and pressed hard on their own hill by a barbarous mob. Then <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> and <a href=/people/773 target=_blank>Quirinus</a>, in the pomp of augur's staff and striped gown, and <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a> pleaded hard for their own <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=place long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latium</a>. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> replied, A general providence is charged with the defence of yonder walls. Gaul will be vanquished and will pay the penalty. Only do thou, <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a>, look to it that the corn which is lacking may be thought to abound, and do not abandon thy proper seat. Let all the grain that is yet unground be crushed in the hollow mill, let it be kneaded by hand and roasted by fire in the oven. So <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> commanded, and the virgin daughter of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a> assented to her brother's command, the time being the hour of midnight. Now sleep had overcome the wearied leaders. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> chode them, and with his sacred lips informed them of his will. Arise and from the topmost battlements cast into the midst of the foe the last resource which ye would wish to yield. <a href=/people/422 target=_blank>Sleep</a> left them, and moved by the strange riddle they inquired what resource they were bidden to yield against their will. They thought it must be corn. They threw down the gifts of the Corn-goddess, which, in falling, clattered upon the helmets and the long shields of the foe. The hope that the citadel could be reduced by famine now vanished: the enemy was repulsed and a white altar set up to Baker <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>. </p>                        </div>

Hence <a href=/people/528 target=_blank>Athamas</a> was haunted by the furies and by a delusive vision, and little <a href=/people/3620 target=_blank>Learchus</a>, thou didst fall by thy father's hand.

A brief pause ensued, and then the prophetess assumed her heavenly powers, and all her bosom swelled with majesty divine.

While the goddess timidly confessed her furtive love, and blushed to think that as a celestial being she should made with a mere man (for she burned with a deep, an overmastering passion for the king, and he was the only man for whom she was not blind), she was wont to enter his house by a small window (fenestra); hence the gate bears the name of Fenestella (the Little Window). To this day she is ashamed and hides the loved features beneath a veil, and the king's face is covered by many a robe. Or is the truth rather that after the murder of <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> the common folk were bewildered by the death of the gentle chief, there were no bounds to their grief, and their sorrow increased with the sight of his statue, until they hid him by putting robes on him? </p>                        </div>

Having accomplished her marriage by means of crime, <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a> used to incite her husband by these words: What boots is that we are will matched, thou by my sister's murder, and I by thy brother's, if we are content to lead a life of virtue? Better that my husband and thy wife had lived, if we do not dare attempt some greater enterprise. I offer as my dower the head and kingdom of my father: if thou art a man, go to, exact the promised dower. Crime is a thing for kings. Kill thy wife's father and seize the kingdom, and dye our hands in my sire's blood. Instigated by such words, he, private man though he was, took his seat upon the lofty throne; the mob, astounded, rushed to arms. Hence blood and slaughter, and the weak old man was overpowered: his son-in-law (<a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquin</a>) the Proud snatched the sceptre from his father-in-law. <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> himself, at the foot of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LEsq class=place long=12.496 lat=41.895>Esquiline</a> hill, where was his palace, fell murdered and bleeding on the hard ground. Driving in a coach to her father's home, his daughter passed along the middle of the streets, erect and haughty. When he saw her father's corpse, the driver burst into tears and drew up. She chode him in these terms: Wilt thou go on, or dost thou wait to reap the bitter fruit of this thy loyalty? Drive, I say, the reluctant wheels across his very face! A sure proof of the deed is the name of the street called Wicked after her; the event is branded with eternal infamy. Yet after that she dared to touch the temple, her father's monument: strange but true the tale I'll tell. There was a statue seated on a throne in the likeness of <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>: it is aid to have put its hand to its eyes, and a voice was heard, Hide my face, lest it should see the execrable visage of my own daughter. The statue was covered by a robe lent for the purpose: <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> forbade the garment to be moved, and thus she spoke from her own temple: That day on which the statue of <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> shall be laid bare by unmuffling his face will be the first day of modesty cast to the winds. Ye matrons, refrain from touching the forbidden garments; enough it is to utter prayers in solemn tones. Let him who was the seventh king in our city always keep his head covered with Roman drapery. This temple was once burnt, yet the fire spared the statue: <a href=/people/3212 target=_blank>Mulciber</a> himself rescued his son. For the father of <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> was <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Vulcan</a>, his mother was the beautiful <a href=/people/4630 target=_blank>Ocresia</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420127UCor class=place long=12.74281 lat=42.02348>Corniculum</a>. After performing with her the sacred rites in due form, <a href=/people/3257 target=_blank>Tanaquil</a> ordered <a href=/people/4630 target=_blank>Ocresia</a> to pour wine on the hearth, which had been adorned. There among the ashes there was, or seemed to be, the shape of the male organ; but rather the shape was really there. Ordered by her mistress, the captive <a href=/people/4630 target=_blank>Ocresia</a> sat down at the hearth. She conceived <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>, who thus was begotten of seed from heaven. His begetter gave a token of his paternity when he touched the head of <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> with gleaming fire, and when on the king's hair there blazed a cap of flame. </p>                        </div>

Now favour my undertaking, thou yellow-haired <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>. Why does the flute-player march at large through the whole City? What mean the masks? What means the long gown? So did I speak, and thus did Tritonia answer me, when she had laid aside her spear — would that I could report the very words of the learned goddess! In the times of your ancestors of yore the flute-player was much employed and was always held in great honour. The flute played in temples, it played at games, it played at mournful funerals. The labour was sweetened by its reward; but a time followed which of a sudden broke the practice of the pleasing art. Moreover, the aedile had ordered that the musicians who accompanied funeral processions should be ten, no more. The flute-players went into exile from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>City</a> and retired to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a>: once upon a time <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a> was a place of exile! The hollow flute was missed in the theatre, missed at the altars; no dirge accompanied the bier on the last march. At <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a> there was a certain man who had been a slave, but had long been free, a man worthy of any rank. In his country place he made ready a banquet and invited the tuneful throng; they gathered to the festal board. It was night, and their eyes and heads swam with wine, when a messenger arrived with a made-up tale, and thus he spoke (to the freedman): 'Break up the banquet without delay, for see here comes the master of thy rod!' Immediately the guests bestirred their limbs, reeling with heady wine; their shaky legs or stood or slipped. But the master of the house, 'Off with you all!' says he, and when they dawdled he packed them in a wain that was well lined with rushes. The time, the motion, and the wine allured to slumber, and the tipsy crew fancied that they were on their way back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a>. And now the wain had entered the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPEq class=place long=12.5014 lat=41.8958>Esquiline</a>, and at morn it stood in the middle of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a>. In order to deceive the Senate as to their persons and their number, <a href=/people/2183 target=_blank>Plautius</a> commanded that their faces should be covered with masks; and he mingled others with them and ordered them to wear long garments, to the end that women flute-players might be added to the band. In that way he thought that the return of the exiles could be best concealed, lest they should be censured for having come back against the orders of their guild. The plan was approved, and now they are allowed to wear their new garb on the Ides and to sing merry words to the old tunes. </p>                        </div>

A festival of mine, quoth she, is celebrated under that name in the month of March, and among my inventions is also the guild of flute-players. I was the first, by piercing boxwood with holes wide apart, to produce the music of the long flute. The sound was pleasing; but in the water that reflected my face I saw my virgin cheeks puffed up. 'I value not the art so high; farewell, my flute!' said I, and threw it away; it fell on the turf of the river-bank. A satyr found it and at first beheld it with wonder; he knew not its use, but perceived that, when he blew into it, the flute gave forth a note, and with the help of his fingers he alternately let out and kept in his breath. And now he bragged of his skill among the nymphs and challenged <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a>; but, vanquished by <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a>, he was hanged and his body flayed of its skin.

KAL. 30th Tomorrow is the birthday of the Kalends of July. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402225RPie class=place long=22.5 lat=40.2>Pierides</a>, put the last touches to my undertaking. Tell me, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402225RPie class=place long=22.5 lat=40.2>Pierides</a>, who associated you with him to whom his stepmother was forced to yield reluctantly. So I spoke, and <a href=/people/2195 target=_blank>Clio</a> answered me thus: Thou dost behold the monument of that famous <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> from whom the chaste <a href=/people/2633 target=_blank>Marcia</a> is descended, <a href=/people/2633 target=_blank>Marcia</a> who derives her name from sacrificial <a href=/people/12006 target=_blank>Ancus</a>, and whose beauty matches her noble birth. In her the figure answers to the soul; in her we find lineage and beauty and genius all at once. Nor deem our praise of figure base; on the same ground we praise great goddesses. The mother's sister of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was once married to that <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>. O florious dame! O lady worthy of that sacred house! So <a href=/people/2195 target=_blank>Clio</a> sang. Her learned sisters chimed in; <a href=/people/12214 target=_blank>Alcides</a> bowed assent and twanged his lyre. </p>                        </div>
