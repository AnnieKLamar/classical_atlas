You’re safe regarding time. <br />Fine-spun verses come from a tranquil mind: <br />my days are clouded by sudden miseries. <br />Verse asks for a writer with leisure and privacy: <br />I’m tossed by winter gales, the storms, the sea. <br />Every fear harms verse: I’m lost and always <br />afraid of a sword slicing at my throat. <br />Even what I’ve created, will amaze just critics: <br />they’ll read it, whatever it is, with indulgence. <br />Set <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388283RMai class=demonym long=28 lat=38.6>Maeonian</a>, in such danger, <br />his genius would fail among such troubles. <br />Go then, book, untroubled by fame, <br />don’t be ashamed to displease the reader. <br /><a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>’s not so kind to me now <br />for you to take account of any praise. <br />Secure, I was touched by desire for fame, <br />and I burned with ardour to win a name. <br />Enough now if I don’t hate those studies, verses <br />that hurt me, so that wit brought me exile. <br />You go for me, you, who can, gaze at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. <br />If the gods could grant now that I were my book! <br />And because you’re a foreigner in a mighty city <br />don’t think you come as a stranger to the crowd. <br />Though you lack a title, they’ll know the style: <br />though wishing to deceive, it’s clear you’re mine. <br />But enter quietly so my verse won’t hurt you, <br />it’s not as popular as once it was. <br />If anyone thinks you shouldn’t be read <br />because you’re mine, and thrusts you away, <br />say: ‘Look at the title: I’m not love’s master: <br />that work’s already got what it deserved.’ </p>                        </div>

I’ll be alive here at the end <br />of the earth, in a land that’s far away from my land. </p>                        </div>

What mountains of water churn! <br />Now, now you think they’ll touch the highest stars. <br />What abysses sink beneath the yawning flood! <br />Now, now you think they’ll touch black <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a>. <br />Wherever I look there’s nothing but sea or air, <br />here swollen waves, there threatening cloud, <br />between, the roar and humming of the winds. <br />The ocean waves don’t know what lord to obey. <br />Now <a href=/people/1548 target=_blank>Eurus</a> storms in power from the purple east, <br />now <a href=/people/444 target=_blank>Zephyrus</a> rushes in from late evening, <br />Now frozen <a href=/people/208 target=_blank>Boreas</a> raves from dry polar stars, <br />now <a href=/people/2367 target=_blank>Notus</a> wars with his opposing brow. <br />The helmsman’s unsure of what to shun or where <br />to steer for: his art is baffled by uncertain evils. <br />Surely we’re done for, there’s no hope of safety, <br />while I speak the waves drench my face. <br />The breakers will crush this life of mine, with lips <br />praying in vain, I’ll swallow the fatal waters. <br />But my loyal wife grieves only for my exile: <br />it’s the only ill of mine she knows, and groans at. <br />She doesn’t see me hurled through the vast seas, <br />pursued by the winds, she doesn’t see death nearing. <br />It’s good that I didn’t allow her to ship with me, <br />or I, poor wretch, would endure a double death! <br />Now, though I die, since she is free from danger, <br />at least the other half of me will survive. <br />Ah! What a swift flame flashes from the cloud! <br />What a mighty crash resounds from the ether! <br />The blow on her planks from the waves is no less <br />than a siege-gun’s heavy thud against the walls. <br />Here comes a wave that overtops them all: <br />after the ninth and before the eleventh. <br />I don’t fear dying: but this way of dying’s wretched. <br />Save me from drowning, and death will be a blessing. <br />A natural death or dying under the blade, at least <br />your body rests on the solid ground, as you ebb, <br />and there are requests to others, and hope of a tomb, <br />not to be food for the fishes in the ocean. <br />Assume I deserve such a death, I’m not the only <br />traveller here.

Sweet love of country held me, <br />but this was the last night before my decreed exile. <br />Ah! How often I spoke as someone hastened by: <br />‘Why hurry? Think where and whence you’re hurrying.’ <br />Ah! How often I said, deceptively, I’d a set time, <br />an appropriate one for my intended journey. <br />I touched the threshold three times, was called back <br />three times, even my feet slow to match my intent. <br />Often, having said ‘Farewell’, I spoke again at length, <br />and, as if I was going, I gave the last kisses. <br />Often I gave the same orders, and deceived myself, <br />eyes turning back towards my dear ones. <br />At last I said: ‘Why hurry? I’m off to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a>, <br />I’m leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>.

This hour given me is so much gained.’ <br />No more delay, I left my words unfinished, <br />and embraced each one dear to my heart. <br />While I spoke and we wept, <a href=/people/11021 target=_blank>Lucifer</a> had risen, <br />brightest in the high heavens, baleful star to me. <br />I was torn, as though I had left my limbs behind, <br />and half seemed severed from my body. <br />So Mettus grieved when, punishing his treachery, <br />the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> were driven in different directions. <br />Then truly the groans and cries of my people rose, <br />and grieving hands beat on naked breasts. <br />Then truly my wife, clinging to me at parting, <br />mingled these sad words amongst my tears: <br />‘I can’t be separated. Together, we’ll go together. <br />I’ll follow you and be an exile’s wife in exile. <br />There’s a path for me too, the far off land will take me: <br />my going will add little weight to your fleeing ship. <br /><a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>’s anger drives you to leave your country, <br />loyalty orders me. Loyalty will be my <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>.’ <br />So she tried, as she had tried before, <br />and, with difficulty, ceased trying for my sake. <br />I went, like one carried off before his funeral, <br />bedraggled, hair straggling over unshaven cheeks. <br />Maddened by grief they say she was overcome <br />by darkness, and fell half-dead in the midst of the room, <br />and when she rose, hair fouled with filthy dust, <br />and lifted her body from the cold ground, <br />she wept for herself, and the deserted <a href=/people/12190 target=_blank>Penates</a>, <br />and often called her lost husband’s name, <br />groaning no less than if she’d seen the bodies <br />of her daughter and me, on the stacked pyre, <br />and wanted to die, to end those feelings by dying, <br />yet out of care for me she did not die. <br />May she live, and, since the fates have willed my absence, <br />live so as always to help me with her aid. </p>                        </div>

Yet, at the same time, <br />let him halt the music of his songs, as I do mine. </p>                        </div>

Yet whoever sets out <br />to commit arson, arms his bold hands with fire. <br />Medicine sometimes grants health, sometimes destroy it, <br />showing which plants are helpful, which do harm. <br />The robber and cautious traveller both wear a sword: <br />one for ambush, the other for defence. <br /><a href=/people/736 target=_blank>Eloquence</a> is learnt to plead just causes: <br />it protects the guilty, crushes the innocent. <br />So with verse, read with a virtuous mind <br />it’ll be established nothing of mine will harm. <br />But I ‘corrupt some’? Whoever thinks so, errs, <br />and claims too much for my writings. <br />Even if I’d confessed it, the games also <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a><br />seeds of iniquity: order the theatres closed! <br />Many have often found an excuse for sin <br />when the hard earth’s covered with <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>’s sand! <br />Close the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCiM class=place long=12.4871 lat=41.8852>Circus</a>!

<br />Why because <a href=/people/1088 target=_blank>Icarus</a> flew high, the other lower: <br />yet both flew on wings that were not their own. <br />Believe me, who lives quietly lives well, <br />and every man should be happy with his lot. <br /><a href=/people/2878 target=_blank>Eumedes</a> would not have lost his child, if <a href=/people/10979 target=_blank>Dolon</a>, <br />his foolish son, hadn’t yearned for <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>’ <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. <br /><a href=/people/1976 target=_blank>Merops</a> would not have seen his son on fire, his daughters <br />trees, if he’d sufficed <a href=/people/273 target=_blank>Phaethon</a> as a father. <br />You too, always fear what is too high, <br />and narrow the sails of your intentions. <br />Since you ought to run life’s course on sound feet, <br />and enjoy a brighter destiny than mine. <br />You deserve my prayers for you, by your kind <br />affection, and that loyalty that clings to me always. <br />I saw you grieving for my fate, with such a look <br />as I believe my own face must have showed. <br />I saw your tears falling on my lips, <br />tears that I drank with your faithful words. <br />Even now you defend your exiled friend zealously, <br />easing the pain that can scarcely be eased. <br />Live unenvied, pass sweet years, unknown, <br />form friendships equal to your own, <br />and love the name of <a href=/people/2769 target=_blank>Ovid</a>, the only part of him <br />not exiled: the rest <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> holds. <br />The land near the stars of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380218LEry class=demonym long=21.8333 lat=37.9667>Erymanthian</a> Bear <br />imprisons me, earth gripped with freezing cold. <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454367WBos class=place long=36.66 lat=45.36>Bosphorus</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/473393WTan class=place long=39.336 lat=47.268>Don</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> marshes lie beyond it, <br />a handful of names in a region scarcely known. <br />Further there’s nothing but uninhabitable cold. <br />Ah how near I am to the ends of the earth! <br />And my country’s far away, my dear wife’s far away, <br />and everything that, after them, was sweet. <br />Even so they’re still present, though I cannot <br />touch them: everything’s alive in my mind. <br />My home’s before my eyes, the city, the image of places, <br />every event that happened in each place. <br />My wife’s form is before my eyes, as if she were here, <br />She makes my misfortunes darker: she lightens them: <br />darkens them by her absence, lightens them by her gift <br />of love, and her strength in enduring the load she bears. <br />You too cling to my heart, my friends, <br />whom I’d like to mention each by name, <br />but cautious fear inhibits that service, and I think <br />you wouldn’t want a place in my verse. <br />You did before: it was like an honour, deserving thanks, <br />for your names to be read in my poems. <br />Since it’s dangerous now, I’ll speak to you, each <br />in my heart, and be a source of fear to none. <br />My verse gives no hints that drag my friends from hiding. <br />Let him who loved me, love in secret still. <br />But though I’m absent, far away in a distant place, <br />know you’re always present in my heart. <br />And in whatever way each can, ease my pain somehow, <br />don’t refuse an outcast a loyal hand. <br />So may good fortune stay with you, and may you never, <br />touched by a like fate, have to make the same request. </p>                        </div>

If you corrected that one thing <br />there’d be no flaw in your illustrious person. <br />I’d accuse you more strongly, except it’s possible <br />a letter’s been sent that’s not reached me yet. <br />The gods grant that my complaint’s baseless, <br />and I’m wrong in thinking you’ve forgotten me. <br />It’s clear what I pray for is so: since it’s wrong for me <br />to believe that the strength of your feelings should change. <br />Sooner would pale wormwood be missing from icy <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>, <br />or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369147UHyb class=place long=14.7421 lat=36.9267>Hybla</a> lack its sweet-scented thyme, <br />than anyone could convict you of forgetting a friend. <br />The threads of my fate are not so dark as that. <br />Still, beware of seeming what you’re not, so you <br />can refute these false accusations of guilt. <br />As we used to spend long hours in conversation, <br />until the daylight failed us, while we talked, <br />so letters now should bear our silent voices to and fro, <br />and paper and hands perform the acts of tongues. <br />Lest I seem too despairing of this ever being so, <br />and may these few lines serve to remind you of it, <br />accept that word with which a letter always ends – <br />and may your fortunes be different from mine! – ‘Vale’. </p>                        </div>
