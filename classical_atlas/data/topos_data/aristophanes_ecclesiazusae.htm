Oh! lamp, I will tell thee thine origin and thy future; 'tis the rapid whirl of the potter's wheel that has lent thee thy shape, and thy wick counterfeits the glory of the sun; mayst thou send the agreed signal flashing afar! In thee alone do we confide, and thou art worthy, for thou art near us when we practise the various postures in which <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> delights upon our couches, and none dream even in the midst of her sports of seeking to avoid thine eye that watches our swaying bodies. Thou alone shinest into the depths of our most secret charms, and with thy flame dost singe the hairy growth of our privates. If we open some cellar stored with fruits and wine, thou art our companion, and never dost thou betray or reveal to a neighbour the secrets thou hast learned about us. Therefore thou shalt know likewise the whole of the plot that I have planned with my friends, the women, at the festival of the <a href=/people/5962 target=_blank>Scirophoria</a>. I see none of those I was expecting, though dawn approaches; the Assembly is about to gather and we must take our seats in spite of <a href=/people/4268 target=_blank>Phyromachus</a>, who forsooth would say, It is meet the women sit apart and hidden from the eyes of the men. Why, have they not been able then to procure the false beards that they must wear, or to steal their husbands cloaks? Ah! I see a light approaching; let us draw somewhat aside, for fear it should be a man. <br />FIRST WOMAN: Let us start, it is high time; as we left our dwellings, the cock was crowing for the second time. </p>                        </div>

Firstly, as agreed, I have let the hair under my armpits grow thicker than a bush; furthermore, whilst my husband was at the Assembly, I rubbed myself from head to foot with oil and then stood the whole day long in the sun. <br />FIFTH WOMAN: So did I: I began by throwing away my razor, so that I might get quite hairy, and no longer resemble a woman. <br />PRAXAGORA: Have you the beards that we had all to get ourselves for the Assembly? <br />FOURTH WOMAN: Yea, by <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a>!

'Twould be a fine thing if one of us, in the midst of the discussion, rushed on to the speaker's platform and, flinging her cloak aside, showed her hairy privates. If, on the other hand, we are the first to take our seats closely muffled in our cloaks, none will know us. Let us fix these beards on our chins, so that they spread all over our bosoms. How can we fail then to be mistaken for men? <a href=/people/2828 target=_blank>Agyrrhius</a> has deceived everyone, thanks to the beard of <a href=/people/5209 target=_blank>Pronomus</a>; yet he was no better than a woman, and you see how he now holds the first position in the city.

No, by the two goddesses.... <br />PRAXAGORA: What? by the two goddesses! Wretched woman, where are your senses? <br />EIGHTH WOMAN: Eh! what?..

But where shall I find a spot suitable for my purpose. Bah! One place is as good as another at night-time, for no one will see me.
