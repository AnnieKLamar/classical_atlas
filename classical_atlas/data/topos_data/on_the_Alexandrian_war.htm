Meanwhile the entrenchments were daily extended by additional works, and all those sectors of the town which appeared to be not strong enough were provided with shelters and mantlets; battering-rams, moreover, were introduced from one building into the next through holes, and the entrenchments were extended to cover all the ground laid bare by demolitions or gained by force of arms. For <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> is well-nigh fire-proof, because its buildings contain no wooden joinery and are held together by an arched construction and are roofed with rough-cast or tiling. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was particularly anxious that, by bringing to bear his siege-works and pent-houses, he should isolate from the rest of the city that narrowest part of the town which was most constricted by the barrier of marshland lying to the south; his object being first that, since his army was divided between two sectors of the city, it should be controlled by a single strategy and command; secondly, that if they got into difficulties in one sector of the town, assistance and support could be brought from the other sector. But above all his object was to secure himself abundance of water and fodder; of which, as regards the former, he had but a scanty supply, and, as regards the latter, no stocks whatever; and the marshland could afford him bountiful supplies of both. </p>                        </div>

They had in fact despatched emissaries and recruiting officers throughout the entire length and breadth of the territory and kingdom of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> for the purpose of holding a levy, and had conveyed into the town a large quantity of weapons and artillery and mustered a countless host. In the city too, no less, vast arms factories had been established. They had, moreover, armed the adult slaves, and these the wealthier owners furnished with their daily food and pay. This numerous force they deployed to guard the fortifications of outlying areas; while they kept their veteran cohorts unemployed in the most frequented quarters of the city so that, no matter in what district fighting occurred, they could be thrown in as fresh and lusty reinforcements. All the streets and alleys were walled off by a triple barricade, built of rectangular stone blocks and not less than forty feet high; while as for the lower quarters of the city, these were fortified with very lofty towers, each ten stories high. Besides these there were other towers which they had contrived — mobile ones of the like number of stories; and these, being mounted on wheels with ropes and draught animals attached, they moved along the level streets to any area they saw fit. </p>                        </div>

The people themselves were clever and very shrewd, and no sooner had they seen what was being done by us than they would reproduce it with such cunning that it seemed it was our men who had copied their works. Much also they invented on their own account, and kept assailing our entrenchments while simultaneously defending their own. In their councils and public meetings the arguments which their leaders kept driving home were as follows: 'the Roman people were gradually acquiring a habit of seizing that kingdom; a few years earlier <a href=/people/1616 target=_blank>Aulus</a> <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> had been in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> with an army; <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> too had resorted thither in his flight; <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had now come with his forces, and the death of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> had had no effect in dissuading <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> from staying on among them. If they failed to drive him out, their kingdom would become a Roman province: and this driving out they must do betimes; for cut off as he now was by storms owing to the season of the year, he could not receive reinforcements from overseas.' </p>                        </div>

This circumstance suggested to <a href=/people/1283 target=_blank>Ganymedes</a> the possibility that the water supply could be cut off from our troops; who, posted as they were in various quarters of the town to guard our entrenchments, were using water drawn from conduits and cisterns in private buildings. </p>                        </div>

Having first blocked up the conduits and sealed off all quarters of the city occupied by himself, he then made haste to draw off a vast quantity of water out of the sea by means of mechanical water-wheels; and this he steadily poured from higher ground into <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s area. For which reason the water drawn from the nearest buildings was a little more brackish than usual, and occasioned no little wonder among men as to why this had come about. Nor could they quite believe the evidence of their own ears when their neighbours lower down said that the water they were using was of the same kind and taste as they had previously been accustomed to; and they were openly discussing the matter amongst themselves and, by tasting samples, learning how markedly the waters differed. However, in a short space of time the water nearer the contamination was entirely undrinkable, while that lower down was found to be relatively impure and brackish. </p>                        </div>

As for retreating, there was no sound policy in that, not merely for those who held the chief responsibility, but not even for those whose sole concern was for their own lives. They were hard put to it to contain the enemies' frontal attacks from their entrenchments: once abandon those and they could be no match for them either in vantage ground or numbers. Moreover, boarding ships, especially from pinnaces, involved considerable delay and difficulty; while set against this the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> had the greatest mobility and knowledge of the ground and buildings.

On our side no chance of escape either by land or sea was presented in the event of repulse and defeat, while victory would in no way settle the question; whereas in their case, if their fleet should gain the upper hand, they would hold all the cards, while if they were beaten, it would still be left to them to try their luck again. At the same time it seemed a grievous shame that the supreme issue and the salvation of all should be decided by the rival exertions of so few; and if any one of these wavered in purpose or courage, the others too, who had had no chance of fighting to defend themselves, would have to look out for themselves. These considerations <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had repeatedly explained to his men in recent days, that they might fight with the greater resolution because they saw that the safety of all was entrusted to themselves. It was by these same arguments too that every man, as he escorted his messmate, friend or acquaintance, implored him not to prove false to the estimate which not only he himself had formed of him, but all those others likewise, to whose decision he owed it that he was now going forth as one of the chosen combatants.

Having formed this plan, he embarked in smaller craft and pinnaces ten cohorts, some picked light-armed troops and such of his Gallic cavalry as he deemed suitable; and, to distract the enemy garrison, he launched an attack with decked ships upon the other side of the island, offering large rewards to the first to capture it. At first the islanders held off our troops' attack, simultaneously fighting back from the roofs of buildings, and with equal success defending the beaches with armed parties — and there the roughness of the ground did not afford our troops an easy approach — and guarding the narrow waters with pinnaces and five warships displaying both speed and skill.

Near the bridge — the one closer to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299IPha class=place long=29.8856 lat=31.213>Pharos</a> — he fortified a redoubt, and posted a garrison there. This bridge the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299IPha class=place long=29.8856 lat=31.213>Pharos</a> had abandoned in their flight; while the other one, which was narrower and closer to the town, was guarded by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a>. However, on the next day he attacked it from a similar motive, because the possession of these two bridges seemed likely to do away with all the sallies and sudden forays of the enemies' ships. And by now he had dislodged the members of its garrison with artillery and arrows shot from his ships, had driven them back into the town, and put ashore approximately three cohorts — the confined space would not afford a footing for more — while the rest of his forces remained at their posts aboard the ships. At this stage he ordered the bridge to be screened by a rampart on the side facing the enemy, and the opening for the passage of ships — formed by an arch which supported the bridge — to be filled up and blocked with stones. The latter task being completed, so that not a single pinnace could come out, and the former one being under way, all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a>' forces burst out of the town and took post in a fairly open position over against our fortifications of the bridge; while at the same time they drew up near the mole the vessels which they had been in the habit of sending out under the bridges to set fire to our transports. And so the battle proceeded, with us fighting from the bridge and the mole, and with them from the area facing the bridge and from their ships opposite the mole. </p>                        </div>

Some were inspired by their anxiety to watch the fray, others also by the desire to take part in it. They began by driving back the enemy vessels from the mole with stones and slings, and it seemed that their heavy volleys of missiles were having great effect. But when a few <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> ventured to disembark beyond that point, on the side of their unprotected flank, then, just as they had advanced in no set order or formation and without any particular tactics, so now they began to retire haphazardly to the ships. Encouraged by their retreat, more of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> disembarked and pursued our flustered men more hotly. At the same time those who had stayed aboard the warships made haste to seize the gang-planks and ease the ships away from land, to prevent the enemy from gaining possession of them. All this thoroughly alarmed our troops of the three cohorts which had taken post on the bridge and the tip of the mole; and as they heard the clamour behind them, and saw the retreat of their comrades, and sustained a heavy frontal barrage of missiles, they feared they might be surrounded in rear and have their retreat entirely cut off by the departure of their ships; and so they abandoned the entrenchment they had begun at the bridge, and doubled frantically to the ships. Some of them gained the nearest ships, only to be capsized by the weight of so many men; some were killed by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> as they put up a forlorn and bewildered resistance; some proved luckier in reaching ships at anchor cleared for action, and so got away safely; and a few, holding their shields above them and steeling their resolution to the task, swam off to ships near by. </p>                        </div>

As a large number of men followed him and kept forcing their way aboard it, and as no opportunity was afforded either of navigating it or easing it off shore, anticipating what actually happened he dived from the vessel and swam to those ships which were hove to farther off. From them he sent pinnaces to the help of his men who were in difficulties, and saved not a few. His vessel was in fact capsized by the large number of troops, and foundered with the men on board. In this battle the losses among the legionary troops amounted to approximately 400, with a slightly larger number of seamen and rowers.

Accordingly, he urged the king to take thought for the kingdom of his fathers, to have pity on his most illustrious country, shamefully scarred as it was by fire and desolation, to recall his citizens to sanity first and then to preserve them therein, and to prove his loyalty to the Roman people and to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, inasmuch as <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself had such faith in him that he was sending him to join an enemy under arms.

Not a few of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s officers and friends and many of the centurions and soldiers were delighted at this turn of events, inasmuch as <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s over-generosity had, they felt, been made fun of by the deceitful tricks of a boy.

No one brought him assistance, either because they thought that, considering his courage and his good luck, he was quite able to take care of himself, or because they were afraid for their own sakes.

The king had encamped with his forces in a naturally strong position, since in itself the position was higher than the plateau which lay beneath it on all sides; moreover, on three sides it was covered by defences of diverse types: one side abutted the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>; a second ran along very high ground and formed one face of his camp; while the third was encircled by a marsh. </p>                        </div>

When the king learned that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was coming by this route, he despatched all his cavalry and a picked force of light-armed infantry to this river to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> from crossing it and to engage at long range from its banks — an unfair engagement, for the spot could neither afford scope for valour nor involve cowardice in any risk. These tactics filled our infantry and cavalry with burning resentment at the thought that for so long their struggle with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> should prove a drawn battle. And so, at the same time as scattered groups of German cavalry, looking for places to ford the river, swam across it at some points where the banks were lower, simultaneously the legionary troops, having felled lofty trees tall enough to reach from bank to bank, hurled them forward and crossed the river on a causeway hastily thrown on top. So terrified were the enemy by their attack, that they pinned their hopes of deliverance to flight: in vain, however; for few survived that route to take refuge with the king, and practically all the remainder were killed. </p>                        </div>

But when he observed that this camp was strongly entrenched as well as protected by its natural position, and saw the serried mass of armed men posted at the rampart, he was unwilling to let his soldiers, weary as they were with marching and fighting, advance to attack the camp. Accordingly he pitched camp at no great distance from the enemy. In a nearby hamlet, not far distant from the king's camp, there was a fort which the king had built and linked with bastions to the main defences of his camp so as to hold the hamlet. This fort <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> attacked and took by storm on the following day with all his forces; not that he thought it would be difficult to gain that objective by using a smaller number of soldiers, but in order that, with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> thoroughly unnerved as a result, he might go straight on from that victory to attack the king's camp. And so, having chased the retreating <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> from the fort into their camp, our troops carried on their charge right up to the fortifications, where they proceeded to fight at long range very briskly. On two sides our men were afforded an opening for assault: the first was the one which, as I have explained, allowed unimpeded approach; the second comprised the moderate-sized space between the camp and the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>. The largest and most carefully picked contingent of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> was defending that side which afforded the easiest approach; but the defenders in the area of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> were the most successful in repelling and wounding our men: for the latter were being hit by missiles coming from opposite directions — from the rampart of the camp ahead of them, and from the river behind them, where many ships manned with slingers and archers were engaging our men. </p>                        </div>

Thus the Thirty-Sixth legion launched an attack on the king's cavalry outside the trench and fought so successful an action that it advanced up to the walls of the town, crossed the trench, and attacked the enemy in rear. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=demonym long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontic</a> legion, however, on the other flank, drew back a little from the enemy, and attempted, moreover, to go round or cross the trench, so as to attack the enemy's exposed flank; but in the actual crossing of the trench it was pinned down and overwhelmed. The legions of <a href=/people/1110 target=_blank>Deiotarus</a>, indeed, offered scarcely any resistance to the attack. Consequently the king's forces, victorious on their own right wing and in the centre of the line, now turned upon the Thirty-Sixth legion. The latter, nevertheless, bore up bravely under the victors' attack and, though surrounded by large enemy forces, yet with consummate presence of mind formed a circle and so made a fighting withdrawal to the foothills, where <a href=/people/452 target=_blank>Pharnaces</a> was loth to pursue it owing to the hilly nature of the ground.

To this province there had been sent out in the summer a quaestor of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s, Q. <a href=/people/966 target=_blank>Cornificius</a>, as pro-praetor; and although the province was not at all abundantly stocked for supporting armies and was exhausted and wasted by war upon its borders and by rebellions, yet by his far-sighted and careful policy, taking great pains not to make an ill-considered advance in any quarter, he recovered and defended it. For example, he successfully stormed several mountain strongholds, the commanding position of which prompted their occupants to carry on a predatory warfare, and presented his troops with the resulting booty; which, paltry though it was, was none the less welcome — considering the very meagre prospects of the province — especially since it was the prize of valour. Again, when in the course of his flight from the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393224UPha class=place long=22.3869 lat=39.2883>Pharsalia</a> <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a> took refuge with a large fleet upon that coast, <a href=/people/966 target=_blank>Cornificius</a>, with the aid of a few ships of the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441152UIad class=place long=15.2245 lat=44.1155>Iadera</a> — those devoted supporters of the commonwealth, who were unsurpassed in their constant loyalty — made himself master of <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>' scattered ships, and was accordingly enabled by the addition of these vessels to those of his allies to go into action with something like a fleet. And when in quite a different quarter of the globe <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was victoriously pursuing Cn. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, and heard that several of his opponents had collected the remnants of the fugitives and taken refuge in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> on account of its proximity to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, he sent despatches to <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>, bidding him set out for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> with the legions of recruits which had recently been raised: there he was to join forces with Q. <a href=/people/966 target=_blank>Cornificius</a> and repulse any dangerous move that might be made against the province: if on the other hand no large forces were needed to ensure the safety of the province, he was to lead his legions into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>.

As a result of these considerable difficulties he was forced to conduct the campaign, not as he wished, but as necessity dictated. And so, as lack of supplies forced him to storm towns or strongholds in very adverse weather, he frequently sustained reverses, and was held by the natives in such contempt that, while retreating on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435165USal class=place long=16.4834 lat=43.5397>Salona</a>, a coastal town occupied by very gallant and loyal Roman citizens, he was forced to fight an action on the march.

So, although he was afflicted by a serious illness and his bodily strength barely enabled him to obey his will, yet by courage he overcame his physical handicap, as well as the difficulties both of winter and the sudden mobilisation. Thus, as he himself had few warships in harbour, he sent despatches to Q. <a href=/people/1443 target=_blank>Calenus</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=place long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaia</a>, requesting him to send him a fleet; but as this proved too slow a business — our troops were in no position to withstand <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>' attack, and their critical situation urgently demanded something speedier — he fitted beaks to some fast boats, of which he had a sufficient number, though their size was by no means adequate for fighting purposes.

While the latter was assaulting <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426182UEpi class=place long=18.2179 lat=42.582>Epidaurus</a> by land and sea, where there was a garrison of ours, <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a> forced him by his approach to abandon his assault, and so relieved our garrison. </p>                        </div>

The more closely interlocked the ships — whenever the opportunity was afforded for such fighting — the more marked was the superiority of the Vatinians; for they displayed admirable courage in leaping without hesitation from their own ships on to those of the enemy, and where the fighting was on equal terms their markedly superior courage brought them success. <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>' own quadrireme was sunk, and many besides were either captured or else rammed, holed and sunk: some of his combat troops were cut down on the ships, others dived overboard. <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a> himself took refuge in a pinnace; and when too many others sought safety in it and it capsized, wounded as he was he swam to his own light galley.

Having thus recovered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> and made a present to his troops of all the royal plunder, he himself set out on the following day with his cavalry in light order; instructing the Sixth legion to leave for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> to receive its rewards and honours, sending home the auxiliary troops of <a href=/people/1110 target=_blank>Deiotarus</a>, and leaving two legions in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> with <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a> <a href=/people/10485 target=_blank>Vinicianus</a>. </p>                        </div>

To the same <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> he awarded, by right of racial affinity and kinship, the tetrarchy of <a href=/people/12143 target=_blank>Gallograecia</a> which had been seized and occupied a few years earlier by <a href=/people/1110 target=_blank>Deiotarus</a>.
