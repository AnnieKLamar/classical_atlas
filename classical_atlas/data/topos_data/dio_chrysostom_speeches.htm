In precisely the same way it was possible, he maintained, to have gained possession also of a human being unjustly. For manifestly of those who from time to time acquire slaves, as they acquire all other pieces of property, some get them from others either as a free gift from someone or by inheritance or by purchase, whereas some few from the very beginning have possession of those who were born under their roof, 'home-bred' slaves as they call them. A third method of acquiring possession is when a man takes a prisoner in war or even in brigandage and in this way holds the man after enslaving him, the oldest method of all, I presume. For it is not likely that the first men to become slaves were born of slaves in the first place, but that they were overpowered in brigandage or war and thus compelled to be slaves to their captors. </p>                        </div>

Consequently, they were not slaves before that, either. And sometimes they not only escaped from slavery themselves, but also reduced their masters to slavery. In this case, also, we have now found that 'at the flip of a shell,' as the saying goes, their positions are completely reversed.

But just as bodies unaccustomed to toil need anointing and moderate exercise rather than the training of the gymnasium, so you in preparing yourself for public speaking have need of diligence which has a tempering of pleasure rather than laborious training. So let us consider the poets: I would counsel you to read <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> of the writers of Comedy quite carefully, and <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> of the writers of Tragedy, and to do so, not casually by reading them to yourself, but by having them read to you by others, preferably by men who know how to render the lines pleasurably, but at any rate so as not to offend.

For physicians do not prescribe the most costly diet for their patients, but that which is salutary. Now it would be a long task to enumerate all the advantages to be derived from these writers; indeed, not only has <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>'s portrayal of every character and every charming trait surpassed all the skill of the early writers of Comedy, but the suavity and plausibility of <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, while perhaps not completely attaining to the grandeur of the tragic poet's way of deifying his characters, or to his high dignity, are very useful for the man in public life; and furthermore, he cleverly fills his plays with an abundance of characters and moving incidents, and strews them with maxims useful on all occasions, since he was not without acquaintance with philosophy. </p>                        </div>

For example, they experience joy and sorrow, and courage and timidity, for no reason at all, they are enthusiastic, they desire the impossible, and what is unreal they regard as real, while what is real they fail to perceive. However, these traits, perhaps, they share in common with ourselves. But this, in my opinion, is the clearest mark of slumber — they snort. For, by heaven, I have no more becoming name to give it.

Well then, supposing certain people should as a community be so afflicted that all the males got female voices and that no male, whether young or old, could say anything man-fashion, would that not seem a grievous experience and harder to bear, I'll warrant, than any pestilence, and as a result would they not send to the sanctuary of the god and try by many gifts to propitiate the divine power? And yet to speak with female voice is to speak with human voice, and nobody would be vexed at hearing a woman speak. </p>                        </div>

However, they did have faces that were comely and boyish beyond their years when rid of that down. Next — since this was still to try — they shaved the legs and chest, to insure that in all other respects as well they might resemble boys. Then they progressed as far as the arms; then shifted to the genitals, where evidence of youthful vigour is indeed superfluous.

Conversely, neither abundance of riches nor number of men nor any other element of strength is of advantage to those who are divided, but all these things are rather on the side of loss, and the more abundant they are, so much the greater and more grievous the loss.

For when a proprietor's absence from home, if protracted, suffices to ruin even the greatest estate, what should one expect in the course of so many years of exile? From such an exile no one could have expected me to come home safe except yourselves — because of your extreme partiality for me. And yet as long as poverty was the only risk confronting me, that was nothing to be afraid of. For I am not unprepared, I may say, to cope with that, having wandered so long, not only without hearth and home, but even without a single servant to bear me company.

Moreover, while concord is a word of good omen, and to make trial of it is most excellent and profitable for all, strife and discord are forbidding and unpleasant words even to utter, and much worse are their deeds and more forbidding. For the fact is, strife and discord involve saying and hearing said many things one might wish to avoid, and doing and experiencing them too. </p>                        </div>

Clearly, then, not one of these law-givers had any claim to independence, nor did they exert themselves or wage war for the purpose of being free; on the contrary, after they had gathered within the compass of their city walls slavery without bound or limit, thereupon with ramparts and towers and missiles they tried to protect themselves against the chance that slavery might make its entry among them from without, just as if, when a ship's seams have opened up and the hold is already taking water, one were to take measures of prevention and be concerned lest perchance the sea might sweep over from above.

For the speech joins forces with nature; and by nature we all desire to be beautiful, an ambition whose realization is greatly assisted by the hair to which from boyhood nature has accustomed us. In my own case, for example, even when the dreadful plague was just beginning and a hair fell off, I was smitten to my inmost heart, and when the attack was pressed with greater vigour, hair after hair dropping out, and ultimately even two or three together, and the war was being waged with fury, my head becoming utterly ravaged, then indeed I thought myself to be the victim of more grievous injury than the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> suffered at the hands of <a href=/people/239 target=_blank>Archidamus</a> when he cut down the trees of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381237DAch class=ethnic long=23.7332 lat=38.0803>Acharnians</a>, and presently, without my so intending, I was turned into a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=person long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboean</a>, one of the tribe which the poet marshalled against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> with flowing locks behind. At this stage what god, what spirit, did I pass by without arraignment? I even set myself to composing a eulogy of <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, not that I held the same views about the gods as he, but rather because I aimed to make them smart for it to the best of my poor powers. For I said, Where are the tokens of their providence in treating the individual contrary to his deserts? For what crime of mine dooms me to appear less comely in women's eyes? It is nothing terrible if I am to appear so to the women of the neighbourhood — for so far as love is concerned I might with fullest justice lay claim to the prize for continence, even against <a href=/people/807 target=_blank>Bellerophon</a> — but even a mother, yes, even sisters, I am told, attach some importance to the beauty of their men. And <a href=/people/898 target=_blank>Parysatis</a> made this plain by growing cold toward <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a> who was king because of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> who was beautiful. Thus, then, I cried aloud in indignation, and I made no light matter of my misfortune. But when time had made it more familiar and reason, too, entering as contender, rose up to give battle against my suffering, and when little by little that suffering was yielding ground, then at last for these reasons I was more at ease and beginning to recover; but now this very <a href=/people/674 target=_blank>Dio</a> has caused the flood of my distress to flow afresh, and it has returned to attack me in company with an advocate. But against two adversaries, as the saying is, not even <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> could contend, since when the <a href=/people/5125 target=_blank>Molionidae</a> fell upon him from ambush he did not endure the attack. Nay, even in his struggle with the <a href=/people/1205 target=_blank>Hydra</a>, though for a time they were locked in single combat, yet when the crab came to her aid <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> might even have cried quits, had he not enlisted <a href=/people/502 target=_blank>Iolaus</a> against them as ally. I too, methinks, have had much the same experience at the hands of <a href=/people/674 target=_blank>Dio</a>, though I have no nephew <a href=/people/502 target=_blank>Iolaus</a>. Once more, therefore, quite forgetful of myself and my reasonings, I am composing laments, mourning my lost head of hair. But since you are the most excellent of bald-heads and are apparently a man of mettle, seeing that you do not even give a thought to your misfortune but, when pease porridge has been served and an inspection of foreheads is in progress, even call attention to yourself, as if priding yourself, forsooth, upon some blessing, therefore endure with patience <a href=/people/674 target=_blank>Dio</a>'s discourse and, as the saying goes, keep your heart in obedience, just as <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> when confronted with the misconduct of the women remained undaunted; so do you too endeavour to be undismayed by <a href=/people/674 target=_blank>Dio</a>. Ah, but you couldn't. What's that you say? You will indeed be able? Well then, listen. But there is no need to unroll the parchment; instead I will recite the speech myself. For in fact it does not contain many lines; yet it is a polished composition, and its beauty lingers in my memory, so that not even if I wished to do so could I forget. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0612.tlg001:82.2'><b>&sect; 82.2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=/people/674 target=_blank>Dio</a>'s Encomium on Hair: Having arisen at dawn and having addressed the gods, as is my wont, I proceeded to attend to my hair; for in truth my health, as it happened, was rather feeble and my hair had been too long neglected. At any rate, most of it had become quite matted and tangled, as happens with the knots of wool that dangle about the legs of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> — though these, of course, are far more stubborn, having been twisted together out of strands that are finer. Well, my hair was a wild and grievous sight to behold, and it was proving difficult to get it loosened up, and most of it threatened to tear out and resisted my efforts. Accordingly it occurred to me to praise the hair-lovers, who, being beauty-lovers and prizing their locks most of all, attend to them in no casual manner, but keep a sort of reed always in the hair itself, wherewith they comb it whenever they are at leisure; moreover — the most unpleasant thing of all — while sleeping on the ground they are careful never to let their hair touch the earth, placing a small prop of wood beneath their head so as to keep it as far as possible from the earth, and they are more concerned to keep their hair clean than they are to enjoy sweet sleep. The reason, it would seem, is that hair makes them both beautiful and at the same time terrifying, while sleep, however sweet it be, makes them both sluggish and devoid of caution. And it seems to me that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a>, too, do not disregard a matter of such importance, for on that memorable occasion, on their arrival before the great and terrible battle, at a time when they alone among the Greeks were to withstand the attack of the Great King, three hundred in number as they were, they sat down and dressed their locks. And <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, too, methinks, believed that sort of thing deserved fullest attention. At least he does not often praise his beauties for their eyes, nor does he think that by so doing he will best set forth their beauty. Accordingly, he praises the eyes of none of his heroes except <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, just as he praises the rest of his body also; moreover, he applies the term 'flashing-eyed,' not to the Greeks alone, but just as much to <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> himself, using the epithet common to the Greeks in general; on the other hand, he praises everybody for his hair. First of all take <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, of whom he says, She seized Peleides by his flaxen hair, then <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, whom he calls 'blonde' for his hair. And <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>'s hair he mentions in these words, And all about his blue-black tresses swept. Indeed, on the death of <a href=/people/1131 target=_blank>Euphorbus</a>, the most beautiful of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a>, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> mourned nothing else of his, for he said, His locks, so like the <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a>', were wet with blood, His braids with gold and silver tightly claspt. </p>                        </div>

And again of the same person, Down from his head she caused the curly locks To fall, like bloom of hyacinth. Moreover, the adornment afforded by the hair, to judge by <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, seems to be more suited to the men than to the women. At any rate, when descanting on feminine beauty, he is not found to mention hair so often; for even with the gods he praises the female deities in different fashion — for it is 'golden <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>' and 'great-eyed <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>' and '<a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a> of the silver feet' — but with <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> he praises most of all his hair: And toward her streamed the god's ambrosial locks.
