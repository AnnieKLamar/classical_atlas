                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg083:-'><b>&sect; -</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the virtues of women, O <a href=/people/6367 target=_blank>Clea</a>, I am not of the same mind with <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a>. For he would prove that she is the best woman concerning whom there is the least discourse made by people abroad, either to her praise or dispraise; judging that, as the person, so the very name of a good woman ought to be retired and not gad abroad. But to us <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a> seems more accurate, who requires that not only the face but the fame of a woman should be known to many. For the Roman law seems exceeding good, which permits due praises to be given publicly both to men and women after death. Wherefore when <a href=/people/1704 target=_blank>Leontis</a>, a most excellent woman, departed this life, immediately we made a long oration to thee about her, and truly not devoid of philosophical consolation; and now (as thou didst desire) I send thee in writing the rest of my speech and conversation, carrying with it an historical demonstration that the virtue of a man and woman is one and the same. And although it be not composed for the tickling of the ear, yet if there be jucundity in the nature of an example to him that is persuaded of the truth of it, my narration fails not of that grace which works conviction; neither is it ashamed of commixing the <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a> with the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> in the sweetest harmony (as <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> saith), while it engageth confidence especially through that part of the soul which is studious of grace and beauty. For surely, if, whilst we asserted the art of painting to be the same, whether performed by men or women, we produced the same sort of draughts wrought by women which <a href=/people/460 target=_blank>Apelles</a>, <a href=/people/10969 target=_blank>Zeuxis</a>, or <a href=/people/562 target=_blank>Nicomachus</a> hath left, is there any one who would reprehend us as attempting rather to humor and cajole men than to convince them? Verily I do not think it. Moreover, if, whilst we go to make appear that the poetic or comic art is not one thing in men and another in women, we compare <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a>'s verses with <a href=/people/543 target=_blank>Anacreon</a>'s, or the <a href=/people/12187 target=_blank>Sibylline oracles</a> with those of <a href=/people/3544 target=_blank>Bacis</a>, can any one justly blame this way of argumentation, because it insinuates a credence into the pleased and delighted hearers? No one surely would say this. Neither can a man truly any way better learn the resemblance and the difference between feminine and virile virtue than by comparing together lives with lives, exploits with exploits, as the products of some great art; duly considering whether the magnanimity of <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a> carries with it the same character and impression with that of <a href=/people/1486 target=_blank>Sesostris</a>, or the cunning of <a href=/people/3257 target=_blank>Tanaquil</a> the same with that of King <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>, or the discretion of <a href=/people/2013 target=_blank>Porcia</a> the same with that of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, or that of <a href=/people/277 target=_blank>Pelopidas</a> with <a href=/people/3476 target=_blank>Timoclea</a>, — regarding that quality of these virtues wherein lie their chiefest point and force. Moreover, virtues do admit some other differences, like peculiar colors, by reason of men's dispositions, and are assimilated to the manners and temperaments of the bodies wherein they are, yea, to the education and manner of diet. <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> was courageous in one manner, <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> in another; the subtlety of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> was not like that of <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>, neither were <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> and <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a> just after the same manner; neither was <a href=/people/3825 target=_blank>Eirene</a> a lover of her husband as <a href=/people/1166 target=_blank>Alcestis</a> was; neither was <a href=/people/858 target=_blank>Cornelia</a> magnanimous in the same way with <a href=/people/272 target=_blank>Olympias</a>. But, for all this, we do not say that there are many kinds of fortitude, prudence, and justice specifically distinct, so long as their individual dissimilitudes exclude none of them from the specific definitions. Those things now which are very commonly discoursed of, and of which I know thou hast had the exact history and knowledge from solid books, I will at present omit, unless there be some public and recorded matters worth your hearing, which have escaped the historians of former times. And seeing that many worthy things, both public and private, have been done by women, it is not amiss to give a brief historical account of those that are public, in the first place. </p>                        </div>

Whilst the men went about the country to enquire after pilots, there fell out a discourse among the women, that for a people as fortunate and happy as they had been, any fixed habitation on the land was better than perpetual wandering over the sea; and that they must make a new country for themselves, seeing it was impossible to recover that which they had lost. Upon this, complotting together, they set fire on the ships, Roma (as they say) being one of the first in the attempt. But having done these things, they went to meet their husbands, who were running towards the sea to the relief of the ships; and fearing their indignation, they laid hold some of them on their husbands, and some on their kinsfolk, and fell a kissing them soundly; by which carriage they obtained their charitable reception. Wherefore it hath been formerly, and now remains to be a custom among the Romans, for the women to salute their kinsfolk that come unto them by kissing.

The total history of the transaction is particularly recorded in the Life of <a href=/people/4961 target=_blank>Daiphantus</a>. The story of those women is this. There was an implacable war between the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=ethnic long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocians</a>. For these (the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=ethnic long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocians</a>) slew all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> governors and magistrates in the cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=place long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocis</a> in one day. Whereupon they (the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a>) slew two hundred and fifty <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=demonym long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocian</a> hostages, and with their whole host marched up against them through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386231ROpu class=place long=23.04 lat=38.65>Locris</a>, publishing their resolution to spare no men that were of age, and to sell the women and children for slaves. <a href=/people/4961 target=_blank>Daiphantus</a> therefore, the son of Bathyllius, a triumvir, governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=place long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocis</a>, persuaded the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=demonym long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocian</a> men themselves to go to meet the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> in battle; but as for the women, together with their children, that they should assemble them from all the parts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=place long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocis</a> into one place, which they should pile round with combustible matter, and should leave a watch, to whom they should give in charge, that if he perceived that the men were conquered, he should immediately set fire to the pile and burn all the bodies to ashes. The counsels were agreed to by some, but one stands up and saith: It is just that these things be consented to by the women also, and if they do not cheerfully submit to it, they should have no force offered to them. The account of this discourse being come to the women, they assembled together by themselves, and carried it by vote, and applauded <a href=/people/4961 target=_blank>Daiphantus</a> as a man that best consulted the affairs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=place long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocis</a>; they say also, that the children meeting together privately voted the same things. These matters being thus settled, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=ethnic long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocians</a> joining battle at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386228UKle class=place long=22.844 lat=38.6099>Kleonai</a>, a town of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386229PHya class=place long=22.9054 lat=38.5961>Hyampolis</a>, got the victory. Hence the Grecians call this vote of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=demonym long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocian</a> women Aponoia (the desperate resolve). And of all the festivals this of the <a href=/people/7629 target=_blank>Elaphebolia</a> is the greatest, which they observe to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386229PHya class=place long=22.9054 lat=38.5961>Hyampolis</a> to this day, in remembrance of this victory. </p>                        </div>

A certain famous man of the nobles of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a> was married; whilst the bride was drawn in her chariot, King <a href=/people/6541 target=_blank>Hippoclus</a>, an intimate friend of the bridegroom's, being present with the rest, and also fuddled and merry, leaped into the chariot, not designing any incivility, but only to keep up the usual custom and to make sport. However, the bridegroom's friends slew him. The effects of divine displeasure appearing against the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a>, and the oracle commanding them to slay the slayers of <a href=/people/6541 target=_blank>Hippoclus</a>, they replied, We have all of us slain <a href=/people/6541 target=_blank>Hippoclus</a>. The oracle commanded them all therefore to depart the city, if all did partake of the guilt. So that at length the principals, accessories, and abettors of the murder by any means whatsoever, being not a few in number nor feeble for strength, transplanted themselves into <a href=/people/5748 target=_blank>Leuconia</a>, which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> had once taken from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384230PKor class=ethnic long=22.9571 lat=38.3912>Coroneans</a> by the aid of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382234PEry class=ethnic long=23.4032 lat=38.2358>Erythraeans</a>. Afterward a war arising between them and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382234PEry class=ethnic long=23.4032 lat=38.2358>Erythraeans</a>, by far the most potent people among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=ethnic long=27.3 lat=38>Ionians</a>, when the latter invaded <a href=/people/5748 target=_blank>Leuconia</a>, the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a> were not able to defend themselves and came to an agreement to depart upon these terms that every one should take with him only one cloak and one coat, and nothing else. But the women of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a> upbraided them as mean-spirited men, that they would lay down their weapons and go naked men through their enemies. And when they made answer that they were sworn so to do, they charged them not to leave their weapons behind them, but to say to their adversaries, that the spear is a cloak and the buckler a coat to every man of courage. The men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a> being persuaded to these things, and emboldening themselves courageously against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382234PEry class=ethnic long=23.4032 lat=38.2358>Erythraeans</a>, and showing their weapons, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382234PEry class=ethnic long=23.4032 lat=38.2358>Erythraeans</a> were amazed at their audacity, and none opposed or hindered them, but were glad of their departure. These men therefore, being taught courage by the women in this manner, made a safe escape. Many years after this there was another exploit, nothing inferior to this in fortitude, performed by the women of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a>. When <a href=/people/35 target=_blank>Philip</a>, the son of <a href=/people/234 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, besieged the city, he set forth a barbarous and insolent proclamation, inviting the servants to a defection upon promise of liberty and marriage of their mistresses, saying that he would give them their masters' wives into their possession. At this the women were dreadfully and outrageously incensed; and also the servants were no less provoked to indignation, and were ready to assist. Therefore they rushed forth furiously and ascended the wall, bringing stones and darts, encouraging and animating the soldiers; so that in the end these women discomfited and repulsed the enemy, and caused <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> to raise his siege, while not so much as one servant fell off to him. </p>                        </div>

This woman they say was of an honorable family, but had a sickly body; she therefore sent to consult the oracle concerning her health. Answer was made, that she must be a servant to the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. Accordingly she becomes obedient to the Goddess, applying herself to poetry and music; her distempers left her, and she became the mirror of women in the art of poetry. Now when <a href=/people/81 target=_blank>Cleomenes</a>, king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a>, having slain many <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a> (but not so many as some fabulously reported, to wit, 7,777), marched up against the city, the youthful women were (as it were) divinely inspired with desperate resolution and courage to repulse the enemies out of their native country. They take arms under the conduct of <a href=/people/2263 target=_blank>Telesilla</a>, they place themselves upon the battlements, they crown the walls, even to the admiration of the enemy; they by a sally beat off <a href=/people/81 target=_blank>Cleomenes</a>, with the slaughter of many of his men; and as for the other king, <a href=/people/475 target=_blank>Demaratus</a> (as <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> saith), he having entered the city and possessed him of the socalled Pamphyliacum, they beat him out. In this manner the city being preserved, those women that were slain in the engagement they buried by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=demonym long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a> road; to them that escaped they gave the honor of erecting the statue of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, in perpetual memorial of their bravery. Some say this fight was on the seventh day of the month; others say it was on the first day of the month, which is now called the fourth and was anciently called Hermaeus by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a>; upon which day, even to this time, they perform their Hybristica (i.e., their sacred rites of incivility), clothing the women with men's coats and cloaks, but the men with women's veils and petticoats. To repair the scarcity of men, they admitted not slaves, as <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> saith, but the best sort of the adjacent inhabitants to be citizens, and married them to the widows; and these the women thought meet to reproach and undervalue at bed and board, as worse than themselves; whence there was a law made, that married women should wear beards when they lay with their husbands. </p>                        </div>

The oracle enjoined them to continue sailing till they cast away their ships, and there to pitch their colony. It happened that, when they arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=place long=28.7 lat=37.01>Caria</a> and went ashore, their ships were broken to pieces by a storm. Some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=ethnic long=28.7 lat=37.01>Carians</a> which dwelt at <a href=/people/7553 target=_blank>Cryassus</a>, whether commiserating their distressed condition or dreading their resolution, invited them to dwell in their neighborhood, and bestowed upon them a part of their country; but then observing their marvellous increase in a little time, they conspired to cut them off by treachery, and provided a feast and great entertainment for that end and purpose. But it came to pass that a certain virgin in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=place long=28.7 lat=37.01>Caria</a>, whose name was Caphene, fell in love with <a href=/people/3056 target=_blank>Nymphaeus</a>. While these things were in agitation, she could not endure to connive at the destruction of her beloved <a href=/people/3056 target=_blank>Nymphaeus</a>, and therefore acquainted him privately with the conspiracy of the citizens against him. When the Cryassians came to invite them, <a href=/people/3056 target=_blank>Nymphaeus</a> made this answer: It is not the custom of the Greeks to go to a feast without their wives. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=ethnic long=28.7 lat=37.01>Carians</a> hearing this requested them also to bring their wives; and so explaining the whole transaction to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367244PMel class=ethnic long=24.4199 lat=36.7389>Melians</a>, he charged the men to go without armor in plain apparel, but that every one of the women should carry a dagger stuck in her bosom, and that each should take her place by her husband. About the middle of supper, their signal token was given to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=ethnic long=28.7 lat=37.01>Carians</a>; the point of time also the Grecians were sensible of. Accordingly the women laid open their bosoms, and the men laid hold of the daggers, and sheathing them in the barbarians, slew them all together. And possessing themselves of the country, they overthrew that city, and built another, which they called New <a href=/people/7553 target=_blank>Cryassus</a>. Moreover, Caphene being married to <a href=/people/3056 target=_blank>Nymphaeus</a> received due honor and grateful acknowledgments becoming her good services.

Amisodarus, as they say, whom the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=ethnic long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycians</a> call Isaras, came from a colony of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=ethnic long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycians</a> about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402276UZel class=place long=27.5961 lat=40.2036>Zeleia</a>, bringing with him <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirate</a> ships, which Chimarrhus, a warlike man, who was also savage and brutish, was commander of. He sailed in a ship which had a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> carved on her head and a dragon on her stern. He did much mischief to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=ethnic long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycians</a>, so that they could not sail on the sea nor inhabit the towns nigh the sea-coast. This man <a href=/people/807 target=_blank>Bellerophon</a> pursued with his <a href=/people/1116 target=_blank>Pegasus</a> and slew him, and also defeated the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a>, for which he obtained no due requital, but <a href=/people/2700 target=_blank>Iobates</a> the king was most unjust to him; upon which <a href=/people/807 target=_blank>Bellerophon</a> went to the seashore, and made earnest supplication by himself to <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> that he would render that country barren and unfruitful; and having said his prayers, he faced about. Upon which the waves of the sea arose and overwhelmed the land, and it was a dreadful sight to behold the lofty billows following <a href=/people/807 target=_blank>Bellerophon</a> and drowning the plain. And now, when the men by their deprecation, laboring to put a stop to <a href=/people/807 target=_blank>Bellerophon</a>, availed nothing at all, the women plucking up their petticoats met him full butt; upon which confounded with shame he turned back again, and the flood, as they say, returned with him. But some unriddle the fabulous part of this story, by telling us that it was not by execrations that he brought up the sea; but the fattest part of the plain lying lower than the sea, and a certain ridge extending itself all along the shore which beat off the sea, <a href=/people/807 target=_blank>Bellerophon</a> broke through this, so that the sea forcibly flowed in and overwhelmed the plain; and when the men by their humble addresses obtained nothing, the women assembling about him in multitudes gained respect from him and pacified his wrath. Some tell us that the celebrated <a href=/people/1239 target=_blank>Chimaera</a> was a mountain opposite to the sun, which caused reflections of the sun's beams, and in summer ardent and fiery heats, which spread over the plain and withered the fruits; and <a href=/people/807 target=_blank>Bellerophon</a>, finding out the reason of the mischief, cut through the smoothest part of the cliff, which especially caused these reflections. But on seeing that he was treated ungratefully, his indignation was excited to take vengeance on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=ethnic long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycians</a>, but was appeased by the women. The reason which <a href=/people/3908 target=_blank>Nymphis</a> (in the fourth book concerning Heraclea) doth assign is to me not at all fabulous; for he saith, when <a href=/people/807 target=_blank>Bellerophon</a> slew a certain wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>, which destroyed the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and fruits in the province of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364293PXan class=ethnic long=29.3182 lat=36.3565>Xanthians</a>, and received no due reward of his service, he prayed to <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> for vengeance, and obtained that all the fields should cast forth a salt dew and be universally corrupted, the soil becoming bitter; which continued till he, condescendingly regarding the women suppliants, prayed to <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, and removed his wrath from them. Hence there was a law among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364293PXan class=ethnic long=29.3182 lat=36.3565>Xanthians</a>, that they should not for the future derive their names from their fathers, but from their mothers. </p>                        </div>

Upon which he raised his siege; when they changed their minds, and would not perform any thing that they had promised. Wherefore returning again to his siege, he gave command to his soldiers to take the city by storm, and fall to the plundering their goods. At this the barbarians, struck universally into a panic fear, came to terms of composition, for the free citizens to depart the city with their clothes to their backs, but to leave their weapons, goods, slaves, and city behind them. Now the women supposed that, although the enemies would strictly search every man as he departed, yet the women would go untouched. Accordingly, taking scimitars and hiding them under their coats, they fell in with the men as they marched out. When they were all gone out of the city, <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> sets a guard of <a href=/people/7933 target=_blank>Masaesylian</a> soldiers, fixing their post without the gate, but the rest of his army fell promiscuously into the city to plunder. But the <a href=/people/7933 target=_blank>Masaesylians</a>, seeing them busy in carrying away much spoil, were not able any longer to refrain or to mind the charge of their watch, taking it heinously that that was their lot, and therefore left their post and went to take their share of the booty. Upon this the women raised a shout to animate their husbands, and delivered the scimitars into their hands, and they themselves some of them fell upon the sentinels; insomuch that one of them, snatching away the spear of Banon the interpreter, smote him with it, though he was armed with a breastplate. And as for the rest, the men routed and put some to flight and slew others, making their escape by charging through them in a great body together with the women. <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>, being made acquainted with these things, pursued them, and those he took he slew; but some betaking themselves to the mountains easily made their escape, and afterwards, sending in their humble supplications, were admitted by him into the city, obtaining indemnity and civil usage. </p>                        </div>

It is most likely the air had acquired some infatuating and venomous quality, that did influence them to this change and alienation of mind; for all on a sudden an earnest longing for death, with furious attempts to hang themselves, did attack them, and many did privily accomplish it. The arguments and tears of parents and the persuasion of friends availed nothing, but they circumvented their keepers in all their contrivances and industry to prevent them, still murdering themselves. And the calamity seemed to be an extraordinary divine stroke and beyond human help, until by the counsel of a wise man a decree of the senate was passed, enacting that those maids who hanged themselves should be carried naked through the market-place. The passage of this law not only inhibited but quashed their desire of slaying themselves. Note what a great argument of good nature and virtue this fear of disgrace is; for they who had no dread upon them of the most terrible things in the world, death and pain, could not abide the imagination of dishonor and exposure to shame even after death. </p>                        </div>

She was ravished by one of <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquin</a>'s sons, who was in a way of hospitality entertained by her; and after she had acquainted her friends and family with the abuse offered her, she immediately slew herself. <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> having fallen from his dominion, after many battles that he fought in attempting to regain his kingly government, at last prevailed with <a href=/people/3670 target=_blank>Porsena</a>, prince of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Etrurians</a>, to encamp against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> with a powerful army. Whereupon the Romans, being pressed with war and famine at the same time, likewise knowing that <a href=/people/3670 target=_blank>Porsena</a> was not only a great soldier but a just and civil person, resolved to refer the matters against <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> to him as a judge. This proposal <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> obstinately refused to consent unto, saying that <a href=/people/3670 target=_blank>Porsena</a> could not be a just arbitrator if he did not remain constant to his military alliance. Whereupon <a href=/people/3670 target=_blank>Porsena</a> left him to himself, and made it his endeavor to depart a friend to the Romans, on condition of having restored to him the tracts of land they had cut off from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Etrurians</a> and the captives they had taken. Upon these accepted conditions hostages being given, — ten male children, and ten females (among whom was <a href=/people/12047 target=_blank>Valeria</a>, the daughter of <a href=/people/2252 target=_blank>Publicola</a> the consul), — he immediately ceased his warlike preparations before the articles of agreement were quite finished. Now the virgin hostages going down to the river, as if they intended only to wash themselves a little further than ordinary from the camp, there, by the instigation of one of them whose name was <a href=/people/12067 target=_blank>Cloelia</a>, wrapping their garments about their heads, they cast themselves into that great river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, and assisting one another, swam through those vast depths with much labor and difficulty. There are some who say that <a href=/people/12067 target=_blank>Cloelia</a> compassing a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> got upon him, and passing over gently before, the rest swimming after her, conducted, encouraged, and assisted them; the argument they use for this we shall declare anon. As soon as the Romans saw the maids had made such a clever escape, they admired indeed their fortitude and resolution, but did not approve of their return, not abiding to be worse in their faith than any one man; therefore they charged the maids to return back, and sent them away with a safe conduct. <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> laid wait for them as they passed the river, and wanted but little of intercepting the virgins. But <a href=/people/12047 target=_blank>Valeria</a> with three of her household servants made her flight to the camp of <a href=/people/3670 target=_blank>Porsena</a>; and as for the rest, <a href=/people/7310 target=_blank>Aruns</a>, <a href=/people/3670 target=_blank>Porsena</a>'s son, gave them speedy help and delivered them from the enemies. When they were brought, <a href=/people/3670 target=_blank>Porsena</a> looking upon them commanded them to tell him which of them advised and first attempted this enterprise; all of them being surprised with fear, except <a href=/people/12067 target=_blank>Cloelia</a>, were silent, but she said, that she was the author of it; at which <a href=/people/3670 target=_blank>Porsena</a>, mightily surprised, commanded an <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> curiously adorned with trappings should be brought, which he gave to <a href=/people/12067 target=_blank>Cloelia</a>, and dismissed them all with much generosity and civility; and this is the ground which many make of saying that <a href=/people/12067 target=_blank>Cloelia</a> passed through the river on horseback. Others deny this story, but yet say that <a href=/people/3670 target=_blank>Porsena</a> admiring the undauntedness and confidence of the maid, as being beyond what is commonly in a woman, bestowed a present on her becoming a man champion. It is certain that there is the statue of a woman on horseback by the side of the Sacred Way, which some say represents <a href=/people/12067 target=_blank>Cloelia</a>, others, <a href=/people/12047 target=_blank>Valeria</a>. </p>                        </div>

For he was naturally a savage man; and being in servile fear of a band of mixed barbarians, who guarded his person and his government, he connived at many injurious and cruel things which his subjects suffered at their hands, among which was the calamity of <a href=/people/2181 target=_blank>Philodemus</a>. This man had a beautiful daughter, whose name was <a href=/people/7973 target=_blank>Micca</a>. This maid one of the tyrant's captains of auxiliaries, called Lucius, attempted to lie with, more out of a design to debauch her than for any love he had to her; and for this end he sent to fetch her to him. The parents verily seeing the strait they were in advised her to go; but the maid, being of a generous and courageous spirit, clasped about her father, beseeching him with earnest entreaties that he would rather see her put to death than that her virginity should be filthily and wickedly violated. Some delay being made, Lucius himself starts up in the midst of his cups, enraged with wrath and lust, and drunk with wine; and finding <a href=/people/7973 target=_blank>Micca</a> laying her head on her father's knees, he instantly commanded her to go along with him; but she refusing, he rent off her clothes, and whipped her stark naked, she stoutly enduring the smart in silence. When her father and mother perceived that by their tears they could not avail or bring any succor to her, they turned to imploring the help of both Gods and men, as persons that were oppressed by the most cruel and unrighteous proceedings. But this barbarous fellow, drunk and raging every way with madness, ran the maid through as she lay with her face in her father's bosom. Neither was the tyrant affected with these cruelties, but slew many and sent more into exile; for they say eight hundred took their flight into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=place long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aitolia</a>, petitioning the tyrant that their wives and children might come to them. A little after he made proclamation, permitting the women that would to go to their husbands, carrying with them all their household goods that they pleased; but when he perceived that all the women received the proclamation with pleasure (for the number was above six hundred), he charged them all to go in great companies on the appointed day, as if he intended to consult for their safety. When the day came, they crowded at the gates with their goods packed up, carrying their children, some in their arms and some in carts, and stayed for one another. All on a sudden many of the tyrant's creatures made towards them in great haste, crying aloud to them to stay, while they were yet at great distance from them; and as they approached, they charged the women to return back. Likewise turning about their chariots and carts, they forced them upon them, drove the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> through the midst of them without fear or wit, suffering the women neither to follow nor to stay, nor to reach forth any help to the perishing infants, some of whom were killed falling out of the carts, others run over by the carts. So they drove them in (as so many <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> which butchers drive along), hauling and whipping them as they thronged upon one another, till they had crowded them all into a prison; but their goods they returned to <a href=/people/1986 target=_blank>Aristotimus</a>. The people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=place long=21.374 lat=37.89>Elis</a> taking these things very heinously, the priestesses devoted to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a> (which they call the Sixteen), taking with them their suppliant boughs and wreaths belonging to the service of their God, went to meet <a href=/people/1986 target=_blank>Aristotimus</a> in the market-place; the guards, out of a reverential awe, stood off and gave way to their approach. These priestesses stood still at first with silence, solemnly reaching forth their supplicatory rods; but as soon as they appeared as petitioners and deprecators of his wrath against the women, he fell into a great rage at the guards, exclaiming against them that they had suffered the priestesses to approach his presence, and he caused some to be thrust away, others to be beaten and dragged through the market-place, and fined them two talents apiece. These things being transacted in this manner, one <a href=/people/637 target=_blank>Hellanicus</a> moved a conspiracy against this tyrant. He was a man who, by reason of old age and the loss of two sons by death, was unsuspected of the tyrant, as being altogether unlikely for action. In the mean time also the exiles waft themselves over from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=place long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aitolia</a>, and take Amymona, a very convenient place on the borders to entrench a camp in, where they received great numbers of the citizens who made their escape by flight from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=place long=21.374 lat=37.89>Elis</a>. <a href=/people/1986 target=_blank>Aristotimus</a> being startled at these things went in to the imprisoned women, and thinking to work them to his pleasure more by fear than by favor, charged them to send letters to their husbands, enjoining them to depart out of the coasts; if they would not write, he threatened them to slay their children before their eyes, and then put them (the mothers) to death by torments. Whilst he was long provoking and urging them to declare whether they would obey his mandates or not, most of them answered him nothing, but looked with silence one upon another, signifying by nods and gestures that they were not at all affrighted at his threat. But <a href=/people/3889 target=_blank>Megisto</a> the wife of Timocleon, who both in respect of her husband and her own excellent accomplishments carried the port of a princess among them, would not vouchsafe to rise off her seat to him nor permit the rest so to do, but as she sat, she gave him this answer: Verily if thou wert a discreet man, thou wouldst not after this manner discourse with women about their husbands, but wouldst send to them as to our lords, finding out better language than that by which thou hast deluded us. But if thou thyself despairest to prevail with them, and therefore undertakest to trepan them by our means, do not hope to put a cheat upon us again. And may they never be guilty of such baseness, that for the saving their wives and little ones they will desert that liberty of their native country; for it is not so great a prejudice to them to lose us, whom even now they are deprived of, as it will be benefit to set the subjects at liberty from thy cruelty and oppression. <a href=/people/1986 target=_blank>Aristotimus</a>, being not able to refrain himself at this speech of <a href=/people/3889 target=_blank>Megisto</a>, required that her son should be brought, as if it were to slay him before her eyes; but whilst the officer was seeking out the child, that was in the company of other children playing and wrestling together, his mother called him by his name, and said: Come hither, my child; before thou hast any sense and understanding, be thou delivered from bitter tyranny; for it would be much more grievous to me to see thee basely enslaved than to see thee die. At which <a href=/people/1986 target=_blank>Aristotimus</a> drawing his sword upon the mother herself, and transported with rage, was going to fall upon her, when one of his favorites, <a href=/people/1661 target=_blank>Cylon</a> by name (esteemed his trusty confidant, but in reality a hater of him, and a confederate with <a href=/people/637 target=_blank>Hellanicus</a> in the conspiracy), put a stop to him, and averted him in an humble manner, telling him: This is an ignoble and woman-like carriage, not at all becoming a person of a princely mind and a statesman. Hereupon <a href=/people/1986 target=_blank>Aristotimus</a> scarcely coming to his senses departed. Now observe what an ominous prodigy happened to him. It was about noon, when he was taking some repose, his wife sitting by; and whilst his servants were providing dinner, an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> was seen in the air floating over the house, which did, as it were considerately and on purpose, let fall a stone of an handsome bigness upon that part of the roof of the house which was over the apartment where <a href=/people/1986 target=_blank>Aristotimus</a> lay. At the same time there was also a great rattling from above, together with an outcry made by the people that were abroad looking upon the bird. Upon which <a href=/people/1986 target=_blank>Aristotimus</a>, falling into a great consternation and examining the matter, sent and called his soothsayer which he usually consulted in his public concerns, and being in great perplexity, desired to be satisfied what that prodigy meant. The soothsayer bade him be of good cheer, for it signified that <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> now wakened and assisted him. But to the citizens that he could confide in he said, that vengeance would no longer be delayed from falling on the tyrant's head. Wherefore it was concluded by <a href=/people/637 target=_blank>Hellanicus</a> and his friends not to defer any longer, but to bring matters to an issue the next day. At night <a href=/people/637 target=_blank>Hellanicus</a> imagined in his sleep that he saw one of his dead sons stand by him saying, What is the matter with thee, O father! that thou sleepest? Tomorrow thou shalt be governor of this city. Being animated by his vision, he encouraged the rest concerned with him. Now <a href=/people/1986 target=_blank>Aristotimus</a> was informed that <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a>, coming to his aid with great forces, was encamped in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>; upon which he became so confidently secure, that he ventured to go without his guards into the market-place, <a href=/people/1661 target=_blank>Cylon</a> only accompanying him. Wherefore <a href=/people/637 target=_blank>Hellanicus</a>, observing this opportunity, did not think good to give the signal to those that were to undertake the enterprise with him, but with a clear voice and lifting up both his hands, he spake saying: O ye good men! why do ye delay? Here is a fair theatre in the midst of your native country for you to contend in for the prize of valor. Whereupon <a href=/people/1661 target=_blank>Cylon</a> in the first place drawing his sword smote one of <a href=/people/1986 target=_blank>Aristotimus</a>'s waiting gentlemen; but <a href=/people/253 target=_blank>Thrasybulus</a> and <a href=/people/1162 target=_blank>Lampis</a> making a brisk opposition, <a href=/people/1986 target=_blank>Aristotimus</a> escaped by flight into the temple of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. Here slaying him, they dragged forth his corpse into the market-place, and proclaimed liberty to the citizens. Neither were the men there much before the women, who immediately ran forth with joyful acclamations, environing the men and binding triumphant garlands about their heads. The multitude presently rushed on upon the tyrant's palace, where his wife shutting herself into her bed-chamber hanged herself. He had also two daughters, maidens of most beautiful complexions, ripe for marriage. Those they laid hands on, and haled forth, with a desperate resolution to slay them, but first to torment and abuse them. But <a href=/people/3889 target=_blank>Megisto</a>, with the rest of the women, meeting them called out with a loud voice: Will they perpetrate such enormities who reckon themselves a free people, in imitation of the practices of audacious and libidinous tyrants? The multitude reverencing the gravity of this matron, pleading with them so undauntedly as also affectionately with tears, they resolved to lay aside this opprobrious way of proceeding, and to cause them to die by their own hands. As they were therefore returned into the chamber, they required the maids immediately to be their own executioners. Muro, the eldest, untying her girdle and tying it about her neck, saluted her sister, and exhorted her to be careful and do whatever she saw her do; lest (as she said) we come to our death in a base and unworthy manner. But the younger desiring it might be her lot to die first, she delivered her the girdle, saying: I did never deny thee any thing thou didst ever desire, neither will I now; take this favor also. I am resolved to bear and endure that which is more grievous than death to me, to see my most dear sister die before me. Upon this, when she had instructed her sister how to put the girdle so as to strangle her, and perceived her dead, she took her down and covered her. And now the eldest sister, whose turn was next, besought <a href=/people/3889 target=_blank>Megisto</a> to take care of her, and not suffer her to lie indecently after she was dead. So that there was not any one present that was so bitter and vehement a tyrant-hater that he did not lament and compassionate these maidens upon their brave and virtuous behavior. Of the innumerable famous exploits performed by women, these examples may suffice. But as for their particular virtues, we will describe them according as they offer themselves scattered here and there, not supposing that our present history doth necessarily require an exact order of time. </p>                        </div>

To the assistance of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=ethnic long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Milesians</a> came in many others; and of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=ethnic long=27.3 lat=38>Ionians</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382234PEry class=ethnic long=23.4032 lat=38.2358>Erythraeans</a> were most ready. So that this war was of long continuance, and had great calamities attending it. But as it was begun by the lewdness of a woman, so it was ended by a woman's policy. <a href=/people/1129 target=_blank>Diognetus</a>, a colonel of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382234PEry class=ethnic long=23.4032 lat=38.2358>Erythraeans</a>, holding a fortification committed to his keeping, which was cast up against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=ethnic long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxians</a>, lying naturally to great advantage and well furnished with ammunition, took great spoils from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=ethnic long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxians</a>; yea, he captivated both free married women and virgins; with one of which, called <a href=/people/3668 target=_blank>Polycrita</a>, he fell in love, and treated her not as a captive but after the manner of a married wife. Now a festival coming in turn to be celebrated among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=ethnic long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Milesians</a> in the camp, and all of them given to their cups and luxury, <a href=/people/3668 target=_blank>Polycrita</a> petitioned <a href=/people/1129 target=_blank>Diognetus</a> that he would be pleased to permit her to send some part of the cakes to her brethren. He permitting and bidding her do it, she thrust into a cake a piece of lead engraven with writing, and commanded the bearer to say to her brethren that they alone by themselves should eat up what she had sent. Accordingly they met with the plate of lead, and read <a href=/people/3668 target=_blank>Polycrita</a>'s hand-writing, advising them that night to fall upon their enemies, who, by reason of excess caused by their feastings, were overcome with wine and therefore in a careless secure condition. They acquainted the officers with it, and urged them to accompany them forth against the enemies. Upon engagement the stronghold being gotten and many slain, <a href=/people/3668 target=_blank>Polycrita</a> by entreaty of her countrymen obtained the life of <a href=/people/1129 target=_blank>Diognetus</a> and preserved him. But she being met by her countrymen at the gate, who received her with acclamations of joy and garlands, and greatly applauded her deed, could not bear the greatness of the joy, but died, falling down at the gate of the citadel, where she was buried; and it is called the Sepulchre of <a href=/people/1036 target=_blank>Envy</a>, as though some envious fortune had grudged <a href=/people/3668 target=_blank>Polycrita</a> the fruition of so great honor. And thus do the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=demonym long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxian</a> writers declare the history. But <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> saith, that <a href=/people/3668 target=_blank>Polycrita</a> was not taken captive, but that by some other way or means <a href=/people/1129 target=_blank>Diognetus</a> seeing her fell in love with her, and was ready to give and do all that he could for the enjoying her. <a href=/people/3668 target=_blank>Polycrita</a> promised to consent to him, provided she might obtain one only thing of him; concerning which, as the philosopher saith, she required an oath of <a href=/people/1129 target=_blank>Diognetus</a>. When he had sworn, she required <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383237UDel class=place long=23.67398 lat=38.34248>Delium</a> to be delivered up to her (for the stronghold was called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383237UDel class=place long=23.67398 lat=38.34248>Delium</a>), otherwise she would not yield to go with him. He, being besotted with lust and for his oath's sake, delivered up the place into the hands of <a href=/people/3668 target=_blank>Polycrita</a>, and she to her countrymen. From henceforward they adjusted matters so equally, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=ethnic long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxians</a> had free converse, as they pleased, with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=ethnic long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Milesians</a>. </p>                        </div>

So that when <a href=/people/4367 target=_blank>Phobus</a> was returning back by sea, <a href=/people/3039 target=_blank>Mandron</a> showed great civility to him, promising to give him a part of his country and city, if he would bring over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387268UPho class=ethnic long=26.7532 lat=38.6704>Phocaeans</a> and plant them as inhabitants in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403267UPit class=place long=26.6992 lat=40.3467>Pituoessa</a>. <a href=/people/4367 target=_blank>Phobus</a> therefore persuading his countrymen sent his brother to conduct them over as planters, and likewise the obligation was performed on <a href=/people/3039 target=_blank>Mandron</a>'s part according to expectation. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387268UPho class=ethnic long=26.7532 lat=38.6704>Phocaeans</a> taking great booty, prey, and spoils from the neighboring barbarians, were first envied, and afterwards became a terror to the <a href=/people/8978 target=_blank>Bebrycians</a>; and therefore they desired to be rid of them. As for <a href=/people/3039 target=_blank>Mandron</a>, being an honest and righteous person, they could not possess him against the Grecians; but he taking a long journey, they provided to destroy the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387268UPho class=ethnic long=26.7532 lat=38.6704>Phocaeans</a> by treachery. <a href=/people/3039 target=_blank>Mandron</a> had a daughter called <a href=/people/4578 target=_blank>Lampsace</a>, a virgin, who was acquainted with the plot; and first she endeavored to take off her friends and familiars from it, admonishing them what a dreadful and ungodly enterprise they were going upon, — to murder men that were benefactors, military auxiliaries, and now citizens. But when she could not prevail with them, she declared to the Grecians secretly what was plotting, and wished them to stand upon their guard. Upon this, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387268UPho class=ethnic long=26.7532 lat=38.6704>Phocaeans</a> provided a sacrifice and feast, and invited the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403267UPit class=ethnic long=26.6992 lat=40.3467>Pituoessans</a> into the suburbs; on which, dividing themselves into two parts, with one they surprised the walls of the city, with the other they slew the men.

She arrived at such a degree of fortitude and experience in counsel as might be compared with the conduct of any heroic ladies. She was the daughter of Aeglator and the wife of <a href=/people/1846 target=_blank>Phaedimus</a>, both renowned men. She was a great beauty, excelling in discretion, and was not unacquainted with the most knotty pieces of policy; but the common disasters of her native country rendered her famous. <a href=/people/2765 target=_blank>Nicocrates</a>, having then usurped the tyranny over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=ethnic long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrenaeans</a>, not only murdered many other citizens, but also assassinated <a href=/people/3495 target=_blank>Melanippus</a>, a priest of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, with his own hand, and held the priesthood himself. He slew also <a href=/people/1846 target=_blank>Phaedimus</a>, the husband of <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a>, and married <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a> against her will. Unto a thousand other villanies he added this, that he set guards at the gates, who mangled the dead corpses as they were carrying forth, pricking them with their daggers and clapping hot irons to them, lest any citizen should be carried out privily under pretence of being a dead corpse. <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a>'s own proper calamities were very grievous to her, although the tyrant, for the love that he bare to her, suffered her to enjoy a great part of his regal power; for his love had subdued him unto her, and to her alone was he gentle and manageable, being very rude and savage in his behavior to others. But that which troubled her more than other things was to see her miserable country suffering such horrid things in so base a manner; one citizen being slaughtered after another, without any hopes of a vindictive justice from any. The exiles also were altogether enfeebled, affrighted, and scattered here and there. <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a> therefore supposed herself to be the only hope remaining for the state; and emulating the famous and brave enterprises of <a href=/people/1873 target=_blank>Thebe</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394228PPhe class=person long=22.7539 lat=39.379>Pherae</a>, although she was destitute of the faithful friends and helpers which circumstances afforded to <a href=/people/1873 target=_blank>Thebe</a>, she laid a plan to despatch her husband by poison. But in setting herself about it, providing the materials, and trying many experiments with poisons, the matter could not be hid, but was discovered; and there being proof made of the attempt, <a href=/people/6316 target=_blank>Calbia</a>, <a href=/people/2765 target=_blank>Nicocrates</a>'s mother, being naturally of a murdering implacable spirit, presently adjudged <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a> to torments and then to death. But love abated the rage of <a href=/people/2765 target=_blank>Nicocrates</a>, and put him upon delay; and the vigorous manner in which <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a> met the accusation and defended herself gave some plausible ground for his hesitation. But when she was convicted by the clearest proofs, and the preparation she had made for the poison was even in sight, admitting no denial, she confessed that she provided poison, but not deadly poison. But truly, O sir, she said, I am contending for matters of great concern, no less indeed than the honor and power which by thy gracious favor I reap the fruit of. I am maligned by many ill women, whose poisons and treacheries I stand in fear of, and therefore have been persuaded to contrive something on the other side in my own defence. These are haply foolish and woman-like plots, but not such as deserve death, unless it seem good to thee as judge to take away thy wife's life on account of love-potions and charms, which she has used because she wishes to be loved by thee more than thou wouldst have her. Notwithstanding this defence which <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a> had made for herself, <a href=/people/2765 target=_blank>Nicocrates</a> thought good to commit her to torments; and <a href=/people/6316 target=_blank>Calbia</a> presided in the judicature, rigid and inexorable. But <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a> bore up invincibly under her tortures, till <a href=/people/6316 target=_blank>Calbia</a> herself was tired, sore against her will. But <a href=/people/2765 target=_blank>Nicocrates</a> being pacified discharged her, and was sorry he had tortured her. And it was not very long ere he went in again unto her, being highly transported with affection, renewing his favor towards her with honors and courteous behavior. But she would not be brought under by flattery, who had held out so stoutly under tortures and pains; and an emulation of victory, conjoined with the love of honesty, made her betake herself to other measures. She had a daughter marriageable, an excellent beauty. Her she presented for a bait to the tyrant's brother, a young stripling and lasciviously addicted. There was a report, that <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a> used such enchantments and witchcrafts towards the maid, that she plainly charmed and destroyed the young man's reason. He was called <a href=/people/11020 target=_blank>Leander</a>. After he was entangled, he petitioned his brother and accomplished the marriage. Now the maid, being instructed by her mother, instigated and persuaded him to set the city at liberty, insinuating that he himself could not live long free under an arbitrary government, nor could he marry a wife or reserve her to himself. Also some friends, <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a>'s favorites, suggested to him continually some accusations or surmises concerning his brother. But as soon as he perceived that <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a> was counselling and aiding in these matters, he undertook the business, and excited <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a> a household servant, who slew <a href=/people/2765 target=_blank>Nicocrates</a> by his command. In what followed, he attended not so much to <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a>, but presently manifested by his actions that he was rather a fratricide than a tyrannicide; for he managed his affairs perversely and foolishly. But yet he had some honor for <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a>, and she had some influence with him; neither did she manage any enmity or open opposition against him, but ordered her affairs privily. First of all, she stirred up an African war against him, and incited <a href=/people/7234 target=_blank>Anabus</a>, a certain duke, to invade his borders and approach the city; and then she buzzed into <a href=/people/11020 target=_blank>Leander</a>'s head suspicions against the favorites and officers, saying that they were not forward to fight but rather ambitious of peace and tranquillity, which indeed (she said) the state of affairs and the security of his dominion required of him if he would hold his subjects in firm subjection; and she would effect a cessation of arms and bring <a href=/people/7234 target=_blank>Anabus</a> to a parley with him, if he would permit it, before an incurable war should break forth. <a href=/people/11020 target=_blank>Leander</a> gave her commission. First she treated with the African, and with the promise of great presents and treasures begged that he would seize <a href=/people/11020 target=_blank>Leander</a> when he came to treat with him. The African was persuaded, but <a href=/people/11020 target=_blank>Leander</a> was backward to it; only for the respect that he bore to <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a>, who said that she would be present, he went unarmed and unguarded. But as he came nigh and saw <a href=/people/7234 target=_blank>Anabus</a>, he made a halt, and would have waited the coming of his guards; only <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a> being present sometimes encouraged him, sometimes reviled him. But at last, when he still hesitates, she undauntedly lays hold on him, and dragging him resolutely along, delivers him to the barbarian. He was immediately seized, confined, and bound, and kept prisoner by the African, until <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a>'s friends, with other citizens, procured the treasures promised. Many people acquainted with this ran forth to the parley; and as soon as they saw <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a>, they were so transported that they had like to have forgot their indignation against the tyrant, and reckoned the punishing him of no great concern. But the first work after the enjoyment of their liberty was the saluting <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a>, between acclamations of joy and weeping, and falling down before her, as before the statue of one of the Gods. And the people flocked in one after another, so that they scarcely had time that evening to receive <a href=/people/11020 target=_blank>Leander</a> again and return into the city. When they had satisfied themselves in honoring and applauding <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a>, they turned themselves to the tyrants; and <a href=/people/6316 target=_blank>Calbia</a> they burnt alive, <a href=/people/11020 target=_blank>Leander</a> they sewed up in a sack and threw him into the sea, but they voted that <a href=/people/1933 target=_blank>Aretaphila</a> should bear her share in the government together with the statesmen, and be taken into counsel. But she, by great sufferings having acted a tragi-comedy consisting of various parts, and at last obtained the reward of the garland, as soon as she saw the city set at liberty, betook herself to her private apartment; and casting off all multiplicity of business, she led the rest of her time in spinning, and finished her days in tranquillity among her friends and acquaintance. </p>                        </div>

For she was not only modest and loving to her husband, but discreet and of a generous mind. And by reason of her gentle and courteous behavior she was extremely acceptable to her inferiors; yea, that which rendered her more eminently renowned was, that being a priest of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> (for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401330RGal class=ethnic long=33 lat=40.1>Galatians</a> worship that goddess most) she did always appear magnificently adorned in all sacred processions and at the sacrifices. Wherefore <a href=/people/4307 target=_blank>Synorix</a>, falling in love with her, could not prevail either by persuasions or violence, whilst her husband lived. He commits a horrid crime, — he slays <a href=/people/3471 target=_blank>Sinatus</a> treacherously, — and not long after accosts <a href=/people/3356 target=_blank>Camma</a>, whilst she abode within the temple, and bore <a href=/people/4307 target=_blank>Synorix</a>'s crime not in an abject and despondent manner, but with a mind intent upon revenge on <a href=/people/4307 target=_blank>Synorix</a>, and only waiting an opportunity. He was importunate in his humble addresses, neither did he seem to use arguments that were without all show of honesty. For as in other things he pretended that he far excelled <a href=/people/3471 target=_blank>Sinatus</a>, so he slew him for the love he bare to <a href=/people/3356 target=_blank>Camma</a> and for no other wicked design. The woman's denials were at first not very peremptory, and then by little and little she seemed to be softened towards him. Her familiars and friends also lay at her in the service and favor of <a href=/people/4307 target=_blank>Synorix</a>, who was a man of great power, persuading and even forcing her. In fine therefore she consented, and accordingly sent for him to come to her, that the mutual contract and covenant might be solemnized in the presence of the Goddess. When he came, she received him with much courtesy, and bringing him before the altar and pouring out some of the drink-offering upon the altar out of the bowls, part of the remainder she drank herself and part she gave him to drink. The cup was poisoned mead. As she saw him drink it all up, she lifted up a shrill loud voice, and fell down and worshipped her Goddess, saying: I call thee to witness, O most reverend Divinity! that for this very day's work's sake I have over-lived the murder of <a href=/people/3471 target=_blank>Sinatus</a>, no otherwise taking any comfort in this part of my life but in the hope of revenge that I have had. And now I go down to my husband. And for thee, the lewdest person among men, let thy relations prepare a sepulchre, instead of a bride-chamber and nuptials. When the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401330RGal class=demonym long=33 lat=40.1>Galatian</a> heard these things, and perceived the poison to wamble up and down and indispose his body, he ascended his chariot, hoping to be relieved by the jogging and shaking. But he presently alighted, and put himself into a litter, and died that evening. <a href=/people/3356 target=_blank>Camma</a> continued all that night, and being told that he had ended his life, she comfortably and cheerfully expired. </p>                        </div>

For when <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> took <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a> and the soldiers fell a plundering, some in one part and some in another, it happened that a man, neither civil nor sober but mischievous and mad, took up his quarters in <a href=/people/3476 target=_blank>Timoclea</a>'s house. He was a captain to a Thracian company, and the king's namesake, but nothing like him; for he having no regard either to the family or estate of this woman, when he had swilled himself in wine after supper, commanded her to come and lie with him. Neither ended he here, but enquired for gold and silver, whether she had not some hid by her; sometimes threatening as if he would kill her, sometimes flattering as if he would always repute her in the place of a wife. She, taking the occasion offered by him, said: Would God I had died before this night came, rather than lived to it; that though all other things had been lost, I might have preserved my body free from abuse. But now seeing it is thus come to pass, and Divine Providence hath thus disposed of it that I must repute thee my guardian, lord, and husband, I will not hold any thing from thee that is thine own. And as for myself, I see I am at thy disposition. As for corporeal enjoyments, the world was mine, I had silver bowls, I had gold, and some money; but when this city was taken, I commanded my maids to pack it up altogether, and threw it, or rather put it for security, into a well that had no water in it. Neither do many know of it, for it hath a covering, and nature hath provided a shady wood round about it. Take then these things, and much good may they do thee; and they shall lie by thee, as certain tokens and marks of the late flourishing fortune and splendor of our family. When the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=person long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> heard these things, he stayed not for day, but presently went to the place by <a href=/people/3476 target=_blank>Timoclea</a>'s conduct, commanding the garden-door to be shut, that none might perceive what they were about. He descended in his morning vestment. But the revengeful <a href=/people/1726 target=_blank>Clotho</a> brought dreadful things upon him by the hand of <a href=/people/3476 target=_blank>Timoclea</a>, who stood on the top of the well; for as soon as she perceived by his voice that he reached the bottom, she threw down abundance of stones upon him, and her maids rolled in many and great ones, till they had dashed him to pieces and buried him under them. As soon as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> came to understand this and had taken up the corpse, there having been late proclamation that none of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a> should be slain, they seized her and carried her before the king and declared her audacious exploit; but the king, who by the gravity of her countenance and stateliness of her behavior did perceive in her something that savored of the greatest worth and nobility, asked her first, What woman art thou? She courageously and undauntedly answered: <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> was my brother, who was a commander at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385228PCha class=place long=22.8416 lat=38.4944>Chaeronea</a>, and lost his life fighting against you in defence of the Grecian liberty, that we might not suffer any such thing; and seeing I have suffered things unworthy of my rank, I refuse not to die; for it is better so to do than to experience another such a night as the last, which awaits me unless thou forbid it. All the most tender-spirited persons that were present broke out into tears; but <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was not for pitying her, as being a woman above pity. But he admired her fortitude and eloquence, which had taken strong hold on him, and charged his officers to have a special care and look to the guards, lest any such abuse be offered again to any renowned family; and dismissed <a href=/people/3476 target=_blank>Timoclea</a>, charging them to have a special regard to her and all that should be found to be of her family. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg083:25'><b>&sect; 25</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;ERYXO: <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> was the son of <a href=/people/586 target=_blank>Battus</a> who was surnamed Felix, not at all like to his father in his conversation. His father, when he lived, laid a fine of a talent upon him for making fortifications about his house. After his father's death he being of a rugged disposition (therefore surnamed the Severe), and following the counsels of <a href=/people/3408 target=_blank>Laarchus</a>, an ill friend, became a tyrant instead of a king. For <a href=/people/3408 target=_blank>Laarchus</a> affecting the government for himself, either banished or slew the noblemen of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a>, and charged the fault upon <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a>; and at last casting him into a wasting and grievous disease, by giving him the sea-hare in his drink, he deprived him of his life. So that <a href=/people/3408 target=_blank>Laarchus</a> assumed the government, under pretence of being protector to <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a>'s young son <a href=/people/586 target=_blank>Battus</a>; but the youth, by reason either of his lameness or youthful age, was contemned. As for his mother, many made addresses to her, being a modest and courteous woman, and she had many of the commons and nobility at her devotion. Therefore <a href=/people/3408 target=_blank>Laarchus</a>, pretending to be her humble servant, would needs marry her, and thereby take <a href=/people/586 target=_blank>Battus</a> to the dignity of being son and then allow him a share in the government. But <a href=/people/3022 target=_blank>Eryxo</a> (for that was the woman's name), taking counsel of her brethren, bade <a href=/people/3408 target=_blank>Laarchus</a> treat with them as if she had designed marriage; <a href=/people/3408 target=_blank>Laarchus</a> accordingly treating with <a href=/people/3022 target=_blank>Eryxo</a>'s brethren, they on purpose delay and prolong the business. <a href=/people/3022 target=_blank>Eryxo</a> sends one of her maid-servants acquainting him, that for the present her brethren did oppose the match, but if they could but accomplish it so as to lie together once, her brethren would cease arguing the matter any farther, and would give their consent. He should therefore come to her by night, if he pleased; an entrance being once made in a business, the rest will succeed well enough. These things were mighty pleasing to <a href=/people/3408 target=_blank>Laarchus</a>, and he was much inflamed by the woman's obliging carriage towards him, and declared that he would come to whatever place she should command him. These things <a href=/people/3022 target=_blank>Eryxo</a> transacted with the privity of <a href=/people/2653 target=_blank>Polyarchus</a>, her eldest brother. A time being now appointed for the congress, <a href=/people/2653 target=_blank>Polyarchus</a> placed himself in his sister's bed-chamber, together with two young men that were sword-men, all out of sight, to revenge the death of his father, whom <a href=/people/3408 target=_blank>Laarchus</a> had lately murdered. <a href=/people/3022 target=_blank>Eryxo</a> sending at the time to acquaint him, he entered without his guard, and the young men falling upon him, he was wounded with the sword and died; the corpse immediately they threw over the wall. <a href=/people/586 target=_blank>Battus</a> they brought forth and proclaimed king over his father's dominions, and <a href=/people/2653 target=_blank>Polyarchus</a> restored to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=ethnic long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrenaeans</a> their ancient constitution of government. There were present at that time many soldiers of <a href=/people/424 target=_blank>Amasis</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> king; whom <a href=/people/3408 target=_blank>Laarchus</a> had employed and found faithful, and by whose means he had been not a little formidable to the citizens. These sent messengers to accuse <a href=/people/2653 target=_blank>Polyarchus</a> and <a href=/people/3022 target=_blank>Eryxo</a> to <a href=/people/424 target=_blank>Amasis</a>. At this the king was greatly incensed, and determined to make war upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=ethnic long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrenaeans</a>. But it happened that his mother died, and while he was solemnizing her funeral, ambassadors came and brought the news of his intentions to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a>. Wherefore it was thought best by <a href=/people/2653 target=_blank>Polyarchus</a> to go and apologize for himself. <a href=/people/3022 target=_blank>Eryxo</a> would not desert him, but was resolved to accompany him and run the same hazard with him. Nor would his mother <a href=/people/10813 target=_blank>Critola</a> leave him, though she was an old woman; for great was her dignity, she being the sister of old <a href=/people/586 target=_blank>Battus</a>, surnamed Felix. As soon as they came into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, as others with admiration approved of the exploit, so even <a href=/people/424 target=_blank>Amasis</a> himself did not a little applaud the chastity and fortitude of <a href=/people/3022 target=_blank>Eryxo</a>, honoring her with presents and royal attendance, with which he sent back <a href=/people/2653 target=_blank>Polyarchus</a> and the ladies into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a>. </p>                        </div>

He was called by the barbarians Malakos (that is soft and effeminate) with regard merely to his youth; because, when he was a mere stripling, with other companions of the same age who wore long hair (whence they were called Coronistae, as it seems from their long hair), he became famous in the war against the barbarians. He was also not only renowned for resolution and activity, but very exceedingly remarkable for his discretion and providence; insomuch that being admired by the citizens he proceeded to the highest dominion among them. He was to bring aid to the Romans when they were in war with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Etrurians</a>, who engaged to restore <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> <a href=/people/2188 target=_blank>Superbus</a> to his kingdom; in all which expedition, that was very long, he managed all affairs so as to ingratiate himself with the military part of the citizens, aiming more at the making himself head of a popular faction than general of the army. He accordingly prevailed with them to join with him in attacking the senate, and in casting out the citizens of highest rank and most potent into exile. Afterwards becoming tyrant, he was flagitious in his carriage towards women and free-born youth, and exceeded even himself in vileness. For history reports of him how that he accustomed the boys to wear their hair long and set with golden ornaments, and the girls he compelled to be polled round, and to wear youths' jerkins and short-tailed petticoats. Notwithstanding, he had a peculiar affection for <a href=/people/5316 target=_blank>Xenocrita</a>, a girl of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=person long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a>, left behind by her exiled father. Her he kept, but could not bring over to his humor by any insinuations or persuasions, neither had he gained her father's consent; however, he reckoned the maid would be brought to love him by constant conversation with him, since she would be envied and reputed very happy by the citizens. But these things did not at all besot the maid; but she took it heinously that she must be constrained to dwell with him, not espoused or married. Neither did she less long for the liberty of her native country than did those who were hated by the tyrant. It happened about that time that <a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemus</a> was casting up an entrenchment about the borders of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=place long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a>, a work neither necessary nor profitable, only because he was resolved to tire out the citizens with hard toil and labor; for every one was required to carry out a stinted number of baskets of earth daily, in order to the delving this ditch. A certain maid, as she saw <a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemus</a> approaching, ran aside and covered her face with her apron; but when <a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemus</a> was withdrawn, the young men would sport and jest with her, asking her whether out of modesty she avoided only the sight of <a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemus</a> and was not so affected towards other men. She made answer designedly, rather than otherwise, that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=ethnic long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumaeans</a> <a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemus</a> was the only man. This sentence thus spoken verily touched them all very near, for it provoked the generous-minded men among them for very shame to the recovering of their liberties. And it is said that <a href=/people/5316 target=_blank>Xenocrita</a> was heard to say, that she had rather carry earth for her father, if he were at home, than participate in the great luxury and pomp of <a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemus</a>. These things added courage to them that were about to make an insurrection against <a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemus</a>, which Thymoteles had the chief management of; for <a href=/people/5316 target=_blank>Xenocrita</a> providing them safe admittance, they easily rushed in upon <a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemus</a>, unarmed and unguarded, and slew him. In this manner the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=place long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a> gained its liberty, by the virtue of two women; one by suggesting and invigorating the enterprise, the other by bringing it to an issue. When honors and great presents were tendered to <a href=/people/5316 target=_blank>Xenocrita</a>, she refused all; but requested one thing, that she might bury the corpse of <a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemus</a>. This they delivered her, and made her a priestess of <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>; reckoning that, as it was a deserved honor bestowed on her, so she would be no less acceptable to the Goddess. </p>                        </div>

Their wives laid down their petition at his gate, addressing themselves to the wife of <a href=/people/1791 target=_blank>Pythes</a>. She bade them all depart and be of good cheer; but those goldsmiths which she confided most in she required to wait upon her, and confining them commanded them to make up golden loaves, all sorts of junkets and summer-fruits, all sorts of fish and flesh meats, in which she knew <a href=/people/1791 target=_blank>Pythes</a> was most delighted. All things being provided, <a href=/people/1791 target=_blank>Pythes</a> coming home then (for he happened to go a long journey) and asking for his supper, his wife set a golden table before him, having no edible food upon it, but all golden. <a href=/people/1791 target=_blank>Pythes</a> admired the workmanship for its imitation of nature. When, however, he had sufficiently fed his eyes, he called in earnest for something to eat; but his wife, when he asked for any sort, brought it of gold. Whereupon being provoked, he cried out, I am an hungered. She replied: Thou hast made none other provisions for us; every skilful science and art being laid aside, no man works in husbandry; but neglecting sowing, planting, and tilling the ground, we delve and search for useless things, killing ourselves and our subjects. These things moved <a href=/people/1791 target=_blank>Pythes</a>, but not so as to give over all his works about the mine; for he now commanded a fifth part of the citizens to that work, the rest he converted to husbandry and manufactures. But when <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> made an expedition into Greece, <a href=/people/1791 target=_blank>Pythes</a>, being most splendid in his entertainments and presents, requested a gracious favor of the king, that since he had many sons, one might be spared from the camp to remain with him, to cherish his old age. At which <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> in a rage slew this son only which he desired, and cut him in two pieces, and commanded the army to march between the two parts of the corpse. The rest he took along with him, and all of them were slain in the wars. At which <a href=/people/1791 target=_blank>Pythes</a> fell into a despairing condition, so that he fell under the like suffering with many wicked men and fools. He dreaded death, but was weary of his life; yea, he was willing not to live, but could not cast away his life. He had this project. There was a great mound of earth in the city, and a river running by it, which they called Pythopolites. In that mound he prepared him a sepulchre, and diverted the stream so as to run just by the side of the mound, the river lightly washing the sepulchre. These things being finished, he enters into the sepulchre, committing the city and all the government thereof to his wife; commanding her not to come to him, but to send his supper daily laid on a sloop, till the sloop should pass by the sepulchre with the supper untouched; and then she should cease to send, as supposing him dead. He verily passed in this manner the rest of his life; but his wife took admirable care of the government, and brought in a reformation of all things amiss among the people. </p>                        </div>
