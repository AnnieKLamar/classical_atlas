It is my belief you are jealous, Do you remember? we were playing on the shore at the foot of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377150LAit class=place long=15.001 lat=37.748>Etna</a>, where the long strip of beach comes between the mountain and the sea; he was feeding his <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, and spied us from above; yes, but he never so much as glanced at the rest of you; I was the pretty one; he was all eyes — eye, I mean — for me. That is what makes you spiteful, because it showed I was better than you, good enough to be loved, while you were taken no notice of. <br />DOR: Hoity-toity! jealous indeed! because a one-eyed shepherd thinks you pretty! Why, what could he see in you but your white skin? and he only cared for that because it reminded him of cheese and milk; he thinks everything pretty that is like them. If you want to know any more than that about your looks, sit on a rock when it is calm, and lean over the water; just a bit of white skin, that is all; and who cares for that, if it is not picked out with some red? <br />GAL: Well, if I am all white, I have got a lover of some sort; there is not a shepherd or a sailor or a boatman to care for any of you. Besides, <a href=/people/882 target=_blank>Polyphemus</a> is very musical. <br />DOR: Take care, dear; we heard him singing the other day when he serenaded you. Heavens! one would have taken him for an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> braying. And his lyre! what a thing! A stag's skull, with its horns for the uprights; he put a bar across, and fastened on the strings without any tuning-pegs! then came the performance, all harsh and out of tune; he shouted something himself, and the lyre played something else, and the love ditty sent us into fits of laughter. Why, <a href=/people/741 target=_blank>Echo</a>, chatterbox that she is, would not answer him; she was ashamed to be caught mimicking such a rough ridiculous song. Oh, and the pet that your beau brought you in his arms! — a bear cub nearly as shaggy as himself. Now then, <a href=/people/1498 target=_blank>Galatea</a>, do you still think we envy you your lover? <br />GAL: Well, <a href=/people/1326 target=_blank>Doris</a>, only show us your own; no doubt he is much handsomer, and sings and plays far better. <br />DOR: Oh, I have not got one; I do not set up to be lovely. But one like the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a> — faugh, he might be one of his own <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>! — he eats raw meat, they say, and feeds on travellers — one like him, dear, you may keep; I wish you nothing worse than to return his love. </p>                        </div>

Her name is <a href=/people/1146 target=_blank>Amymone</a>; I asked about that and her family. <a href=/people/303 target=_blank>Danaus</a> understands discipline; he is bringing them up to do everything for themselves; they have to fetch water, and make themselves generally useful. <br />POSEID: And does she come all that way by herself, from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375227ULer class=place long=22.7182 lat=37.5511>Lerna</a>? <br />TRI: Yes; and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>, you know, is a thirsty place; she is always having to get water. <br />POSEID: <a href=/people/664 target=_blank>Triton</a>, this is most exciting.

Just fetch me out a good fast <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphin</a>; that will be quickest. <br />TRITON: Here is a racer for you. <br />POSEID: Good; now let us be off. You swim alongside. — Here we are at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375227ULer class=place long=22.7182 lat=37.5511>Lerna</a>. I'll lie in ambush hereabouts; and you keep a look-out.

Come, you shall have a fountain called after you; it shall spring up in this very place, near the waves; I will strike the rock with my trident. — Think how nice it will be being dead, and not having to carry water any more, like all your sisters. </p>                        </div>

He had made no secret of the gold and silver he had with him; and when they were in mid <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381253WAeg class=demonym long=25.3 lat=38.1>Aegean</a>, the sailors rose against him. As I was swimming alongside, I heard all that went on. 'Since your minds are made up,' says <a href=/people/777 target=_blank>Arion</a>, 'at least let me get my mantle on, and sing my own dirge; and then I will throw myself into the sea of my own accord.' — The sailors agreed. He threw his minstrel's cloak about him, and sang a most sweet melody; and then he let himself drop into the water, never doubting but that his last moment had come. But I caught him up on my back, and swam to shore with him at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364225STai class=place long=22.4867 lat=36.4018>Taenarum</a>. <br />POSEID: I am glad to find you a patron of the arts.

Let her grave be the sea which bears her name. We are so sorry for her; that step-mother's treatment of her was shocking. <br />POSEID: No, my dear, that may not be. And indeed it is not desirable that she should lie here under the sand; her grave shall be in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399263RTro class=place long=26.27 lat=39.915>Troad</a>, as I said, or in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403265LChe class=place long=26.5 lat=40.3333>Chersonese</a>. It will be no small consolation to her that <a href=/people/311 target=_blank>Ino</a> will have the same fate before long.

I wonder what made the poor child fall off the ram; her brother <a href=/people/548 target=_blank>Phrixus</a> held on all right. <br />POSEID: Of course he did; a lusty youth equal to the flight; but it was all too strange for her; sitting on that queer mount, looking down on yawning space, terrified, overpowered by the heat, giddy with the speed, she lost her hold on the ram's horns, and down she came into the sea. <a href=/people/590 target=_blank>Nereid</a>. Surely her mother <a href=/people/2809 target=_blank>Nephele</a> should have broken her fall. <br />POSEID: I dare say; but <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a> is a great deal too strong for <a href=/people/2809 target=_blank>Nephele</a>. </p>                        </div>

What was it all about? Did you hear? <br />THE: Her father, <a href=/people/864 target=_blank>Acrisius</a>, wanted to keep her from marrying. And, as she was so pretty, he shut her up in an iron room. And — I don't know whether it's true — but they say that <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> turned himself into gold, and came showering down through the roof, and she caught the gold in her lap, — and it was <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> all the time. And then her father found out about it — he is a horrid, jealous old man — and he was furious, and thought she had been receiving a lover; and he put her into the chest, the moment the child was born. <br />DORIS: And what did she do then? <br />THE: She never said a word against her own sentence; she was ready to submit: but she pleaded hard for the child's life, and cried, and held him up for his grandfather to see; and there was the sweet babe, that thought no harm, smiling at the waves. I am beginning again, at the mere remembrance of it. <br />DORIS: You make me cry, too. And is it all over? <br />THE: No; the chest has carried them safely so far; it is by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372245PSer class=place long=24.506 lat=37.154>Seriphos</a>. <br />DORIS: Then why should we not save them?

You were not there, <a href=/people/2367 target=_blank>Notus</a>? <br />SOUTH: Pageant, <a href=/people/444 target=_blank>Zephyr</a>? what pageant? and whose? <br />WEST: You missed a most ravishing spectacle; such another chance you are not likely to have. <br />SOUTH: I was busy with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Red Sea</a>; and I gave the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> coasts a little airing too.

A fine sight he was — spotless white skin, crumpled horns, and gentle eyes. He gambolled on the shore with them, bellowing most musically, till <a href=/people/434 target=_blank>Europa</a> took heart of grace and mounted him. No sooner had she done it than, with her on his back, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> made off at a run for the sea, plunged in, and began swimming; she was dreadfully frightened, but kept her seat by clinging to one of his horns with her left hand, while the right held her skirt down against the puffs of wind. <br />SOUTH: A lovely sight indeed, <a href=/people/444 target=_blank>Zephyr</a>, in every sense — <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> swimming with his darling on his back. <br />WEST: Ay, but what followed was lovelier far. Every wave fell; the sea donned her robe of peace to speed them on their way; we winds made holiday and joined the train, all eyes; fluttering Loves skimmed the waves, just dipping now and again a heedless toe — in their hands lighted torches, on their lips the nuptial song; up floated <a href=/people/590 target=_blank>Nereids</a> — few but were prodigal of naked charms — and clapped their hands, and kept pace on <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphin</a> steeds; the <a href=/people/664 target=_blank>Triton</a> company, with every sea-creature that frights not the eye, tripped it around the maid; for <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> on his car, with <a href=/people/1147 target=_blank>Amphitrite</a> by him, led them in festal mood, ushering his brother through the waves. But, crowning all, a <a href=/people/664 target=_blank>Triton</a> pair bore <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, reclined on a shell, heaping the bride with all flowers that blow. So went it from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenice</a> even to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>. But, when he set foot on the isle, behold, the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> was no more; 'twas <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> that took <a href=/people/434 target=_blank>Europa</a>'s hand and led her to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352254CAig class=demonym long=25.4452 lat=35.1627>Dictaean</a> Cave — blushing and downward-eyed; for she knew now the end of her bringing. But we plunged this way and that, and roused the still seas anew. <br />SOUTH: Ah me, what sights of bliss! and I was looking at griffins, and elephants, and blackamoors! </p>                        </div>
