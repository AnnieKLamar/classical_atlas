As far as I can judge this name was not conferred upon the city when it was first settled, but originally it bore another name.

I will speak also of the laws which govern its holy rites, of its popular assemblies and of the sacrifices offered by its citizens. I will speak also of all the traditions attaching to the founders of this holy place: and of the manner of the founding of its temple. I write as an <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> born who have witnessed with mine own eyes some of the facts which I am about to narrate: some, again, I learnt from the priests: they occurred before my time, but I narrate them as they were told to me. </p>                        </div>

A river, flowing from Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/339358LLib class=place long=35.765 lat=33.925>Libanus</a>, discharges itself into the sea: this river bears the name of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340356WAdo class=place long=35.6522 lat=34.0633>Adonis</a>. Every year regularly it is tinged with blood, and loses its proper colour before it falls into the sea: it dyes the sea, to a large space, red: and thus announces their time of mourning to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/341356PByb class=ethnic long=35.646 lat=34.119>Byblians</a>. Their story is that during these days <a href=/people/430 target=_blank>Adonis</a> is wounded, and that the river's nature is changed by the blood which flows into its waters; and that it takes its name from this blood. Such is the legend vulgarly accepted: but a man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/341356PByb class=place long=35.646 lat=34.119>Byblos</a>, who seemed to me to be telling the truth, told me another reason for this marvellous change. He spoke as follows: This river, my friend and guest, passes through the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/339358LLib class=place long=35.765 lat=33.925>Libanus</a>: now this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/339358LLib class=place long=35.765 lat=33.925>Libanus</a> abounds in red earth. The violent winds which blow regularly on those days bring down into the river a quantity of earth resembling vermilion. It is this earth that turns the river to red. And thus the change in the river's colour is due, not to blood as they affirm, but to the nature of the soil. This was the story of the Byblian. But even assuming that he spoke the truth, yet there certainly seems to me something supernatural in the regular coincidence of the wind and the colouring of the river. </p>                        </div>

I have heard the story about <a href=/people/10993 target=_blank>Deukalion</a> as the Greeks narrate it from the Greeks themselves. The story runs as follows: The present race of men was not the first to be created. The first generation perished to a man; the present is a second creation. This generation became a vast multitude, owing to <a href=/people/10993 target=_blank>Deukalion</a>. Of the men of the original creation they tell this tale: they were rebellious, and wilful, and performed unholy deeds, disregarding the sanctity of oaths and hospitality, and behaving cruelly to suppliants; and it was for these misdeeds that the great destruction fell upon them. Straightway the earth discharged a vast volume of water, and the rivers of heaven came down in streams and the sea mounted high. Thus everything became water, and all men perished; <a href=/people/10993 target=_blank>Deukalion</a> alone was saved for another generation, on the score of his wisdom and piety. The manner of his salvation was as follows: He placed his children and his wives in an ark of vast size, and he himself also entered in. Now, when he had embarked, there came to him wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and generations of <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> and <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a>, and all the other beasts which roam the earth, all in couples. He welcomed them all. Nor did they harm him; and friendship remained amongst them as <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> himself ordained. These, one and all, floated in this ark as long as the flood remained.

I have actually seen this chasm, it lies beneath the temple and is of very small dimensions. If it was once of large size, and was afterwards reduced to its present small dimensions, I know not: but the chasm which I saw is certainly very small. They maintain that their tale is proved by the following occurrence; twice in every year the water comes from the sea to the temple. This water is brought by the priests; but besides them, all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a> and many from beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> go down to the sea; one and all bring its water which they first pour out in the temple; then this water passes down into the chasm which, small though it be, holds a vast quantity of water.

For when <a href=/people/243 target=_blank>Rhea</a> deprived him of his powers, he put off his manly garb and assumed the appearance of a woman and her dress, and roaming over the whole earth he performed his mysterious rites, narrating his sufferings and chanting the praises of <a href=/people/243 target=_blank>Rhea</a>.

This I take to be the <a href=/people/1082 target=_blank>Stratonice</a> of whom her stepson was enamoured, and the skill of a doctor detected the intrigue: for the lover, overpowered by the malady of his passion, bewildered by the thought of his shameful caprice, lay sick in silence. He lay sick, and though no ache was in any limb, yet his colour was gone, and his frame was growing frailer day by day. The doctor, seeing that he was suffering from no definite disease, perceived that his malady was none other than love. Many are the symptoms of secret love: languor of vision, change in the voice and complexion, and frequent tears. The doctor, aware of this, acted as follows: he laid his hand on the heart of the young man, and summoned all the domestics in the household. The patient remained tranquil and unmoved on the entrance of the rest, but when his stepmother carne in he grew pale and fell to sweating and trembling, and his heart beat violently. These symptoms betrayed his passion to the doctor. </p>                        </div>

He longs to possess what he will never obtain; he loves my wife, whom I will never give up. This was the trick of the wise physician. The father straightway begged the doctor by his prudence and professional skill not to let his son perish. His malady depended not on his will; it was involuntary. Pray then do not you let your jealousy bring grief on the whole realm, and do not, dear doctor, draw unpopularity on your profession. Such was the unwitting father's request. The doctor replied: Your request is scandalous. You would deprive me of my wife and outrage the honour of a medical man. I put it to you, what would be your conduct, since you are deprecating mine, if your wife were the object of his guilty love? He replied that he would not spare his own wife nor would he begrudge his son his life, even though that son were enamoured of his own stepmother: losing one's wife was a less misfortune than losing one's son. The doctor on hearing this said: Why then offer me these entreaties? In good truth, your wife is the object of his love. What I said to you was all a made-up story. The father followed this advice, and handed over his wife and his kingdom to his son, and he himself departed into the region of <a href=/people/471 target=_blank>Babylonia</a> and founded a city on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> which bore his name: and there he died. Thus it was that our wise doctor detected and cured the malady. </p>                        </div>

Thus I must even perform a mighty deed which will heal all my fears. Saying this he unmanned himself, and he stowed away the mutilated pudenda in a little vessel together with myrrh and honey and spices of various sorts. He sealed this vessel up with a ring which he wore; and finally he proceeded to dress his wound.

At last, in despair at her impotency to master her passion, she sought a suitable occasion for supplicating his love. She was too cautious to admit her passion to a stranger, but her modesty prevented her from facing the situation. Finally she hits on this plan; that she should confront him after she should have drunk deeply of wine; for courage rises after drinking and a repulse seems then less degrading, and actions performed under the influence of wine are set down to ignorance. Thus she acted as she thought best. After supper she entered the chamber in which <a href=/people/1823 target=_blank>Combabus</a> dwelt, and besought him, embracing his knees, and she avowed her guilty love. He heard her words with disgust and rejected her advances, reproaching her with drunkenness. She, however, threatened that she would bring on him a great calamity; on which he trembled, and he told her all his story and narrated all that he had done and finally disclosed to her the manifest proofs of his statement. When the queen witnessed this unexpected proof her passion indeed was quenched, but she never forgot her love, but in all her intercourse she cherished the solace of her unavailing affection.

In the propylaia those phalli stand which <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> erected: they stand thirty fathoms high. Into one of these a man mounts twice every year, and he abides on the summit of the phallus for the space of seven days. The reason of this ascent is given as follows: The people believe that the man who is aloft holds converse with the gods, and prays for good fortune for the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, and that the gods from their neighbourhood hear his prayers.

As he mounts he jerks the chain up his own length, as a driver his reins. Those who have not seen this process, but who have seen those who have to climb palm trees in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>, or in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, or any other place, will understand what I mean. When he has climbed to the top, he lets down a different chain, a long one, and drags up anything that he wants, such as wood, clothing, and vases; he binds these together and sits upon them, as it were, on a nest, and he remains there for the space of time that I have mentioned. Many visitors bring him gold and silver, and some bring brass; then those who have brought these offerings leave them and depart, and each visitor gives his name. A bystander shouts the name up; and he on hearing the name utters a prayer for each donor; between the prayers he raises a sound on a brazen instrument which, on being shaken, gives forth a loud and grating noise. He never sleeps; for if at any time sleep surprises him, a scorpion creeps up and wakes him, and stings him severely; this is the penalty for wrongfully sleeping. This story about the scorpion is a sacred one, and one of the mysteries of religion; whether it is true I cannot say, but, as it seems to me, his wakefulness is in no small degree due to his fear of falling. So much then for the climbers of the phalli. As for the temple, it looks to the rising sun. </p>                        </div>

First I will speak of the oracle. There are many oracles among the Greeks, and many, too, among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, and again in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> and in Asia there are many too. But these speak not, save by the mouth of priests and prophets: this one is moved by its own impulse, and carries out the divining process to the very end. The manner of his divination is the following: When he is desirous of uttering an oracle, he first stirs in his seat, and the priests straightway raise him up. Should they fail to raise him up, he sweats, and moves more violently than ever. When they approach him and bear him up, he drives them round in a circle, and leaps on one after another. At last the high priest confronts him, and questions him on every subject. The god, if he disapproves of any action proposed, retreats into the background; if, however, he happens to approve it, he drives his bearers forward as if they were <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. It is thus that they gather the oracles, and they undertake nothing public or private without this preliminary. This god, too, speaks about the symbol, and points out when it is the due season for the expedition of which I spoke in connexion therewith. </p>                        </div>
