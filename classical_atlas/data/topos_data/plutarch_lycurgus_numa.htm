For their points of likeness are obvious from their careers: their wise moderation, their piety, their talent for governing and educating, and their both deriving their laws from a divine source. But each also performed noble deeds peculiar to himself. To begin with, <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> accepted, but <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a> resigned, a kingdom. 2 One got it without asking for it, the other had it and gave it up. One was made by others their sovereign, though a private person and a stranger; the other made himself a private person, though he was a king. It was a noble thing, of course, to win a kingdom by righteousness; but it was also a noble thing to set righteousness above a kingdom. For it was virtue which rendered the one so famous as to be judged worthy of a kingdom, and virtue, too, which made the other so great as to scorn a kingdom. </p>                        </div>

For his efforts were to persuade the citizens, not to take off their breast-plates and lay aside their swords, but to cast away gold and silver, and abandon costly couches and tables; not to cease from wars and hold festivals and sacrifices, but to give up feasting and drinking and practise laboriously as soldiers and athletes. 4 Wherefore the one accomplished all his ends by persuasion, through the good-will and honour in which his people held him; but the other had to risk his life and suffer wounds, and scarcely then prevailed. </p>                        </div>

For this too was one of the institutions of <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a>, as we are told, who thereby admitted to the enjoyment of the yearly fruits of the earth those who had helped to produce them. Some, however, fancy that this custom was a reminder of the equality which characterized the famous Saturnian age, when there was neither slave nor master, but all were regarded as kinsmen and equals. </p>                        </div>

Nor did he reduce the great inequalities resulting therefrom, 5 but left the acquisition of wealth wholly unrestricted, and paid no attention to the great increase of poverty and its gradual influx into the city. And yet it was his duty at the very outset, while as yet there was no general or great disparity of means, but people still lived on much the same plane, to make a stand against rapacity, as <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a> did, and take measures of precaution against its mischiefs; for these were not trifling, but furnished the seed and source of the most and greatest evils of after times. 6 But as regards the redistribution of land, <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a>, in my opinion, is not to be censured for making it, nor <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> for not making it. In the one case, the resulting equality was the foundation and base of his polity; but in the other, since the allotment of lands was recent, there was no urgent reason for introducing another division, or for disturbing the first assignment, which probably was still in force. </p>                        </div>

The Roman husband, if he had a sufficient number of children to rear, and another, who lacked children, could persuade him to the step, relinquished his wife to him, having the power of surrendering her entirely, or only for a season; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=person long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a>, while his wife remained in his house, and the marriage retained its original rights and obligations, might allow any one who gained his consent to share his wife for the purpose of getting children by her. 2 And many husbands, as we have said, would actually invite into their homes men whom they thought most likely to procure them handsome and noble children. What, then, is the difference between the two customs? We may say, perhaps, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=person long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a> implies a complete indifference to the wife, and to the jealous emotions which confound and consume the hearts of most men; while the Roman, as if with shame-faced modesty, makes a veil of the new betrothal, and concedes that community of wives is really insupportable. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a>, while carefully preserving to the matrons that dignified and honourable relation to their husbands which was bestowed on them by <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, when he tried by kindly usage to efface the memory of the violence done them, nevertheless enjoined great modesty upon them, forbade them all busy intermeddling, taught them sobriety, and accustomed them to be silent; wine they were to refrain from entirely, and were not to speak, even on the most necessary topics, unless their husbands were with them. 6 At any rate, it is said that when a woman once pleaded her own cause in the forum, the senate sent to inquire of an oracle what the event might portend for the city. And for their usual gentleness and readiness to obey, there is strong evidence in the specific mention made of those who were less amenable. For just as our Greek historians record the names of those who first slew kinsfolk, or made war on their brothers, or were parricides, or matricides, 7 so the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> make record of the fact that <a href=/people/862 target=_blank>Spurius</a> <a href=/people/2394 target=_blank>Carvilius</a> was the first to divorce his wife, two hundred and thirty years after the founding of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, there being no precedent for it; also that the wife of <a href=/people/1900 target=_blank>Pinarius</a>, Thalaea by name, was the first woman to quarrel with her own mother-in‑law, <a href=/people/7707 target=_blank>Gegania</a>, in the reign of <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> <a href=/people/2188 target=_blank>Superbus</a>. In such fitting and proper manner were marriages regulated by their lawgiver. </p>                        </div>

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, on the other hand, gave their maidens in marriage when they were twelve years old, or even younger. In this way more than any other, it was thought, both their bodies and their dispositions would be pure and undefiled when their husbands took control of them. 2 It is clear, therefore, that one practice regarded nature more, with children in view; the other regarded more the formation of character, with married life in view. </p>                        </div>

For <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> left the bringing up of youths to the wishes or necessities of their fathers. 3 A father might, if he wished, make his son a tiller of the soil, or a shipwright, or might teach him to be a smith or a flute-player, as if it were not important that all of them should be trained with one and the same end in view from the onset, and have their dispositions formed alike; but rather as if they were like passengers on a ship, each coming with a different object and purpose, and each therefore uniting with the rest for the common good only in times of peril, through fear of private loss, but otherwise consulting only his own interests. </p>                        </div>

But when a wise man had consented to be king over a people newly constituted and pliant to his every wish, what should have been his first care, unless it was the rearing of boys and the training of youths so that there might be no confusing differences in their characters, 78but that they might be moulded and fashioned from the very outset so as to walk harmoniously together in the same path of virtue? 5 This, indeed, was what helped <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a> to secure, among other things, the stability and permanence of his laws. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> took oaths to maintain these laws, it is true, but this would have availed little had he not, by means of his training and education of the boys, infused his laws, as it were, into their characters, and made the emulous love of his government an integral part of their rearing. The result was that for more than five hundred years the sovereign and fundamental features of his legislation remained in force, like a strong and penetrating dye. </p>                        </div>

After his death the double doors of the temple which he had kept continuously closed, as if he really had war caged and confined there, were thrown wide open, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> was filled with the blood of the slain.

That is a question which will need a long answer, if I am to satisfy men who hold that betterment consists in wealth, luxury and empire, rather than in safety, gentleness, and that independence which is attended by righteousness. However, it will be thought, I suppose, to favour the superior claims of <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a>, that, whereas the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> increased in power as they did after abandoning the institutions of <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a>'s time, 8 the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a>, on the other hand, just as soon as they forsook the precepts of <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a>, sank from the highest to the lowest place, lost their supremacy over the Greeks, and were in danger of utter destruction. Nevertheless, this remains a great feature in <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a>'s career, and one really divine, that he was a stranger, and yet was summoned to the throne, where he changed the whole nature of the state by force of persuasion alone, and mastered a city which was not yet in sympathy with his views; and that he accomplished this without appeal to arms or any violence (unlike <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a>, who led the nobles in arms against the commons), but by his wisdom and justice won the hearts of all the citizens and brought them into harmony. </p>                        </div>
