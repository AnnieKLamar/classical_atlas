He had a father who was active, indulgent, and, as times then were, wealthy, as well as eminently devoted to literature; and, as he loved learning himself, he instructed his son in all branches of knowledge with which youth ought to be made acquainted. In the boy, too, besides docility of disposition, there was great sweetness of voice, so that he not only imbibed rapidly what was taught him, but repeated it extremely well. He was in consequence distinguished among his companions in his boyhood, and shone forth with more lustre than his noble fellow-students could patiently bear; hence he stirred them all to new exertions by his application. In the number of them were Lucius <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, Caius <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> the younger, and Marcus <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, whom he so attached to himself by his intercourse with them, that no one was ever more dear to them. </p>                        </div>

He himself, in his youth, on account of his connexion with Publius <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a>, who was killed when tribune of the people, was not unapprehensive of sharing in his danger; for <a href=/people/10774 target=_blank>Anicia</a>, <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a>'s cousin, was married to Marcus <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>, the brother of <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a>. When he saw that the state, therefore, after the death of <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a>, was thrown into confusion by the disturbances of <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a>, and that no facility was allowed him of living suitably to his dignity without offending one side or the other (the feelings of the citizens being divided, as some favoured the party of <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> and others that of <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a>) he thought it a proper time for devoting himself to his studies, and betook himself to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. He nevertheless, however, assisted young <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, when declared an enemy, by such means as he could, and relieved him in his exile with money. And, lest his sojourn in a foreign country should cause any detriment to his estate, he transported thither a great portion of his fortune. Here he lived in such a manner, that he was deservedly much beloved by all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>; for, in addition to his interest, which was great for so young a man, he relieved their public exigencies from his own property; since, when the government was obliged to borrow money, and had no fair offer of it, he always came to their aid, and in such a way, that he never received any interest of them, and never allowed them to be indebted to him longer than had been agreed upon; both which modes of acting were for their advantage, for he neither suffered their debt to grow old upon them, nor to be increased by an accumulation of interest. He enhanced this kindness also by other instances of liberality; for he presented the whole of the people with such a supply of corn, that seven modii of wheat (a kind of measure which is called a medimnus at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>) were allotted to each person. </p>                        </div>

As long as he was among them, he prevented any statue from being erected to him; but when absent, he could not hinder it; and they accordingly raised several statues both to him and <a href=/people/402 target=_blank>Phidias</a>, in the most sacred places, for, in their whole management of the state, they took him for their agent and adviser. It was the gift of fortune, then, in the first place, that he was born in that city, above all others, in which was the seat of the empire of the world, and had it not only for his native place but for his home; and, in the next, it was a proof of his wisdom, that when he betook himself to a city which excelled all others in antiquity, politeness, and learning, he became individually dear to it beyond other men. </p>                        </div>

He also recited verses, both in Greek and Latin, in so pleasing a manner that nothing could have been added to its attractions. It was in consequence of these accomplishments that <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> would never suffer him to be out of his company, and wanted to take him away with him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. But when he endeavoured to persuade him to go, Do not desire, I entreat you, replied <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a>, to lead me with you against those, with whom, that I might not bear arms against you, I quitted <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, commending the good feeling of the young man, directed, at his departure, that all the presents which he had received at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> should be carried to his house. <br />Though he resided at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> many years, paying such attention to his property as a not unthrifty father of a family ought to pay, and devoting all the rest of his time either to literature or to the public affairs of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, he nevertheless afforded his services to his friends at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; for he used to come to their elections, and whatever important business of theirs was brought forward, he was never found wanting on the occasion. Thus he showed a singular fidelity to <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> in all his perils; and presented him, when he was banished from his country, with the sum of two hundred and fifty sestertia. And when the affairs of the Romans became tranquil, he returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, in the consulship, as I believe, of Lucius <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a> and Lucius <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>; and the whole city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> observed the day of his departure in such a manner, that they testified by their tears the regret which they would afterwards feel for him. </p>                        </div>

In consequence, he reaped the fruit of his respectful conduct; for <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>, at his death, adopted him by his will, and made him heir to three-fourths of his estate, from which bequest he received about ten thousand sestertia. <br />A sister of <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> was married to Quintus Tullius Cicero; and Marcus <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> had been the means of forming the connexion, a man with whom <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> had lived in the closest intimacy from the time that they were fellow-students, in much greater intimacy, indeed, than with Quintus; whence it may be concluded that, in establishing friendship, similarity of manners has more influence than affinity.

He aimed at no offices (though they were open to him as well through his influence as through his high standing), since they could neither be sought in the ancient method, nor be gained without violating the laws in the midst of such unrestrained extravagance of bribery, nor be exercised for the good of the country without danger in so corrupt a state of the public morals.

Offers of places, under several consuls and praetors, he received in such a way as never to follow any one into his province, being content with the honour, and not solicitous to make any addition to his property; for he would not even go into Asia with Quintus Cicero, when he might have held the office of legate under him; for he did not think it became him, after he had declined to take the praetorship, to become the attendant on a praetor. In such conduct he consulted not only his dignity but his quiet; since he avoided even the suspicion of evil practices. Hence it happened that attentions received from him were more valued by all, as they saw that they were attributable to kindness, not to fear or hope. </p>                        </div>

It was projected by some that a private fund should be formed by the Roman knights for the assassins of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; a scheme which they thought might easily be accomplished if even only the leading men of that order would furnish contributions. <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> was accordingly solicited by Caius <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a>, an intimate friend of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, to consent to become a promoter of the plan.

He was her surety in all cases, and even when she had bought an estate, in her prosperous circumstances, to be paid for by a certain day, and was unable after her reverse of fortune to borrow money to discharge the debt, he came to her aid, and lent her the money without interest, and without requiring any security for the repayment, thinking it the greatest gain to be found grateful and obliging, and to show, at the same time, that it was his practice to be a friend, not to fortune but to men; and when he acted in such a manner, no one could imagine that he acted for the sake of time-serving, for it entered into nobody's thoughts that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> could regain his authority.

He accordingly withdrew from the forum on the approach of the leaders, from dread of the proscription, and lived in retirement at the house of Publius <a href=/people/1860 target=_blank>Volumnius</a>, to whom, as we have said, he had not long before given assistance; (such were the vicissitudes of fortune in those days, that sometimes one party, and sometimes the other, was in the greatest exaltation or in the greatest peril;) and he had with him Quintus <a href=/people/1509 target=_blank>Gellius</a> <a href=/people/3357 target=_blank>Canus</a>, a man of the same age, and of a character very similar to his own; and this also may be given as an instance of the goodness of <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>'s disposition, that he lived in such close intimacy with him whom he had known when a boy at school, that their friendship increased even to the end of their lives. But <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, though he was moved with such hatred towards <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, that he showed his enmity, not only to him, but to all his friends, and resolved to proscribe them, yet, at the instance of many, was mindful of the obliging conduct of <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>; and, after ascertaining where he was, wrote to him with his own hand, that he need be under no apprehension, but might come to him immediately; as he had excepted him and <a href=/people/1509 target=_blank>Gellius</a> <a href=/people/3357 target=_blank>Canus</a>, for his sake, from the number of the proscribed; and that he might not fall into any danger, as the message was sent at night, he appointed him a guard.

Indulging his liberality in such a manner, he incurred no enmities, since he neither injured any one, nor was he, if he received any injury, more willing to resent than to forget it. Kindnesses that he received he kept in perpetual remembrance; but such as he himself conferred, he remembered only so long as he who had received them was grateful.

Other kinds of artificers, also, such as domestic necessities require, were very good there, yet he had no one among them that was not born and instructed in his house; all which particulars are proofs, not only of his self-restraint, but of his attention to his affairs; for not to desire inordinately what he sees desired by many, gives proof of a man's moderation; and to procure what he requires by labour rather than by purchase, manifests no small exertion. <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> was elegant, not magnificent; polished, not extravagant; he studied, with all possible care, neatness, and not profusion.

Of a matter which he had once taken in hand, he was never weary; for he thought his reputation, than which he held nothing more dear, concerned in the accomplishment of it. Hence it happened that he managed all the commissions of the <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Ciceros</a>, <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, Quintus <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>, Aulus <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, and of many Roman knights besides. It may therefore be thought certain that he declined business of state, not from indolence, but from judgment. </p>                        </div>

In testimony of this fact (besides the books in which <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> mentions him, and which have been published to the world), there are sixteen books of letters, written to <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, which extend from his consulship to his latter days, and which he that reads will not much require a regular history of those times; for all particulars concerning the inclinations of leading men, the faults of the generals, and the revolutions in the government, are so fully stated in them that every thing is made clear; and it may be easily concluded that wisdom is in some degree divination, as <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> not only predicted that those things would happen which took place during his life, but foretold, like a prophet, the things which are coming to pass at present. </p>                        </div>

He has given similar accounts too, separately, in other books; as, at the request of Marcus <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, he specified in order the members of the Junian family, from its origin to the present age, stating who each was, from whom sprung, what offices he held, and at what time.
