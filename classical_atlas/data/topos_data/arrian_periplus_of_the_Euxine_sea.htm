We surveyed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Euxine</a> sea with the greater pleasure, as we viewed it from the same spot, whence both <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> and Yourself had formerly observed it. Two altars of rough stone are still standing there; but, from the coarseness of the materials, the letters inscribed upon them are indistinctly engraven, and the inscription itself is incorrectly written, as is common among barbarous people. I determined therefore to erect altars of marble, and to engrave the inscription in well marked and distinct characters. Your statue, which stands there, has merit in the idea of the figure, and of the design, as it represents You pointing towards the sea; but it bears no resemblance to the original, and the execution is in other respects but indifferent. Send therefore a statue worthy to be called Yours, and of a similar design to the one which is there at present, as the situation is well calculated for perpetuating, by these means, the memory of any illustrious person. </p>                        </div>

Wherefore, if You would think proper, send to me a statue of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> of not more than five feet in height, as such a size seems well proportioned to that of the building. I request also a statue of <a href=/people/10986 target=_blank>Philesius</a> of four feet in height; for it seems to me reasonable that the latter should have a temple and an altar in common with his ancestor. Hence whilst some persons sacrifice to <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, and some to <a href=/people/10986 target=_blank>Philesius</a>, and others to both, they will all do what is agreeable to both these deities; to <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, as they honour his descendant; to <a href=/people/10986 target=_blank>Philesius</a>, as they honour his ancestor. Wherefore I myself sacrificed an ox there; not as <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> did in the port of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412302UKal class=place long=30.1958 lat=41.1501>Calpe</a>, when he took an ox from a waggon on account of the scarcity of victims; whereas here the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410397PTra class=ethnic long=39.727 lat=40.999>Trapezuntines</a> themselves furnished no contemptible sacrifice. We examined the entrails of the animals sacrificed, and performed our libations upon them. I need not mention to You in whose behalf we first offered our prayers, as You are well acquainted with our custom on such occasions, and as You must be conscious, that You deserve the prayers of all, and especially of those who are under less obligations of gratitude than myself. </p>                        </div>

This body of men, as You know, consists of foot, although they have besides belonging to them twenty horsemen, who are designed for private services only. It has however been found necessary for these men sometimes to act in the capacity of those who throw javelins. Thence we sailed, at first only with the breezes which blow early in the morning from the mouths of the rivers, using however oars at the same time. These breezes were indeed cool, as <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> expresses himself, but not sufficiently strong for us, who wished for a quick voyage. A calm soon followed, when we were reduced to depend upon our oars only. Soon after a cloud suddenly arising burst nearly in an easterly direction from us, and brought on a violent storm of wind, which was entirely contrary to the course that we held, and from the fatal effects of which we had a narrow escape. For it almost instantly produced such a swell of the sea, as to make it appear hollow to the view, and caused a deluge of water to break not only over that part of the ship where the benches of the rowers were placed, but also over the part which is between them and the poop. Our situation was then truly tragical, since as fast as we pumped out the water, so fast did it burst in upon us. The swell of the sea did not however bear upon the side of our vessel; and from this circumstance we were enabled, although with great trouble and difficulty, to make use of our oars, and, after much distressful suffering, to arrive at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412409UAth class=place long=40.8888 lat=41.1773>Athenae</a>. </p>                        </div>

There is a ruined fortress at this place, and an anchorage (ὅρμος), which in the summer season cannot indeed contain many ships, but is sufficient to afford them a shelter from the South wind, and even from the South-East. Ships that put in there might indeed be safe from the North-East wind, but not from the North, nor from that wind, which is called in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>, <a href=/people/6993 target=_blank>Thrascias</a>, but in Greece, <a href=/people/1303 target=_blank>Sciron</a>. During the night there came on a violent storm of thunder and lightning; nor did the wind continue in the same quarter, but came about to the South, and soon after from the South to the South-West, which rendered the anchorage, in which we lay, no longer a safe station. Therefore, before the sea had begun to rage violently, we hauled up at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412409UAth class=place long=40.8888 lat=41.1773>Athenae</a> as many of our ships as it would contain, excepting one trireme, which having found a convenient anchorage under cover of a rock, rode there in safety. <br />We thought proper also to send several of our vessels to the neighbouring beaches to be drawn aground; which succeeded so well, that they all escaped safe, excepting one, which while being beached exposed its side improperly to the wind, and the swell of the sea drove it ashore, where it was wrecked. Every thing on board however was saved, not the sails only, and the nautical instruments, but the bolts also, and the men. We also scraped off the wax, which is as necessary an article in ship-building as any, timber excepted; of which last material there is, as You know, a great quantity in the countries that border upon this sea. The storm continued two days, and necessarily detained us during that time. It would indeed have indicated a want of respect to have passed by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412409UAth class=place long=40.8888 lat=41.1773>Athenae</a>, even the one of that name on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=demonym long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontic</a> sea, as if it were some deserted and nameless port. </p>                        </div>

Before noon we reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416416UAps class=place long=41.5736 lat=41.5732>Apsarus</a>, having sailed more than five hundred stadia. At this place five cohorts are stationed, to whom we delivered their pay, and inspected their arms, the walls, and the ditch, their sick, and their present stock of provisions.

The water of this river is lighter in the balance, and more changeable in its colour, than any with which I am acquainted. Any person may satisfy himself of the superior lightness of this water by weighing it, or by observing that it floats on the surface of the sea without mingling with it. In the same manner <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> says, that the water of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398223WTit class=place long=22.139 lat=39.726>Titaresius</a> floats upon the surface of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399227WPen class=place long=22.7094 lat=39.9298>Peneus</a>: <br />Yet o'er the silver surface pure they flow, <br />The silver stream unmix'd with streams below. <br />The water of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=place long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasis</a>, if you take it from the surface, is fresh; but if any one lets down a jar deep into the stream, he finds the water brackish. It must however be observed, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=demonym long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontic</a> sea is much less salt than the sea without the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>, on account of the rivers which discharge themselves into the former, the number and size of which are beyond computation. We may bring as a proof of its freshness, if any proof can be necessary respecting what is the object of our senses, that all the people who live on its borders lead out their <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> to drink of the water of the sea, which they willingly do; and experience has shewn that they thrive better with this than with fresh water. The colour of the water of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=place long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasis</a> resembles that of water impregnated with lead or tin; but on standing and depositing a sediment, it becomes perfectly pure. It is even provided by the law, that those who sail into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=place long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasis</a> should not import any foreign water into the country; but as soon as they enter the stream, it is signified to them, that they should pour out what water is left in the ship; which if they neglect to do, the common opinion is that their future voyages will not be prosperous. The water of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=place long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasis</a> does not corrupt by keeping, but continues free from any taint of this kind for more than ten years. The only change that takes place is, that it becomes sweeter than it was originally. </p>                        </div>

The walls were formerly of earth, and the towers of wood; but at present both the wall and the towers are built of baked brick, the foundations of which are securely laid, and the whole furnished with warlike engines, and, in short, so fortified in every respect, as to afford no access to the Barbarians, nor to expose those who defend it to the danger of a siege. But as it is advisable that the port should be rendered safe for sea-faring people, and that other places should be secured which lie without the walls of the castle, and are inhabited by people who are now exempted from military service, or by persons engaged in commerce, I thought proper to carry from the double ditch, that sunrounds the wall, another ditch, as far as the river, which may include both the harbour, and the buildings, that lie beyond the walls of the fortifications. </p>                        </div>

Those who come on purpose to the island, carry animals proper for sacrifice with them in their ships, some of which they immolate, and others they set at liberty in honour of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>. Even those, who are compelled by stress of weather to land upon the island, must consult the God himself whether it would be right and proper for them to select for sacrifice any of the animals, which they should find feeding there; offering, at the same time, such a recompense, as to them seems adequate to the value of the animal so selected. But if this should be rejected by the Oracle, for there is an Oracle in this temple, they must then add to their valuation; and if the increased valuation be still rejected, they must increase it again, till they find, from the assent of the Oracle, that the price they offer is deemed sufficient. When this is the case, the beast to be sacrificed stands still of its own accord, and makes no effort to escape. A considerable treasure is laid up in this temple as the price of these victims. </p>                        </div>

They even say further, that <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> has appeared to them not in time of sleep, or a dream, but in a visible form on the mast, or at the extremity of the yards, in the same manner as the <a href=/people/526 target=_blank>Dioscuri</a> have appeared. This distinction however must be made between the appearance of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, and that of the <a href=/people/526 target=_blank>Dioscuri</a>, that the latter appear evidently and clearly to persons, who navigate the sea at large, and when so seen foretell a prosperous voyage; whereas the figure of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> is seen only by such as approach this island.
