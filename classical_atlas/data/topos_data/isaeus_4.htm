It seems, therefore, only natural to me to support their case to the best of my ability. <br />For the events which happened in a foreign land it is not possible to find witnesses or easy to convict our adversaries of any lies which they may tell, because neither of my clients has ever been to the country in question; but the events which have occurred here in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> seem to me to provide you with sufficient proof that all those who lay claim to <a href=/people/5827 target=_blank>Nicostratus</a>'s estate on the ground of bequest are desirous of deceiving you.</p>                        </div>
