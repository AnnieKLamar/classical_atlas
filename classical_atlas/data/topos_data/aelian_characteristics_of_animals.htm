For man has been endowed with speech, of all things the most precious, and has been granted reason, which is of the greatest help and use. Moreover, he knows how to reverence and worship the gods. But that dumb animals should by nature possess some good quality and should have many of man's amazing excellences assigned to them along with man, is indeed a remarkable fact. And to know accurately the special characteristics of each, and how living creatures also have been a source of interest no less than man, demands a trained intelligence and much learning. Now I am well aware of the labour that others have expended on this subject, yet I have collected all the materials that I could; I have clothed them in untechnical language, and am persuaded that my achievement is a treasure far from negligible. So if anyone considers them profitable, let him make use of them; anyone who does not consider them so may give them to his father to keep and attend to. For not all things give pleasure to all men, nor do all men consider all subjects worthy of study. Although I was born later than many accomplished writers of an earlier day, the accident of date ought not to mulct me of praise, if I too produce a learned work whose ampler research and whose choice of language make it deserving of serious attention. </p>                        </div>

These, it is said, neither harm the barbarians nor go near them. If however a stranger from Greece puts in to port, the birds by some divine dispensation approach, extending their wings as though they were hands, to welcome and embrace the strangers. And if the Greeks stroke them, they do not fly away, but stay still and allow themselves to be touched; and if the men sit down, the birds fly on to their lap as though they had been invited to a meal.

Now skilful anglers are aware of this, and they set upon it in this way. Whenever they capture a female, they fasten a fine line of esparto to its lip and trail the fish alive through the sea, knowing as they do where the fish lie, their haunts, and where they assemble. They prepare a heavy lead sinker round in shape and three fingers in length; a cord is passed through both ends, and it trails the captured fish after it. One of the men in the boat attaches to the side a weel with a wide mouth; the weel is then turned towards the captured Wrasse and slightly weighted with a stone of appropriate size. Whereupon the male Wrasses, like young men who have caught sight of a pretty girl, go in pursuit, mad with desire, each trying to outstrip the other and to reach her side and rub against her, just as love-sick men strive to kiss or tickle (a girl) or to play some other amorous trick. So then the man who is towing the female gently and slowly and planning to entrap (his fish), draws the lovers (as you might call them) with the loved one straight towards the weel. As soon as they come level with the weel, the angler lets the lead weight drop into it, and as it falls in it drags the female down with it by the line. And as the male Wrasses swim in with her, they are captured and pay the penalty for their erotic impulse. </p>                        </div>

For it never sets upon a living creature, but is naturally inclined to peaceful relations with all fish. If it comes across any dead fish, it makes its meal off that, but will not lay hold upon it until it has moved it with its tail: if the fish does not stir, it becomes the Mullet's prey; but if it moves, the Mullet withdraws. </p>                        </div>

For instance, directly they are aware that a mate has been hooked, they swim up with all possible speed; then they set their back against him and by falling upon him and pushing with all their might try to stop him from being hauled in. <br />Parrot Wrasses too are doughty champions of their own kin. At any rate they rush forward and make haste to bite through the line in order to rescue the one that has been caught. And many a time have they cut the line and set him free, and they ask for no reward for life-saving. Many a time however they have not contrived to do this, but have failed in spite of having done all they could with the utmost zeal. And it has even happened, they say, that, when a Parrot Wrasse has fallen into the weel and has left his tail-part projecting, the others that are swimming around uncaught have fixed their teeth in him and have dragged their comrade out. If however his head was projecting, one of those outside offered his tail, which the captive grasped and followed. This, my fellow-men, is what these creatures do: their love is not taught, it is inborn. </p>                        </div>

Its teeth grow in an unbroken line and are numerous and so strong as to bite through anything that comes their way. Therefore, when taken with a hook, it is the only fish that does not attempt to withdraw, but presses on in its eagerness to cut the line. Fishermen however counter this by a device: they have their hooks forged with a long shank. But the Gnawer, being a powerful jumper in its way, often leaps above the shank, and cutting the hair-line that is drawing it, swims away again to the places where fish haunt. <br />It also gathers round it a shoal of its fellows and with them also makes an attack upon the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphins</a>, and if one chance to get separated from the rest, the Gnawers surround it and then set upon the creature furiously, knowing as they do that the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphin</a> is by no means insensible to their bites. For the Gnawers cling most tenaciously to it, while the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphin</a> leaps upwards and plunges; and it shows how it is being tormented by the pain, for the Gnawers that have fastened upon it are lifted out of the water with it as it leaps. And while the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphin</a> struggles to shake them loose and beat them off, they never relax their hold, but would eat it alive. Then however when each Gnawer has bitten away a piece, they go off with their mouthful, and the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphin</a> is thankful to swim away after having fed its uninvited guests (if one may so call them) to its own pain. </p>                        </div>

One at any rate that pays service to this god is the Mullet, but not every species, only that to which men who have observed the different species of fish have given a name derived from its sharp snout. These, I am told, are caught in great numbers round about the Gulf of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=person long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaia</a>, and there are various ways of catching them. But the following method of capture proves how madly amorous they are. <br />A fisherman catches a female Mullet and fastens it to a long rod or a cord (this too must be long); as he walks slowly along the sea-shore he draws the fish, swimming and gasping, after him. In his footsteps there follows one with a net, and this net-fisherman watches diligently to see what is going to happen and where. So the female Mullet is towed along, and all the males that catch sight of her, like (one might say) licentious youths ogling a beautiful girl as she hurries by, come swimming up, mad with sexual desire. Thereupon the man with the net casts it and frequently has good luck, thanks to the urgent lust of the fish that approach. It is essential for the first fisherman's purpose that the captured female should be at her prime and well-fleshed, so that a greater number may be ardent after her and may take the bait which her enticing beauty offers. But should she be lean, most of them will scorn her and go away. Still, if any one of them is madly in love, he will not leave her, because he has been enslaved not by her beauty (that I will swear) but by his desire for sexual intercourse. </p>                        </div>

(If by excessive use of these expressions I make my discourse too wanton, the facts of nature permit me to do things of that sort.) So the females which are actually facing the strain of birth-pangs remain quiet in their homes, while the male, after the manner of a husband, stays about the entrance to prevent any mischief from outside, being anxious for his offspring. For it seems that he loves even those that are yet unborn, and it is his fatherly concern that causes him these early fears; he even spends the whole day without touching food: his care sustains him. But as the afternoon grows late, he relinquishes his forced watch and seeks for food, which he does not fail to find. But of course each of the females within, whether in the act of giving birth or after it, finds a quantity of seaweed in the hollow places and about the rocks, and this is their meal. </p>                        </div>

And then he moves the line a little, rousing and egging on his prey to take the food, while the prawn by its movement conveys the impression that it intends to enter the Wrasse's den. Now this the Wrasse greatly resents, and therefore, as soon as he observes it, he longs, such is his fury, to demolish the object of his abhorrence, for he is not thinking of his appetite at the moment; and when he has crushed it, he moves off, considering it more honourable and more important that the watchman should not be caught napping than that he should be fed. But when he intends to eat any other creature that comes his way, he crushes it lightly and then lets it lie. As soon as he sees that it is dead, then at length he nibbles at it. But the female Wrasses, so long as they see the male acting as their shield, so to say, 'remain within and with the care of their household' are occupied.

And so it comes about that she is caught along with her offspring, though she could save herself and escape. But if both her offspring are by her, and if she realises that one has been wounded and is being hauled in, as I said above, she pursues the one that is unscathed and drives it away, lashing her tail and biting her little one with her mouth; and she makes a blowing sound as best she can, indistinct, but giving the signal to flee, which saves it.

The Prawn however in this ample space gambols about and dances in triumph, so to say, over the Basse's throat.

They lay the leaves of a plane-tree upon their nests, and directly the bats come near the storks, they are benumbed and become incapable of doing harm. <br />On swallows too Nature has bestowed a like gift: cockroaches injure their eggs.

Most of the aforesaid creatures dislike these things, but the way to catch <a href=/people/10963 target=_blank>Wasps</a> is as follows. You should hang up a cage in front of the <a href=/people/10963 target=_blank>Wasps</a>' nest and insert a little smelt or a small sprat and with them a minnow or a sardine. And the <a href=/people/10963 target=_blank>Wasps</a>, drawn by their natural greed and lured by the bait, fall into the cage in numbers, and once they are trapped, it is no longer possible for them to fly out again. Lizards also have designs upon <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>Bees</a>, so too have Land-crocodiles. But a means has been devised of destroying them too, thus: soak some meal in hellebore, or pour upon it the sap of spurge or the juice of mallow and scatter it about in front of the hives. This is death to the aforesaid creatures, once they have tasted of it. If a <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>-keeper drop the leaves of mullein or nuts into a pool, he will find it the simplest way of destroying Tadpoles. But Moths are destroyed at nighttime by the placing of a strong light in front of the hives and vessels full of oil below the light. And the Moths fly to the brightness and fall into the oil and are killed. Otherwise they would not be caught so very easily. But the Titmice, once they have tasted the -wine-steeped meal, become drowsy; then they fall over and lie quivering and can readily(?) be captured as they struggle to fly and are quite incapable of standing. But the Swallow men refrain from killing out of respect for its music, though they might easily do so. They are content to hinder the Swallow from attaching its nest below the hives. <br />Again, <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>Bees</a> dislike all bad smells and perfume equally: they cannot endure foul odours nor do they welcome a luxurious fragrance, even as modest, refined girls abhor the former while despising the latter. </p>                        </div>

And this was how he did it. When fully grown he had no need of being fed from the hand, but would now swim further Out, and as he ranged abroad in his search for some quarry from the sea, would keep some to feed himself, and the rest he would bring to his 'relations.' And they were aware of this and were even glad to wait for the tribute which he brought. This then was one gain; another was as follows. As to the boy so to the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphin</a> his foster-parents gave a name, and the boy with the courage born of their common upbringing would stand upon some spot jutting into the sea and call the name, and as he called would use soothing words. Whereat the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphin</a>, whether he was racing with some oared ship, or plunging and leaping in scorn of all other fish that roamed in shoals about the spot, or was hunting under stress of hunger, would rise to the surface with all speed, like a ship that raises a great wave as it drives onward, and drawing near to his loved one would frolic and gambol at his side; at one moment would swim close by the boy, at another would seem to challenge him and even induce his favourite to race with him. And what was even more astounding, he would at times even decline the winner's place and actually swim second, as though presumably he was glad to be defeated. <br />These happenings were noised abroad, and those who sailed thither reckoned them among the excellent sights which the city had to show; and to the old people and to the boy they were a source of revenue. </p>                        </div>

And I am told that they fish in this way. The weather must be calm, and if it is, they attach to the prow of their boats some hollow braziers with fire burning in them, and one can see through them, so that while retaining the fire they do not conceal the light. They call them lanterns. Now the fish are afraid of the brightness and are dazzled by the glare, and some of them not knowing what is the purpose of the thing they see, draw near from a wish to discover what it is that, frightens them. Then terror-stricken they either lie still in a mass close to some rock, quivering with fear, or are cast ashore as they are jostled along, and seem thunderstruck. Of course in that condition it is perfectly easy to harpoon them. So when the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphins</a> observe that the fishermen have lit their fire, they get ready to act, and while the men row softly the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphins</a> scare the fish on the outskirts and push them and prevent any escape. Accordingly the fish pressed on all sides and in some degree surrounded, realise that there is no escaping from the men that row and the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphins</a> that swim; so they remain where they are and are caught in great numbers. And the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphins</a> approach as though demanding the profits of their common labour due to them from this store of food. And the fishermen loyally and gratefully resign to their comrades in the chase their just portion — assuming that they wish them to come again, unsummoned and prompt, to their aid, for those toilers of the sea are convinced that if they omit to do this, they will make enemies of those who were once friends. </p>                        </div>

For the present I intend to speak of their sense for music and their readiness to obey and their aptitude for learning things which are difficult even for mankind, to say nothing of so huge an animal and one hitherto so fierce to encounter. The movements of a chorus, the steps of a dance, how to march in time, how to enjoy the sound of flutes, how to distinguish different notes, when to slacken pace as permitted or when to quicken at command — all these things the Elephant has learnt and knows how to do, and does accurately without making mistakes. Thus, while nature has created him to be the largest of animals, learning has rendered him the most gentle and docile. Now had I set out to write about the readiness to obey and to learn among elephants in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> or in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> or in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, anyone might suppose that I was concocting some pretentious tale, that in fact I was on the strength of hearsay about the beast giving a completely false account of its nature. That is the last thing that a man in pursuit of knowledge and an ardent lover of the truth has any right to do. Instead I have preferred to state what I have myself seen and what others have recorded as having formerly occurred in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, treating summarily a few facts out of many, which nevertheless sufficiently demonstrate the peculiar nature of the beast. <br />The Elephant when once tamed is the gentlest of creatures and is easily induced to do whatever one wants. Now keeping due eye on the time, I shall state the most important events first. <a href=/people/2619 target=_blank>Germanicus</a> Caesar was about to give some shows for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> (He would be the nephew of <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>). There were in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> several full-grown male and female elephants and there were calves born of them in the country; and when their limbs began to grow firm, a man who was clever at dealing with such beasts trained them and instructed them with uncanny and astounding dexterity. To begin with he introduced them in a quiet, gentle fashion to his instructions, supplying them with delicacies and the most appetising food, varied so as to allure and entice them into abandoning all trace of ferocity and into becoming renegades, that is tame and to some degree human. So what they learnt was not to go wild at the sound of flutes, not to be alarmed at the beating of drums, to be charmed by the pipe and to endure discordant notes, the beat of marching feet, and the singing of crowds. Moreover they were thoroughly trained not to be afraid of men in masses. And further their disciplining was manly in the following respects: they were not to get angry at the infliction of a blow, nor, when obliged to move some limb and to sway in time to dance or song, to burst into a rage, even though they had attained to such strength and courage. Now to refrain by instinct from misbehaving and from flouting the instruction given by a man is a virtue and a mark of nobility. When therefore the dancing-master had brought them to a high degree of proficiency, and they performed accurately what he had taught them, they did not disappoint the labour spent on their training (so they say) in the place where in due time the occasion demanded that they should display what they had been taught. Now this troupe was twelve in number, and they advanced in two groups from the right and the left sides of the theatre. They entered with a mincing gait, swaying their whole body in a delicate manner, and they were clothed in the flowered garments of dancers. And at no more than a word from the conductor they formed into line (so we are told) — supposing that to have been their teacher's order. Then again they wheeled into a circle when he so ordered them, and if they had to deploy, that also they did. And then they sprinkled flowers to deck the floor, but with moderation and economy, and now and again they stamped, keeping time in a rhythmical dance. <br />That <a href=/people/859 target=_blank>Damon</a> therefore, that <a href=/people/2788 target=_blank>Spintharus</a>, <a href=/people/633 target=_blank>Aristoxenus</a>, <a href=/people/489 target=_blank>Philoxenus</a>, and others should be experts in music and should be numbered among the few for their knowledge of it is certainly matter for wonder but by no means incredible or absurd. The reason is that man is a rational animal capable of understanding and logical thought. But that an inarticulate animal should comprehend rhythm and melody, should follow the movements of a tragic dance without a false step, fulfilling all that its lessons required of it — these are gifts bestowed by Nature, and each one is a singularity that fills one with amazement. <br />But what followed was enough to send the spectator wild with delight. On the sand of the theatre were placed mattresses of low couches, and on these in turn cushions, and over them embroidered coverlets, clear evidence of a house of great prosperity and ancestral wealth. And close at hand were set costly goblets and bowls of gold and of silver, and in them a large quantity of water; and beside them were placed tables of citrus wood and of ivory, of great magnificence, and they were laden with meat and bread enough to satisfy the stomachs of the most voracious animals. So as soon as the preparations were completed in all their abundance, the banqueters came on, six males and an equal number of females; the former were clad in masculine garb, thes latter in feminine; and they took their places in orderly fashion in pairs, a male and a female. And at a signal they reached forward their trunks modestly, as though they were hands, and ate with great decorum. And not one of them gave the impression of being a glutton nor yet of trying to forestall others or of being inclined to snatch too large a portion, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> did who occurs in <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> the golden. And when they wanted to drink, a bowl was placed by each one, from which they sucked up the water with their trunks and drank it in an orderly manner, and then proceeded to squirt (the attendants) in fun, not by way of insult. <br />Many similar stories have been recorded showing the astounding ingenuity of these animals. And I myself have seen one actually with its trunk writing Roman letters on a tablet in a straight line without any deviation. The only thing was that the in-structor's hand was laid upon it, directing it to the shape of the letters until the animal had finished writing; and it looked intently down. You would have said that the animal's eyes had been taught and knew the letters. </p>                        </div>

The leader is a small, slim fish with an elongated head, but its tail is narrow, according to the authorities on the subject. But whether Nature has conferred upon each large fish the aforesaid guide, or whether it associates with the large fish of its own free will out of friendliness, I am unable to say, but I prefer to believe that this is done under the compulsion of Nature, for this fish never swims by itself, but moves in front of the large fish's head and is its leader and, as it were, tiller. For instance, it foresees and takes previous notice of everything on behalf of the large fish; it forewarns it of everything by the tip of its tail, and by its contact signals to the fish, keeping it away from what is to be feared but leading it on to what will feed it. And by some invisible sign it warns the fish that its pursuers have designs upon it, and gives timely indication of those spots which a creature of its size ought not to approach, if it is not to be surrounded and perish utterly on some reef. <br />So then the first essential for the life of the largest of creatures is the smallest. And it seems that when the large fish becomes very fat it can no longer see nor hear, the vast bulk of its flesh being an obstacle to sight and to hearing. But the 'leader' is never seen apart from the large fish; if however, with its responsibility for the services described above, it dies first, then the large fish is bound to die also. </p>                        </div>

For this the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> allot a portion of their catch to the Falcons and find them trusty friends; if they do not do so, they at once deprive themselves of helpers. Now the full-grown Falcon will fight both with a <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>fox</a> and with an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>; with a vulture it frequently fights. But a Falcon will never eat the heart, thereby presumably fulfilling some mystic rite. If a Falcon sees the dead body of a man (so it is said), it always heaps earth upon the unburied corpse, though <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> laid no such injunction upon it, and will never touch the body. And it even refrains from drinking if a solitary man is engaged in leading off water into a channel, feeling sure that it will cause damage to the man who so labours if it purloins the water which he needs. But if several men are engaged in irrigating, it sees that the stream is abundant and takes its share from the loving-cup, so to speak, which they offer, and is glad to drink. </p>                        </div>

Another jj-jj species is the Orites Hawk. Both species are remarkably addicted to the female bird and pursue it after the manner of lovesick men and never cease from the pursuit. But should the female chance to disappear without the male noticing it, he is overcome with grief and cries aloud and is like one in the depths of woe from love. <br />When Hawks are troubled with their eyesight they go straight to some stone wall and pull up some wild tro lettuce and then holding it above their eyes allow the bitter, astringent juice to drip in; and this restores their health. And men say that doctors use this drug for the benefit of those whose sight is affected, and the remedy derives its name from these birds. And men do not refuse to be called the disciples of birds; rather they admit as much. <br />It is said that once upon a time a Hawk at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> proved a man guilty of sacrilege by swooping upon him and striking his head. It is also believed that Hawks are bastards, if they be compared with the various kinds of <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a>. <br />At the beginning of spring the Hawks of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=person long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> select two from all their number and despatch them to reconnoitre certain desert islands off the coast of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. When they return they act as leaders to the rest in their flight.

And having reached the islands which the original scouts decided were the most suitable for them, they there lay and hatch their eggs in complete security and peace; and they hunt sparrows and pigeons and rear their young in an abundance of food. Then when these have grown strong and are able to fly, they take the young birds with them back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> as though they were going to their own homes, that is to their haunts in regions they have grown to know. </p>                        </div>

And I am told that <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lions</a> even resort to the houses of Moors when they fail to find any prey and are overtaken by the pangs of hunger. And if the master of the house happens to be there, he keeps the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> off and drives him away, pursuing him vigorously. If however he is out and his wife is left all alone, then with words that put the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> to shame she checks his approach, restrains him, and admonishes him to control himself and not to allow his hunger to incense him. The <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a>, it seems, understands the Moorish tongue; and the sense of the rebuke which the woman administers to the animal is (so they say) as follows. 'Are not you ashamed, you, a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a>, the king of beasts, to come to my hut and to ask a woman to feed you, and do you, like some cripple, look to a woman's hands hoping that thanks to her pity and compassion you may get what you want?

Whereas, like some sorry lap-<a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, you are content to be fed by another.' <br />Such are the spells she employs, whereupon the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a>, as though his heart smote him and he were filled with shame, quietly and with downcast eyes moves off, overcome by the justice of her words. <br />Now if <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> through being reared in their company understand and quail before the threats of men, I should not be surprised if Moors too, who are reared and brought up along with <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lions</a>, are understood by these very animals. For the Moors profess to treat <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>-cubs to the same kind of food, the same bed, and the same roof as their own children.

In summer they remain in their country, but in mid-autumn they leave for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, appearing to know the map of the earth, the disposition of the winds, and the variations of the seasons. And after spending a winter like spring, when again conditions are becoming tolerably settled and the sky is calm, . they return. To lead their flight they appoint those that have already had experience of the journey; these would naturally be the older birds, and they select others of the same age to bring up the rear, while the young ones are ranged in their midst. Having waited for a fair and favouring wind from behind, and using it as an escort to speed them forward, they then form their order of flight into an acute-angled triangle, in order that as they encounter the air they may cleave it with the least difficulty, and so hold on their way. This then is how Cranes spend their summer and winter. (But mankind regards as marvellous the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> king's comprehension of temperature, and harps on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus class=place long=48.247 lat=32.191>Susa</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348485UEcb class=place long=48.5166 lat=34.8054>Ecbatana</a> and the repeated stories of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>'s journeyings to and fro.) When however the Cranes observe an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> bearing down upon them, they form a circle and in a bellying mass threaten him with attack; and he retires. Resting their bills upon each other's tail-feathers they form in a sense a continuous chain of flight, and sweeten their labour as they repose gently one upon another. And in some distant land . . . when they light upon some water-spring they rest for the night and sleep, while three or four mount guard for all the others; and in order to avoid falling asleep during their watch they stand on one leg, but with the other held up they clutch a stone firmly and securely in their claws. Their object is that, if they should inadvertently drop off to sleep, the stone should fall and wake them with the sound. <br />Now the stone which a Crane swallows to give itself ballast is a touchstone for gold when regurgitated by the Crane after it has, so to say, come to anchor and reached land. </p>                        </div>

It is plaited, hollow, and well-suited for sitting in. They pour in dust and construct as it were a soft bed; they enter and after screening themselves over with dry twigs so as to avoid being seen by birds of prey and by human hunters, they lay their eggs in complete tranquillity. Next, they do not entrust their eggs to the same place but to some other, emigrating as it were, because they are afraid that they may perhaps be detected. <br />And when they hatch their young they impart heat to them, being callow, and warm them with their wings, enveloping them in their feathers, as it might be swaddling-clothes. They do not however wash them, but render them more sleek by putting dust on them. <br />If a Partridge sees someone approaching with evil intent against itself and its young, it thereupon rolls about in front of the hunter's feet and fills him with the hope of seizing it as it moves this way and that. <br />And the man bends down to catch his prey, but it eludes him. Meantime the young ones slip away and get some distance ahead. So when the Partridge is aware of this, it takes courage and releases the bird-catcher from his fruitless occupation by flying off, leaving the man gaping. Then when the mother-bird is secure and advantageously placed, she calls her chicks, and they recognising her voice flutter towards her. <br />The Partridge when about to lay her eggs endeavours to hide from her mate for fear that he may crush them, because he is lustful and tries to prevent the mother from devoting her time to rearing her young. So incontinent a creature is the Partridge. When the females leave the males and brood their eggs, the male birds of set purpose provoke one another to anger and deal and receive the most violent blows; and the vanquished bird gets trodden, the victor performing unsparingly, until he in his turn is vanquished and is caught in like clutches. </p>                        </div>

So the guardian of the fortress, observing the young birds inside, smeared the hole over with mud. When the Hoopoe returned and saw itself excluded, it fetched a herb and applied it to the mud. The mud was dissolved; the bird reached its young, and then flew off to get food. So once again the man smeared the spot over, and the bird by means of the same herb opened the hole. <br />And the same thing happened a third time. Therefore the guardian of the fortress, seeing what was done, himself gathered the herb and used it not for the same purpose; instead he laid open treasures that were none of his. </p>                        </div>

The Cuckoo is extremely clever and most adroit at devising ingenious solutions to difficulties. For the bird is conscious that it cannot brood and hatch eggs because of the cold nature of its bodily constitution, so they say. Therefore, when it lays its eggs, it neither builds itself a nest nor nurses its young, but watches until birds that have nestlings are flown and abroad, enters the strange lodging, and there lays its eggs. The rascal does not however assail the nests of all birds, only those of the lark, the ring-dove, the greenfinch, and the pappus, knowing as it does that these birds lay eggs resembling its own. And if the nests are empty, it will not go near them, but if they contain eggs, then it mixes its own with them. But if the eggs of the other bird are numerous, it rolls them out and destroys them and leaves its own behind, their resemblance making it impossible to know them apart and detect them. And the aforesaid birds hatch the eggs which are none of theirs. But when the Cuckoo's young have grown strong and are conscious of their bastardy, they fly away and resort to their parent. For directly they are fledged they are recognised as alien and are grievously ill-treated. <br />The Cuckoo is seen only at one season, and that the best, of the year. For it is actually visible from the beginning of spring until the rising of the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a>-star; after that it withdraws from the sight of man. </p>                        </div>

When the hawk, which is accustomed to soar high in the air, gives chase, the Pigeons glide and sink lower and attempt to reduce their flight.

For the Partridge that is defeated cannot endure to show himself either to his loved one or to his spouse.

Now the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=ethnic long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretans</a> say that the young man did acts of valour in the fight, but when the enemy's massed line pressed him hard, he stumbled over a dead body that lay there and was thrown down. Whereupon one of the enemy who was nearest, in his eagerness was about to strike him in the back. But the man turned and exclaimed 'Do not deal me a shameful and cowardly blow, but strike me in front, in the breast, in order that my loved one may not judge me guilty of cowardice and refrain from laying out my dead body: he could not bear to go near one who so disgraces himself.' <br />There is nothing wonderful in a man being ashamed to appear a coward, but that a Partridge should have some feeling of shame, this is a truly impressive gift of Nature.

Its face however is not that of a wild beast but of a man, and it has three rows of teeth set in its upper jaw and three in the lower; these are exceedingly sharp and larger than the fangs of a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hound</a>. Its ears also resemble a man's, except that they are larger and shaggy; its eyes are blue-grey and they too are like a man's, but its feet and claws, you must know, are those of a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>. To the end of its tail is attached the sting of a scorpion, and this might be over a cubit in length; and the tail has stings at intervals on either side. But the tip of the tail gives a fatal sting to anyone who encounters it, and death is immediate. If one pursues the beast it lets fly its stings, like arrows, sideways, and it can shoot a great distance; and when it discharges its stings straight ahead it bends its tail back; if however it shoots in a backward direction, as the <a href=/people/12117 target=_blank>Sacae</a> do, then it stretches its tail to its full extent. Any creature that the missile hits it kills; the elephant alone it does not kill. These stings which it shoots are a foot long and the thickness of a bulrush. Now <a href=/people/485 target=_blank>Ctesias</a> asserts (and he says that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> confirm his words) that in the places where those stings have been let fly others spring up, so that this evil produces a crop. And according to the same writer the Mantichore for choice devours human beings; indeed it will slaughter a great number; and it lies in wait not for a single man but would set upon two or even three men, and alone overcomes even that number. All other animals it defeats: the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> alone it can never bring down. That this creature takes special delight in gorging human flesh its very name testifies, for in the Greek language it means man-eater, and its name is derived from its activities. Like the stag it is extremely swift. <br />Now the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> hunt the young of these animals while they are still without stings in their tails, which they then crush with a stone to prevent them from growing stings. The sound of their voice is as near as possible that of a trumpet. <br /><a href=/people/485 target=_blank>Ctesias</a> declares that he has actually seen this animal in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> (it had been brought from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> as a present to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> King) — if <a href=/people/485 target=_blank>Ctesias</a> is to be regarded as a sufficient authority on such matters. <br />At any rate after hearing of the peculiarities of this animal, one must pay heed to the historian of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=place long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidos</a>. </p>                        </div>

Men commonly report that it is winged and that the feathers along its back are black, and those on its front are red, while the actual wings are neither but are white. And <a href=/people/485 target=_blank>Ctesias</a> records that its neck is variegated with feathers of a dark blue; that it has a beak like an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>'s, and a head too, just as artists portray it in pictures and sculpture. Its eyes, he says, are like fire. It builds its lair among the mountains, and although it is not possible to capture the full-grown animal, they do take the young ones. And the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=place long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactria</a>, who are neighbours of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, say that the Gryphons guard the gold in those parts; that they dig it up and build their nests with it, and that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> carry off any that falls from them. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> however deny that they guard the aforesaid gold, for the Gryphons have no need of it (and if that is what they say, then I at any rate think that they speak the truth), but that they themselves come to collect the gold, while the Gryphons fearing for their young ones fight with the invaders. They engage too with other beasts and overcome them without difficulty, but they will not face the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> or the elephant. Accordingly the natives, dreading the strength of these animals, do not set out in quest of the gold by day, but arrive by night, for at that season they are less likely to be detected. Now the region where the Gryphons live and where the gold is mined is a dreary wilderness. <br />And the seekers after the aforesaid substance arrive, a thousand or two strong, armed and bringing spades and sacks; and watching for a moonless night they begin to dig. Now if they contrive to elude the Gryphons they reap a double advantage, for they not only escape with their lives but they also take home their freight, and when those who have acquired a special skill in the smelting of gold have refined it, they possess immense wealth to requite them for the dangers described above. If however they are caught in the act, they are lost. And they return home, I am told, after an interval of three or four years. </p>                        </div>

And if a man cuts through the bones of a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> fire leaps forth. But they are devoid of marrow, nor are they hollow like tubes. There is no season of the year in which it abstains from coupling, and the Lioness is pregnant for two months.

But the account which says that they scratch through the womb is a fable. <br />To encounter a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> when famished is dangerous, but when he has eaten his fill he is extremely gentle; they even say that at that time he is playful. A <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> will never turn his back and flee, but withdraws, looking you straight in the face, and by degrees. <br />But when he begins to age he visits folds and huts and spots where shepherds lodge in caves; which,is to be expected, because he no longer has the spirit for hunting on the mountains. He has a horror of fire. Any <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> that inclines to roundness and a compact figure, and that has too shaggy a mane, appears to be lacking in spirit and daring; whereas the beast that attains a good length and has a straight mane is regarded as bolder and fiercer. Possessing a ravenous appetite he will, they say, devour and swallow whole limbs. So when he has taken his fill of them he will often not eat for the space of three days until his former meal has been gradually absorbed and digested.

Now this <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> appears to be a span long; its colour is like the deepest purple, but its head they describe as white and not purple, and not just white, but whiter even than snow or milk. <br />But this <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> has no fangs and is found in the hottest regions of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, and though it is quite incapable of biting — for which reason you might pronounce it to be tame and gentle — yet if it vomits upon anyone (so I am told), be it man or animal, the entire limb inevitably putrefies. Therefore when caught men hang it up by the tail, and naturally it has its head hanging down, looking at the ground. And below the creature's mouth they place a bronze vessel, into which there ooze drops from its mouth; and the liquid sets and congeals, and if you saw it you would say that it was gum from an alnaond-tree. So when the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> is dead they remove the vessel and substitute another, also of bronze; and again from the dead body there flows a liquid serum which looks like water. This they leave for three days, and it too sets; but there will be a difference in colour between the two, for the latter is a deep black and the former the colour of amber. Now if you give a man a piece of this no bigger than a sesame seed, dropping it into his wine or his food, first he will be seized with convulsions of the utmost violence; next, his eyes squint and his brain dissolves and drips through his nostrils, and he dies a most pitiable death. And if he takes a smaller dose of the poison, there is no escape for him hereafter, for in time he dies. If however you administer some of the black matter which has flowed from the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> when dead, again a piece the size of a sesame seed, the man's body begins to suppurate, a wasting sickness overtakes him, and within a year he is carried off by consumption.

A young hunter Jfise who was able to spend his life among the wildest of animals, after they had been trained from the day when they were young cubs, had living with him and sharing each other's food a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a>, a Bear, and a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a>. And for a time, <a href=/people/1475 target=_blank>Eudemus</a> says, they lived in peace and mutual amity. But it happened one day that the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a> was playing with the Bear, fawning upon it and teasing it, when the Bear became unwontedly savage, fell upon the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a>, and with its claws ripped the poor creature's belly open and tore him to pieces. The <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a>, says the writer, was indignant at what had occurred and seemed to detest the Bear's implacability and want of affection: it was smitten with grief for the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a> as for a companion, and being filled with righteous anger, punished the Bear by treating it exactly as the Bear had treated the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a>.

All their body is white except for the head, which approaches purple, while their eyes give off a dark blue colour. They have a horn on their forehead as much as a cubit and a half long; the lower part of the horn is white, the upper part is crimson, while the middle is jet-black. From these variegated horns, I am told, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> drink, but not all, only the most eminent <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, and round them at intervals they lay rings of gold, as though they were decorating the beautiful arm of a statue with bracelets. And they say that a man who has drunk from this horn knows not, and is free from, incurable diseases: he will never be seized with convulsions nor with the sacred sickness, as it is called, nor be destroyed by poisons. Moreover if he has previously drunk some deadly stuff, he vomits it up and is restored to health. <br />It is believed that <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>Asses</a>, both the tame and the wild kind, all the world over and all other beasts with uncloven hoofs are without knucklebones and without gall in the liver; whereas those horned <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>Asses</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=person long=74 lat=30>India</a>, <a href=/people/485 target=_blank>Ctesias</a> says, have knucklebones and are not its tn without gall.

They begin to run, it is true, at a gentle pace, but gradually gather strength until to pursue them is, in the language of poetry, to chase the unattainable. <br />When the dam gives birth and leads her new-born colts about, the sires herd with, and look after, them. <br />And these <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>Asses</a> frequent the most desolate plains in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>.

Now the strength of these horns is such that nothing can withstand their blows, but everything gives way and snaps or, it may be, is shattered and rendered useless. They have in the past even struck at the ribs of a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, ripped it open, and disembowelled it. For that reason the horsemen dread coming to close quarters with them, since the penalty for so doing is a most lamentable death, and both they and their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> are killed. They can kick fearfully too. Moreover their bite goes so deep that they tear away everything that they have grasped. A full-grown <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>Ass</a> one would never capture alive: they are shot with javelins and arrows, and when dead the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> strip them of their horns, which, as I said, they decorate. <br />But the flesh of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=person long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>Asses</a> is uneatable, the reason being that it is naturally exceedingly bitter. </p>                        </div>

But they do not touch flesh, are temperate in their appetite, and for them seeds are a sufficient meal. And when late autumn sets in, a flock of these birds (they call them Memnons) resort to the land round <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a>, making straight for the tomb of <a href=/people/1491 target=_blank>Memnon</a>.

So it seems that <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> uncritically represented Polyeidus as seeing this bird and thereby conjecturing that he would discover the dead son of <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a>. And I myself have ascertained that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> histories, beside the facts already told, relate in verse and prose how <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> received from <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> a boon — seeing that the island had nursed him and effected that famous concealment of him — namely that it should be free of all noxious creatures born to do harm, that it should neither produce them nor support them if introduced from abroad. And the island proves how potent this boon was, for it produces none of the aforesaid creatures. But if a man by way of trying and testing the extent of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>'s favour imports one of these alien creatures, it has but to touch the soil and it dies. Accordingly <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a>-hunters from and to the neighbouring <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> use devices of this kind. These charmers of venomous reptiles tame a great number and bring them for people to wonder at, and with them they import a load of soil from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> sufficient for their need. This they do by way of precaution, to prevent the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> from meeting their death. With this object, when they arrive at the aforesaid island they do not put down their <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> until they have laid a bed of the imported soil. This done, they collect crowds and fill the unintelligent majority with amazement. Now as long as each <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> remains coiled up and settled in its place, or rises up without however crossing the limit of its own native dust, so long it lives. If however it strays on to the alien soil which is strange and hostile to it, it dies, and naturally so. For if the will of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> did not fail of effect in the case of <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a>, and would not fail in the case of any other person, far less, I think, will it prove ineffectual when his own nurse is concerned. </p>                        </div>

But these creatures attain to a length of as much as seven cubits, though one might find specimens both larger and smaller. Their bulk is such that a ten-year-old boy could hardly encircle it with his arms. A single tooth is attached to the upper jaw, another to the lower, and both are square and about eighteen inches long; and such is the strength of their teeth that they can crush with the greatest ease anything that they get between them, be it stone, be it animal, tame or wild. During the daytime they live at the bottom of the river, wallowing in the mud and slime; for that reason they are not to be seen. But at night they emerge on to the land, and whatever they encounter, whether <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> or <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> or <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>, they crush and then drag down to their haunts and eat it in the river, devouring every member of the animal excepting its paunch. If however they are assailed by hunger during the day as well, and should a <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camel</a> or an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> be drinking on the bank, they slide furtively up and seizing firmly upon its lips, haul it along with the utmost force and drag it by sheer strength into the water, where they feast upon it. Each one is covered with a hide two fingers thick. The following means have been devised for hunting and capturing them. Men let its <a href=/people/556 target=_blank>cat</a> down a stout, strong hook attached to an iron chain, and to this they fasten a rope of white flax weighing a talent, and they wrap wool round both chain and rope to prevent the worm biting through them. On the hook they fix a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a> or a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kid</a>, and then let them sink in the river. As many as thirty men hold on to the rope and each of them has a javelin ready to hurl and a sword at his side. Wooden clubs are placed handy, should they need to deal blows, and these are of cornel-wood and very hard. Then when the worm is secured on the hook and has swallowed the bait, the men haul, and having captured it and killed it, hang it up in the sun for thirty days. From the body there drips a thick oil into earthenware vessels; and the o each worm yields up to ten cotylae. This oil they <a href=/people/10989 target=_blank>seal</a> and bring to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> King; no one else is permitted to have so much as a drop. The rest of the carcase is of no use. Now the oil has this power: should you wish to burn a pile of wood and to scatter the embers, pour on a cotyle and you will set it alight without pre-viously applying a spark. And if you want to burn a man or an animal, pour some oil over him and at once he is set on fire. With this, they say, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> King even takes cities that have risen against him; he does not wait for battering-rams or penthouses or any other siege-engines, for he burns them down and captures them. He fills earthen vessels, each holding one cotyle, with oil, <a href=/people/10989 target=_blank>seals</a> them, and slings them from above against the gates. When the vessels touch the embrasures they are dashed into fragments; the oil oozes down; fire pours over the doors, and nothing can quench it. And it burns weapons and fighting men, so tremendous is its force. It is however allayed and put out if piles of rubbish are poured over it. <br />Such is the account given by <a href=/people/485 target=_blank>Ctesias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=person long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidus</a>. </p>                        </div>

To sta some <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> he assigns the bringing of water, to others the fashioning of honeycombs within the hive, while a third lot must go abroad to gather food. But after a time they exchange duties in a precisely determined rotation. As to the King himself, it is enough for him to take thought and to legislate for the matters that I mentioned above after the manner of great rulers to whom philosophers like to ascribe simultaneously the qualities of a citizen and of a king. <br />For the rest he lives at ease and abstains from physical labour. If however it is expedient for the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> to change their dwelling, then the ruler departs, and if he happens to be still young, he leads the way and the rest follow; if however he is elderly, he is carried on his way and conveyed by other <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>. <br />At a signal <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> retire to slumber. When it seems to be time to go to sleep the King commands one <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a> to give the signal for going to rest. And the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a> obeys and gives the word, whereupon the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> that have been buzzing till then retire to bed. Now so long as the King survives, the swarm flourishes and all disorder is suppressed. The drones gladly remain at rest in their cells, the older <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> dwell in their quarters apart, the young in theirs, the King by himself, and the larvae in their own place. Their food and their excrement are in separate places. But when the King dies, disorder and anarchy fill the place; the drones produce offspring in the cells of the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>; the general confusion no longer permits the swarm to thrive, and finally the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> perish for want of a ruler. <br />The <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>Bee</a> leads a blameless life and would never touch animal food. It has no need of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> for counsellor, but flowers afford it food enough. It is in the highest degree temperate; at any rate it abhors luxury and delicate living; witness the fact that it pursues and drives away a man who has perfumed himself, as if he were some enemy who has perpetrated actions past all remedy. It recognises too a man who comes from an unchaste bed, and him also it pursues, as though he were its bitterest foe. And <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>Bees</a> are well-endowed with courage and are undaunted. For instance, there is not a single animal from which they flee; they are not mastered by cowardice but go to the attack. Towards those who do not trouble them or start to injure them or who do not approach the hive bent on mischief and with evil intent they show themselves peaceful and friendly; but against those who would injure them the fires of a truceless war, as the phrase goes, are kindled; and anyone who comes to plunder their honey is reckoned among their enemies. And they sting even <a href=/people/10963 target=_blank>wasps</a> severely. And <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> records its s how <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>Bees</a> once finding a horseman near the hive attacked him violently and slew both him and his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. And further, they fight with one another, and the stronger party defeats the weaker. But I learn that <a href=/people/10990 target=_blank>toads</a> and <a href=/people/10983 target=_blank>frogs</a> from pools, <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>-eaters, and swallows defeat them, and frequently <a href=/people/10963 target=_blank>wasps</a> do so too. Yet the victor achieves what you might call a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=demonym long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Cadmean</a> victory, for he comes off badly from their blows and stings, since the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>Bees</a> are armed with courage no less than with stings. But <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>Bees</a> are not without a share of the wisdom of foresight, and <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> vouches for my statement thus. Some <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>Bees</a> came to a hive that was not theirs but a different one and proceeded to plunder the honey which did not belong to them. But the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>Bees</a> which were being despoiled of their labours nevertheless remained quiet and waited patiently to see what would happen. Then, when the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>-keeper had killed the greater number of the enemy, the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>Bees</a> in the hive realised that they were in fact sufficient to sustain an equal combat and emerged to strike back, and the penalty which they exacted for the robbery left nothing to cavil at. </p>                        </div>

In summertime they afford it a covering of its own, unsought, not adventitious. If, for instance, it wants to scare somebody it raises its tail-feathers and shakes them and emits a scream, and the bystanders are terrified, as though scared by the clang of a hoplite's armour. And it raises its head and nods most pompously, as though it were shaking a triple plume at one. When however it needs to cool itself it raises its feathers, inclines them in a forward direction and displays a natural shade from its own body, and wards off the fierceness of the sun's rays. But if there is a wind behind it, it gradually expands its feathers, and the breeze which streams through them, blowing gently and agreeably, enables the bird to cool itself. <br />It knows when it has been praised, and as some handsome boy or lovely woman displays that feature which excels the rest, so does the <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>Peacock</a> raise its feathers in orderly succession; and it resembles a flowery meadow or a picture made beautiful by the many hues of the paint, and painters must be prepared to sweat in order to represent its special characteristics. And it proves how ungrudgingly it exhibits itself by permitting bystanders to take their fill of gazing, as it turns itself about and industriously shows off the diversity of its plumage, displaying with the utmost pride an array surpassing the garments of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> and the embroideries of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>.

For it is confident that in death there is neither pain nor sorrow. But men are afraid of what they know not, and regard death as the greatest of all ills. Now the Swan has so contented a spirit that at the very close of its life it sings and breaks out into a dirge, as it were, for itself. Even so does <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> sing of <a href=/people/807 target=_blank>Bellerophon</a>, prepared like a hero of high soul for death. For example, he has portrayed him addressing his soul thus: <br />'Reverent wast thou ever in life towards the gods; strangers didst thou succour; nor didst thou ever grow weary towards thy friends' — <br />and so on. So then the Swan too intones its own funeral chant, and either by hymns to the gods or by the rehearsal of its own praises it makes provision for its departure. <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> also testifies to the fact that it sings not from sorrow but rather from cheerfulness, for (he says) a man whose heart is vexed and sore has no leisure for song and melody. <br />Now death is not the only thing that the Swan faces with courage: it is not afraid of a fight. But though it will not be the first to do an injury, any more than a sober, educated man would be, yet it will not retire and give way before an aggressor. While all other birds are on terms of peace with the Swan, the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>Eagle</a> has frequently attacked it, as <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says, though it has never yet overcome it, but has always been defeated not only through the strength of the Swan in battle but also because in defending itself the Swan has justice on its side. </p>                        </div>

And others have observed that even when asleep the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> moves his tail, showing, as you might expect, that he is not altogether quiescent, and that, although sleep has enveloped and enfolded him, it has not subdued him as it does all other animals. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, they say, claim to have observed in him something of this kind, asserting that the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> is superior to sleep and for ever awake. And I have ascertained that it is for this reason that they assign him to the sun, for, as you know, the sun is the most hard-working of the gods, being visible above the earth or pursuing his course beneath it without pause. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> cite <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> as a witness when he speaks of the 'untiring sun'. And in addition to his strength the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> shows intelligence. For instance, he has designs upon <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and goes to their folds by night. Now <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> was aware of this when he said: <br />'Like <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> which a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> has scared, coming in the dead of night.' <br />And he strikes terror into them all by his strength, but seizes only one and devours it. And when he and h has gorged himself, he wishes to preserve the remains for another occasion, yet he is ashamed to stay and watch over them, as though he were afraid of starving from want of food. Accordingly with jaws agape he breathes upon them and trusts to his breath to guard them while he himself goes on his way. But when the other beasts arrive and realise to whom the remains upon the ground belong, they do not venture to touch them but go their way for fear of seeming to rob and diminish anything that belongs to their king. Now if the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> chances to be lucky and has good hunting, he forgets his former prize, disregards it as being stale, and goes away. Otherwise he returns to it as to a private store. And when he has eaten more than enough, he empties himself by lying quiet and abstaining from food, or alternatively he catches a monkey and eats some of it, voiding and emptying his belly by means of its flesh. <br />The <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> is after all upright and one to 'defend himself against the man who should assail him first'. <br />Thus, he faces his attacker and by lashing with his tail and winding it about his flanks rouses himself as though he were stimulating himself with a spur. <br />And if a man shoot at him but miss him, he will defend himself by a fair return: he will scare the man but do him no harm. If he has been domesticated since the time when he was a cub, he is extremely gentle and agreeable to meet, and is fond of play, and will submit with good temper to any treatment to please his keeper. For instance, <a href=/people/381 target=_blank>Hanno</a> kept a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> to carry his baggage; a tame <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> was the companion of <a href=/people/743 target=_blank>Berenice</a> and was no different from her tiring-slaves: for example, it would softly wash her face with its tongue and smooth away her wrinkles; it would share her table and eat in a sober, orderly fashion just like a man. And <a href=/people/1298 target=_blank>Onomarchus</a>, the Tyrant of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375151PCat class=person long=15.0881 lat=37.503>Catana</a>, and the son of <a href=/people/81 target=_blank>Cleomenes</a> both had <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lions</a> with them as table-companions. </p>                        </div>

With its crowing a cock scares a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> and is fatal to a basilisk, and yet it cannot endure <a href=/people/556 target=_blank>cats</a> or kites.

Yet it seems that after all the Leopard is craftier than the Monkey, for such designs and traps does it contrive for the Monkeys. It comes to the place where a gathering of Monkeys is seated, throws itself down beneath a tree, lies on the ground on its back, inflates its belly, relaxes its legs, closes both eyes, and even holds its breath, and lies there like one dead. And the Monkeys looking down upon their most hated enemy, fancy it to be dead; and what they most fervently desire, that they believe. For all that, they do not as yet take courage but make an experiment, and the experiment is this: they send down one of their number whom they regard as the most fearless to test and to scrutinise the state of the Leopard. So the Monkey descends not altogether unafraid; but after running down a little way he turns back, fear causing him to retreat. And a second time he descends and having approached, withdraws; and a third time he returns and observes the Leopard's eyes and examines it to see if it is breathing. But the Leopard, by remaining motionless with the utmost self-control, inspires a gradual fearlessness in the Monkey. And since it approaches and remains close by and takes no harm, the Monkeys up aloft also now gather courage and run down from that particular tree and from all others that grow near by, and assembling in a mass encircle the Leopard and dance round it. Then they leap upon it and turn somersaults on its body and by dancing in triumph a dance appropriate to monkeys, and by a variety of insults testify to the joy and delight they feel over the supposed corpse. But the Leopard submits to all this until it realises that the Monkeys are tired by their dancing and their insolence, when it leaps up unexpectedly and springs at them. And some it lacerates with its claws, others it tears to pieces with its teeth, and enjoys without stint the ample and sumptuous banquet provided by its enemies. It is Nature that bids the Leopard endure with heroic fortitude, so that it may rise superior to the insults of its enemies, bearing up with the utmost patience and finding no need to say 'endure, my heart'.

Animals however A need no extraneous encouragement but stimulate their prowess for themselves and rouse and incite themselves. For instance, the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>Boar</a> when intending to do battle, whets his tusks on smooth rocks. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, you know, gives clear evidence touching the animal. Further, the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> rouses himself by lashing himself with his tail and allows no idling and no repose. And this the poet knew when he spoke of the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a>. And Elephants inflame themselves for the fight, whenever the occasion arises, by beating themselves with their trunk: they need no one to sing to them and say 'This is no time for sitting still or for delaying', still less do they wait for the poems of <a href=/people/1032 target=_blank>Tyrtaeus</a>. And when a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>Bull</a> that is the leader of a herd j is defeated by another leader, he departs to some other place and becomes his own trainer and practises every method of fighting, scattering the dust over himself and rubbing his horns against tree-trunks and fitting himself in other ways to display his strength, and particularly abstaining from sexual acts and living continently like <a href=/people/5711 target=_blank>Iccus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=person long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>, whom <a href=/people/2345 target=_blank>Plato</a> the son of <a href=/people/313 target=_blank>Ariston</a> celebrates as of refraining from all sexual commerce during the entire period of the Games.

For to him the prizes meant glory — the wild olive of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230SIst class=demonym long=22.9932 lat=37.9159>Isthmian</a> pine, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> laurel, admiration in his lifetime, and after death an honoured name.

There is nothing surprising that being men they should behave so, either in order to make money or to achieve renown and fame.

Now he brought a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kid</a> and gave it to the Leopard alive, thinking to provide it at once with food and with the pleasure of tearing the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kid</a> to pieces, and supposing that it would refuse to eat dead meat. In fact when the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kid</a> was brought the Leopard controlled itself: being full-fed it needed to abstain from food. And it did the same on the second day, for it still needed the medicine of starvation. But when the third day came it began to grow hungry and, as usual, showed that it was by the sound of its voice; for all that, it still would not touch the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kid</a> which had been its friend for two days, but left it alone, though it accepted another one. <br />Men however have betrayed even their brothers and their parents and old friends; there have been many and frequent cases. </p>                        </div>

But what I have not already mentioned I will mention now, and this is a suitable occasion. It gives birth in the winter time, and having done so, hibernates; and as it dreads the frosts it awaits the coming of spring, and would never bring its cubs out until three full months have passed. But when it perceives that it is pregnant it dreads this as though it were some sickness, and seeks for a lair. (Hence the Bear's hibernation is called its 'lair period.') Then it enters, not on its feet but lying down, thus effacing its tracks for those who hunt it, for it drags itself along on its back. And having entered, it rests, and in some way reduces its figure; and this it does for forty days. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> however says that the Bear remains motionless and does not stir for fourteen days, and for the remainder she just turns. So she passes the entire forty days without food or nourishment: it is enough for her to lick her right paw. And owing to excessive colliquescence her intestines become wrinkled up and compressed. Knowing this, as soon as she emerges she eats some of the plant called 'wild arum'; and as this induces flatulence, it opens up her gut, widens it, and renders it capable of admitting food. And when she has filled herself out once more, she eats some ants and obtains an easy evacuation. <br />I have now sufficiently described how Bears empty and fill their bodies by natural means without any need, my fellow men, of doctors or of concoctions. </p>                        </div>

Now while they were swimming about, a <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphin</a> fell passionately in love with a boy of remarkable beauty. At first when it approached, it frightened the boy and completely scared him; later on however, through constant meeting, it even led the boy to conceive a warm friendship and kindly feelings towards it. For instance, they began to sport with one another; and sometimes they would compete, swimming side by side in rivalry, sometimes the boy would mount, like a rider on a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and be carried proudly along on the back of his lover. And to the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373276UIas class=place long=27.5846 lat=37.2795>Iasos</a> and to strangers the event seemed marvellous. For the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphin</a> would go a long way out to sea with its darling on its back and as far as it pleased its rider; then it would turn and bring him close to the beach, and they would part company and return, the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphin</a> to the open sea, the boy to his home. And the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphin</a> used to appear at the hour when the gymnasium was dismissed, and the boy was delighted to find his friend expecting him and to play together. And besides his natural beauty, this too made him the admired of all, namely that not only men but even dumb animals thought him a boy of surpassing loveliness. <br />In a little while however even this mutual affection was destroyed by <a href=/people/1036 target=_blank>Envy</a>. Thus, it happened that the boy exercised himself too vigorously, and in an exhausted state threw himself belly downwards on to his mount, and as the spike on the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphin</a>'s dorsal fin chanced to be erect it pierced the beautiful boy's navel. Whereupon certain veins were severed; there followed a gush of blood; and presently the boy died. The <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphin</a> perceiving this from the weight — for the boy lay heavier than usual, as he could not lighten himself by breathing — and seeing the surface of the water crimson with blood, realised what had happened and could not bear to survive its darling. And so with all the gathered force of a ship dashing through the waves it made its way to the beach and deliberately cast itself upon the shore, bringing the dead body with it. And there they both lay, the boy already dead, the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphin</a> breathing its last. (But <a href=/people/465 target=_blank>Laios</a>, my good <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, did not act so in the case of <a href=/people/4021 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a>, although, as you yourself and the common report tell me, he was the first among the Greeks to inaugurate the love of boys.) And the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373276UIas class=place long=27.5846 lat=37.2795>Iasos</a> to requite the ardent friendship between the pair built one common tomb for the beautiful youth and the amorous <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphin</a>, with a monument at the head. It was a handsome boy riding upon a <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphin</a>. And the inhabitants struck coins of silver and of bronze and stamped them with a device showing the fate of the pair, and they commemorated them by way of homage to the operation of the god who was so powerful. <br />And I learn that at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> also, in the reign of <a href=/people/8222 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> II, a <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphin</a> was similarly enamoured; at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a> also, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. So, had these facts been known to <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>, I think they would have surprised him no less than what happened to <a href=/people/3505 target=_blank>Arion</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394262PMet class=person long=26.1769 lat=39.3692>Methymna</a>. </p>                        </div>

It Sgs cannot overcome them by a direct attack, the reason being that their prickles prevent it; and so, gingerly and taking great care of its mouth, it turns them over and lays them on their back and after ripping them open, easily devours those whom till then it dreaded. <br />And this is the way that <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>Foxes</a> hunt Bustards in ana <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>. They reverse themselves and put their head down upon the ground and stick their tail up, like a bird's neck. And the bustards are taken in and approach, supposing it to be some bird of their own kind; then when they come close up, they are easily caught by the <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>Fox</a>, which turns upon them and attacks them violently. Their manner of catching very small fishes is and extremely dexterous. They move along the bank of a stream and trail their tails in the water. And the fish swim up and are immeshed and entangled in the thick hairs. When the <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>Foxes</a> notice this, they withdraw from the water and go to dry ground where they shake their tails thoroughly: the little fishes tumble out, and the <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>Foxes</a> make a delicious meal. <br />The people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> use this animal as an indicator of whether a frozen river is safe to cross.

The <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>Fox</a> tests the safety of the transit in the following manner: it puts its ear down to the ice, and if it hears no sound of the flow beneath and no murmur in the depths, it has no fear, the ice being solid, and it races over without hesitation. Otherwise it would not set foot upon it. </p>                        </div>

A mere boy, a goatherd by occupation, whose name was Crathis, under an erotic impulse lay with the prettiest of his <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>, and took pleasure in the union, and whenever he wanted sexual pleasure he would go to her; and he kept her as his darling. Moreover the amorous goatherd would bring to his loved one aforesaid such gifts as he could procure, offering her sometimes the loveliest twigs of tree-medick, and often bindweed and mastic to eat, so making her mouth fragrant for him if he should want to kiss her. And he even prepared for her, as for a bride, a leafy bed ever so luxurious and soft to sleep in. But the he-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>, the leader of the flock, did not observe these proceedings with indifference, but was filled with jealousy. For a time however he dissembled his anger and watched for the boy to be seated and asleep; and there he was, his face dropped forward on his chest.

They have yet to learn of the elaborate tracks with their mazy windings dug by Ants in the earth. Now in their wisdom these make their underground dwelling so very tortuous as to render access difficult or totally impossible for such creatures as have designs upon them. And the soil which they excavate they put around the mouth, forming as it were walls a,nd barriers, so that the rain which descends from the sky may not easily flood them and destroy all or at any rate most of them. And with consummate skill they build partitioning walls, as you might say, to separate their cells from one another, and, as in some fine house, there will be three divisions: the first they design for the 'men's quarters,' in which the males live and any females that are with them; the second, in which the pregnant ants bring forth their young — the 'women's quarters,' as it might be; and the third they set apart as a treasury and a pit for the seeds they have collected. And no <a href=/people/3617 target=_blank>Ischomachus</a>, no <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, with their interest in the management of a household on admirable lines, is there to teach them these things. When Ants go abroad to collect food, they follow the biggest ones, and these lead the way, like generals. And as soon as they reach the crops the young ones stand at the foot of the stalks while the leaders crawl up and having eaten through what are called the 'rhacillae' of the fruitful ears, throw the ears down to the crowd below. And these go about and cut off the chaff and peel off the capsules that protect and envelop the wheat. They need no threshing, no men who can winnow, nor even 'rushing winds' to separate and sunder the chaff and the grain, yet the Ants possess the food of men who plough and <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a>. <br />I have also heard the following example of their cleverness: their relations bury dead ants in the capsules of wheat, just as men bury their parents or all whom they love in coffins. </p>                        </div>

Now there were Ants about his feet in great numbers. So he observed how some were conveying a dead ant out of one track to a nest belonging to other ants not of their own kin. And they paused on the edge of the nest with the corpse while others came up from below and met the strangers seemingly with a view to some consultation; the same Ants then went down into the nest. And this happened several times until finally they brought up a worm, as it were a ransom. And the other party accepted it and surrendered the dead body which they had brought. And the Ants in the nest were glad to receive it, as though they were recovering a son or brother. <br />Now what answer can <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> make to this when he says that <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> has made a distinction between various natures and has granted 'to fish on the one hand and to beasts and to winged fowl that they should devour one another, for among them there is no justice, but to mankind has he granted justice'? <br />But <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> will not admit this, since it was at the cost of many marvellous treasures that even he, a man and moreover a descendant of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, redeemed <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a> from the man who was also a hero and a descendant of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. </p>                        </div>

It is smaller than the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>viper</a>, but kills more swiftly, for persons who chance to be bitten burn with thirst and are on fire to drink and imbibe without stopping and in a little while burst. <a href=/people/988 target=_blank>Sostratus</a> declares that the Dipsas is white, though it has two black stripes on its tail. And I have heard that some people call these <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> presteres (inflaters); others, kausones (burners). In fact they deluge this creature with a host of names.

It is said that <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a> stole fire, and the story goes that <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> was angered and bestowed upon those who laid information of the theft a drug to ward off old age.

The <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> proceeded with the load on its back; and it was summer time, and the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> came thirsting to a spring in its need for a drink. Now the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> which was guarding the spring tried to prevent it and force it back, and the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> in torment gave it as the price of the loving-cup the drug that it happened to be carrying. And so there was an exchange of gifts: the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> got his drink and the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> sloughed his old age, receiving in addition, so the story goes, the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>'s thirst. <br />What then? Did I invent the legend?

So as the pair grew up the child became a youth while his foster-brother had already become enormous. And they were devoted to one another. <br />But the relatives of the youth were terrified at the size of the monster. (You may see these creatures attain in a very short time to an enormous size and the most terrifying aspect.) And so while it was asleep on the same bed with the boy, they picked it up and took it as far away as possible. And the boy rose up, but the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>Snake</a> remained in that place.

And they have a spring of drinking-water pure and welling up abundantly; and they are regarded as sacred and are allowed to go unmolested; and they have an agreement with the barbarians in those parts that they shall not be hunted; and it is commonly said that they are under the care of certain gods of the district who are lords of wood and valley. And there is a story current about them, as follows. A certain King of that country was eager to kill some of them on account of the splendour and size of their tusks, in order to obtain a choice possession, for with the multitude of years and the lengthening of time these weapons of these creatures become enormous. <br />So when this desire came upon him he despatched three hundred picked men to shoot this sacred herd. <br />And all equipped they accomplished their journey with the utmost speed, and were actually nearing the spot when a pestilence suddenly seized them and laid them low: all died save only one, and he returned and rendered to him who had sent them a full account of the truly lamentable disaster. By this means it was discovered that the Elephants were beloved of the gods. </p>                        </div>

Indeed they run with all their might and baffle their pursuers by the course they take; which is natural, for they are familiar with the country. And when they have got far away and are at a great distance ahead of the pursuing horsemen and have regained their courage through being secure from danger and feeling free, they pause and rest and are most glad to lay aside their anxious fears. And then at this time they bethink them of food. They feed, so I hear, on the bushy mastic that grows around the trees and the wild ivy that creeps with its dense foliage over them, also upon the young and tender leaves of the date-palm and upon the more sappy shoots and twigs of other plants. <br />But if their pursuers again approach, the Elephants once more take to flight. And so when evening has overtaken them the pursuers bivouac, and by setting fire to the forest to some extent cut off the Elephants' retreat and so bring them to a standstill.

But if the same birds are flying tranquilly, that is a promise of fine weather and a calm atmosphere; and if they make no sound they are reminding those who have experience that it will be fairly calm. And if they (fly in from the sea)? uttering their cries and confusing their order in their agitation, there again they are threatening a heavy storm. And if a shearwater utters its cry at dusk, it apparently signifies the same; if it flies straight to the sea, it is giving a hint that a rainstorm will burst from the sky. If however the weather is stormy, the hooting of an <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a> portends fair weather and a bright day; whereas if the weather is fair and the <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a> hoots softly, you must expect storms. If a raven croaks volubly and pecks and shakes its wings, it is the first to observe that a storm is coming. Again, if the raven, the <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>, and the jackdaw utter their cries in the late afternoon, they teach us that we shall have a visitation by a storm. And if jackdaws, as the same writer says, scream like hawks and fly now high now low, they point to frost and rain. If a <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a> caws softly at supper-time, it is inviting us to expect fair weather next day. If birds appear in great numbers and they are white, it is a certain indication that there will be heavy storms. When ducks and shearwaters flap their wings, they point to violent winds. And when birds come speeding into land from the sea, this is evidence of stormy weather. <br />If the robin comes to <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>-sheds and houses, he is clearly trying to escape from a coming storm. Cockerels too and domestic fowls, when they flap their wings and step proudly and cluck, signify stormy weather. When birds bathe, it is a sign that wind is threatening, and it points to gusty weather. <br />If during a storm birds fly towards one another and in and out it is a sign of fine weather. When birds congregate about meres and on river banks, they know that a storm is coming. On the other hand when birds of the sea and lake come in to land, they know that there will be a heavy storm, whereas land birds hastening to moist places are heralds of fine weather, if, that is, they make no sound. </p>                        </div>

When <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> dig the ground with their hoofs, it is likely to mean a storm; and if the rams mount them early in the day, it promises an early storm; and the same when <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> lie huddled together. When <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pigs</a> appear in cornland, they inform us that the rain is departing. Now when <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> and <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kids</a> leap on one another and frisk about, they promise a bright day. <br />But when martens squeak and <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mice</a> likewise, they are conjecturing that there will be a violent storm. <br />When <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a> quit lonely places and make straight for inhabited districts, they show thereby that they dread the onslaught of a coming storm.

The ministers of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> say that there are certain men called 'hawk-keepers' for this reason: they feed and tend the Hawks belonging to the god. Now the whole race of Hawks is consecrated to this god, but there are certain sacred birds which are fed upon carefully prepared food and which seem in nowise to differ from offerings made to the god. Now the men who have been charged with the care of these birds tell the uninformed that each of them (they are tended in a sacred grove) lays eggs in its nest. They have, it is true, the care of all Hawks, but these sacred ones are their special charge. They take out the brains of birds which have been caught and throw them to the newly born Hawks: soft food for tender chicks. But to those that are full-grown the keepers serve flesh and sinews, which furnish strengthening nourishment for birds of prey. Those however that are in the intermediate stage between chicks and full-grown birds are served with the hearts/ and one may see the remains of them. So the aforesaid difference of foods concedes the point that Hawks know what is appropriate and agreeable to each age; and they are particular about it and would never touch food unsuited to their age. At a certain season quails visit their country and other birds arrive in flocks, and these sacred Hawks feast on them also. </p>                        </div>

In one of the civil wars at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> when <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a> the Roman was murdered, there was not one of the man's enemies that was able to cut off his head, although countless numbers competed for this trophy, until they had killed the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Hound</a> at his side that had been reared under his care and that maintained its affection with the utmost loyalty and fought on behalf of its dead master, as though it were a fellow soldier, sharer of the same tent, and friend to the very last. It is worth knowing 'what a deed was this, wrought' not 'by a man', I declare, but by a faithful <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Hound</a> of valiant spirit. <br /><a href=/people/85 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=person long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> was on a journey when he came upon the corpse of a man who had been killed, with his <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a> standing beside and guarding its master to prevent anybody from adding outrage to murder. Now it happened that this was the third day for which the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a> was keeping its assiduous and most patient watch, unfed. And so when <a href=/people/85 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> learnt this he took pity on the dead man and ordered him to be buried; but as for the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a>, he directed that it should be cared for and gave it whatever one offers a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> with one's hand, in sufficient quantity and of a nature to induce it to be friendly and well-disposed towards him; and little by little <a href=/people/85 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> drew the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a> away. So much then for that. Now not so long after, there was a review of the hoplites, and the King whom I mentioned above was looking on, and that same <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a> was at his side. For most of the time it remained silent and completely gentle. But directly it saw the murderers of its master in the review, it could not contain itself or remain where it was, but leaped upon them, barking and tearing them with its claws, and by frequently turning towards <a href=/people/85 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> did its best to make him see that it had caught the murderers. And so a suspicion dawned upon the King and those about him, and the way in which the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a> barked at the aforesaid men caused them to reflect. The men were seized and put on the rack and confessed their crime. <br />To those who trample upon the ordinance of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the god of fellowship and of aifection and betray their friends in life and after death, all this seems a mere tale. But for my part I do not follow those who fail to appreciate the excellence of Nature which, if she has given brutes a share of kindliness and affection, has certainly given a larger share to us rational beings. But they make no use of her gift. And what need is there to add to my story all the other crimes which men have committed against their friends for the sake of base gain, hatching plots and acting the traitor? It fills me with pain that a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a> should be shown to have more loyalty, more kindly feeling than man. </p>                        </div>

There was a rock rising from the sea, though not to a great height. Now once upon a time an Octopus crawled up it and spread out its tentacles and was glad to warm itself (the weather was inclined to be stormy), though it did not at once assume the colour of the rock. Octopuses do this naturally, to protect themselves against those who have designs upon them, and also that they themselves may ambush fishes. Now an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>Eagle</a>, quick to mark its prey (though it got no good thereby), swooped with all the force of its wings upon the Octopus, reckoning to secure a ready meal for itself and its young. But the creature's tentacles wreathed themselves round the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>Eagle</a>, and clinging fast to its hated enemy dragged it down, <br />a case of 'The hungry <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>,' as you might say. And presently the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>Eagle</a> was floating dead upon the sea for the sake of its meal. Birds in fact suffer countless misadventures of this kind, and men even more: for example, <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> the Second, the son of <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a>, among the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetae</a> celebrated by <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>; <a href=/people/331 target=_blank>Polycrates</a> also who hastened to <a href=/people/5149 target=_blank>Oroetes</a> with the intention of laying hands on his gold, and any who 'working for another's ill, wreaks ill for his own heart.' <br />Brute beasts do not realise these dangers; human beings do, but fail to guard against them. What use to you, <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> and <a href=/people/331 target=_blank>Polycrates</a>, were a tongue, speech, teachers, beatings?

The <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> seem inclined to be sluggish; fawns, roe-deer, gazelles, antelopes, hares (which poets style 'cowerers') are timorous creatures. Timorous also are sparrows among birds, and the mullet among fishes. Baboons and <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> are lecherous, and it is even said that the latter have intercourse with women — a fact which <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> appears to marvel at. And even <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> are said to have assaulted women, and indeed it is reported that a woman in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was accused by her husband of adultery, and the adulterer in the case was stated to be a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hound</a>. And I have heard that baboons have fallen madly in love with girls and have even raped them, being more wanton than the little boys in the all-night revels of <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>. The partridge is extremely lecherous and given to adultery; at any rate these birds are said to go after the hens stealthily and with hardly a sound. <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dogs</a> do not admit others to share their food on any account; at any rate they often tear one another over a bone, just like <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> and <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a> over <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>. <br />I am told that the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=person long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a> are the only ones that pool their prey and share their food. The <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>hog</a> is implacable and devoid of justice; at any rate these creatures eat one another's dead bodies. And the majority of fishes do the same. But the most impious of all is the hippopotamus, for it even eats its own father. Flies and <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> are without shame and are not easily checked. </p>                        </div>

And they have many shapes and many names. And the Runner-crabs as they are called (and most appropriately) roam hither and thither, for it is neither their wish nor their nature to remain quiet and at rest in the same place, but they wander about the beaches where they were born; and they do in fact go further afield, just as human beings who are fond of travel. The occasion of their wandering so far is their desire for more food of some kind. Now in the Thracian <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411291WBos class=place long=29.0753 lat=41.1194>Bosphorus</a> whenever the current comes down strongly from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Euxine</a>, the Crabs wish to force their way upstream, but, as is natural, the stream breaks with too great violence round the headlands, so that if they should want to go against it, it will altogether thrust them back and defeat them. Now the Crabs are already aware of this, and whenever they come near a headland each one halts in some bay-like spot and waits for the others. Then when they have congregated in one spot, they crawl up on to the land and scramble up on to the cliffs and so pass by on foot that part of the sea where the current is strongest. Then having surmounted and passed the promontory, they descend once more to the sea. But the fishermen spare them because it is of their own free will that the Crabs crawl out on to the land: the men wish also to be spared themselves: they cannot bear to appear more cruel than the waves. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly the woman used to hang out as a bait to charm it a garland woven of the season's flowers, and every day it was the Elephant's practice to accept, and hers to offer it. In course of time the woman departed this life, and the Elephant, missing its customary fare and not seeing the woman of its desire, grew savage like a lover who has lost his loved one. And the creature that till then had been of the gentlest was inflamed with passion like men who are overwhelmed with excess of grief and driven out of their senses. </p>                        </div>

Let <a href=/people/10150 target=_blank>Ptolemy Philopator</a> be a trustworthy witness to the fact. With the aid of the god he overcame <a href=/people/60 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, and in sacrificing for his victory and to propitiate the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> he not only offered sacrifices on a magnificent scale but even went so far as to offer four of the very largest elephants as victims, paying homage, as he supposed, to the god by this very sacrifice. But a vision in his sleep troubled him: the god seemed to threaten him for this unusual and strange offering. And he in his fear caused four elephants to be made of bronze and offered them to the god in place of those he had slaughtered, hoping to placate him and to ensure his favour.

One <a href=/people/10996 target=_blank>Androcles</a> by name, who happened to be a slave in the household of a Roman senator, ran away from his master after committing some offence, the nature and extent of which I am unable to state. Well, he arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> and was for avoiding towns and, as the saying is, 'marked their places only by the stars' and went on into the desert. And being parched by the excessive and fiery heat of the sun, he was glad to take refuge and to rest under a caverned rock. This rock, it seems, was the lair of a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a>. Now the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> returned from hunting, injured from having been pierced with a sharp stake, and when it encountered the young man it looked at him in a gentle manner and began to fawn upon him, extending its paw and imploring him as best it could to have the stake plucked out. <a href=/people/10996 target=_blank>Androcles</a> at first shrank back. But when he saw that the beast was in gentle mood, and realised what was the matter with its paw, he extracted what was hurting it and rid the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> of its pain. The <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> therefore in joy at being healed paid him his fee by treating him as its guest and friend, and shared with him the spoils of its chase. And while the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> ate its food raw, as is the custom of <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a>, <a href=/people/10996 target=_blank>Androcles</a> used to cook his for himself. And they enjoyed a common table each as was his nature. And this was how <a href=/people/10996 target=_blank>Androcles</a> lived for the space of three years. After a time, as his hair grew to an excessive length and he was troubled with a violent itching, he forsook the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> and trusted himself to fortune. Then as he was wandering about he was caught, questioned as to whom he belonged to, and sent bound to his master in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. The master punished his servant for the injury he had done him and he was condemned to be given to the wild beasts to eat. It chanced that the same <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=person long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyan</a> <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> had also been caught and was let loose in the arena together with the young man destined for death, him who had shared that very <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a>'s home and dwelling. The man for his part did not know the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> again, but the animal immediately recognised the man, fawned upon him, and letting its whole body sink down, threw itself at his feet. And at last <a href=/people/10996 target=_blank>Androcles</a> recognised his host and throwing his arms round it, greeted it like a comrade returned after absence. But as he was thought to be a magician; a leopard also was let loose upon him. And when it rushed at <a href=/people/10996 target=_blank>Androcles</a> the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> came to the rescue of its former healer and remembering how they used to feed together, tore the leopard to pieces. The spectators, as was natural, were dumbfounded, and the man who was giving the shows summoned <a href=/people/10996 target=_blank>Androcles</a> and learnt the whole story. And the report spread through the multitude, and the populace on learning the truth shouted aloud that both man and <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> must be set free. <a href=/people/767 target=_blank>Memory</a> is indeed one of the attributes of animals. <br />And there is a corresponding story to the same effect as the above . . . in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a> in front of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> of the Open Mouth . . ., might be thought to know the lair also.

Huntsmen take thoroughbred bitches which are good at tracking wild animals and are very swift of foot to places infested by these animals; they tie them to trees and then go away, simply, as the saying is, trying a throw of the dice. And if tigers find them when they have caught nothing and are famished, they tear them to pieces. If however they arrive on heat and full-fed they couple with the bitches, for tigers too when gorged turn their thoughts to sexual intercourse. From this union, so it is said, a tiger is born, not a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hound</a>. And from this tiger and a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>bitch</a> again a tiger would be born, although the offspring of this last and of a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>bitch</a> takes after its dam, and the seed degenerates and a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hound</a> is born. Nor will <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> contradict this. Now these <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> which can boast a tiger for sire scorn to pursue a stag or to face a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>, but are glad to rush at <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> and thereby to give proof of their pedigree. <br />At any rate the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> gave <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the son of <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a> a test of the strength of these <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> in the following manner. They let loose a stag, and the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Hound</a> stayed quiet; then a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>, and it never moved; after that a bear, but the bear caused it no excitement whatever. But when a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> was let loose, and 'when' the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Hound</a> 'beheld it, then came wrath upon him the fiercer', and as though it had seen its real adversary, it neither hesitated nor remained still but leapt upon the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> and clung to it with a vigorous grip, pressing and throttling it. So then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> who was giving the King this exhibition, knowing full well the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Hound</a>'s power of endurance, ordered the men to cut off its tail. The tail was cut off, but the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Hound</a> paid no heed. So the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> ordered one of its legs to be cut off, and cut off it was. But the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Hound</a> clung as fast as ever, and would not let go, as though the leg of some other creature unconnected with it were being cut off. Then another leg was cut off and still the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Hound</a> would not relax its bite; then a third, and it continued to cling; and after these the fourth, and still it was capable of biting. And finally they severed the rest of its body from its head. But the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Hound</a>'s fangs maintained their original grip, while the head hung aloft on the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>, although the biter himself was no more. At this <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was grieved and amazed that the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Hound</a> in giving proof of its mettle had perished, a fate the reverse of a coward's, and had met its death by reason of its courage. Accordingly the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> seeing <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s grief, presented him with four <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> of the same breed. And he was delighted to receive them and gave the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> a suitable gift in return. And when the son of <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a> received the four he forgot his grief over the first. </p>                        </div>

Otherwise it preserves the animal alive until the huntsman comes up and decides what he wants to do with the capture. But if it comes upon a dead hare or <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> it will not touch it, refusing to claim credit for another's labours and declining to appro-priate what does not belong to it. From these facts it appears to have a certain natural love of distinction: it is not meat that it wants; it is victory that it loves. And it is worth hearing how the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Hound</a> behaves when it is hunting. It goes ahead of the huntsman, to whom it is attached by a long leash, and controlling its bark, tracks the game by scent. And so long as no game comes its way and it finds nothing, it goes forward rather despondently to judge from its looks; for all that, it goes ahead and leads the huntsman on with the utmost keenness and pertinacity. But if it tracks out some beast and comes upon some scent, then it halts. And the huntsman approaches while the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Hound</a> overjoyed at its good luck fawns upon its master, licks his feet, and resumes its original quest, advancing step by step until it comes upon the lair; further it does not go. So then the huntsman understands and with a low call gives the signal to the men with the nets. And they set the nets in a ring. Thereupon the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Hound</a> barks. The intention of its baying just then is to provoke the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> to rise in order that he may emerge and as he flees may be caught in the nets. And when the beast is captured, the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Hound</a> raises a loud cry of victory, as it were a hymn of praise, and is delighted and leaps about, like soldiers who have overcome their enemies.

And the headland and caverned rock to which they swam with him on their backs are pointed out, and the spot is called Coeraneus. Later when this same <a href=/people/2303 target=_blank>Coeranus</a> died they burnt his body by the sea-shore. Whereupon the <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>Dolphins</a>, observing this from some point, assembled as though they were attending his funeral, and all the while that the pyre was ablaze they remained at hand, as one trusty friend might remain by another.

For instance, when they come near to the pit which elephant-hunters are in the habit of secretly digging, whether by some natural instinct or by some altogether mysterious faculty of divination they restrain themselves from going any further, and turn back and put up a most strenuous resistance as in war and try to overthrow their hunters and, thrusting their way through them, to seek safety in flight after overcoming their adversaries. So then there ensues a fierce battle and there is a slaughter of hunters and hunted. And this is how the battle is fought. The men take aim and hurl stout spears at them, while the Elephants seize upon any man that has fallen in their way, dash him to earth, trample upon him, and wounding him with their tusks inflict upon him a most pitiful and agonising death. And the animals attack, their ears in passion spread wide like sails, after the manner of ostriches which open their wings to flee or to attack. And the Elephants bending their trunk inwards and folding it beneath their tusks, like the ram of a ship driving along with a great surge, fall upon the men in a tremendous charge, overturning many and bellowing with a piercing, shrill note like a trumpet. And as those who are caught are trampled or smashed by the beasts' knees, a great sound of bones being crushed can be heard even at a distance, and men's faces, with eyes knocked out, nose battered, and forehead split, lose their distinctive features, and frequently become unrecognisable even by their nearest relatives. Others however escape contrary to expectation, in the following manner. A hunter has been caught, but the Elephant in its forward rush has overpassed him and has planted its knees upon the earth and has besides fixed its tusks in a thicket or in a tree-root or some similar object, and is held fast and can only with difficulty withdraw and pull them out. Meanwhile the hunter slips out and escapes. In such a battle therefore it often happens that the Elephants are victorious, often however that they are defeated through the men designedly applying various means of scaring them. For instance, trumpets are sounded; the hunters make a din and a clash by beating their spears on their shields; now they light a fire on the ground, now they lift it up in the air; or again they launch burning firebrands like javelins and violently brandish great torches in full blaze before the faces of the animals. And as the animals dread and are dazzled by these things they are pushed back and sometimes forced to fall into the pit which till then they have kept clear of. </p>                        </div>

For they seek intercourse with the female not as though minded to commit an outrage or from lust, but like men desiring a succession to their family and to beget children, in order that their common offspring may not fail but that they may leave their seed after them. At any rate once only in a life-time do their thoughts turn to love, when the female herself submits. Then when each one has impregnated its mate, thereafter it knows her no more. And they do not couple without reserve or in the sight of others but withdraw and screen themselves in thick trees or in some close-growing forest or in some deep hollow, which affords them ample means of hiding. <br />Now I said above that they were just, and I have already spoken of their valour. Their continence has been displayed in the present instance. Further, anyone who has leisure to learn of their detestation of evil should lend an ear and listen to this. The trainer of a tame Elephant had a somewhat elderly but rich wife. Now he was in love with another woman, and desiring that his wife's property should become hers, he strangled his wife and buried her, rash man that he was, close by the Elephant's manger, and married the other woman. So then the Elephant seizing hold of the new arrival with its revc trunk led her up to the dead body, dug it up, and laid it bare with its tusks, showing by its mere action what it could not express in words, and enlightening the woman as to the conduct of him who had wedded her; such was the Elephant's hatred of evil. </p>                        </div>

They are principally .eaten by fish which swim in shoals, and so when scared they rush to one another, and as each clings to its neighbour, by their close cohesion they avoid falling an easy prey to plots upon their life. And so united is their mass when they have rushed together that even ships which run into them do not cleave it. Moreover should someone wish to drive an oar or a pole through them, they are not torn apart, but cling to each other as though woven together. But if you put your hand down and pull hard as if you were drawing grains of wheat or beans from a heap, you may catch some, with the result that they are often tom to pieces and that fragments of fish are caught, while the rest is left behind. For though you may get possession of the tail, yet the head remains with the other fish; or you may take home a head, but the rest of the fish remains in the sea. Their swimming in a dense, compact mass is called a 'draught,' and a single draught often fills fifty fishing-boats, as toilers of the sea inform us. </p>                        </div>

There was a woman in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>, admirable in other ways and particularly as a faithful wife. Her name was Heracleis. <br />So long as her husband lived she cared for him with the utmost devotion. But when he died the woman took a dislike to life in the city and to the home in which she had seen her husband dead, and such was her grief that she went to dwell among the tombs and was content to remain by her late husband's sepulchre, constant to him who was beneath the soil. And once in summer when some storks, still fledglings, were essaying their first flight, one of them, the youngest, not having sufficient strength of wing, fell and broke one of its legs. So Heracleis seeing its fall and finding how its leg was injured, took pity on the nestling and picking it up very gently wrapped up the wound, and tended it with fomentations and plasters, brought it food, gave it drink, and, when in due course it was strong and had grown its quill-feathers, set it free. And the stork, knowing by some strange instinct that it owed her the price of its life, departed. Later when a year had passed and spring was just beginning to brighten, the woman chanced to be warming herself in the sun, and the Stork which had been healed by her, seeing its benefactress, checked the speed of its wings and sinking nearer to earth came close, opened its bill, and disgorged a stone into the lap of Heracleis, and then flew off and settled on the roof. At first, naturally enough, she was amazed and startled out of her wits, and was at a loss to conjecture what this action could mean. And so she put the stone away somewhere indoors; later being woken in the night she saw that it diffused a brightness and a gleam, and the house was lit up as though a torch had been brought in, so strong a radiance came from, and was engendered by, the lump of stone. And when she had taken hold of the Stork and handled it she recognised the scar left by the wound, and knew that it was the very bird which had been the object of her pity and her ministrations. </p>                        </div>

The account given by the historian of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=place long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a> is as follows. A woman suffered from an intestinal worm, and the cleverest doctors despaired of curing her.

The god was not at hand. The attendants of the temple however made her lie down in the place where the god was in the habit of healing his petitioners. And the woman lay quiet as she was bid; and the ministers of the god addressed themselves to her cure: they severed her head from the neck, and one of them inserted his hand and drew out the worm, which was a monstrous creature. But to adjust the head and to restore it to its former setting, this they always failed to do. Well, the god arrived and was enraged with the ministers for undertaking a task beyond their skill, and himself with the irresistible power of a god restored the head to the body and raised the stranger up again. For my part, O King <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>, of all gods the kindliest to man, I do not set Wormwood against your skill (heaven forbid I should be so insensate!), but in considering Wormwood I was reminded of your beneficent action and of your astounding powers of healing.

For inflamed with violent passion it rushed forward and coming up to the young and beautiful Elephant, fell upon it and began to fight, like a man filled with resentment over the conduct of his wife or his mistress. And the two dashed together with such force that both damaged their tusks.

First of all they lead them away bound into a wood a little distance from the trench in which they have captured them, keeping them apart by ropes and not allowing them either to run forward or to stop and pull back. Next they fasten each beast to a very large tree at a measured distance from the next one so that they can neither spring forward nor retreat backwards to any extent through being free to leap about and work mischief. And by refusing them food and by starvation they drain away their excessive strength and power, and gradually reduce their spirit and their inflexible determination, so that they forget their hitherto indomitable fierceness and abandon their former temper. The keepers of these animals go up to them and offer them food from their hands, and the Elephants under stress of need take it and do the men no harm, and already begin to wear a mild and fatigued expression. But those that are extremely powerful and full-grown, after bursting their bonds and tearing up trees with the points of their tusks and with their trunks, even smashing some by their onset and by assailing them, have with difficulty and only after a long while been tamed sometimes by starvation sometimes by pleasant food, at other times by means of goads. While these animals are being tamed their food consists of very large loaves of bread, barley, dried figs, raisins, onions, garlic, honey in large quantities, bundles of mastic branches and of palm-leaves and of ivy and any edible and familiar substance which is for that reason welcome to them. </p>                        </div>

The fish, which enjoy an even more richly wrought colouring, are an astonishing sight. <br />And the oysters in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Red Sea</a> are not without the same glamour, for they are encircled with rings of fiery hue, and to look at them you would say that with the blending of their colours they were copying the rainbow, Nature having painted parallel stripes upon them.

So then these shells which are the mothers of the aforesaid pearls are sought for when the weather is fine and the sea smooth. And the seekers collect them and extract this object which delights the hearts of the luxurious. One may find a small pearl even in the largest shell and a large one in a small shell; and this one contains none, and that not more than one, and many contain a number. <br />Some assert that as many as twenty have been attached to a single shellfish. Now the shell is the flesh, and these pearls cling to it like a thorn. But if one were to open the shell prematurely, that is before the birth-process is complete, one would find the flesh indeed, but it will not contain the object of one's quest. The pearl, it seems, is like a stone produced by petrifaction, and it is not its nature to contain or to admit even a drop of moisture. In the opinion of those who trade in pearls and those who buy them pearls that are pure white and large are the most beautiful and the most highly esteemed, and I can avow that many of those who make a livelihood by them have become wealthy. And I am also well aware that when these stones have been extracted and the shellfish have been released after giving up the aforesaid coveted object as ransom for their lives, they have gradually produced another one. If however the animal that fosters the pearl dies before the pearl is extracted, as is sometimes reported, both pearl and flesh rot away and perish. <br />It has a naturally smooth and well-rounded contour, but if a man should want by artificial means to make round and smooth some stone not naturally so, the pearl confounds his design, for it declines to yield and develops roughnesses, thereby denouncing the plot that has been laid to secure its beauty. </p>                        </div>

Now the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> called Tentyrites know the best way to master the beast: the most effective way of wounding it is to strike it in the eyes or the armpits and even in the belly. Its back however, and its tail are impenetrable, for it is fortified and, so to say, armed with scaly plates which resemble hard earthenware or shells.

And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> say, though I for one am not easily persuaded, yet they say that those who see to the embalming of animals and who are experts at it, agree that the entrails of the Ibis measure ninety-six cubits. I have heard further that its stride when walking measures a cubit. And when the moon is in eclipse it closes its eyes until the goddess shines out again. It is said to be beloved of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> the father of speech because its appearance resembles the nature of speech: thus, the black wing-feathers might be compared to speech suppressed and turned inwards, the white to speech brought out, now audible, the servant and the messenger of what is within, so to say. Now I have already mentioned that the bird lives to a very great age. And <a href=/people/1363 target=_blank>Apion</a> states that it is immortal and adduces the priests of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/277308UHer class=place long=30.8036 lat=27.7796>Hermopolis</a> as witnesses to prove it. Yet even he considers that this is very far from the truth, and to me it would seem to be an absolute falsehood. The Ibis is a very hot-blooded creature, at any rate it is an exceedingly voracious and foul feeder if it really does eat <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> and scorpions. And yet some things it digests without difficulty, while others it easily expels in its excrement. And very rarely would one see a sick Ibis, yet it thrusts its beak down in every place, caring nothing for any filth and treading upon it in the hope of tracking down something even there. <br />And yet when it turns to rest it first of all washes itself and purges. It makes its nest in the top of date-palms in order to escape the <a href=/people/556 target=_blank>cats</a>, for this animal cannot easily clamber and crawl up a date-palm as it is constantly impeded and thrown off by the protuberances on the stem. </p>                        </div>

And it will drink wine, and if boiled or cooked meat is served to it, it will eat its fill; and it likes well-seasoned food, but food boiled without any care it dislikes. <br />If it wears clothes, it is careful of them; and it does everything else that I have described above.

Now his son was a vigorous youth of remarkable beauty and his name was Pindus. Other sons he had besides, but they were foolish in spirit and not robust of body, and so in course of time growing jealous of the valour and the general good fortune of their brother, they slew him; but it was to their own undoing, and they paid the penalty as was right. For Pindus realising that his brothers were plotting against him, left his father's kingdom and lived in the country. And besides being vigorous in other respects he was also a great hunter. And on one occasion he was pursuing some fawns, and they fled as fast as their legs could carry them, while he rode at full speed in pursuit, leaving his fellow huntsmen far behind. But the fawns entered a hollow and very deep ravine, escaped out of their pursuer's sight, and disappeared. Accordingly Pindus leapt from his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and fastened it by the rein to one of the trees hard by and was just about to investigate the ravine and to search for the fawns, when he heard a voice which said 'Touch not the fawns!' And so after looking all round and seeing nothing, he was in fear of the voice, thinking that it proceeded from some mightier agency. And then he departed taking his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> with him. But on the following day he came unaccompanied, but remembering the voice that had fallen on his ears and being afraid, he did not enter the ravine. And while he was taking council with himself and was perplexed as to who it was that the day before had checked his pursuit of the quarry, and while he was looking about, as was natural, for shepherds on the hills or other hunters, he beheld a monstrous <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> trailing most of its body behind but with the neck, which was small compared with the rest of the body, held aloft. (Neck and head together exceeded in size that of a full-grown man.) The sight filled him with terror. Pindus however did not take to flight, but pulled himself together and by his adroitness tricked the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>, for he brought forward the birds which he happened to have caught and offered them as friendly gifts and as a ransom for his own life. And the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> mollified presumably and bewitched, as you might say, by the gifts, departed. This pleased the youth and thereafter, being a good man, he used to bring payment for the saving of his life to the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>, giving freely the first fruits of the chase, whether beast or bird from the hills. And this bestowal of gifts had the most fruitful results for Pindus, and his fortune began to prosper and grew every day more impressive, for whether it was beasts of the forest or whether it was birds, with all of them his hunting was successful. Accordingly he enjoyed abundance; moreover his fame spread abroad, of how he fearlessly attacked and captured wild beasts. His figure was tall and such as to cause astonishment by reason of the bulk of his body and of his splendid condition also. And it was clear that his beauty inflamed and kindled the hearts of all women with desire for him: all who were widowed would throng his doors like people crazed, while those who were married to husbands and whom custom confined indoors were enslaved by the fame of Pindus's beauty and would rather have been his wife than become goddesses. As to the men, most of them admired and loved him; only his brothers hated him. And once when he was hunting by himself they lay in wait for him, and the hunting-ground was near a river, and the three set upon him as he had none to help him and smote him with their swords. Whereupon he cried aloud. His cry was heard by his companion the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>. (This creature is keen of hearing and has very sharp eyes.) And so it emerged from its lair and coiling round the miscreants killed them by choking them to death. But the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> continued to mount guard until the youth's relations, who were anxious for him, arrived and found him lying dead. But though they made lamentation for him they did not dare to attend to the dead body for fear of its guardian. The <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> however realising by some mysterious instinct that it was keeping them away, departed at a very leisurely pace, leaving Pindus to receive the last kind service from his kin. And so he was buried with great pomp, and the river which was close by the scene of murder was called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387224PAky class=place long=22.3773 lat=38.6815>Pindus</a> after the dead man and the tomb over him. It is then a characteristic of animals to render thanks to their benefactors, as I have stated earlier on, and especially on this occasion. </p>                        </div>

But I learn that <a href=/people/235 target=_blank>Hamilcar</a> the Carthaginian6 looted these objects, melted down the silver and gold, and then distributed an infamous largesse to his troops. And for these deeds he suffered the most painful and grievous torments and was punished with crucifixion, while all his accomplices and partners in that unholy sacrilege died violent and terrible deaths. And his native land which till then was so prosperous and which was reputed enviable above most lands, after these sacred objects had been imported, was reduced to slavery.0 But impressive though these facts are they have no bearing on my present object, but what is relevant to this discourse shall now be told. <br />On every day throughout the whole year the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380126UEry class=place long=12.588 lat=38.04>Eryx</a> and strangers too sacrifice to the goddess. And the largest of the altars is in the open air, and upon it many sacrifices are offered, and all day long and into the night the fire is kept burning. The dawn begins to brighten, and still the altar shows no trace of embers, no ashes, no fragments of half-burnt logs, but is covered with dew and fresh grass which comes up again every night. And the sacrificial victims from every herd come up and stand beside the altar of their own accord; it is the goddess in the first place that leads them on, and in the second place it is the ability to pay, and the wish, on the part of the sacrificer. At any rate should you desire to sacrifice a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, lo and behold, there is a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> standing at the altar, and you must begin the ceremonial washing. But if you are a man of substance and wish to sacrifice one <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a> or even more than one, then the herdsman will not mulct you by charging too much, nor will you disappoint him,6 for the goddess sees that the sale-prices are just, and if you pay fairly you will win her favour. If however you want to buy at a cheaper rate than is proper, you will pay down your money in vain — the animal departs and you are unable to sacrifice. <br />So much then for this peculiarity of animals at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380126UEry class=place long=12.588 lat=38.04>Eryx</a> in addition to those which I have mentioned earlier on. </p>                        </div>

The many other matters of importance which he narrates I think there is no need for me to bring in now, and in fact I shall postpone the full recital to some other occasion, when it will be pleasanter for me and more convenient for my hearers. The only facts which this narrative invites me to relate are as follows. This god has as priests the sons of <a href=/people/208 target=_blank>Boreas</a> and <a href=/people/2565 target=_blank>Chione</a>, three in number, brothers by birth, and six cubits in height. <br />So when at the customary time they perform the established ritual of the aforesaid god there swoop down from what are called the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/520255LRhi class=place long=25.5 lat=52>Rhipaean</a> mountains swans in clouds, past numbering, and after they have circled round the temple as though they were purifying it by their flight, they descend into the precinct of the temple, an area of immense size and of surpassing beauty. Now whenever the singers sing their hymns to the god and the harpers accompany the chorus with their harmonious music, thereupon the Swans also with one accord join in the chant and never once do they sing a discordant note or out of tune, but as though they had been given the key by the conductor they chant in unison with the natives who are skilled in the sacred melodies. Then when the hymn is finished the aforesaid winged choristers, so to call them, after their customary service in honour of the god and after singing and celebrating his praises all through the day, depart. </p>                        </div>

How then could I avoid being censured by history and by Nature, who made and gave this gift also to man? <br />But (no one shall accuse me of negligence on this point?), and I will describe also, as is reasonable, this system of religion. <br />Among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> <a href=/people/360 target=_blank>Apis</a> is believed to be the god whose presence is most manifest. He is born of a <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a> on which a flash of light from heaven has fallen and caused his engendering. The Greeks call him <a href=/people/1212 target=_blank>Epaphus</a> and trace his descent from his mother the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=person long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a> <a href=/people/389 target=_blank>Io</a>, daughter of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378228WIna class=place long=22.744 lat=37.625>Inachus</a>. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> however reject the story as false, and appeal to time as their witness, for they maintain that <a href=/people/1212 target=_blank>Epaphus</a> was born late down the ages, whereas the first <a href=/people/360 target=_blank>Apis</a> visited mankind many, many thousands of years earlier. <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> and <a href=/people/647 target=_blank>Aristagoras</a> adduce evidence and tokens of this; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> do not acknowledge them, for they assert that there are nine-and-twenty marks clearly to be seen on this sacred <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>. But what these marks are, and how they are distributed over the body of the animal, and in what fashion the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> is, as it were, adorned with them, you may learn from another source. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> are able to explain which of the stars each mark symbolises. And they say further that the marks indicate when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> will rise and the shape of the universe. But you will also see a mark (so the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> assert) which suggests that darkness is older than light. And another mark explains the shape of the crescent moon to him who understands; there are besides, other mysterious signs of different import which to the eyes of the profane and those uninstructed in divine history are hard to interpret. And whenever the report gets abroad which tells the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> that the god has been born, some of the sacred scribes to whom there has been handed down from father to son the science whereby they verify these marks, come to the spot where the calf has been born to the heifer beloved of god, and in accordance with the immemorial precepts of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> erect a house where the calf will live at any rate for the time being; it faces the rising sun and is quite large enough to take in the nurses of the calf, for it is essential that the calf should be at the udder for four months. And when it has been weaned, then at the rising of the new moon the sacred scribes and priests go out to meet it and moreover year by year make ready a sacred vessel for this god and transport him on board to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>, where he finds abodes after his heart and delightful spots to linger in and places where he may amuse himself, where he may run and roll in the dust and exercise himself, and the homes of beautiful <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a>, and a well and a spring that yield water for drinking, for his ministers and priests say that it is not good for him always to drink of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>. Moreover he is said to grow fat on this sweet water which helps to build up a mass of flesh. As for the processions which they hold and the sacred offices which they perform when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> celebrate the revelation of the new god, the dances which they execute, the feasts and the assemblies which they organise, and how every town and village is filled with joy — all this would make a long story.

For instance when <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> was besieging <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=place long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megara</a> a female elephant of the name of <a href=/people/1952 target=_blank>Nicaea</a> was being kept along with one of the war-elephants.

And the Elephant grew fond of the child and used to look after it, and liked to have it lying near, and would glance at it when it whimpered; and when it slept the Elephant would scare away the flies, holding in her trunk a spray from the reeds which were thrown beside her as her fodder. And if the child was not there she would actually put her own food aside. And so the mother was obliged to give the child its fill of milk and then place it beside its guardian, otherwise <a href=/people/1952 target=_blank>Nicaea</a> gave unmistakable signs of being annoyed and angered and even of threatening mischief. And often, if the baby started to cry, she rocked the cradle in which it lay, comforting it as nurses are in the habit of doing by the swaying — and this, my fellow-men, was an Elephant. </p>                        </div>

The gods take thought for them, neither looking down upon them nor reckoning them of small account. For although destitute of reasoning power, at any rate they possess understanding and knowledge proportionate to their needs. And I will explain how they are beloved of the gods, not by many examples taken from a multitude but by a sufficient number. <br />A cavalry officer of the name of <a href=/people/2890 target=_blank>Lenaeus</a> owned a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> of fine appearance, very fleet of foot and of dauntless spirit; in displays it was good at running the course it had been taught; in war itself it was capable of endurance; and was quite excellent both in pursuit, when occasion arose, and in retreat, where necessity called for it. And in consequence of all this the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> was a valued possession, and the owner was accounted most fortunate by his fellow cavalrymen. Now the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, with the excellent qualities I have described, in consequence of a blow which it received in its right eye was incapacitated for seeing. Accordingly <a href=/people/2890 target=_blank>Lenaeus</a> seeing all his hopes anchored upon the condition of his noble <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> (the cavalry shield covered the left eye which alone could see), went to the temple of <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Serapis</a> bringing a patient of a most unusual kind, — his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and, as though he were pleading for a brother or a son, implored the god for the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>'s sake to have compassion on his suppliant, especially as it had done no wrong. For men, he said, may bring misfortune upon themselves either by some impious act or some blasphemous speech. 'But what sacrilege,' he exclaimed, 'or what murder has a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> committed, and how and by what means has it blasphemed?' And he called the god to witness that he himself had never wronged any man, and for this reason he implored the god to relieve his comrade-in-arms and friend of its blindness. And the god, although so mighty, did not neglect or scorn to heal the dumb beast, and therefore took pity both on the sick animal and on the man who besought him on its behalf, and prescribed a cure, not by fomenting the eye but by warming it with vapour baths at midday in the temple precinct. So this was done and the eye of the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> was restored.

And as he was breaking up the soil he caught sight of the tail involved in the sand, while the severed portion from the belly upwards to the neck was still crawling and covered with gore from the cut. He was horror-struck, went out of his mind, and passed into a state of real madness of the most acute description. By day he lost control of himself and of his reason; moreover at night he was in a state of frenzy, and would leap out of bed saying that the Asp was pursuing him, and as though he was on the point of being bitten would utter the most horrifying cries and shout for help. He would even say that he saw the form of the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> which he had slain, angrily threatening him; at times he avowed that he had been bitten, and it was evident from his groans that he was in pain. So when his affliction had lasted for some time, his relations took him as a suppliant to the temple of <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Serapis</a> and implored the god to remove and abolish the phantom of the aforesaid Asp.

He was unwilling to keep it along with the common flock as a household pet or for eating, but attached it to the temple of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> Protector of the City, judging the aforesaid bird to be an offering worthy of the god. This bird a dissolute youth of considerable wealth longed to capture and to make a meal of, for he habitually indulged his appetite on any and every pretext, and in his extravagant gluttony and depravity he regarded variety of food and what had been acquired by dangerous means and what had been purchased at the cost of immense trouble as an accession to his pleasure. Accordingly he offered one of the attendants on the god a substantial bribe to commit sacrilege, and promised him a further sum besides. And the man elated by a vain hope went to the spot where he knew the bird lodged and tried to lay hands on it and bring it to his rich patron. But the bird he did not see: what he did see was a huge <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>asp</a> reared up in anger against him. At first he was afraid and made off, but when the dissolute man insisted and urged him on, the attendant went to get the <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>Peacock</a>. But the bird sprang up out of reach and raising itself lightly through the air on its wings, settled not upon one of the sacred trees nor upon any other lofty and high spot but upon the centre of the temple, and surveyed them with an unflinching eye as though to show that it was too clever for their designs and that it was not to be caught. Accordingly since the attendant had accomplished nothing, the dissolute man demanded the money, which he had already given, back again; but the other refused, saying that he had carried out his orders but was unable to steal what belonged to the gods. As was natural, a quarrel arose over the affair and presently there was shouting, and many people heard the noise. Next, the chief priest arrived and enquired what was the reason of this wrangling in the temple, and the men began to accuse one another. And the rich man, outraged by threats, blasphemy, and abuse, took his departure, and after swallowing the bone of another bird was in pain and died in agonies, while the wicked attendant was punished by the governor of the city for sacrilege. <br />As for the bird, it was not seen either alive or dead, but the story goes that after living for a hundred years it disappeared. </p>                        </div>

And the theme of the song is 'Do not bewitch any of the beholders'; this singing appears, as you might say, to be a substitute for amulets.

The windows of some open to the east, others to the west, making life more pleasant for them. And to preserve their health they have places for exercise, and wrestling-grounds near by, and their adversary is a well-nourished calf. And if, after practising his skill against the calf, the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> brings it down (this takes time for he is lazy and unused to hunting), he eats his fill and goes back to his own stall. <br />The <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> is a very fiery animal, and this is why the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> connect him with <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a>, but, they say, he dislikes and shuns the fire from without because of the great fire within himself. And since he is of a very fiery nature, they say the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> is the house of the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, and when the sun is, at its hottest and at the height of summer, they say it is approaching the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a>. Moreover the inhabitants of the great city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/301313UHel class=place long=31.3075 lat=30.1293>Heliopolis</a> keep these <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lions</a> in the entrance to the temples of the god as sharing (so the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> say) to some extent the lot of the gods. And further, they appear in dreams to those whom the god regards with favour and utter prophecies, and those who have committed perjury they punish not after some delay but immediately, for the god inspires them with a righteous indignation. And <a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a> maintains that if his lot translates a man into an animal, then it is best for him to transmigrate into a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>; if into a plant, then into a sweet-bay. <a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a>' words are <br />'Among wild beasts they become <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> that couch upon the mountains and sleep on the earth, and among trees with fair foliage sweet-bay-trees.' <br />But if we are (as we ought) to take into consideration the wisdom of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> who refer such manifestations to natural causes, they assign the foreparts of this animal to fire, and the hinder parts to water. Again, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> artificers in their sculptures and the vainglorious legends of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a> attempt to represent the <a href=/people/974 target=_blank>Sphinx</a>, with her two-fold nature, as of two-fold shape, making her awe-inspiring by fusing the body of a maiden with that of a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>. And <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> suggests this when he says <br />'And drawing her tail in beneath her <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>'s feet she sat down.' <br />And moreover they say that the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378227SNem class=person long=22.7108 lat=37.8085>Nemea</a> fell from the moon.

And again from the Chorus of <a href=/people/799 target=_blank>Epicrates</a> they cite these words: <br />'The accursed go-between fooled me completely, swearing by the Maiden, by <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, by <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Persephone</a>, that the wench was a heifer, virgin, an untamed filly — and all the time she was an absolute mousehole.' <br />By calling her an 'absolute mousehole' he meant to say that she was beyond measure lecherous. And <a href=/people/638 target=_blank>Philemon</a> says: <br />'A white <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mouse</a>, when someone tries to — but I am ashamed to say the word, the confounded woman at once lets out such a yell, that it is after impossible to avoid attracting attention.' </p>                        </div>

He agrees that their stomach is extremely hot, and that the veins throughout their entire body are extremely fine, while the bone containing the brain is extremely thin, like a membrane, and loose in texture, and the veins that rise from it to the crown of the head are extremely thick. The food at all events, or at any rate the most productive part of it, is distributed through the body at great speed: the fatty portion of it, he says, envelops their body on the outside, while the solid portion mounts through the veins to the brain. And this is how horns, being moistened with plentiful juices, come to sprout. The continuous flow therefore extrudes the earlier horns. And the moisture which rises and emerges from the body solidifies, the air congealing and hardening it into horns, while that which is still enclosed in the body is soft. The one portion is rendered solid by the external cold; the other remains soft owing to the internal heat. Accordingly the added growth of the new horn extrudes the older as alien, because what is within chafes and tries to push it upwards, swelling and throbbing as though it were in haste to be born and to emerge, for the juice, you see, bursting out and mounting upwards from below cannot remain stationary, but it too solidifies and is impelled against the parts above it. And the older horns are in most cases forced out by the strength of that which is within, although in some cases the animal, forced ahead by its own momentum, has broken off horns that have got entangled in branches and hinder it from running swiftly. These then drop off, but the new horns which are ready to peep out are pushed forward by nature. </p>                        </div>

Netting fish brings wealth, and may be compared to the capture of a camp and the taking of prisoners; it requires a variety of gear, for instance rope, fishing-line white and black, cord made from galingale, corks, lead, pine timber, thongs, sumach, a stone, papyrus, horns, a six-oared ship, a windlass with handles, a cottane, a drum, iron, timber, and pitch. And there fall into the nets fish of different kinds, varied droves in their multitude. <br />Fishing with a pole is the most manly form and needs a hunter of very great strength. He must have a straight pole of pine-wood, ropes of esparto, and firesticks of thoroughly sappy pine. He also needs a small boat and vigorous oarsmen with strong arms. Fishing with a weel is a pursuit that calls for much craft and deep design, and seems highly unbecoming to free men. The essentials are club-rushes unsoaked, withies, a large stone, anchors, sea-weed, leaves of rushes and cypress, corks, pieces of wood, a bait, and a small skiff. <br />Fishing with a hook is the most accomplished form and the most suitable for free men. One needs <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>-hair, white, black, red, and grey in colour. If the hairs are dyed, men select only those coloured blue-grey and sea-purple; for all the rest, they say, are bad. Men also use the straight bristles of wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> and flax also, and a quantity of bronze and lead, cords of esparto, feathers, especially white, black, and particoloured. And anglers also use crimson and sea-purple wool, corks, and pieces of wood. Iron and other materials are needed; among them reeds of straight growth and unsoaked, club-rushes that have been soaked, stalks of fennel rubbed smooth, a fishing-rod of cornel-wood, the horns and hide of a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>.

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> shall relate the practice in his country, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=demonym long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyan</a> shall relate what he knows. So their two accounts are as follows. <br />In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> if a full-grown Elephant is captured he is hard to tame and his craving for freedom makes him thirst for blood, and if you make him fast with ropes his anger is inflamed all the more and he will not stand being a slave and a prisoner. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> blandish him with food and try to mollify him with a variety of attractive baits, offering him what will fill his stomach and assuage his passion, Yet he is displeased with them and takes no notice of them. So what device do the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> adopt to meet this? They introduce native music and charm the Elephants with a musical instrument that is in common use; it is called scindapsus. And the Elephant lends an ear and is pacified; his rage is softened, and his passion is subdued and allayed, and little by little he begins to notice his food. Then he is freed from his bonds but remains captivated by the music, and eats his food with the eagerness of a man faring sumptuously: for in his love for the music he will no longer run away. <br />But the mares of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> (for we must listen to the; second account as well) are equally captivated by' the sound of the pipe. They become gentle and tame and cease to prance and be skittish, and follow the herdsman wherever the music leads them; and if he stands still, so do they. But if he plays his pipe with greater vigour, tears of pleasure stream from their eyes. Now the herdsmen of the mares hollow a stick of rose-laurel, fashion it into a pipe, and blow into it, and thereby charm the aforesaid animals. And <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> speaks of some 'marriage songs of shepherds'; this is the pipe-music which throws mares into an amorous frenzy and makes <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> mad with desire to couple. This in fact is how the mating of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> is brought about, and the pipe-music seems to provide a marriage song. </p>                        </div>

They set the nets and other hunting gear that ensnare the animals in a circle, and a man proficient on the pipes stands there and tries his utmost to play a rather soft tune, avoiding any shriller note, but playing the sweetest melodies possible. The quiet and the stillness easily carry (the sound) abroad; and the music streams up to the heights and into ravines and thickets in a word into every lair and resting-place of these animals. Now at first when the sound penetrates to their ears it strikes them with terror and fills them with dread, and then an unalloyed and irresistible delight in the music takes hold of them, and they are so beguiled as to forget about their offspring and their homes.

But little by little these creatures in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Etruria</a> are attracted as though by some persuasive spell, and beneath the wizardry of the music they come and fall into the snares, overpowered by the melody. </p>                        </div>

And when the merchants entered and saw the broken pieces, they realised that a large quantity of their cargo had disappeared; and they were amazed and could not guess who had robbed them: they saw that no attempt had been made upon the doors; he roof was undamaged; the walls had not been broken through. They saw also the remains of the pickled fish that had been left behind by the uninvited guest. So they decided to have their most courageous servant armed and waiting in ambush in the house. Well, during the night the Octopus crept up to its accustomed meal and clasping the vessels, as an athlete puts a strangle-hold upon his adversary with all his might gripping firmly, the robber — if I may so call the Octopus — crushed the earthenware with the greatest ease. It was full moon, and the house was full of light, and everything was quite visible. But the servant was not for attacking the brute single-handed as he was afraid, moreover his adversary was too big for one man, but in the morning he informed the merchants what had jappened. They could not believe their ears. Then some of them remembering how heavily they bad been mulcted, were for risking the danger and were eager to encounter their enemy, while others in their thirst for this singular and incredible spectacle voluntarily shut themselves up with their companions in order to help them. Later, in the evening the marauder paid his visit and made for his usual feast, whereupon some of them closed off the conduit; others took arms against the enemy and with choppers and razors well sharpened cut the tentacles, just as vine-dressers and woodmen lop the tips of the branches of an oak. And having cut away its strength, at long last they overcame it not without considerable labour. And what was so strange was that merchants captured the fish on dry land.

And an Elephant using its sense of smell will pick out a flower, while the trainer, basket in hand, holds it out beneath the picker as he throws it in. Later when it has filled the basket, like a fruit-gatherer it has a bath and takes as much pleasure in the bath as the more luxurious of mankind do.

For instance, when by night it comes upon the track of a Hare and has scented the animal, it steals upon it softly and with noiseless tread, and holds its breath, and finding it in its form, attempts to seize it, supposing it to be free of fear and anxiety. But the Hare is not a luxurious creature and does not sleep carefree, but directly it is aware of the <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>Fox</a>'s approach it leaps from its bed and is off. And it speeds on its way with all haste; but the <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>Fox</a> follows in its track and continues its pursuit. And the Hare after covering a great distance, under the impression that it has won and is not likely to be caught, plunges into a thicket and is glad to rest. But the <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>Fox</a> is after it and will not allow it to remain still, but once again rouses it and stimulates it to run again. Then a second course no shorter than the first is gone through, and the Hare again longs to rest, but the <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>Fox</a> is upon it and by shaking the thicket contrives to keep it from sleeping.

But I will return to the point at which I was diverted. <br />It seems that the reason why it distributes its young and rears them in different spots is as follows. The Hare is deeply devoted to its offspring and dreads both the designs of huntsmen and the attacks of <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>foxes</a>; and it has no less a horror of the attacks of birds, and even more so of the cry of ravens and of <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a>.

For he used to maintain that even the male Hare does in fact give birth and produce offspring and endure the birthpangs and partake of both sexes. And he told me how it bears and rears itis young ones, and how it brings perhaps two or three to birth; and he bore witness to this too, and then as the finishing touch to the whole story added the following. A male Hare had been, caught in a half-dead state, and its belly was enlarged; being pregnant. Now he admitted that it had been cut open and that its womb, containing three leverets had been discovered. These, he said, which so far were undisturbed, were taken out and lay there like lifeless flesh, When however they were warmed by the sun and had spent some time slowly acquiring a little heat, they came to themselves and revived, and one of them, I suppose, stirred and looked up and presently put out its tongue as well and opened its mouth in its craving for nourishment. Accordingly some milk was brought, as was proper for such young creatures, and little by little they were reared up, to furnish (in my opinion) an astonishing proof of their birth by a male. I cannot prevail upon myself to doubt the story, the reason being that the narrator's tongue was a stranger to falsehoods and exaggeration. </p>                        </div>

During the winter it makes its bed in sunny spots, for it obviously likes to be warm and hates the cold.

The Hare does not close its eyes when sleeping: this advantage over other animals it alone enjoys and its eyelids are never overcome by slumber. They say that it sleeps with its body alone while it continues to see with its eyes. (I am only writing what experienced hunters say.) Its time for feeding is at night, which may be because it desires unfamiliar food, though I should say that it was for the sake of exercise, in order that, while refraining from sleep all this time and full of activity, it may improve its speed. But, it greatly likes to return to its home and loves every spot with which it is familiar.

Hence it is not unnatural for it to be nimble. At any rate to begin with it leaps and bounds from the earth and slips through thickets and across marshy ground with ease, and wherever the grass is deep it escapes without difficulty. And just as they say that the tail of the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> can rouse and stimulate it, so it is with the ears of the Hare: they are signals for speed and excite it to run. At any rate it lays them back and uses them as goads to prevent it from lagging and hesitating. But its course is not uniform and straight, but it turns aside now right now left and doubles this way and that, bewildering, and deluding the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> . And in whatever direction it wants to swerve in its course, it droops one ear to that avenue of escape, as though it were steering its course therewith. It does not however squander its powers, but observes the pace of its pursuer; and if he is tardy, it does not put forth its whole strength but keeps itself in check somewhat, enough to outrun the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hound</a> but not enough to exhaust itself by intense speed. For it knows that it can run faster and realises that this is not the moment for it to over-exert itself. If however the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hound</a> is very swift, then the Hare runs as fast as its feet can carry it. And when at length it has got far ahead and has left hunters, <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a>, and horsemen a long way behind, it races up some high hill and sitting up on its hind legs surveys as from a watch-tower the efforts of its pursuers and, as I think, laughs at them for being feebler than itself. Then emboldened by the advantage it has gained, like one who has achieved peace and calm, it is glad to rest and lies down to sleep. <br />The Mountain Hares, however, are not so swift as those that live in the plains, unless indeed the former: also have plain-Iand lying below into which they can descend and run about. Though their home is on a mountain they exercise themselves in the plain, often running about with the Hares there. The usual thing when they are pursued in the plain is for them to start up and to lie hid by turns, but since they are constantly forced out, not one escapes. But when they are on the point of being caught they change suddenly their direction over the plain and dart uphill into the mountains, speeding of course to their native haunts, their proper domain; and in this way they escape and are gone, reaching unexpected safety, for <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> dislike going up mountains, since their feet give out and are very quickly worn down, while <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> suffer even worse, their paws being fleshy and having nothing to resist the rocks, as <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> have their hooves. The Hare on the contrary has naturally hairy paws and is quite content with rough ground. <br />All Hares that live among thickets and bushes are sluggish runners and slow to flee, for such animals have grown plump and from sloth are not habituated to running and are quite incapable of going a long distance from their thickets. The method of hunting them is as follows. To begin with these Hares slip through the little bushes of which the foliage is not a solid mass, but where it is denser they naturally leap over them as they cannot get beneath them. But other bushes grow in a solid mass with their branches interlaced. So where the bushes are of this nature the Hare is constantly obliged to do this, and since the weight of its body does not dispose it to be good at jumping, it very soon tires and gives up. <br />At first the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> are baffled and lose the track, for owing to the thickness of the wood they fail to see the quarry; but they too leap over the bushes and are led by the scent. Finally however they catch sight of it and are after it, never pausing for a moment, whereas the Hare exhausted by the continual leaping gives up and so is caught. <br />Hares run up steep, high ground with the utmost ease, for their hind legs are longer than the front ones; They run down less easily, for the shortness of their front legs is a handicap to them. </p>                        </div>

In the matter of size the largest Aulopias yields to the largest <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>Tunnies</a>, but if matched against them it would take the prize for strength and courage. True, the <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>Tunny</a> also is a powerful species of fish, but after its first onset against its adversary and vigorous opponent it forgoes its strength, and as its blood congeals, it very soon surrenders; and is then caught. The Aulopias on the contrary carries on the struggle for a long time when it is attacked with vigour, and withstands the fisherman as it, would an adversary, and on most occasions gets the better of him by gathering itself together, bowing its head, and thrusting down into the depths; it has a forceful jaw and a powerful neck and is exceedingly strong. But when it is captured it is a most beautiful sight: it has wide open eyes, round and large, such eyes as <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> sings of in <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>. And the jaw, though powerful, as I remarked, contributes to its beauty. Its back is like the colour of the deepest lapis lazuli, its belly underneath is white. A stripe of a golden hue starts at the head and descending to the region of the tail ends in a circle. <br />I wish to speak also of the artifices employed in hunting it which I remember to have heard. The fishermen previously select spots from a large area where they suppose the Aulopiae to be congregating and after catching a number of <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>Crow</a>-fish in their bag-nets they anchor their boat and maintain a continuous din; the <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>Crow</a>-fish they make fast in a noose and let out on a line. Meanwhile the Aulopiae hearing the din and observing the bait, come swimming up from all sides and congregate and circle about the boat. And the din and the quantity of food have such a soothing effect upon them that, even though men reach out their hands, they remain and submit to the human touch because, as I judge, they are slaves to food, and in fact, as their pursuers maintain, because their strength gives them confidence. There are also tame ones among them which the fishermen recognize as their benefactors and comrades, so with them they maintain a truce. And other strange fishes follow them like leaders, and these, aliens, as one might call them, the men hunt and kill, but the tame fish, which may be likened to decoy-doves, they do not hunt but spare, nor would any prudent fisherman ever be reduced to such straits as to catch a tame Aulopias deliberately, for if by some mischance one happens to be caught it brings trouble. The fish is captured either by being pierced with a hook or by being mortally wounded. <br />We see bird-catchers also abstaining from killing birds that decoy others, whether for sale or for the table. There are other methods besides of catching these fish. </p>                        </div>

Moreover there are shady groves and herbage growing among them, and the boughs are interwoven by the woodman's art.

These fish are hunted, and in a most astounding manner. The method is as follows. The local fishermen watch for a moonless night and after supper pair off and launch a skiff while there is neither wave nor swell but the sea is calm, and then row forward quietly by slow degrees. One of the men gently agitates the water with his oar, propelling the boat step by step: so to speak, while the other propped on his elbow weighs down his end of the boat, depressing it until the gunwale is nearly at the water-level. And the Mullet and others of their kind, either because they enjoy the night or because they delight in the calm, quit their holes and lairs, swim up, and show the tip of their head above the water and are so occupied in swimming to the surface that they draw near to the shore. So the fishermen observing this, begin to sail, and the rush of the boat starts a gentle ripple. Therefore the fish in fleeing from the shore turn and owing to their numbers jostle one another into the portion of the boat sloping toward them, and once inside are caught. </p>                        </div>

There is also a lagoon in the island where shoals of tame Mackerel are fed. And the fishermen throw in food to them and observe a treaty of peace with them; so the fish are free and immune from pursuit and attain to a great age; there are even ancient Mackerel living there. Yet they do not feed without making any return, nor do they fail in gratitude for their food, but after they have been fed by the fishermen in the morning they too of their own accord go to join the pursuit, as though they were paying for their maintenance. And advancing beyond the harbour they set out to meet the strange Mackerel. When they have encountered them as it were in a company or in line of battle, they swim up to them as being of the same family and the same kind, nor do the strangers flee from them, nor do the tame fish attempt to divert them but bear them company. Presently the tame fish surround the newcomers, and having encircled them, close their ranks and cut off the fish in their midst, amounting to a great number, and prevent them from escaping; they wait for their keepers and provide the fishermen with a feast in return for the satisfaction of their own appetites. For the fishermen arrive, catch the strangers, and perpetrate a massacre. But the tame fish return with all haste to the lagoon, dive into their lairs, and wait for their afternoon meal, which the fishermen bring, if they want allies and loyal friends as fellow-hunters. And this happens every day. </p>                        </div>

In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=place long=-5 lat=35>Mauretania</a> Elephants are in the habit of dropping their tusks every tenth year, just as stags drop their horns, though with stags it is every year. Now these Elephants prefer a level, well-watered country to any other, and they go down upon their knees and rest their tusks upon the ground in their passionate desire to shed their tusks. And they thrust with such force as finally to bury them in the ground. Next, with their feet they gently scrape and make smooth the spot that guards their treasure. Now the soil is extremely fertile and in a very short while sends up a crop of grass and effaces the evidence of what occurred for those who pass by. But those who track down these secreted objects and who have some knowledge of the Elephants' designs, bring water in goatskins and disperse them, well filled, in different places, and themselves remain where they are. And one sleeps while another drinks a little, and I dare say that in the intervals of quaffing from his cup he sings to himself and remembers his sweetheart in his song; (Nor should I be surprised if a man tries to seduce some well-grown boy who is with him and is his companion in the quest, for the Moors are handsome, stalwart, and of manly aspect, and are devotees of the chase: and many a heart do they inflame too, while still boys, though they are so big). So then if those tusks have been buried near by, by some mysterious and amazing spell they draw the aforesaid water out of the skins and leave them empty. Thereupon the mien dig up the ground with mattocks and picks, and the spoil which they have tracked down without the aid of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> is theirs. If however the skins remain filled in the place where the tusk-hunters laid them, they go off on a fresh quest and again bring the skins and the water, the instruments of the hunt which I have described. </p>                        </div>

If you kill an Ostrich and wash out its stomach it will be found to contain pebbles which the bird has swallowed and keeps in its gizzard and in time digests. And these pebbles are an aid to the human digestion; its sinews also and its fat are good for the human sinews. <br />Now the capture of this bird is effected by means of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, for it runs in a circle keeping to the outer edge, but the horsemen intercept it by keeping on the inner side of the circle, and by wheeling in a narrower compass at length overtake it when it is exhausted with running. And here is another way to catch it. It builds itself a nest low down on the ground after scooping out the sand with its feet. The centre of the nest is hollow, but it builds up the lips all round and walls off the nest so that the lips may keep out the rain and prevent it from streaming into the nest and deluging the young at a tender age. It lays over eighty eggs, but does not hatch them simultaneously, nor do they all emerge to daylight at the same time, but while some have already been born, others are still acquiring consistency within the shell. Others again are being kept warm. When therefore the Ostrich is so engaged, a man — not a witless person but one who has experience of this kind of hunting — who has seen her, fixes some sharp spears round the nest, planting them upright by the ferrule; and the iron shines. Then he withdraws and lies in wait to see the result. So the Ostrich returns from her feeding-ground full of love for her chicks and yearning to be with them. And first of all she casts her eyes around; looking this way and that for fear someone should catch sight of her. And then overcome and stimulated by her longing, she spreads her wings like a sail and rushing at full speed leaps into her nest to die a most pitiful death entangled and impaled upon the spears. Then the hunter is at hand and seizes the young birds with their mother. </p>                        </div>

These were <a href=/people/2815 target=_blank>Antimachus</a>'s words: <br />'He had accepted the gold of <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a>, splendid gifts,' <br />as <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> says. Well, there is another city not far away which they call <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455115UVic class=place long=11.5403 lat=45.5459>Vicetia</a>, and past it there flows a river of the name of Eretaenus: it traverses a considerable area and then falls into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450120WEri class=place long=12.0293 lat=44.9753>Eridanus</a>, to which it imparts its waters. Now in the Eretaenus there are Eels of very great size and far fatter than those from any other place, and this is how they are caught. The fisherman sits upon a rock jutting out in some bay-like spot on the river where the stream widens out, or else upon a tree which a fierce wind has uprooted and thrown down close to the bank — the tree is beginning to rot and is no use for cutting up and burning. So the eel-fisher seats himself and taking the intestine of a freshly slaughtered <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a> which measures some three or four cubits and has been thoroughly fattened, he lowers one end into the water, and keeps it turning in the eddies; the other end he holds in his hands, and a piece of reed, the length of a sword-handle, has been inserted into it. The food does not escape the notice of the Eels, for they delight in this intestine. And the first Eel approaches, stimulated by hunger and with open jaws, and fastening its curved, hook-like teeth, which are hard to disentangle, in the bait, continues to leap up in its efforts to drag it down. But when the fisherman realises from the agitation of the intestine that the Eel is held fast, he puts the reed to which the intestine has been attached to his mouth and blows down it with all his might, inflating the intestine very considerably. And the downflow of breath distends and swells it. And so the air descends into the Eel, fills its head, fills its windpipe, and stops the creature's breathing. And as the Eel can neither breathe nor detach its teeth which are fixed in the intestine, it is suffocated, and is drawn up, a victim of the intestine, the blown air, and thirdly of the reed. Now this is a daily occurrence, and many are the Eels caught by many a fisherman. This then is what I have to say of the habits peculiar to these fishes. </p>                        </div>

And it often happens that hunters in pursuit of one animal go astray and fall in with others, fresh and untired.

And if he should start to pursue one of these, he and his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> as well will be the first to give up the chase, for though in course of time he will overtake an animal already weary, he will not overtake those just starting to run; his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> will tire before they do. <br />Every year these <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>Cattle</a> are caught and slaughtered in great numbers, but their offspring take their place, and they are abundant.

So then the hunter after removing the liver for his own use and cutting off the udder, which is still swollen, and flaying the hide, leaves the flesh for the birds and beasts to feed upon.

The rest of the body however is light-brown; the legs are long; the eyes black; the head is adorned with horns; the ears are very long. But the Pricket, as poets call it, 'runneth very swiftly, even as the hurricane'; in appearance it is red and very shaggy, but its tail is white; its eyes are the colour of dark blue dye; its ears are filled with very thick hair; its horns incline forwards and are graceful, so that the creature conies on and while inspiring fear, is a thing of beauty. Now this Pricket does not display its speed only on land, but will plunge into a running river and cleave the stream by rowing, so to speak, with its hooves. And it loves to swim in a lake, and there, let me tell you, it obtains food and feasts upon the ever-flowering rush and galingale.

It is because Nature has pity and compassion on <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> that this occurs, for (they say) had this continued to be attached always to the foal, both <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and mares would be inflamed with a passion for uncontrolled mating. This may, if you like, be a gift bestowed by <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> or <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, the god and the goddess of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, upon these animals to insure that their race is perpetuated and does not perish through an insane indulgence. Now those who tend <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, are fully aware of this and if they chance to need the aforesaid piece of flesh with the design of kindling the fires of <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a> in some person, they watch a pregnant Mare, and directly she bears the foal they seize it, cut off the piece of flesh, and deposit it in a Mare's hoof, for there alone will it be securely kept and stored away. As to the foal, they sacrifice it to the rising sun, for its dam refuses to suckle it any more now that it has lost its birth-token and no longer possesses the premise of her affection. For it is by eating that piece of flesh that the dam begins to love her offspring passionately. But any man who as a result of some plot tastes of that piece of flesh becomes possessed and consumed by an incontinent desire and cries aloud, and cannot be controlled from going after even the ugliest boys and grown women of repellent aspect. And he proclaims his affliction and tells those whom he meets how he is being driven mad. And his body pines and wastes away and his mind is agitated by erotic frenzy. <br />I have, heard also this story of the bronze mare at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>: <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> fall madly in love with it and long '( to mount it, and at the sight of it neigh amorously. Bidden away in the charmed bronze it contains the treacherous Mare's-frenzy, and through some secret contrivance of the artist the bronze works against living animals. For it could not possibly be so true to life that <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> with their eyes open should be deceived and inflamed to that extent.

For the man who has tasted it is first of all seized with a most violent retching; next he is racked with a dry cough but brings up nothing at all; yet his upper stomach is enlarged and swells, while hot streams mount to his head and phlegm descends from his nose, emitting a fishy odour; his eyes turn bloodshot and fiery and the lids become puffy. He is possessed, they say, by a longing to vomit, but brings up nothing whatever. If however Nature prevails, the man escapes the threat of death but sinks gradually into a state of forgetfulness and insanity. But if the wine penetrates into his lower stomach, it is all over with him, and the victim inevitably dies. Those who survive, having drifted into insanity, are seized with a strong desire for water; they yearn to see water and to listen to it falling. This at any rate quiets them and lulls them to sleep. And, they like to spend their time either by ever-flowing rivers or near the sea-shore or by the side of springs or lakes, and though they do not at all desire to drink, they love to swim and to dip their feet and to wash their hands. <br />But there are those who maintain that it is not the actual stomach of the Sea-<a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> which causes these sufferings, but that the creature feeds upon a certain kind of seaweed of extraordinary bitterness and that its essence is transferred to the Sea-<a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. Notwithstanding, the Sea-<a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> has been found to be an efficient remedy thanks to the shrewdness of an aged fisherman who was versed in matters regarding the sea. There was an old fisherman of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> and he had some young sons, also fishermen. Now it so happened that the old man caught some Sea-<a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> along with other fish, and that the boys were bitten by a mad <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>: when the first was bitten, the others who came to help him suffered the same fate. So they lay on the beach at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355237UMit class=place long=23.7134 lat=35.5004>Mithymna</a> [<a about=https://topostext.org/place/354245URhi class=place long=24.4729 lat=35.3711>Rhithymna</a> ?] in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> (this is said to be a village), while the spectators sympathised with their plight and gave orders for the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> to be killed and its liver to be given to the boys to eat as an antidote to the poison. Others urged that they should be taken to the temple of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355237XRok class=person long=23.7326 lat=35.4753>Roccaean</a> <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> and that the goddess should be implored to heal them. But the old man, without a sign of fear, without swerving from his purpose, allowed these advisers to make their recommendations, washed out the stomachs of the Sea-<a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, some of which he roasted and gave to the boys to apply, while others he pounded into a mixture of vinegar and honey, and then smeared on the wounds made, by the bite, and so overcame the boys' madness by that longing for water which the Sea-<a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> engendered in them.

But as soon as they discharge into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, the name which they had at their birth ceases to be used, they surrender it in his favour, all are called after him, and togetheir pour their waters into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Euxine</a>. And there there are fish of different species, <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>-fish, myllus, sturgeon, carp (these are black), and schall and wrasse (which are white), and besides these, perch and sword-fish. These last are suited to their name, witness the fact that the rest of their body is soft and harmless to the touch, that their teeth do not appear curved and sharp, that there are no spines springing erect from their back, as in the case of <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphins</a>,” or from their tail, but what surprises one to learn and to see is this: the jaw just below its nose, through which it breathes and through which the stream flows to the gills and falls out, is prolonged to a sharp point, is straight and increases gradually in length and in bulk; it grows also as the fish grows into a monster and resembles the beak of a trireme. And the Sword-fish makes straight for fishes, kills them, and then feeds on them, and with this same sword beats off the attacks of the largest sea-monsters. No smith has forged this weapon which grows upon the fish, and Nature has made it sharp. <br />And so when these Sword-fish have, attained a considerable size they even attack ships. And there are some who boast that they have seen a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=demonym long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynian</a> vessel drawn up on shore in order that the keel which was suffering from age might receive the necessary attention, and fixed to the keel they saw the head of a sword-fish. For the creature had planted the sword given it by Nature, in the vessel, and when it attempted to withdraw, the whole Of its body was rent from the neck owing to the force of the ship's onrush, while the sword remained fixed just as it entered originally. So then this fish is caught both in the sea and in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, and it delights both in salt water and in fresh streams. </p>                        </div>

They forsake their haunts in the open seas and at this season neglect their feeding-ground there. Now a certain seaweed grows among deep reefs: it is about the size of a tamarisk and bears fruit resembling a poppy. At other seasons of the year the fruit is closed and is resistant and hard like a shell; it opens however after the summer solstice, like buds in rose-gardens And the surrounding sheath protects the inside: encircling it like a barrier; it is a bright yellow colour but the part beneath this covering is dark blue and flabby like a bladder with air in it, and is quite translucent, and from it there oozes a violent poison. By night this seaweed sends out a fiery ray and sparkles: And when the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a>-star is rising the evil power of the poison is even stronger. For that reason all fishermen have given it the name of Pancynium in the belief that it is the rising of the star that generates the poison. Now the Sharks fall upon the flower which by night seems to be burning, rushing at this tamarisk of the sea as if it were treasure trove, and when the poison has drenched them, some being swallowed and some having penetrated through their gills, they die and at once float up to the surface. <br />Now those who are skilled at investigating such matters collect this poison which emanates from the aforesaid monsters, some of it from other parts of the creature's body and some from its mouth. This poison is second only to that of the land-peony, as it is called, which people have also named Cynospastus. The reason for this you will learn if I remember to tell it you. </p>                        </div>

Well, this is the way in which these people hunt fish. An <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450139RHis class=demonym long=13.9 lat=45>Istrian</a> whose trade is fishing drives a pair of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> near the bank of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, but not because he has the least wish to plough, for, as the saying goes, 'an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> and a <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphin</a> have nothing in common;' so in the same way what friendship can there be between a fisherman's hands and a plough? If however he has a pair of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> he uses <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. The man carries the yoke on his shoulders and comes to a spot where he thinks it suitable to sit down and where he believes he is well placed for fishing. One end of his rope, which is stout and thoroughly capable of standing a strain, he attaches to the middle of the yoke. He provides ample fodder for the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> or the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and they eat their fill. And to the other end of the„rope he attaches a strong hook which has been well sharpened, and on this he spits the lungs' of a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>, and lets them down as food, and indeed its favourite food, for the Sheat-fish in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, after' fastening above the point where the rope secures the hook enough lead to prevent it from being dragged away, So directly the fish notices the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>' meat he rushes to seize it. Then, finding what he wants, all at Once with jaws agape he recklessly tugs at fhe deadly meal which has come to him. Next, this glutton, drawn on by his enjoyment, is spitted on the aforesaid hook before he knows it, and in his eagerness to escape the disaster that has befallen him he agitates and shakes the rope with all his might. So when the hunter is aware of this he is filled with joy; he leaps from his seat, abandons his labours in the river and his watery pursuits, and like an actor in a play changing his mask, sets his pair of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> or <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> in motion, and there ensues a trial of strength between the monster and the beasts of burden. For the creature bred in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> exerts a downward pull with all the strength at his command, while the pair of beasts pulling in the .opposite direction makes the rope taut. But it avails the fish; nothing: at any rate he is defeated in the tug-of-war, gives up, and is hauled ashore. A student of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> might say that mules were hauling tree-trunks, as <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> sings in the celebrated tale of the funeral of <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a>. </p>                        </div>

Moreover that this bay attains a considerable depth is sufficiently proved by the following fact: merchant vessels which cross the sea put in to this bay and, when the bay is angered by the winds that blow and lash it into waves and drive it mad, are just as afraid of it as they are of the sea. And there are also islands in it, and even creeks along the shore into which one can run for safety. There are besides, promontories and capes running out, on which the waves in their fury dash and burst whenever the river at its very fullest is, as it were, forced into a narrow space as it presses on to the sea. This commonly occurs when the third autumnal season is past and the winter season is setting in and the river is running in full flood. And as it rises the north wind urges it forward and causes it to descend in fury. And the stream carries dowh the ice it contains as though for an easy voyage. But the' north wind opposes it with its violent and icy blasts: it does not permit it to discharge into the sea what you might call its offspring, but causes it to overflow, resists it, and brings it to a halt; So the ice which is floating and checked sinks and solidifies to a great depth. In consequence the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>'s own water flows beneath, along what you might call hidden channels, while the newly acquired and alien surface resembles a plain, and at this season of the year the people thereabouts travel along it driving a pair or on horseback. Now the way in which that mischievous and crafty animal the <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>fox</a> tests and examines this river and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408238WStr class=place long=23.8489 lat=40.7858>Strymon</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> to see if they are frozen, I have described earlier on. Well, the ice on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> freezes hard even round a merchant vessel on its way downstream and imprisons it: it is no use to spread the sails; the man at the prow looks no more ahead; the ship's captain cannot move the rudders to and fro; they are fixed fast, for the whole vessel is caught in the surrounding fetters and looks, I declare, not like any ship, for it is no longer beaten by the waves, but like some hill rising from a-wide expanse of plain or for all the world like some lofty watch-tower. Thereupon the passengers and the sailors jump out and hurry down the river and fetch wagons .and transfer the cargo on to what was lately the water. Then again when the winter season is over and the river begins to flow strongly they still carry their loads. But the ship remains stationary until the frost relaxes and the ice melts and is dissolved, and the merchant vessel, freed from its strange cable, is released. At that season fishermen also take picks and hack through the ice wherever they feel inclined, and contrive a circular hole reaching down to the water. You would say that it was the mouth of a well or of a huge, very pot-bellied jar. Thereupon multitudes of fish wishing to escape from the ice which is pressing down upon them like a roof, and longing for the light, swim joyfully up to the opening that has been made, and come in crowds past numbering and jostle one another, and being in a confined hole are easily captured. And it is possible to catch carp and <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a>-fish in abundance and perch and the swordfish, though the last-named is not yet fully grown and is still without the frontal spike; sturgeon too, young and tender, for the large ones of mature age may be the size of the biggest <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a>. The Sturgeon is extremely fat along the: sides and the belly; you might say they were the dugs of a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> that was suckling its young. It has a rough skin and spear-makers actually polish their spear-shafts on it. <br />Beneath the spinal marrow of this creature a supple, narrow membrane beginning at the middle of the head, runs down as far as the tail. Now if you Jet this dry in the sun you will obtain, should you wish it, a whip to drive a pair of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> with. For it differs hardly at all from a leather thong. When however the fish has grown to its full size one would not see it emerging from the ice and falling into the hole, hut either it slips beneath some all-sheltering rock or buries itself in deep sand and is only too glad to keep warm. And at that time it needs no vegetation, no other fish to eat, but prefers to remain inactive while the frost lasts, and is happy to be idle and consumes its own fat, just as octopuses also when unable to catch any prey nibble their own tentacles and feed off themselves. But when winter is over and spring is beginning and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> is flowing freely, it hates to be inactive and, swimming up to the surface, takes its fill of the foam on the water, and there is foam in abundance as the stream roars and boils in violent tumult. Then is the time when it is easily captured as the fishermen lie in wait for it and let down hook and line into the foam. The whiteness of the foam conceals the hook and the bright sheen of the bronze is invisible to the fish; hence, as it opens its jaws and takes a heavy draught of the aforesaid food, it swallows the bait and meets its death from the very thing that before sustained it. </p>                        </div>

I have remembered and wish to fulfil my obligations) which by daytime passes unnoticed among the rest and is hardly visible, but at night it becomes 'visible and shines out like a star, for it is of a fiery nature and like a flame'. Therefore men plant some mark near the roots and then go away, for if they did not do this they would be unable by day to remember either the colour or even the appearance of the plant. But when the night is over they come and see the mark which they left and recognise it and are able to guess that this is the very plant that they need; for otherwise it is completely like the plants all round it, differing from them not one whit. But they themselves do not pull up this plant; if they did they would certainly regret it. Accordingly no one either digs round it or pulls it up, for (they say) the first man who in ignorance of its nature touched it, was destroyed by it shortly afterwards. And so they bring a strong <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> that has not been fed for some days and is ravenously hungry and attach a strong cord to it, and round the stalk of the Peony at the bottom they fasten a noose securely from as far away as they can; then they put before the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> a large quantity of cooked meat, which exhales a savoury odour. And the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, burning with hunger and tormented by the savour, lashes at the meat that has been placed before it and with its violent movement pulls up the plant, roots and all. But when the sun sees the roots the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a> immediately dies, and they bury it on the spot, and after performing some mysterious rites and paying honour to the dead body of the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> as having died on their behalf, they then make bold to touch the aforesaid plant and carry it home.

Its name is Nerites. Two stories are in circulation touching this creature, and both have reached me; moreover the telling of a short tale in the middle of a lengthy history is simply giving the hearer a rest and sweetening the narrative. <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> sings of how <a href=/people/1326 target=_blank>Doris</a> the daughter of <a href=/people/527 target=_blank>Oceanus</a> bore fifty daughters to <a href=/people/428 target=_blank>Nereus</a> the sea-god, whom to this day we always hear of as truthful and unlying. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> also mentions them in his poems. But they do not state that one son was born after all that number of daughters, though he is celebrated in mariners' tales. And they say that he was named Nerites and was the most beautiful of men and gods; also that <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> delighted to be with Nerites in the sea and loved him. And when the fated time arrived, at which, at the bidding of the Father of the gods, <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, also had to be enrolled among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=ethnic long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympians</a>, I have heard that she ascended and wished to bring her companion and play-fellow. But the story goes that he refused, preferring life with his sisters and parents to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a>. And then he was permitted to grow wings: this, I imagine, was a gift from <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>. But even this favour he counted as nothing. And so the daughter of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> was moved to anger and transformed his shape into this shell, and of her own accord chose in his place for her attendant and servant <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a>, who also was young and beautiful, and to him she gave the wings of Nerites. <br />But the other account proclaims that <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> was the lover of Nerites, and that Nerites returned his love, and that this was the origin of the celebrated <a href=/people/3121 target=_blank>Anteros</a> (mutual love). And so, as I am told, for the rest the favourite spent his time with his lover, and moreover when <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> drove his chariot over the waves, all other great fishes as well as <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphins</a> and tritons too, sprang up from their deep haunts and gambolled and danced around the chariot, only to be left utterly and far behind by the speed of his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>; only the boy favourite was his escort close at hand, and before them the waves sank to rest and the sea parted out of reverence to <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, for the god willed that his beautiful favourite should not only be highly esteemed for other reasons but should also be pre-eminent at swimming. <br />But the story relates that the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> resented the boy's power of speed and transformed his body into the spiral shell as it now is: the cause of his anger I cannot tell, neither does the fable mention it. But if one may guess where there is nothing to go by, <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> and the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> might be said to be rivals. And it may be that the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> was vexed at the boy travelling about in the sea and wished that he should travel among the constellations instead of being counted among sea-monsters. Thus far the two fables; but may the gods be good to me, and for my part let me observe a religious silence regarding them. But if my fables have said any thing overbold, the fault must be laid to their charge. </p>                        </div>

This net is drawn in by men standing on the shore, fishermen and others, and there are many who though they know nothing of the art, watch the fish being caught: they feel a certain fascination in it. But as the men are drawn in and approach the bank, then the fishermen on the dry land cut the ice there also, for they have an interest in the capture and try to prevent the fish from escaping. When this has been done as described, the net, full of fish, pushes the block of ice that has been cut round and draws it along with it, while the fishermen who are standing on the block look as if they were being carried along on a floating island. Such is the peculiar method of catching the fish there and quite unlike any other. And <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> will allow me to say that these men earn a double wage, one from the river and another from the land, since the same men are both mariners and farmers. </p>                        </div>

Between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405222PBer class=place long=22.2015 lat=40.5221>Beroea</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=place long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonica</a> there flows a river called the <a href=/people/1464 target=_blank>Astraeus</a>. Now there are in it fishes of a speckled hue, but what the natives call them, it is better to enquire of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>. Now these fish feed upon the flies of the country which flit about the river and which are-quite unlike flies elsewhere; they do not look like <a href=/people/10963 target=_blank>wasps</a>, nor could one fairly describe this creature as comparable in shape with what are called Anthedones (bumble-<a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>), nor even with actual honey-<a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>, although they possess a distinctive feature of each of the aforesaid insects. Thtis, they have the audacity of the fly; you might say they are the size of a bumble-<a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a>, but their colour imitates that of a <a href=/people/10963 target=_blank>wasp</a>, and they buzz like a <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>honeybee</a>. All the natives call them <a href=/people/4559 target=_blank>Hippurus</a>. These flies settle on the stream and seek the food that they like; they cannot however escape the observation of the fishes that swim below. So when a fish observes a <a href=/people/4559 target=_blank>Hippurus</a> on the surface it swims up noiselessly under water for fear of disturbing the surface and to Astraeum is the name of a town, hut no river <a href=/people/1464 target=_blank>Astraeus</a> is known; presumably the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411225WAxi class=place long=22.6611 lat=40.7223>Axius</a> is intended. <br /> This is one of the species Stratiomys, known as 'Soldier-flies.' <br />avoid scaring its prey. Then when close at hand in the fly's shadow it opens its jaws and swallows the fly, just as a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> snatches a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> from the flock, or as an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> seizes a goose from the farmyard. Having done this it plunges beneath the ripple. Now although fishermen know of these happenings, they do not in fact make any use of these flies as baits for fish, because if the human hand touches them it destroys the natural bloom; their wings wither and the fish refuse to eat them, and for that reason will not go near them, because by some mysterious instinct they detest flies that have been caught. And so with the skill of anglers the men circumvent the fish by the following artful contrivance. They wrap the hook in scarlet wool, and to the wool they attach two feathers that grow beneath a cock's wattles and are the colour of wax. The fishing-rod is six feet long, and so is the line. So they let down this lure, and the fish attracted and excited by the colour, comes to meet it, and fancying from the beauty of the sight that he is going to have a wonderful banquet, opens wide his mouth, is entangled with the hook, and gains a bitter feast, for he is caught. </p>                        </div>

The inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420090IKyr class=place long=9 lat=42>Corsica</a> tell how, when a ship was wrecked in a storm, a man who was a very strong swimmer managed to swim over a wide expanse of sea and to secure a hold On some hea,dland in their country; he climbed out and stood there, all fear banished, for he Was now free from all perils, with no anxiety for his life, his own master. Now a Ram-fish which was swimming by caught sight of him as he stood, and inflamed with hunger turned about, arched its back, and with its tail drove a great mass of water forward, and then rose as the swelling wave lifted it, and in a moment was carried up on to the headland and like a hurricane or whirlwind seized the man.'

Directly the <a href=/people/10989 target=_blank>seals</a> realise that a Ram-fish is somewhere close at hand, bringing destruction upon them, they swim ashore with all possible speed and pass over the land and plunge into the shelter of rocky caverns. But the Ram-fish perceive that they have fled and give chase, and as they face the cave they know from the smell of flesh that their prey is within, and, as though by some all-powerful spell, with their nostrils they draw in the air that intervenes between themselves and the <a href=/people/10989 target=_blank>seal</a>. But the <a href=/people/10989 target=_blank>seal</a> avoids the attack of the monster's breath, as it might an arrow or a spear-point, and at first withdraws, but is finally dragged out of the cave by the overmastering pull and follows against its will, just as though it were bound fast with thongs or cords, and shrieking provides the Ram-fish with a meal. <br />Those who are skilled at exploring these matters assert that the hairs which grow from the nostrils of the Ram-fish serve many purposes. </p>                        </div>

These fins, whenever the fish dives, open out and form a half-circle and present to the eye the shape of a half-moon.

Just consider the cities along the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Black Sea</a> — <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=place long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heraclea</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416230UTio class=place long=32.0344 lat=41.5682>Tium</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417324UAma class=place long=32.3868 lat=41.7495>Amastris</a>. Now the inhabitants of the whole of that country know exactly of the coming of the <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>Tunny</a>, and at that season of the year the fish arrive, and much gear has been got ready to deal with them, boats and nets and a high lookout-place. This lookout-place is fixed on some beach and stands where there is a wide, uninterrupted view. It is no trouble to me to explain, and you who listen should be pleased to hear, how it is constructed. Two high pine-trunks held apart by wide balks of timber, are set up; the latter are interwoven in the structure at short intervals and are of great assistance to the watchman in mounting to the top. Each of the boats has six young men, strong rowers, on either side. The nets are of considerable length; they are not too light and so far from being kept floating by corks are actually weighted with lead, and these fish swim into them in shoals. And when the spring begins to shine and the breezes are blowing softly and the air is bright and as it were smiling and the waves are at rest and the sea smooth, the watcher, whose mysterious skill and naturally sharp sight enable him to see the fish, announces to the fishermen the quarter from which they are coming: if on the one hand the men ought to spread their nets near the shore he instructs them accordingly; but if closer in, like a general he gives the signal, or like a conductor, the keynote. And frequently he will tell the total number of fish and not be off the mark. And this is what happens. When the company of <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>Tunnies</a> makes for the open sea the man in the lookout who has an accurate knowledge of their ways shouts at the top of his voice telling the men to give chase in that direction and to row straight for the open sea. And the men after fastening to one of the pines supporting the lookout a very long rope attached to the nets, then proceed to row their boats in close order and in column, keeping near to one another, because, you see, the net is distributed between each boat. And the first boat drops its portion of the net and turns back; then the second does the same, then the third, and the fourth has to let go its portion. But the rowers in the fifth boat delay, for they must not let go yet. Then the others row in different directions and haul their part of the net, and then pause. Now the <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>Tunny</a> are sluggish and incapable of any action that involves daring, and they remain huddled together and quite still. So the rowers, as though it were a captured city, take captive — as a poet might say — the population of fishes. And so, my Grecian friends, the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=place long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371255INax class=place long=25.377 lat=37.1059>Naxos</a> know of these things by report, for they have learnt about this method of fishing all that <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> and others relate.

And I have heard that the 'leader' too is conspicuous for his colour and his size. Now divers beneath the waters make it their special aim to capture him, for once he is caught they catch the entire shoal, since it is, so to say, left destitute and without a leader; for it remains motionless and ceases to advance, like a flock of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> that by some mischance has lost its shepherd.

Now this stretch of sea, where the Crane-fish has been tracked down, lies near the sea which approaches <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a> on that side of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a> that faces <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. The fish reaches a length of perhaps fifteen feet reckoned accurately, but it is not (so I learn) as bulky as the largest eel. It has the head and mouth of the bird, and its scales you might say were the feathers of a crane. But it does not swim in the sinuous fashion of those fishes which are slim and long like eels. It is an exceedingly powerful jumper; at any rate it springs forward like an arrow shot from a bowstring . . . Now the accounts from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376232PEpi class=place long=23.1602 lat=37.6335>Epidaurus</a> state that this creature is not the offspring of any fish, but that cranes fleeing from the frosts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> and of the west generally, encounter the wind, and that the female birds are stimulated to mate, while the male birds are inflamed with desire and agitated with a passion to couple, which makes them want to mount the females. They however will not permit it, for they cannot bear the burden of coupling in mid air, and so the males frustrated in their desire ejaculate semen. If they happen to be flying, over land, the semen is spent to no purpose but is lost and wasted. If however they are flying over the ocean, then the sea takes up and preserves the embryo as though it were a treasure, and generates this creature, not destroying it as though it had entered some unfruitful sterile womb. Here then of the two versions is the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376232PEpi class=demonym long=23.1602 lat=37.6335>Epidaurian</a> one fully set out. But the other version, whose origin I cannot; tell, takes a different direction and does not agree with the former, but I shall mention it as well so that I may not appear to be ignorant of it. <a href=/people/1995 target=_blank>Demostratus</a>, whom I also mentioned earlier on, says, 'I saw the fish and was filled with astonishment, and I was anxious to pickle it so that others might be able to see it. And so when the cooks got to work and opened it up, with my own eyes I inspected its internal organs and observed spines on both sides, which met and turned their points towards one another; they were,' he says, 'triangular like three-sided law-tablets, and imbedded in them was a liver of considerable length, and below that was a gall-bladder, with a long tube as in skin-bags. You would have said on seeing it that it was a damp bean-pod. So both gall-bladder and liver were extracted,' and the latter swelled up till it equalled the liver of the largest fish, whereas the gall-bladder, which happened somehow to have been placed on a stone, caused the stone to melt away and disappeared from sight.' Here I conclude the two accounts. </p>                        </div>

And one youth sits in the stern and lets down <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>-hair lines on either side of the vessel.

It has also reached my hearing that 'Marten' was its name then; that it was a dealer in spells and a soreerer; that it was extremely, incontinent, and that it was afflicted with abnormal sexual desires. Nor has it escaped my notice that the anger of the goddess <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a> transformed it into this evil creature. May the goddess be gracious to me: fables and their telling I leave to others. But it is clearly a most malicious animal. Martens set upon human corpses, leap upon them if they are unprotected, pluck out their eyes and swallow them. They say too that if the testicles of a Marten are hung on a woman either by treachery or with her consent, they prevent her from becoming a mother and make her refrain from the sexual act; If the inwards of a Marten are dressed in a certain way, which I leave to those skilled in these matters, and dropped with evil intent into wine, they break up (so they say) a friendship, and sunder relations hitherto harmonious. In reward for these activities let us leave spell-binders and sorcerers to our friend <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> to punish and judge. <br />There is also a fish called Marten (gale): it is small and has nothing in common with those known as <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-fish (galeus), for the latter are cartilaginous, live in the sea, attain to a considerable length, and resemble a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>. But the Marten-fish one might identify with the Hepatus, as it is called. This is a small fish and blinks its eyes; the pupils are a dark blue colour. Its barbel is larger than that of the Hepatus; on the other hand it yields to the <a href=/people/2219 target=_blank>Chromis</a> in this respect. I am told that the Marten lives among rocks, feeds on sea-weed, and that it too like the land Marten eats the: eyes of all bodies that it finds dead. Fishermen who practise sorcery after the manner of those that, dwell on the continent of <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, being evilly disposed and skilled in mischief, use it for the same purpose as men use the land Marten. And since this species of fish is carnivorous, the men who spend their lives fishing and who explore the deepest recesses black their feet and the palms Sf their hands in an attempt to nullify the light that radiates from them, for men's limbs appear extremely light in water and so attract these fish. </p>                        </div>

And they avoid the South wind and flee before the North, and cannot endure even the East wind, but their delight is in a waveless sea and when the pleasant and gentle breezes of the West wind blow. And so beneath their influence they quit their burrows, with their shells still closed and fast shut, and mount upwards from their recesses and, when the sea is waveless, swim around. And; then they open their overirigs and peep forth, like brides looking down from their private chambers or like rosebuds that, formed a little, have peeped out of their flower-cups towards the sun's heat. And so little by little they gather courage and are glad to rest quietly while waiting for the friendly breeze; and one of their coverings the Clams spread beneath them, the other they raise, and with the latter for sail and the former for skiff they float along. And in this way they move forward when the sea is calm and the weather fine; To see them from a distance you would say that it was a fleet of ships. If however they perceive some vessel approaching, or some savage creature advancing or some monstrous fish swimming by, with one clash of their shells they fold up, sink in a mass, and are gone. </p>                        </div>

A.t one time it has a -fiery hue, at another pitch-black, and on its head there bristle what look like horns. It crawls softly as it scrapes the scales of its belly along the ground, and its course is crooked. And so it makes a gentle rustling, which shows how sluggish and how feeble it is. But when it bites it makes a puncture which immediately appears dark blue, and the victim suffers agonising pains in his stomach, while the belly discharges copious fluid. On the first night after, blood streams from the nose and throat and even from the ears together, with a bile-like poison, and the bladder emits blood-stained water. Also if there are any old scars on the body they break open. But if a female Blood-letter darts poison as it strikes, the poison mounts to the gums, blood streams copiously from the finger-nails, and the teeth are forced out from the gums.

And <a href=/people/1995 target=_blank>Demostratus</a>, a member; I may add, of the Roman Senate — not that this makes him a sufficient voucher, though in my opinion he attained the summit of knowledge in matters of fishing and was an admirable expounder of his knowledge; nor should I be surprised if he had made a study of some weightier subject and had dealt with the science of the soul. This <a href=/people/1995 target=_blank>Demostratus</a> admits that he does not know precisely whether there is any other reason for the female declining to copulate, but he claims to vouch for the following fact. The female couples only when looking towards the male, and when he has satisfied his desire he goes away, while the female is quite unable to turn over again owing to the bulk of her shell and because she has been pressed into the ground. And so she is abandoned by her mate to provide a meal for other animals and especially for <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a>. This then, according to <a href=/people/1995 target=_blank>Demostratus</a>, is what the females dread, and since their desires are moderate and they prefer life to pleasurable indulgence, the males are unable to coax them to the act. And so by some mysterious instinct the males cast an amorous spell 'that brings forgetfulness of all' fear, It seems that the spells of a Tortoise in loving mood are by no means songs, like the trifles which <a href=/people/759 target=_blank>Theocritus</a>, the composer of sportive pastoral poems, wrote, but a mysterious herb of which <a href=/people/1995 target=_blank>Demostratus</a> admits that neither he nor anyone else knows the name. Apparently the males adorn themselves with this herb, and some mysterious. . . . At any rate if they hold this herb in their mouth there ensues the exact opposite to what I have described: the male becomes coy, but the female hitherto reluctant is now full of ardour and pursues him in a frenzied desire to mate; fear is banished and the females are not in the least afraid for their own safety. </p>                        </div>

And dancers assert that a certain kind of dance is called after this bird, and if we are to believe them this dance has been called 'the Little Horned <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>Owl</a>.' And that anyone should caricature and imitate them in a playful way affords these birds the greatest pleasure. This is the origin of the word skoptein which we use, meaning 'to mock.' It is said that the Little Horned <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>Owl</a> is smaller than the Little <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>Owl</a> and that its colour resembles lead of the deepest me, but its wings are said to have whitish speckles. And it displays two feathers rising from the brows in either temple. <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a> maintains that, there are two kinds of Little Horned <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>Owl</a>. One kind is vocal, the other doomed to silence; the latter is called skops, the former aeiskops. But <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> asserts that in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> the word does not begin with a sigma (skops), but that the birds are called simply kopes. So those who prefix a sigma mistake the true spelling of the word and are mistaken as to <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s judgment and knowledge of the bird. At all other seasons of the year the Little Horned <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>Owl</a> is not edible, but only when caught on one or two days in the late autumn, and then it is edible. These Skopes differ from the Aeiskopes in bulk, and bear some resemblance to a turtle-dove or ring-dove. </p>                        </div>

And as <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> says that the bit and trappings of a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> are laid up to be a Greek king's glory, so the Hoopoe is the joy of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> King: he carries it on his hand and delights in it, gazing continually in wonder at its splendour and its natural beauty.; Now the <a href=/people/6301 target=_blank>Brahmins</a> also relate a legend regarding this bird, and the legend they relate is as follows. A son was born to an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> king and he had brothers who, when they were grown to manhood, became extremely lawless and violent. And they looked down upon their brother, as being the youngest;, jeered at their father and mother, and showed no respect for their old age. Accordingly the parents refused to live with them,and departed into exile, the aged couple, with their young son. There ensued a laborious journey for them; the parents' strength failed, and they died. The son however did not neglect them but split his head with a sword and buried them in himself. The <a href=/people/6301 target=_blank>Brahmins</a> assert that the all-seeing <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> was so filled with admiration for this surpassing act of piety that he transformed the boy into a bird most beautiful to behold and endowed with length of days. And from his crown there sprang up a crest, as it were in commemoration of the events of his exile. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> too tell some such wondrous tale in a myth regarding the Lark, which <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>, the writer of comedies, appears to me to have followed in his Birds when he says 'No, for you were unlearned and no busybody and had not thumbed your <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>, who used to say that the Lark was the first of all birds to be born, before the earth, and that then its father fell sick and died. But there was no earth, and the corpse was laid out for five days, and the Lark in straits and at its wits' end buried its father in its own head.' <br />So it seems that this fable from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, about a different bird indeed, yet spread to the Greeks as well. For the <a href=/people/6301 target=_blank>Brahmins</a> maintain that it is long ages since the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> Hoopoe, while still a human being and a child in years, did this to its parents. </p>                        </div>

Each hair attains a length of two cubits, and there, spring perhaps as many as thirty from one root, like a tassel. Now this is of all animals the most timid, for if it is seen by somebody and realises that it is being looked at, it flees as fast as it can, the pace of its legs only exceeded by its eagerness to escape. It is hunted by horsemen with swift-footed <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a>. But if it realises that it is going to be caught, it hides its tail in some thicket, faces about, and stands waiting for its pursuers and plucks up its courage, fancying that, since its tail is not visible, it will no longer seem worth pursuing. For it knows that its beauty resides in its tail. And yet on this point its fancies are idle, for a man shoots it with a poisoned arrow and having killed it will cut off its tail, the reward of the chase. And after flaying the body (for the hide also is serviceable) he leaves the dead carcase, because the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> have no use for the flesh of these animals. </p>                        </div>

But when the rains which have over-filled the rivers cease, and the streams withdraw again and return to their natural courses, then Fishes of as much as eight cubits long remain in low-lying, marshy, level spots, where what is known as 'fallow land' commonly has depressions. And the cultivators catch the Fish which can only swim feebly, since they are not moving in deep water but on the surface, glad to snatch a bare existence from the shallow water. </p>                        </div>

And these Elephants of the island are more powerful and bigger than those ofthe mainland, and may be judged naturally cleverer in every way. And so the people; build huge ships (for the island of course has dense forests) and transport the Elephants to the mainland opposite, and having crossed, sell them to the King of the Calingae. But owing to the size of the island those who live in the middle of it do not even know the sea but live, as though they were on the mainland and only learn by report of the sea that surrounds and encircles them. Whereas those that live near to the sea are ignorant of the way in which Elephants are hunted and only know of it by hearsay: they devote them: selves to catching fish and sea-monsters, For they assert that the sea which surrounds the circuit its of their island breeds a multitude past numbering' of fishes and monsters, and moreover that they have the heads of <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> and leopards and <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a> and rams, and, still more wonderful to relate, that there are some which have the forms of satyrs with the faces of women, and these have spines attached in place of hair. They tell of others too which have strange forms whose appearance not even men skilled in painting and in combining bodies of diverse shapes to make one marvel at the sight, could portray with accuracy or represent for all their artistic skill;; for these creatures have immense and coiling tails, while for feet they have claws or fins. Γ learn too that they are amphibious and that at night they graze the fields, for they eat the grass as <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and rooks do; they enjoy the ripe fruit of the date-palm and therefore shake the trees with their coils, which being supple and capable of embracing, they iling round them.

And I am told that the creature has the most discordant and powerful voice of all animals. When other animals approach, it does, not object but is gentle; with its own kind however it is inclined to be quarrelsome. And they say that not only do the males instinctively butt and fight one another, but that they display the same temper towards the females, and carry their contentiousness to such a length that it ends only in the death of their defeated rival. The fact is that strength resides in every part of the animal's body, and the power of its horn is invincible. It likes lonely grazing-grounds where it roams in solitude, but at the mating season, when it associates with the female, it becomes gentle and the two even graze side by side.

Their face is compact, short, and snub-nosed. They are said to be fond of the Greek people, to understand them by some mysterious means, and to maintain a natural friendship for them, so that if Greeks approach them, touch them, and pat them with the hollow of their hand, they do not resent it or shy away, but pass their days at their side as though they were tethered, and when the Greeks lie down to sleep they will sleep at their side. If however some foreigner approaches, then, just as <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> on the scent recognise animals by their tracks, so do these mares know the man's origin, and neigh and flee away as though they were afraid of some wild beast. But their delight is in familiar friends who give them fodder and generally tend them, and they are anxious to appear beautiful, especially in the eyes of their drivers. The proof of this is that when they go swimming they advance far into the lake or sea or spring in their eagerness to sleek their faces, so that nothing disfiguring or unlovely from the manger or from their journey may befoul their beauty. Fragrant unguents and the scent of perfumes are as dear to a lycospade <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> as they are to a bride. And <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> testifies to the natural love which all <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> have for unguents when he says <br />'For so mighty a charioteer and so gentle have they lost, who right often would pour upon their manes smooth oil when he had washed them in clear water.' <br />And <a href=/people/10930 target=_blank>Semonides</a> describing how women are born and moulded after animals of all kinds, says that the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>'s love of ornament and of perfumes is innate in some women also. These are his words 'But another is born of a dainty, long-maned mare: she turns away from servile tasks and drudgery; she will never touch a mill or pick up a sieve or cast muck out of the house, nor, since she would escape the soot, will she sit by the oven. Only by constraint does she take a man to her bosom. And every day she washes off the dirt twice, sometimes thrice, and anoints herself with perfumes. And always she wears her deep tresses combed and shaded with flowers. Such a woman is fair to look upon — for others, but to her husband, a plague, unless he be a despot or sceptred lord who delights his heart with such gauds.' </p>                        </div>

And they throw dummy corpses stuffed with straw beneath their feet in order that they may get used to trampling on corpses in war and may not through terror at some unnerving occurrence be useless in encountering men-at-arms. Nor did this escape the notice of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, as he himself shows. At any rate we learn in pur childhood from the <a href=/people/12111 target=_blank>Iliad</a> how the Thracian <a href=/people/962 target=_blank>Rhesus</a> and his companions with him were slain. This is the story we learn. The son of <a href=/people/183 target=_blank>Tydeus</a> slaughters the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a>, while the son of <a href=/people/520 target=_blank>Laertes</a> draws the slain men away by the, feet for fear lest the Thracian <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, being newcomers, get entangled among the dead bodies and panic, and through being unused to them may leap aside as though they were treading upon some terrifying objects. But once <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>Horses</a> have learnt a thing, they will not forget what they have learnt, so clever are they at learning whatever is of any advantage; I have spoken earlier on of their capacity for affection and how far they will feel it. </p>                        </div>

None of the farmers, none of the herdsmen dared to approach the spot and observe its size, but they were confident simply from its hiss that the beast was a monster to strike one with consternation. Now the discovery how large in fact it was, was due to a miraculous and truly wonderful contrivance. A furious and violent wind assailed the trees in the glen and they were hurled one against the other, and the boughs crashed together with such force that they generated flames, and a huge fire was kindled which embraced the entire region and encircled the monster. It was cut off, and being unable to creep out was burned to death. And so when the place was stripped, all lay bare to view. And the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a>, freed now from their dread, came to see, and discovered the bones to be of gigantic size and the head terrifying.

But this creature of which my discourse set out to speak, I have heard described as follows. 'Its face is like that of a man and is surrounded by thick hair. Its neck below its face, and its chest are also those of a man, but its teats are swelling and stand out on the breast; its shoulders, arms, and forearms, its hands too . . . chest down to the waist are also those of a man.

The hands of this creature serve a double purpose, for when speed is necessary they run in front of the hind legs, and it can move quite as fast as other quadrupeds. Again, if it needs to pluck something, or to put it down, or to seize and hold it tight, what were feet become hands; it no longer walks but sits down. The creature has a violent temper.

I learn further that along with the aforesaid water there descend Fish often a, cubit long and even more, but sometimes less, though not much less.

Accordingly the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a>, since their country is infested with numerous wild animals, collect these Fish and dry them by the heat of the sun; they then inince them, after bandaging nose and mouth in order to prevent themselves from inhaling the odours given off by the Fish in the process of being brayed, and so catching their death. Then after making the Fish into meal they sprinkle it about in the districts that are most infested with wild beasts; they even have a custom of mixing figs with the meal. And this, is the way in which,they destroy wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>, gazelles, deer, bears, wild <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a>, and <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>, and these too are wild.

The man himself was intending to drink after the others, for he happened at that time to be rather their servant than their fellow at table; But when he raised the cup to his lips, the. <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>Eagle</a> which he had rescued and which, fortunately for him, was still lingering about the spot, to reward him for saving its life swooped upon the cup, dashed it from his hand, and spilt the drink. The man was annoyed, for he was indeed thirsty, and exclaimed 'So it is you' (for he recognised the bird), 'yet this is how you thank those who saved your life! I ask you, is this fair? And how should a man hereafter want to do a good turn to another from respect for <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> who marks and watches over kind actions?' Such were his words and he felt parched. But turning round he saw the men who had drunk gasping and at the point of death. It seems, at a guess, that the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> had vomited into the spring and mingled the water with its poison. And so the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>Eagle</a> repaid its saviour by similarly saving his life. <br /><a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=person long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamum</a> says that <a href=/people/695 target=_blank>Stesichorus</a> also sings of this in a poem which has not, I think, reached a wide public, and he has cited, in my opinion, a weighty witness from ancient times. </p>                        </div>

Rhinoceros and Elephant fight for possession of a feeding ground, and one may come across many an Elephant that has met its death in the above manner.

I have not through idleness omitted anything that I have learnt, as though animals, void of reason and of speech, were beneath my notice and to be despised, but here as elsewhere I have been fired by that love of knowledge which in me is inherent and innate; I am well aware that among those who keep a sharp look-out for money, or who are keen in the pursuit of honours and influence and all that brings reputation, there are some who will blame me for devoting my leisure to these studies, when I might have given myself airs and appeared in palaces and attained to considerable wealth. I however occupy myself with <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>foxes</a> and lizards and beetles and <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a> and <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a>, with the habits of the leopard, the affectionate nature of the stork, the melodiousness of the nightingale, the sagacity of the elephant, and the shapes of fishes and the migrations of cranes and the various species of <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a>, and so on — everything which in this account of mine has been carefully got together and observed. But it is no pleasure to me to be numbered among your rich men and to be compared with them. But if I exert myself and desire some how to count myself one of that company to which learned poets, and men clever at detecting and probing the secrets of nature, and writers who have attained the greatest experience, claim to belong, it is obvious that my own counsel is better than the judgment of those men. For I would rather attain to expert knowledge in at least one branch than to the belauded riches and possessions of your wealthiest men. So enough of this for the present. I am aware too that some will express disapproval because I have not in my discourse kept each creature separate by itself, and have not said in its own place all that is to be said about each, but have mixed the various kinds like a varied pattern in the course of describing a great number, at one point dropping the narrative about such-and-such animals, at another going back and stringing together other facts about their nature. Now in the first place, speaking for myself, I am no slave to another's judgment and will: I maintain that it is not my duty to follow another's lead wherever it may take me. And in the second place, since I was aiming to attract through the variety of my reading matter, and since I flee from the tedium arising from monotony, I felt that I ought to weave the tissue of this narrative of mine so as to resemble a meadow or a chaplet beautiful with its many colours, the many creatures, as it were, contributing their flowers. And although hunters regard the finding of even one animal as a piece of luck, I maintain that there is nothing splendid in finding the tracks or capturing the bodies of such a multitude of animals, whereas to track down the faculties which nature has seen fit to bestow upon them — that is splendid. <br />What have they to say to this, your Cephaluses and Hippolytuses, and all the others so skilful in the chase upon the wild mountains, or again, among those who were skilled in fishing, <a href=/people/435 target=_blank>Metrodorus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=person long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, or his son <a href=/people/212 target=_blank>Leonidas</a>, or <a href=/people/1995 target=_blank>Demostratus</a>, or any others who were past masters at the catching of fish? And there were many such, god knows! Painters too: the picture of a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> consummately drawn fills them with pride, as it did <a href=/people/3754 target=_blank>Aglaophon</a>; or the picture of a fawn, as it did <a href=/people/460 target=_blank>Apelles</a>; or his statue of a calf, as it did <a href=/people/771 target=_blank>Myron</a>; or take any other work of art. But when one man displays and brings forth to the light of day his researches into the habits, the forms, the sagacity, the shrewdness, the justice, the temperance, the bravery, the affection, the filial piety of such a great number of animals, he cannot fail to claim immediate respect. Having reached this point in my discourse I am distressed that while praising the filial piety of unreasoning animals, I have to accuse men of the reverse. I shall not here enlarge on this subject, but this much I have every right to add — indeed I mentioned this point at the beginning of this treatise: it is not fair to censure me for repeating what all, or at any rate most, writers have said already. After all I could not create other animals, though I have given evidence that I have known a great many. Yet I have in fact mentioned certain characteristics which no other writer who has attempted the work on my scale has mentioned. But I prize truth in all spheres, most of all in this, and critics who handle me without malice will realise the quality of my work, the labour it cost, the dignity of its style and composition, and the propriety of the words and phrases employed. </p>                        </div>
