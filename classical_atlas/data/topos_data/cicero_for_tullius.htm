Accordingly, I came with a mind free from care and anxiety, because I was aware that I could easily prove that by witnesses. But now, when it has been confessed, not only by that most honourable man, Lucius <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, but when Publius <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> himself has not hesitated to admit the facts which are the subject of this trial, I come forward to plead this cause in quite a different manner from that in which I was originally prepared to argue it. For then my anxiety was to be able to prove what I asserted had been done. Now all my speech is to be directed to this point, to prevent our adversaries from being in a better position, merely because they have admitted what they could not possibly deny though they greatly wished to do so. [2] Therefore, as matters stood at first your decision was more difficult, but my defence was easy. For I originally rested my whole case on the evidence; now I rest it on the confession of my adversary; and to oppose his audacity in acts of violence, his impudence in a court of justice, may fairly be considered as the task of your power, not of my abilities. — For what is easier than to decide on the case of a man who confesses the fact? But it is difficult for me to speak with sufficient force of that which cannot be by language made out worse than it is in reality, and cannot be made more plain by my speech than it is by the confession of the parties actually concerned. <br /> [3] As, therefore, on account of the reasons which I have stated, my system of defence must be changed, I must also forget for a little time, in the case of Publius <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a>, that lenity of mine which I practiced at the previous trial, when I restrained myself from using any arguments which might have the appearance of attacking him, so much that I seemed to be defending his reputation with no less care than the cause of Marcus <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>. Now, since <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> has thought it not foreign to the subject to introduce so many statements, false for the most part and most wickedly invented, concerning the life and habits and character of Marcus <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>, <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> must pardon me for many reasons, if I do not now appear to spare his character so much, or to show the same regard for it now as I did previously. </p>                        </div>

And it seems to me, O judges, that I have more need to feel anxious as to whether my conduct will be approved in having said nothing against him before, than blamed for the reply I now make to him. [5] But I both did at that time what I ought to have done, and I shall do now what I am forced to do. For when it was a dispute about money matters, because we said that Marcus <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> had sustained damage, it appeared foreign to my character to say anything of the reputation of Quintus <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a>; not because the case did not open the door to such statements. What is my conduct then? Although the cause does require it, still, unless when he absolutely compels me against my will, I am not inclined to condescend to speak ill of him. Now that I am speaking under compulsion, if I say anything strong, still I will do even that with decency and moderation, and only in such a way that, as he could not consider me hostile to him at the former trial, so he may now know that I am a faithful and trustworthy friend to Marcus <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>. </p>                        </div>

For the time before, there was no end to your speech in his defence; night alone set bounds to your oration. Now, if you please, do not do the same; this I beg of you. Nor do I beg it on this account, because I think it desirable for me that you should pass over some topics, or that you should fail to state them with sufficient elegance, and at sufficient length; but because I do think it enough for you to state each fact only once. And if you do that, I have no fear that the whole day will be taken up in talking. <br /> [7] The subject of this trial which comes before you, O judges, is, What is the pecuniary amount of the damage inflicted on Marcus <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> by the malice of the household of Quintus <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a>, by men armed and banded together in a violent manner.

For when many families were said to be wandering armed about the distant fields and pasture lands, and to be committing murders, and as that fact appeared to concern not merely the estates of individuals, but the main interests of the republic, Marcus <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, who often presided as judge with the greatest equity and wisdom, first planned this tribunal, and had regard to this object, that all men should so restrain their households that they should not only not go about armed to inflict damage on any one, but, even if they were attacked, should defend themselves by law, rather than by arms; [9] and though he knew that the Aquilian law 2about damage existed, still he thought, that, as in the time of our ancestors both men's estates and their desires were less, and as their families, not being very numerous, were restrained by fear of important consequences, it very seldom happened that a man would be killed, and it was thought a nefarious and unprecedented atrocity; and therefore, that there was at that time no need of a system of judicial procedure with reference to bodies of men collected in a violent manner and armed; (for he thought that if any one established a law or a tribunal for matters which were not usual, he seemed not so much to forbid them as to put people in mind of them.) </p>                        </div>

When an action was assigned, this alone was to be the point at issue, “whether it appeared that damage had been inflicted by the malice of the household, by men collected and armed acting in a violent manner,” and the word “unjustly” was not to be added; he thought that he had put an end to the audacity of wicked men when he had left them no hope of being able to make any defence. </p>                        </div>

For Publius <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> lately purchased a farm of Caius <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, a senator, — a farm bordering on that of Marcus <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>, — dear enough, for nearly half as much again (though in a wretched state of cultivation, and with all the buildings burnt down) as <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> himself had given for it when it was in a good and highly ornamented condition, though he had paid an extravagant price for it. <br /> *****[15] I will add this also, which is very important to the matter. When the commander-in-chief died, though he wished to invest a sum of money, got I know not how, in a farm, he did not so invest it, but he squandered it. I do not very greatly wonder that, hampered as he was by his own folly, he wished to extricate himself how he could. But this I cannot marvel at sufficiently, this I am indignant at, that he strives to remedy his own folly at the expense of his neighbours, and that he endeavoured to pacify his own ill-temper by the injury of <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>. <br />There is in that farm a field of two hundred acres, which is called the Popilian field, O judges, which had always belonged to Marcus <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>, and which even his father had possessed. That new neighbour of his, full of wicked hope, and the more confident because Marcus <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> was away, began to wish for this field, as it appeared to him to lie very conveniently for him, and to be a convenient addition to his own farm. And at first, because he repented of the whole business and of his purchase, he advertised the farm for sale. But he had had a partner in the purchase, Cnaeus Acerronius a most excellent man. He was at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, when on a sudden messengers came to Marcus <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> from his villa, to say that Publius <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> had advertised that neighbouring farm of his for sale, offering a much larger quantity of land than he and Cnaeus Acerronius had lately purchased. [17] He applies to the man. He, arrogantly enough, answers just what he chooses. And he had not yet pointed out the boundaries. <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> sends letters to his agent and to his bailiff, to go to the procurator of Caius <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, in order that he might point out the boundaries to purchasers in their presence.

For no one can decide that, if the household were not present at a transaction, in that transaction the household itself committed damage with men armed, in a violent manner. Therefore, because that could be done, and done easily too, on that account it was not thought sufficient for investigation to be made as to what the household itself had done, but as to this point also, “What had been done by the malice of the household.” [28] For when the household itself does anything, men being collected together and armed, in a violent manner, and inflicts damage on any one, that must be done by malice. But when it forms a plan to procure such a thing to be done, the household itself does not do it, but it is done by its malice. And so by the addition of the words “by malice” the cause of both plaintiff and defendant is made more comprehensive.

If I were to defend myself before a judge in this way, — to confess that I had driven men out by violence — to deny that there was malice in it, — who would listen to me? No one, I suppose; because, if I drove out Marcus <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> by violence, I drove him out by malice; for malice is a necessary ingredient in violence; and it is sufficient for <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> to prove either point, — either that he was driven out with violence by me myself, or that I contrived a plan to have him driven out with violence. [30] More, therefore, is granted to <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> when the interdict runs thus, “from which he was driven by violence, by my malice,” than if it had merely said, “whence he was driven by me by violence.” For, in this latter case, unless I had myself driven him out, I should gain my cause. In the former case, when the word “malice” is added, whether I had merely originated the design, or had myself driven him out, it is inevitable that it should be decided that he had been violently driven out by me with malice. </p>                        </div>

For I ask of you, O <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a>, if the point in question were, “What appeared to be the pecuniary amount of the damage done by the household of Publius <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a>, by armed men, to Marcus <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>,” what would you have to say? Nothing, I suppose; for you confess everything, both that the household of Publius <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> did this, and that they did it violently with armed men. As to the addition, “with malice,” do you think that that avails you, that by which all your defence is cut off and excluded? [32] for, if that addition had not been made, and if you had chosen to urge, in your defence, that your household had not done this, you would have gained your cause if you had been able to prove this. Now, whether you had chosen to use that defence, or this one which you are using, you must inevitably be convicted; unless we think that a man is brought before the court who has formed a plan, but that one who has actually done an action is not; since a design may be supposed to exist without any act being done, but an act cannot exist without a design. Or, because the act is such that it could not be done without a secret design, without the aid of the darkness of night, without violence, without injury to another, without arms, without murder, without wickedness, is it on that account to be decided to have been done without malice? Or, will you suppose that the pleading has been rendered more difficult for me in the very case in which the praetor intended that a scandalous plea in defence should be taken from him? [33] Here, now, they do seem to me to be men of very extraordinary talent, when they seize themselves on the very thing which was granted to me to be used against them; when they use rocks and reefs as a harbour and an anchorage. For they wish the word “malice” to be kept in the shade; by which they would be caught and detected, not only since they have done the things themselves which they admit having done, but even if they had done them by the agency of others. <br /> [34] I say that malice exists not in one action alone, (which would be enough for me,) nor in the whole case, only, (which would also be enough for me,) but separately in every single item of the whole business. They form a plan for coming, upon the slaves of Marcus <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>: they do that with malice. They take arms: they do that with malice. They choose a time suitable for laying an ambush and for concealing their design: they do that with malice. They break open the house with violence: in the violence itself there is malice. They murder men, they demolish buildings: it is not possible for a man to be murdered intentionally, or for damage to be done to another intentionally, without malice. Therefore, if every part of the business is such that the malice is inherent in each separate part, will you decide that the entire business and the whole transaction is untainted with malice? </p>                        </div>

Does it make any difference whether the magistrates establish a defence for a crime, or give people power and liberty to commit crime?

For if it were the case, the magistrates would not give recuperators rather than a judex, — not an action against the whole family, but against the one who was proceeded against by name; nor would the damages be estimated at fourfold, but at double; and to the word “damage” would be added the word “wrongfully.” Nor, indeed, does the magistrate who has assigned this trial depart from the provisions of the Aquilian law about other damage, in cases in which nothing is at issue except the damage.

I imagine I need say no more about the laws. [48] And now I, for the first time in this affair, ask this question: — What connection the reading of these laws had with this trial? Had the slaves of Marcus <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> assaulted any tribune of the people? I think not. Had they come by night to the house of Publius <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> to steal? Not even that. Had they come by day to steal, and then had they defended themselves with a weapon? It cannot be affirmed. Therefore, according to those laws which you have read, certainly that man's household had no right to slay the slaves of Marcus <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>. </p>                        </div>

First of all, there is that holy law which armed men petitioned for, that unarmed men might be free from danger. Wherefore it was only reasonable for them to wish the person of that magistrate to be hedged round with the protection of the laws, by whom the laws themselves are protected. [50] The Twelve Tables forbid a thief — that is to say, a plunderer and a robber — to be slain by day, even when you catch him, a self-evident enemy, within your walls. “Unless he defends himself with a weapon,” says the law; not even if he has come with a weapon; unless he uses it, and resists; “you shall not kill him. If he resists, endoplorato,” that is to say, raise an outcry, that people may hear you and come to your aid. What can be added more to this merciful view of the case, when they did not allow that it might be lawful for a man to defend his own life in his own house without witnesses and umpires? </p>                        </div>

No one, I think. For this is a silent law of humanity, that punishment for intentions, but not for fortune, may be exacted of a man. Still our ancestors did not pardon even this. For there is a law in the Twelve Tables, “If a weapon escapes from the hand” ** <br />If any one slays a thief, he slays him wrongfully. Why? Because there is no law established by which he may do so. What? suppose he defended himself with a weapon? Then he did not slay him wrongfully. Why so?

If, now that that building has been demolished, I myself were this day to prosecute him on the ground “that it was done by violence, or secretly,” you must inevitably either make restitution according to the sentence of an arbitrator, or you must be condemned in the amount of your security. Now, will you be able to make it seem reasonable to such men as these judges, that, though you had no power of your own right to demolish the building, because it was, as you maintain, on your land, you had power of your own right to slay the men who were in that edifice? </p>                        </div>
