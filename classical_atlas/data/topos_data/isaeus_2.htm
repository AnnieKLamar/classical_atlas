When his brothers claimed his estate, a certain <a href=/people/1375 target=_blank>Philonides</a> attested that the estate was not adjudicable, because <a href=/people/2113 target=_blank>Menecles</a> had left a son. The brothers then brought an action for perjury against <a href=/people/1375 target=_blank>Philonides</a>, and it is against them that the son undertakes the defence of <a href=/people/1375 target=_blank>Philonides</a>. The speech, which is in defence of a will, is the counterpart of that delivered On the Estate of <a href=/people/599 target=_blank>Cleonymus</a>, which upholds the rights of kindred. The discussion concerns a point of law with a controversy on a point of fact; for the speaker affirms that the deceased had the right to adopt a son, and then deals with the point of fact, saying, It was not under the influence of a woman that he adopted me. I think, gentlemen, that, if any adoption was ever made in accordance with the laws, mine was, and no one could ever dare to say that <a href=/people/2113 target=_blank>Menecles</a> adopted me in a moment of insanity or under the influence of a woman. But since my uncle, acting, as I assert, under a misapprehension, is trying by every means in his power to deprive his dead brother of descendants, showing no respect for the gods of his family or for any of you, I feel constrained to come to the aid of the father who adopted me, and to my own aid.</p>                        </div>
