He was appointed quaestor a year before he reached the legal age, 5 and through the support of Marcus he attained to the office of aedile. Again with the support of Marcus he became praetor. 6 After his praetorship he commanded the Twenty-second Legion, the Primigenia, in <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a>, 7 and following that he ruled Belgium long and well. Here, with auxiliaries hastily levied from the provinces, he held out against the <a href=/people/4926 target=_blank>Chauci</a> (a people of <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a> who dwelt on the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/535100WAlb class=place long=10 lat=53.4726>Elbe</a>) as they attempted to burst through the border; 8 and for these services, on the recommendation of the emperor, he was deemed worthy of the consulship. He also gained a crushing victory over the <a href=/people/12145 target=_blank>Chatti</a>. 9 Next he took charge of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a> and cleared it of the hostile tribes on its borders. </p>                        </div>

In this position he was accused by one <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a> Clarissimus, a soldier, of being an associate of <a href=/people/1677 target=_blank>Salvius</a> in his conspiracy against <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>. But <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> had already put many senators and many distinguished and powerful men to death on the charge of treason, and so he was afraid of acting too harshly and therefore pardoned <a href=/people/3581 target=_blank>Didius</a> and executed his accuser. 2 Thus acquitted, <a href=/people/3581 target=_blank>Didius</a> was sent again to govern a province. Then he governed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a>, but not as creditably as the other provinces. <br />3 His consulship he served with <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>; in the proconsulship of Africa, moreover, he succeeded him. <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> always spoke of him as his colleague and successor; on that day, in particular, when <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a>, after betrothing his daughter to a kinsman of his own, came to <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> and informed him of the fact, <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> said: . . . and due respect, for he is my colleague and successor. The death of <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> ensued immediately afterwards. 4 After his death, when Sulpicianus was making plans to be hailed emperor in the camp, <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a>, together with his son-in-law, came to the senate, which, he heard, had been summoned, but found the doors closed. 5 At the same time he discovered there two tribunes, <a href=/people/2779 target=_blank>Publius</a> <a href=/people/11058 target=_blank>Florianus</a> and Vectius <a href=/people/4856 target=_blank>Aper</a>, who immediately began urging him to seize the throne; and though he pointed out to them that another man was already proclaimed emperor, they held him fast and conducted him to the praetor camp. 6 When they arrived at the camp, however, Sulpicianus, the prefect of the city and the father-in-law of <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>, was holding an assembly and claiming the empire himself, and no one would let <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> inside, despite the huge promises he made from outside the wall. <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> then first warned the soldiers not to proclaim anyone emperor who would avenge <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>, and next wrote on placards that he would restore the good name of <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>; 7 so he was admitted and proclaimed emperor, the soldiers at the same time requesting that he would not in any way injure Sulpicianus for aiming at the throne. </p>                        </div>

This story, it is generally agreed, was false. 9 For according to report, <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> was so frugal as to make a suckling <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> or hare last for three days, if anyone by chance presented him with one; and often, moreover, even when there was no religious reason therefor, he was contest to dine on cabbages and beans without meat. 10 Furthermore, he gave no banquet until after <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> was buried, and, because of his death, took what food he did in a very depressed state of mind, and passed the first night in continual wakefulness, disquieted by such a fate. </p>                        </div>

He accepted also the name of Father of his Country, but refused a silver statue. 6 Then, as he proceeded from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate-house</a> to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, the populace placed themselves in his way, but by the sword, by wounds, and by promises of gold-pieces, the number of which he himself, in order to inspire trust, kept showing to them on his fingers, they were dispersed and beaten back. 7 Thereupon, all went to the games at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCiM class=place long=12.4871 lat=41.8852>Circus</a>; but here, after everyone had seized seats indiscriminately, the populace redoubled their insults against <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> and called for <a href=/people/11051 target=_blank>Pescennius</a> <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> (who was said to have already declared himself emperor) to protect the city. 8 All this <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> took with perfect equanimity; indeed all through the time he was on the throne he was exceedingly tolerant. The populace, however, kept inveighing with the utmost violence against the soldiers, who had slain <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>, so they said, for money. And so, in order to win favour with the people, <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> restored many measures which <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> had enacted and <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> had repealed. 9 Concerning <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> himself he took no steps either good or evil, a fact which to very many seemed a serious matter. 10 It is generally agreed, however, that it was his fear of the soldiers that caused him to keep silent about the honours due <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>. </p>                        </div>

He gave orders likewise that <a href=/people/2633 target=_blank>Marcia</a> should be put to death at the same time. <br />3 While <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> was engaged in these activities, however, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> seized the fleet stationed at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>; whereupon the envoys of the senate who had promised their services to <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> passed over to <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>. 4 <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> Crispiness, the prefect of the guard, who had been sent to oppose <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> and lead out the fleet, failed in his attempt and therefore returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. 5 When <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> learned of these events, he came to the senate with a proposal that the <a href=/people/12228 target=_blank>Vestal Virgins</a> and the priests, along with the senate itself, should go out to meet <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>' troops and entreat them with fillets held in outstretched hands — a futile step, surely, to take against soldiers of barbarian blood. 6 In this proposal, however, <a href=/people/2183 target=_blank>Plautius</a> <a href=/people/2541 target=_blank>Quintilius</a>, an augur and man of consular rank, opposed him, declaring that he who could not withstand an opponent by force of arms had no right to rule; 7 in this objection many senators agreed with him. Infuriated at this, <a href=/people/3581 target=_blank>Didius</a> <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> called for soldiers from the camp in order either to force the senators to obedience or to slaughter them. 8 But this plan found no favour. For it was scarcely fitting that the senate, after declaring <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> a public enemy for <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a>' sake, should find an enemy in this same <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a>. 9 And so <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> came to the senate with a better plan, and asked it pass a decree effecting a division of empire. And this was forthwith done. </p>                        </div>
