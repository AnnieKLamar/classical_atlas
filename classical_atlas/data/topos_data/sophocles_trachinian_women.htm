                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg001:1'><b>&sect; 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter DEIANEIRA from the house, accompanied by the NURSE.) <br />DEIANEIRA: THERE is a saying among men, put forth of old, that thou canst not rightly judge whether a mortal's lot is good or evil, ere he die. <br />But I, even before I have passed to the world of death, know well that my life is sorrowful and bitter; I, who in the house of my father <br /><a href=/people/490 target=_blank>Oineus</a>, while yet I dwelt at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384214PPle class=place long=21.417 lat=38.402>Pleuron</a>, had such fear of bridals as never vexed any maiden of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=place long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aitolia</a>. For my wooer was a river-god, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383211WAch class=place long=21.1067 lat=38.3388>Achelous</a>, who in three shapes was ever asking me from my sire,- coming now as a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> in bodily form, now as <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> with sheeny coils, now with trunk of man and front of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>, while from a shaggy beard the streams of fountain-water flowed abroad. With the fear of such a suitor before mine eyes, I was always praying in my wretchedness that I might die, or ever I should come near to such a bed. <br />But at last, to my joy, came the glorious son of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and <a href=/people/1123 target=_blank>Alcmena</a>; who dosed with him in combat, and delivered me. How the fight was waged, I cannot clearly tell, I know not; if there be any one who watched that sight without terror, such might speak: I, as I sat there, was distraught with dread, lest beauty should bring me sorrow at the last. But finally the <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> of battles ordained well,- if well indeed it be: for since I have been joined to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> as his chosen bride, fear after fear hath haunted me on his account; one night brings a trouble, and the next night, in turn, drives it out. And then children were born to us; whom he has seen only as the husbandman sees his distant field, which he visits at seedtime, and once again at harvest. Such was the life that kept him journeying to and fro, in the service of a certain master. <br />But now, when he hath risen above those trials,- now it is that my anguish is sorest. Ever since he slew the valiant <a href=/people/751 target=_blank>Iphitus</a>, we have been dwelling here in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388224RTra class=place long=22.4 lat=38.75>Trachis</a>, exiles from our home, and the guests of stranger; but where he is, no one knows; I only know that he is gone, and hath pierced my heart with cruel pangs for him. I am almost sure that some evil hath befallen him; it is no short space that hath passed, but ten long months, and then five more,- and still no message from him. Yes, there has been some dread mischance;- witness that tablet which he left with me ere he went forth: oft do I pray to the gods that I may not have received it for my sorrow. <br />NURSE: <a href=/people/728 target=_blank>Deianeira</a>, my mistress, many a time have I marked thy bitter tears and lamentations, as thou bewailedst the going forth of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>; but now,- if it be meet to school the free-born with the counsels of a slave, and if I must say what behoves thee,- why, when thou art so rich in sons, dost thou send no one of them to seek thy lord;- <a href=/people/787 target=_blank>Hyllus</a>, before all, who might well go on that errand, if he cared that there should be tidings of his father's welfare? Lo! there he comes, speeding towards the house with timely step; if, then, thou deemest that I speak in season, thou canst use at once my counsel, and the man. <br />(HYLLUS comes in from the side.) </p>                        </div>

Tell me, if it may be told. <br />DEIANEIRA: It brings thee shame, she saith, that, when thy father hath been so long a stranger, thou hast not sought to learn where he is. <br />HYLLUS: Nay, I know,- if rumour can be trusted. <br />DEIANEIRA: And in what region, my child, doth rumour place him? <br />HYLLUS: Last year, they say, through all the months, he toiled as bondman to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> woman. <br />DEIANEIRA: If he bore that, then no tidings can surprise. <br />HYLLUS: Well, he has been delivered from that, as I hear. <br />DEIANEIRA: Where, then, is he reported to be now,- alive or dead? <br />HYLLUS: He is waging or planning a war, they say, upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a>, the realm of <a href=/people/1124 target=_blank>Eurytus</a>. <br />DEIANEIRA: Knowest thou, my son, that he hath left with me sure oracles touching that land? <br />HYLLUS: What are they, mother? I know not whereof thou speakest. <br />DEIANEIRA: That either he shall meet his death, or, having achieved this task, shall have rest thenceforth, for all his days to come. <br />So, my child, when his fate is thus trembling in the scale, wilt thou not go to succour him? For we are saved, if he find safety, or we perish with him. <br />HYLLUS: Ay, I will go, my mother; and, had I known the import of these prophecies, I had been there long since; but, as it was, my father's wonted fortune suffered me not to feel fear for him, or to be anxious overmuch. Now that I have the knowledge, I will spare no pains to learn the whole truth in this matter. <br />DEIANEIRA: Go, then, my son; be the seeker ne'er so late, he is rewarded if he learn tidings of joy. <br />(HYLLUS departs as the CHORUS OF TRACHINIAN MAIDENS enters. They are free-born young women of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388224RTra class=place long=22.4 lat=38.75>Trachis</a> who are friends and confidantes of DEIANEIRA.

Thou glorious lord of flashing light, say, is he threading the straits of the sea, or hath he found an abode on either continent? Speak, thou who seest as none else can see! antistrophe 1 <br />For <a href=/people/728 target=_blank>Deianeira</a>, as I hear, hath ever an aching heart; she, the battle-prize of old, is now like some bird lorn of its mate; she can never lull her yearning, nor stay her tears; haunted by a sleepless fear for her absent lord, she pines on her anxious, widowed couch, miserable in her foreboding of mischance. strophe 2 <br />As one may see billow after billow driven over the wide deep by the tireless south-wind or the north, so the trouble of his life, stormy as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> sea, now whirls back the son of <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a>, now lifts him to honour. But some god ever saves him from the house of death, and suffers him not to fail. antistrophe 2 <br />Lady, I praise not this thy mood; with all reverence will I speak, yet in reproof. Thou dost not well, I say, to kill fair hope by fretting; remember that the son of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronus</a> himself, the all-disposing king, hath not appointed a painless lot for mortals. <a href=/people/2830 target=_blank>Sorrow</a> and joy come round to all, as the Bear moves in his circling paths. epode <br />Yea, starry night abides not with men, nor tribulation, nor wealth; in a moment it is gone from us, and another hath his turn of gladness, and of bereavement. So would I wish thee also, the Queen, to keep that prospect ever in thy thoughts; for when hath <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> been found so careless of his children? <br />DEIANEIRA: Ye have heard of my trouble, I think, and that hath brought you here; but the anguish which consumes my heart- ye are strangers to that; and never may ye learn it by suffering! Yes, the tender plant grows in those sheltered regions of its own! and the Sun-god's heat vexes it not, nor rain, nor any wind; but it rejoices in its sweet, untroubled being, til such time as the maiden is called a wife, and finds her portion of anxious thoughts in the night, brooding on danger to husband or to children. Such an one could understand the burden of my cares; she could judge them by her own. <br />Well, I have had many a sorrow to weep for ere now; but I am going to speak of one more grievous than them all. <br />When <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> my lord was going from home on his last journey, he left in the house an ancient tablet, inscribed with tokens which he had never brought himself to explain to me before, many as were the ordeals to which he had gone forth. He had always departed as if to conquer, not to die. But now, as if he were a doomed man, he told me what portion of his substance I was to take for my dower, and how he would have his sons share their father's land amongst them. And he fixed the time; saying that, when a year and three months should have passed since he had left the country, then he was fated to die; or, if he should have survived that term, to live thenceforth an untroubled life. <br />Such, he said, was the doom ordained by the gods to be accomplished in the toils of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>; as the ancient oak at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395208SDod class=place long=20.7878 lat=39.5464>Dodona</a> had spoken of yore, by the mouth of the two <a href=/people/2435 target=_blank>Peleiades</a>. And this is the precise moment when the fulfilment of that word becomes due; so that I: start up from sweet slumber, my friends, stricken with terror at the thought that I must remain widowed of the noblest among men. <br />LEADER OF THE CHORUS: Hush- no more ill-omened words; I see a man approaching, who wears a wreath, as if for joyous tidings. <br />(A MESSENGER enters.) <br />MESSENGER: Queen <a href=/people/728 target=_blank>Deianeira</a>, I shall be the first of messengers to free thee from fear. Know that <a href=/people/1123 target=_blank>Alcmena</a>'s son lives and triumphs, and from battle brings the first-fruits to the gods of this land. <br />DEIANEIRA: What news is this, old man, that thou hast told me? <br />MESSENGER: That thy lord, admired of all, will soon come to thy house, restored to thee in his victorious might. <br />DEIANEIRA: What citizen or stranger hath told thee this? <br />MESSENGER: In the meadow, summer haunt of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, <a href=/people/1097 target=_blank>Lichas</a> the herald is proclaiming it to many: from him I heard it, and flew hither, that I: might be the first to give thee these tidings, and so might reap some guerdon from thee, and win thy grace. <br />DEIANEIRA: And why is he not here, if he brings good news? </p>                        </div>

They deserve pity, unless their plight deceives me. <br />LICHAS: These are captives whom he chose out for himself and for the gods, when he sacked the city of <a href=/people/1124 target=_blank>Eurytus</a>. <br />DEIANEIRA: Was it the war against that city which kept him away so long, beyond all forecast, past all count of days? <br />LICHAS: Not so: the greater part of the time he was detained in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a>,- no free man, as he declares, but sold into bondage. No offence should attend on the word, lady, when the deed is found to be of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. So he passed a whole year, as he himself avows, in thraldom to <a href=/people/1144 target=_blank>Omphale</a> the barbarian. And so stung was he by that reproach, he bound himself by a solemn oath that he would one day enslave, with wife and child, the man who had brought that calamity upon him. Nor did he speak the word in vain; but, when he bad been purged, gathered an alien host, and went against the city of <a href=/people/1124 target=_blank>Eurytus</a>. That man, he said, alone of mortals, had a share in causing his misfortune. For when <br /><a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, an old friend, came to his house and hearth, <a href=/people/1124 target=_blank>Eurytus</a> heaped on him the taunts of a bitter tongue and spiteful soul,- saying, 'Thou hast unerring arrows in thy hands, and yet my sons surpass thee in the trial of archery'; 'Thou art a slave,' he cried, 'a free man's broken thrall': and at a banquet, when his guest was full of wine, he thrust him from his doors. <br />Wroth thereat, when afterward <a href=/people/751 target=_blank>Iphitus</a> came to the hill of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376228PTir class=place long=22.7997 lat=37.6003>Tiryns</a>, in search for <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> that had strayed, <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> seized a moment when the man's wandering thoughts went not with his wandering gaze, and hurled him from a tower-like summit. But in anger at that deed, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> our lord, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=demonym long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympian</a> sire of all, sent him forth into bondage, and spared not, because, this once, he had taken a life by guile. Had he wreaked his vengeance openly, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> would surely have pardoned him the righteous triumph; for the gods, too, love not insolence. <br />So those men, who waxed so proud with bitter speech, are themselves in the mansions of the dead, all of them, and their city is enslaved; while the women whom thou beholdest, fallen from happiness to misery, come here to thee; for such was thy lord's command, which <br />I, his faithful servant, perform. He himself, thou mayest be sure,- so soon as he shall have offered holy sacrifice for his victory to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> from whom he sprang,- will be with thee.

It is indeed distressing not to know thy name. <br />(IOLE maintains her silence.) <br />LICHAS: It will be unlike her former behaviour, then, I can tell thee, if she opens her lips: for she hath not uttered one word, but hath ever been travailing with the burden of her sorrow, and weeping bitterly, poor girl, since she left her wind-swept home.

I stay not now to speak of the gods; I spare to tell how she beguiled the son of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronus</a>, and <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>, the lord of darkness, or <br /><a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, shaker of the earth. <br />But, when this bride was to be won, who were the valiant rivals that entered the contest for her hand? Who went forth to the ordeal of battle, to the fierce blows and the blinding dust? antistrophe <br />One was a mighty river-god, the dread form of a horned and four-legged <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383211WAch class=place long=21.1067 lat=38.3388>Achelous</a>, from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384212POin class=place long=21.1948 lat=38.4118>Oiniadae</a>: the other came from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>, dear to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a>, with curved bow, and spears, and brandished club, the son of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>: who then met in combat, fain to win a bride: and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a> goddess of nuptial joy was there with them, sole umpire of their strife. epode <br />Then was there clatter of fists and clang of bow, and the noise of <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>'s horns therewith; then were there close-locked grapplings, and deadly blows from the forehead, and loud deep cries from both. <br />Meanwhile, she, in her delicate beauty, sat on the side of a hill that could be seen afar, awaiting the husband that should be hers. <br />So the battle rages, as I have told; but the fair bride who is the prize of the strife abides the end in piteous anguish. And suddenly she is parted from her mother, as when a heifer is taken from its dam. <br />(DEIANEIRA enters from the house alone, carrying in her arms a casket containing a robe.) </p>                        </div>

And now we twain are to share the same marriage-bed, the same embrace. Such is the reward that <br /><a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> hath sent me,- he whom I called true and loyal,- for guarding his home through all that weary time. I have no thought of anger against him, often as he is vexed with this distemper. But then to live with her, sharing the same union- what woman could endure it? For <br />I see that the flower of her age is blossoming, while mine is fading; and the eyes of men love to cull the bloom of youth, but they turn aside from the old. This, then, is my fear,- lest <br /><a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, in name my spouse, should be the younger's mate. <br />But, as I said, anger ill beseems a woman of understanding. I will tell you, friends, the way by which I hope to find deliverance and relief. I had a gift, given to me long ago by a monster of olden time, aid stored in an urn of bronze; a gift which, while yet a girl, I took up from the shaggy-breasted <a href=/people/1052 target=_blank>Nessus</a>,- from his life-blood, as he lay dying; <a href=/people/1052 target=_blank>Nessus</a>, who used to carry men in his arms across the deep waters of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384216WEve class=place long=21.552 lat=38.376>Evenus</a>, using no oar to waft them, nor sail of ship. <br />I, too, was carried on his shoulders,- when, by my father's sending, first went forth with <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> as his wife; and when I was in mid-stream, he touched me with wanton hands. I shrieked; the son of <br /><a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> turned quickly round, and shot a feathered arrow; it whizzed through his breast to the lungs; and, in his mortal faintness, thus much the <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaur</a> spake:- <br />'Child of aged <a href=/people/490 target=_blank>Oineus</a>, thou shalt have at least this profit of my ferrying,- if thou wilt hearken,-because thou wast the last whom <br />I conveyed. If thou gatherest with thy hands the blood clotted round my wound, at the place where the <a href=/people/1205 target=_blank>Hydra</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375227ULer class=place long=22.7182 lat=37.5511>Lerna</a>'s monstrous growth, hath tinged the arrow with black gall,- this shall be to thee a charm for the soul of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, so that he shall never look upon any woman to love her more than thee.' <br />I bethought me of this, my friends- for, after his death, I had kept it carefully locked up in a secret place; and I have anointed this robe, doing everything to it as he enjoined while he lived. The work is finished. May deeds of wicked daring be ever far from my thoughts, and from my knowledge,- as I abhor the women who attempt them! But if in any wise I may prevail against this girl by love-spells and charms used on <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, the means to that end are ready;-unless, indeed, I seem to be acting rashly: if so, I will desist forthwith. </p>                        </div>

And henceforth I would say to all, act not with zeal, if ye act without light. <br />LEADER: Tell us the cause of thy fear, if it may be told. <br />DEIANEIRA: A thing hath come to pass, my friends, such that, if I declare it, ye will hear a marvel whereof none could have dreamed. <br />That with which I was lately anointing the festal robe,- a white tuft of fleecy <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>'s wool,- hath disappeared,- not consumed by anything in the house, but self-devoured and self-destroyed, as it crumbled down from the surface of a stone. But I must tell the story <br />More at length, that thou mayest know exactly how this thing befell. <br />I neglected no part of the precepts which the savage <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaur</a> gave me, when the bitter barb was rankling in his side: they were in my memory, like the graven words which no hand may wash from a tablet of bronze. Now these were his orders, and I obeyed them:-to keep this unguent in secret place, always remote from fire and from the sun's warm ray, until I should apply it, newly spread, where I: wished. So had I done. And now, when the moment for action had come, I: performed the anointing privily in the house, with a tuft of soft wool which I had plucked from a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> of our home-flock; then I folded up my gift, and laid it, unvisited by sunlight, within its casket, as ye saw. <br />But as I was going back into the house, I beheld a thing too wondrous for words, and passing the wit of man to understand. I: happened to have thrown the shred of wool, with which I bad been preparing the robe, into the full blaze of the sunshine. As it grew warm, it shrivelled all away, and quickly crumbled to powder on the ground, like nothing so much as the dust shed from a saw's teeth where men work timber. In such a state it lies as it fell. And from the earth, where it was strewn, clots of foam seethed up, as when the rich juice of the blue fruit from the vine of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a> is poured upon the ground. <br />So I know not, hapless one, whither to turn my thoughts; I only see that I have done a fearful deed. Why or wherefore should the monster, in his death-throes, have shown good will to me, on whose account he was dying? Impossible! No, he was cajoling me, in order to slay the man who had smitten him: and I gain the knowledge of this too late, when it avails no more. Yes, I alone- unless my foreboding prove false- I, wretched one, must destroy him! For I: know that the arrow which made the wound did scathe even to the god <br /><a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Cheiron</a>; and it kills all beasts that it touches. And since 'tis this same black venom in the blood that hath passed out through the wound of <a href=/people/1052 target=_blank>Nessus</a>, must it not kill my lord also? I ween it must. <br />Howbeit, I am resolved that, if he is to fall, at the same time <br />I also shall be swept from life; for no woman could bear to live with an evil name, if she rejoices that her nature is not evil. <br />LEADER: Mischief must needs be feared; but it is not well to doom our hope before the event. <br />DEIANEIRA: Unwise counsels leave no room even for a hope which can lend courage. <br />LEADER: Yet towards those who have erred unwittingly, men's anger is softened; and so it should be towards thee. <br />DEIANEIRA: Nay, such words are not for one who has borne a part in the ill deed, but only for him who has no trouble at his own door. <br />LEADER: 'Twere well to refrain from further speech, unless thou would'st tell aught to thine own son; for he is at hand, who went erewhile to seek his sire. <br />(Enter HYLLUS) <br />HYLLUS: O mother, would that one of three things had befallen thee! <br />Would that thou wert dead,- or, if living, no mother of mine,- or that some new and better spirit had passed into thy bosom. </p>                        </div>

There is a sea-washed headland of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a>, Cape <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388229SKen class=place long=22.8315 lat=38.8265>Kenaion</a>, where he dedicated altars and a sacred grove to the <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> of his fathers; and there I first beheld him, with the joy of yearning love. <br />He was about to celebrate a great sacrifice, when his own herald, <a href=/people/1097 target=_blank>Lichas</a>, came to him from home, bearing thy gift, the deadly robe; which he put on, according to thy precept; and then began his offering with twelve <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>, free from blemish, the firstlings of the spoil; but altogether he brought a hundred victims, great or small, to the altar. <br />At first, hapless one, he prayed with serene soul, rejoicing in his comely garb. But when the blood-fed flame began to blaze from the holy offerings and from the resinous pine, a sweat broke forth upon his flesh, and the tunic clung to his sides, at every joint, close-glued, as if by a craftsman's hand; there came a biting pain that racked his bones; and then the venom, as of some deadly, cruel <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>viper</a>, began to devour him. <br />Thereupon he shouted for the unhappy <a href=/people/1097 target=_blank>Lichas</a>,- in no wise to blame for thy crime,- asking what treason had moved him to bring that robe; but he, all-unknowing, hapless one, said that he had brought the gift from thee alone, as it had been sent. When his master heard it, as a piercing spasm clutched his lungs, he caught him by the foot, where the ankle turns in the socket, and hurled him at a surf-beaten rock in the sea; and he made the white brain to ooze from the hair, as the skull was dashed to splinters, and blood scattered therewith. <br />But all the people lifted up a cry of awe-struck grief, seeing that one was frenzied, and the other slain; and no one dared to come before the man. For the pain dragged him to earth, or made him leap into the air, with yells and shrieks, till the cliffs rang around, steep headlands of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386231ROpu class=place long=23.04 lat=38.65>Locris</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=demonym long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboean</a> capes. <br />But when he was spent with oft throwing himself on the ground in his anguish, and oft making loud lament,- cursing his fatal marriage with thee, the vile one, and his alliance with <a href=/people/490 target=_blank>Oineus</a>,- saying how he had found in it the ruin of his life,- then from out of the shrouding altar-smoke, he lifted up his wildly-rolling eyes, and saw me in the great crowd, weeping. He turned his gaze on me, and called me: 'O son, draw near; do not fly from my trouble, even though thou must share my death. Come, bear me forth, and set me, if thou canst, in a place where no man shall see me; or, if thy pity forbids that, at least convey me with all speed out of this land, and let me not die where I am.' <br />That command sufficed; we laid him in mid-ship, and brought him-but hardly brought him- to this shore, moaning in his torments. <br />And ye shall presently behold him, alive, or lately dead. <br />Such, mother, are the designs and deeds against my sire whereof thou hast been found guilty.

From a secret place of espial, I watched her; and saw her spreading coverings on the couch of her lord. When she had done this, she sprang thereon, and sat in the middle of the bed; her tears burst forth in burning streams, and thus she spake: 'Ah, bridal bed and bridal chamber mine, farewell now and for ever; never more shall ye receive me to rest upon this couch.' She said no more, but with a vehement hand loosed her robe, where the gold-wrought brooch lay above her breast, baring all her left side and arm. Then <br />I ran with all my strength, and warned her son of her intent. But lo, in the space between my going and our return, she had driven a two-edged sword through her side to the heart. <br />At that sight, her son uttered a great cry; for he knew, alas, that in his anger he had driven her to that deed; and he had learned, too late, from the servants in the house that she had acted without knowledge, by the prompting of the <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaur</a>. And now the youth, in his misery, bewailed her with all passionate lament; he knelt, and showered kisses on her lips; he threw himself at her side upon the ground, bitterly crying that he had rashly smitten her with a slander,- weeping that he must now live bereaved of both alike,- of mother and of sire. <br />Such are the fortunes of this house. Rash indeed, is he who reckons on the morrow, or haply on days beyond it; for tomorrow is not, until today is safely past. <br />CHORUS (singing) strophe 1 <br />Which woe shall I bewail first, which misery is the greater?

But if thou do it not, even from the world below my curse and my wrath shall wait on thee for ever. <br />HYLLUS: Alas, my father, what hast thou spoken? How hast thou dealt with me! <br />HERACLES: I have spoken that which thou must perform; if thou wilt not, then get thee some other sire, and be called my son no more! <br />HYLLUS: Woe, woe is me! What a deed dost thou require of me, my father,-that I should become thy murderer, guilty of thy blood! <br />HERACLES: Not so, in truth, but healer of my sufferings, sole physician of my pain! <br />HYLLUS: And how, by enkindling thy body, shall I heal it? </p>                        </div>
