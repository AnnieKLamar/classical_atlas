Where frequent winds Swell the vex'd <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236WEur class=place long=23.591 lat=38.465>Euripus</a> with eddying blasts, And roll the darkening waves, my father slew me, A victim to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a>, so he thought, For <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>'s sake, its bay where <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384236UAul class=place long=23.5925 lat=38.4335>Aulis</a> winds, To fame well known; for there his thousand ships, The armament of Greece, the imperial chief Convened, desirous that his Greeks should snatch The glorious crown of victory from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, And punish the base insult to the bed Of <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>, vengeance grateful to the soul Of <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>. But 'gainst his ships the sea Long barred, and not one favouring breeze to swell His flagging sails, the hallow'd flames the chief Consults, and <a href=/people/662 target=_blank>Calchas</a> thus disclosed the fates:- Imperial leader of the Grecian host, Hence shalt thou not unmoor thy vessels, ere <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a> as a victim shall receive Thy daughter <a href=/people/708 target=_blank>Iphigenia</a>: what the year Most beauteous should produce, thou to the queen Dispensing light didst vow to sacrifice: A daughter <a href=/people/595 target=_blank>Clytemnestra</a> in thy house Then bore (the peerless grace of beauty thus To me assigning); her must thou devote The victim. Then <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> by his arts, Me, to <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> as design'd a bride, Won from my mother. My unhappy fate To <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384236UAul class=place long=23.5925 lat=38.4335>Aulis</a> brought me; on the altar there High was I placed, and o'er me gleam'd the sword, Aiming the fatal wound: but from the stroke <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a> snatch'd me, in exchange a hind Giving the Grecians; through the lucid air Me she conveyed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/453343RChe class=place long=34.3 lat=45.3>Tauris</a>, here to dwell, Where o'er barbarians a barbaric king Holds his rude sway, named <a href=/people/533 target=_blank>Thoas</a>, whose swift foot Equals the rapid wing: me he appoints The priestess of this temple, where such rites Are pleasing to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a>, that the name Alone claims honour; for I sacrifice Such, ere I came, the custom of the state) Whatever Grecian to this savage shore Is driven: the previous rites are mine; the deed Of blood, too horrid to be told, devolves On others in the temple: but the rest, In reverence to the goddess, I forbear. But the strange visions which the night now past Brought with it, to the air, if that may soothe My troubled thought, I will relate. I seem'd, As I lay sleeping, from this land removed, To dwell at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>, resting on my couch Mid the apartments of the virgin train. Sudden the firm earth shook: I fled, and stood Without; the battlements I saw, and all The rocking roof fall from its lofty height In ruins to the ground: of all the house, My father's house, one pillar, as I thought, Alone was left, which from its cornice waved A length of auburn locks, and human voice Assumed: the bloody office, which is mine To strangers here, respecting, I to death, Sprinkling the lustral drops, devoted it With many tears. My dream I thus expound:- <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a>, whom I hallow'd by my rites, Is dead: for sons are pillars of the house; They, whom my lustral lavers sprinkle, die. I cannot to my friends apply my dream, For <a href=/people/2024 target=_blank>Strophius</a>, when I perish'd, had no son. Now, to my brother, absent though he be, Libations will I offer: this, at least, With the attendants given me by the king, Virgins of Greece, I can: but what the cause They yet attend me not within the house, The temple of the goddess, where I dwell?

Shall we ascend their height? But how escape Observing eyes? Or burst the brazen bars? Of these we nothing know: in the attempt To force the gates, or meditating means To enter, if detected, we shall die. Shall we then, ere we die, by flight regain The ship in which we hither plough'd the sea? <br />PYLADES: Of flight we brook no thought, nor such hath been Our wont; nor may the god's commanding voice Be disobey'd; but from the temple now Retiring, in some cave, which the black sea Beats with its billows, we may lie conceal'd At distance from our bark, lest some, whose eyes May note it, bear the tidings to the king, And we be seized by force. But when the eye Of night comes darkling on, then must we dare, And take the polish'd image from the shrine, Attempting all things: and the vacant space Between the triglyphs (mark it well) enough Is open to admit us; by that way Attempt we to descend: in toils the brave Are daring; of no worth the abject soul. <br />ORESTES: This length of sea we plough'd not, from this coast, Nothing effected, to return: but well Hast thou advised; the god must be obey'd. Retire we then where we may lie conceal'd; For never from the god will come the cause, That what his sacred voice commands should fall Effectless. We must dare. No toil to youth <a href=/people/6099 target=_blank>Excuse</a>, which justifies inaction, brings. (They go out. IPHIGENIA and the CHORUS enter from the temple.) </p>                        </div>

Of our number there A herdsman saw two youths, and back return'd With soft and silent step; then pointing, said, Do you not see them? These are deities That sit there. One, who with religious awe Revered the gods, with hands uplifted pray'd, His eyes fix'd on them,-Son of the sea-nymph <a href=/people/6618 target=_blank>Leucothoe</a>, guardian of the labouring bark, Our lord <a href=/people/1061 target=_blank>Palaemon</a>, be propitious to us!

One, whose untaught mind Audacious folly harden'd 'gainst the sense Of holy awe, scoff'd at his prayers, and said,- These are wreck'd mariners, that take their seat In the cleft rock through fear, as they have heard Our prescribed rite, that here we sacrifice The stranger. To the greater part he seem'd Well to have spoken, and we judged it meet To seize the victims, by our country's law Due to the goddess. Of the stranger youths, One at this instant started from the rock: Awhile he stood, and wildly toss'd his head, And groan'd, his loose arms trembling all their length, Convulsed with madness; and a hunter loud Then cried,-Dost thou behold her, <a href=/people/663 target=_blank>Pylades</a>? Dost thou not see this dragon fierce from hell Rushing to kill me, and against me rousing Her horrid <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>vipers</a>? See this other here, Emitting fire and slaughter from her vests, Sails on her wings, my mother in her arms Bearing, to hurl this mass of rock upon me! Ah, she will kill me! Whither shall I fly? His visage might we see no more the same, And his voice varied; now the roar of <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>, The howl of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> now uttering, mimic sounds Sent by the maddening <a href=/people/1744 target=_blank>Furies</a>, as they say. Together thronging, as of death assured, We sit in silence; but he drew his sword, And, like a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> rushing mid our herds, Plunged in their sides the weapon, weening thus To drive the <a href=/people/1744 target=_blank>Furies</a>, till the briny wave Foam'd with their blood. But when among our herds We saw this havoc made, we all 'gan rouse To arms, and blew our sounding shells to alarm The neighbouring peasants; for we thought in fight Rude herdsmen to these youthful strangers, train'd To arms, ill match'd; and forthwith to our aid Flock'd numbers. But, his frenzy of its force Abating, on the earth the stranger falls, Foam bursting from his mouth: but when he saw The advantage, each adventured on and hurl'd What might annoy him fallen: the other youth Wiped off the foam, took of his person care, His fine-wrought robe spread over him; with heed The flying stones observing, warded of The wounds, and each kind office to his friend Attentively perform'd. His sense return'd; The stranger started up, and soon perceived The tide of foes that roll'd impetuous on, The danger and distress that closed them round. He heaved a sigh; an unremitting storm Of stones we pour'd, and each incited each: Then we his dreadful exhortation heard:- <a href=/people/663 target=_blank>Pylades</a>, we shall die; but let us die With glory: draw thy sword, and follow me. But when we saw the enemies advance With brandish'd swords, the steep heights crown'd with wood We fell in flight: but others, if one flies, Press on them; if again they drive these back, What before fled turns, with a storm of stones Assaulting them; but, what exceeds belief, Hurl'd by a thousand hands, not one could hit The victims of the goddess: scarce at length, Not by brave daring seized we them, but round We closed upon them, and their swords with stones Beat, wily, from their hands; for on their knees They through fatigue had sunk upon the ground: We bare them to the monarch of this land: He view'd them, and without delay to the Sent them devoted to the cleansing vase, And to the altar.

But, o'er mine eyes the veil's fine texture spread, This brother in my hands who now is lost, I clasp'd not, though his sister; did not press My lips to his, through virgin modesty, As going to the house of <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a>: then Each fond embrace I to another time Deferr'd, as soon to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a> to return.
