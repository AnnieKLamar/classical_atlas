THE FIRST BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED CLIO <br />This is the Showing forth of the Inquiry of <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal class=person long=27.4238 lat=37.0323>Halicarnassos</a>, to the end that neither the deeds of men may be forgotten by lapse of time, nor the works great and marvellous, which have been produced some by Hellenes and some by Barbarians, may lose their renown; and especially that the causes may be remembered for which these waged war with one another. <br />Those of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> who have knowledge of history declare that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a> first began the quarrel. These, they say, came from that which is called the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Erythraean Sea</a> to this of ours; and having settled in the land where they continue even now to dwell, set themselves forthwith to make long voyages by sea. And conveying merchandise of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and of <a href=/people/454 target=_blank>Assyria</a> they arrived at other places and also at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>; now <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a> was at that time in all points the first of the States within that land which is now called Hellas; — the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a> arrived then at this land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>, and began to dispose of their ship's cargo: and on the fifth or sixth day after they had arrived, when their goods had been almost all sold, there came down to the sea a great company of women, and among them the daughter of the king; and her name, as the Hellenes also agree, was <a href=/people/389 target=_blank>Io</a> the daughter of <a href=/people/684 target=_blank>Inachos</a>. These standing near to the stern of the ship were buying of the wares such as pleased them most, when of a sudden the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a>, passing the word from one to another, made a rush upon them; and the greater part of the women escaped by flight, but <a href=/people/389 target=_blank>Io</a> and certain others were carried off. So they put them on board their ship, and forthwith departed, sailing away to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. </p>                        </div>

Now they say that in their judgment, though it is an act of wrong to carry away women by force, it is a folly to set one's heart on taking vengeance for their rape, and the wise course is to pay no regard when they have been carried away; for it is evident that they would never be carried away if they were not themselves willing to go. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> say that they, namely the people of Asia, when their women were carried away by force, had made it a matter of no account, but the Hellenes on account of a woman of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=person long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemon</a> gathered together a great armament, and then came to Asia and destroyed the dominion of <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>; and that from this time forward they had always considered the Hellenic race to be their enemy: for Asia and the Barbarian races which dwell there the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> claim as belonging to them; but Europe and the Hellenic race they consider to be parted off from them. </p>                        </div>

And he said: <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a>, thou art inquiring about human fortunes of one who well knows that the Deity is altogether envious and apt to disturb our lot. For in the course of long time a man may see many things which he would not desire to see, and suffer also many things which he would not desire to suffer. The limit of life for a man I lay down at seventy years: and these seventy years give twenty-five thousand and two hundred days, not reckoning for any intercalated month. Then if every other one of these years shall be made longer by one month, that the seasons may be caused to come round at the due time of the year, the intercalated months will be in number five-and-thirty besides the seventy years; and of these months the days will be one thousand and fifty. Of all these days, being in number twenty-six thousand two hundred and fifty, which go to the seventy years, one day produces nothing at all which resembles what another brings with it. Thus then, O <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a>, man is altogether a creature of accident. As for thee, I perceive that thou art both great in wealth and king of many men, but that of which thou didst ask me I cannot call thee yet, until I learn that thou hast brought thy life to a fair ending: for the very rich man is not at all to be accounted more happy than he who has but his subsistence from day today, unless also the fortune go with him of ending his life well in possession of all things fair. For many very wealthy men are not happy, while many who have but a moderate living are fortunate; and in truth the very rich man who is not happy has two advantages only as compared with the poor man who is fortunate, whereas this latter has many as compared with the rich man who is not happy. The rich man is able better to fulfil his desire, and also to endure a great calamity if it fall upon him; whereas the other has advantage over him in these things which follow: — he is not indeed able equally with the rich man to endure a calamity or to fulfil his desire, but these his good fortune keeps away from him, while he is sound of limb, free from disease, untouched by suffering, the father of fair children and himself of comely form; and if in addition to this he shall end his life well, he is worthy to be called that which thou seekest, namely a happy man; but before he comes to his end it is well to hold back and not to call him yet happy but only fortunate. Now to possess all these things together is impossible for one who is mere man, just as no single land suffices to supply all things for itself, but one thing it has and another it lacks, and the land that has the greatest number of things is the best: so also in the case of a man, no single person is complete in himself, for one thing he has and another he lacks; but whosoever of men continues to the end in possession of the greatest number of these things and then has a gracious ending of his life, he is by me accounted worthy, O king, to receive this name. But we must of every thing examine the end and how it will turn out at the last, for to many God shows but a glimpse of happiness and then plucks them up by the roots and overturns them. </p>                        </div>

For as there were at that time dealings under truce with the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375224PTeg class=place long=22.429 lat=37.464>Tegea</a>, he had come to a forge there and was looking at iron being wrought; and he was in wonder as he saw that which was being done. The smith therefore, perceiving that he marvelled at it, ceased from his work and said: Surely, thou stranger of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemon</a>, if thou hadst seen that which I once saw, thou wouldst have marvelled much, since now it falls out that thou dost marvel so greatly at the working of this iron; for I, desiring in this enclosure to make a well, lighted in my digging upon a coffin of seven cubits in length; and not believing that ever there had been men larger than those of the present day, I opened it, and I saw that the dead body was equal in length to the coffin: then after I had measured it, I filled in the earth over it again. He then thus told him of that which he had seen; and the other, having thought upon that which was told, conjectured that this was <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> according to the saying of the Oracle, forming his conjecture in the following manner: — whereas he saw that the smith had two pairs of bellows, he concluded that these were the winds spoken of, and that the anvil and the hammer were the stroke and the stroke in, and that the iron which was being wrought was the trouble laid upon trouble, making comparison by the thought that iron has been discovered for the evil of mankind. Having thus conjectured he came back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> and declared the whole matter to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>; and they brought a charge against him on a fictitious pretext and drove him out into exile. So having come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375224PTeg class=place long=22.429 lat=37.464>Tegea</a>, he told the smith of his evil fortune and endeavoured to hire from him the enclosure, but at first he would not allow him to have it: at length however <a href=/people/1097 target=_blank>Lichas</a> persuaded him and he took up his abode there; and he dug up the grave and gathered together the bones and went with them away to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>.

Having made this agreement they withdrew; and chosen men of both sides were left behind and engaged in fight with one another. So they fought and proved themselves to be equally matched; and there were left at last of six hundred men three, on the side of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a> <a href=/people/8766 target=_blank>Alkenor</a> and <a href=/people/2026 target=_blank>Chromios</a>, and on the side of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> <a href=/people/3918 target=_blank>Othryades</a>: these were left alive when night came on.

So the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> having taken him brought him into the presence of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>: and he piled up a great pyre and caused <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> to go up upon it bound in fetters, and along with him twice seven sons of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=ethnic long=28 lat=38.5>Lydians</a>, whether it was that he meant to dedicate this offering as first-fruits of his victory to some god, or whether he desired to fulfil a vow, or else had heard that <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> was a god-fearing man and so caused him to go up on the pyre because he wished to know if any one of the divine powers would save him, so that he should not be burnt alive. He, they say, did this; but to <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> as he stood upon the pyre there came, although he was in such evil case, a memory of the saying of <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>, how he had said with divine inspiration that no one of the living might be called happy. And when this thought came into his mind, they say that he sighed deeply and groaned aloud, having been for long silent, and three times he uttered the name of <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>. Hearing this, <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> bade the interpreters ask <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> who was this person on whom he called; and they came near and asked. And <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> for a time, it is said, kept silence when he was asked this, but afterwards being pressed he said: One whom more than much wealth I should have desired to have speech with all monarchs. Then, since his words were of doubtful import, they asked again of that which he said; and as they were urgent with him and gave him no peace, he told how once <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> had come, and having inspected all his wealth had made light of it, with such and such words; and how all had turned out for him according as <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> had said, not speaking at all especially with a view to <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> himself, but with a view to the whole human race and especially those who seem to themselves to be happy men. And while <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> related these things, already the pyre was lighted and the edges of it round about were burning. Then they say that <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, hearing from the interpreters what <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> had said, changed his purpose and considered that he himself also was but a man, and that he was delivering another man, who had been not inferior to himself in felicity, alive to the fire; and moreover he feared the requital, and reflected that there was nothing of that which men possessed which was secure; therefore, they say, he ordered them to extinguish as quickly as possible the fire that was burning, and to bring down <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> and those who were with him from the pyre; and they using endeavours were not able now to get the mastery of the flames. </p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> paid the debt due for the sin of his fifth ancestor, who being one of the spearmen of the <a href=/people/324 target=_blank>Heracleidai</a> followed the treacherous device of a woman, and having slain his master took possession of his royal dignity, which belonged not to him of right. And although <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Loxias</a> eagerly desired that the calamity of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=place long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardis</a> might come upon the sons of <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> and not upon <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> himself, it was not possible for him to draw the Destinies aside from their course; but so much as these granted he brought to pass, and gave it as a gift to <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a>: for he put off the taking of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=place long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardis</a> by three years; and let <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> be assured that he was taken prisoner later by these years than the fated time: moreover secondly, he assisted him when he was about to be burnt. And as to the oracle which was given, <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> finds fault with good ground: for <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Loxias</a> told him beforehand that if he should march upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> he should destroy a great empire: and he upon hearing this, if he wished to take counsel well, ought to have sent and asked further whether the god meant his own empire or that of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>: but as he did not comprehend that which was uttered and did not ask again, let him pronounce himself to be the cause of that which followed. To him also when he consulted the Oracle for the last time <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Loxias</a> said that which he said concerning a mule; but this also he failed to comprehend: for <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> was in fact this mule, seeing that he was born of parents who were of two different races, his mother being of nobler descent and his father of less noble: for she was a <a href=/people/538 target=_blank>Median</a> woman, daughter of <a href=/people/578 target=_blank>Astyages</a> and king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, but he was a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, one of a race subject to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, and being inferior in all respects he was the husband of one who was his royal mistress.

And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=ethnic long=28 lat=38.5>Lydians</a> themselves say that the games which are now in use among them and among the Hellenes were also their invention.

These games they invented as a resource against the famine, and thus they used to do: — on one of the days they would play games all the time in order that they might not feel the want of food, and on the next they ceased from their games and had food: and thus they went on for eighteen years. As however the evil did not slacken but pressed upon them ever more and more, therefore their king divided the whole <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> people into two parts, and he appointed by lot one part to remain and the other to go forth from the land; and the king appointed himself to be over that one of the parts which had the lot to stay in the land, and his son to be over that which was departing; and the name of his son was Tyrsenos.

This <a href=/people/1883 target=_blank>Deiokes</a>, having formed a desire for despotic power, did thus: — whereas the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> dwelt in separate villages, he, being even before that time of great repute in his own village, set himself to practise just dealing much more and with greater zeal than before; and this he did although there was much lawlessness throughout the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a>, and although he knew that injustice is ever at feud with justice. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> of the same village, seeing his manners, chose him for their judge. So he, since he was aiming at power, was upright and just, and doing thus he had no little praise from his fellow-citizens, insomuch that those of the other villages learning that <a href=/people/1883 target=_blank>Deiokes</a> was a man who more than all others gave decision rightly, whereas before this they had been wont to suffer from unjust judgments, themselves also when they heard it came gladly to <a href=/people/1883 target=_blank>Deiokes</a> to have their causes determined, and at last they trusted the business to no one else. </p>                        </div>

And he bade them build for him a palace worthy of the royal dignity and strengthen him with a guard of spearmen. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> did so: for they built him a large and strong palace in that part of the land which he told them, and they allowed him to select spearmen from all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>. And when he had obtained the rule over them, he compelled the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> to make one fortified city and pay chief attention to this, having less regard to the other cities. And as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> obeyed him in this also, he built large and strong walls, those which are now called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348485UEcb class=place long=48.5166 lat=34.8054>Agbatana</a>, standing in circles one within the other. And this wall is so contrived that one circle is higher than the next by the height of the battlements alone. And to some extent, I suppose, the nature of the ground, seeing that it is on a hill, assists towards this end; but much more was it produced by art, since the circles are in all seven in number. And within the last circle are the royal palace and the treasure-houses. The largest of these walls is in size about equal to the circuit of the wall round <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>; and of the first circle the battlements are white, of the second black, of the third crimson, of the fourth blue, of the fifth red: thus are the battlements of all the circles coloured with various tints, and the two last have their battlements one of them overlaid with silver and the other with gold. </p>                        </div>

Now he surrounded himself with this state to the end that his fellows, who had been brought up with him and were of no meaner family nor behind him in manly virtue, might not be grieved by seeing him and make plots against him, but that being unseen by them he might be thought to be of different mould. </p>                        </div>

And both were in anxiety, each for the other, the man having fear about the child-bearing of his wife, and the woman about the cause why <a href=/people/811 target=_blank>Harpagos</a> had sent to summon her husband, not having been wont to do so aforetime. So as soon as he returned and stood before her, the woman seeing him again beyond her hopes was the first to speak, and asked him for what purpose <a href=/people/811 target=_blank>Harpagos</a> had sent for him so urgently.

For the house of <a href=/people/811 target=_blank>Harpagos</a> was all full of mourning, and I being astonished thereat went within: and as soon as I entered I saw laid out to view an infant child gasping for breath and screaming, which was adorned with gold ornaments and embroidered clothing: and when <a href=/people/811 target=_blank>Harpagos</a> saw me he bade me forthwith to take up the child and carry it away and lay it on that part of the mountains which is most haunted by wild beasts, saying that it was <a href=/people/578 target=_blank>Astyages</a> who laid this task upon me, and using to me many threats, if I should fail to do this. And I took it up and bore it away, supposing that it was the child of some one of the servants of the house, for never could I have supposed whence it really was; but I marvelled to see it adorned with gold and raiment, and I marvelled also because mourning was made for it openly in the house of <a href=/people/811 target=_blank>Harpagos</a>. And straightway as we went by the road, I learnt the whole of the matter from the servant who went with me out of the city and placed in my hands the babe, namely that it was in truth the son of <a href=/people/3879 target=_blank>Mandane</a> the daughter of <a href=/people/578 target=_blank>Astyages</a>, and of <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a> the son of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, and that <a href=/people/578 target=_blank>Astyages</a> bade slay it.

So he, as he was being led away to the torture, then declared the story as it really was; and beginning from the beginning he went through the whole, telling the truth about it, and finally ended with entreaties, asking that he would grant him pardon. </p>                        </div>

I did therefore thus: — I called this herdsman and delivered the child to him, saying first that thou wert he who bade him slay it — and in this at least I did not lie, for thou didst so command. I delivered it, I say, to this man commanding him to place it upon a desolate mountain, and to stay by it and watch it until it should die, threatening him with all kinds of punishment if he should fail to accomplish this. And when he had done that which was ordered and the child was dead, I sent the most trusted of my eunuchs and through them I saw and buried the child.

The <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magians</a> said: If the child is still alive and became king without any arrangement, be thou confident concerning him and have good courage, for he shall not be ruler again the second time; since some even of our oracles have had but small results, and that at least which has to do with dreams comes often in the end to a feeble accomplishment. <a href=/people/578 target=_blank>Astyages</a> made answer in these words: I myself also, O <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magians</a>, am most disposed to believe that this is so, namely that since the boy was named king the dream has had its fulfilment and that this boy is no longer a source of danger to me. Nevertheless give counsel to me, having well considered what is likely to be most safe both for my house and for you. Replying to this the <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magians</a> said: To us also, O king, it is of great consequence that thy rule should stand firm; for in the other case it is transferred to strangers, coming round to this boy who is a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, and we being <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> are made slaves and become of no account in the eyes of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, seeing that we are of different race; but while thou art established as our king, who art one of our own nation, we both have our share of rule and receive great honours from thee. Thus then we must by all means have a care of thee and of thy rule. And now, if we saw in this anything to cause fear, we would declare all to thee beforehand: but as the dream has had its issue in a trifling manner, both we ourselves are of good cheer and we exhort thee to be so likewise: and as for this boy, send him away from before thine eyes to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and to his parents. </p>                        </div>

This territory is of all that we know the best by far for producing corn: as to trees, it does not even attempt to bear them, either fig or vine or olive, but for producing corn it is so good that it is as much as two-hundred-fold for the average, and when it bears at its best it produces three-hundred-fold. The leaves of the wheat and barley there grow to be full four fingers broad; and from millet and sesame seed how large a tree grows, I know myself but shall not record, being well aware that even what has already been said relating to the crops produced has been enough to cause disbelief in those who have not visited the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=demonym long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonian</a> land. They use no oil of olives, but only that which they make of sesame seed; and they have date-palms growing over all the plain, most of them fruit-bearing, of which they make both solid food and wine and honey; and to these they attend in the same manner as to fig-trees, and in particular they take the fruit of those palms which the Hellenes call male-palms, and tie them upon the date-bearing palms, so that their gall-fly may enter into the date and ripen it and that the fruit of the palm may not fall off: for the male-palm produces gall-flies in its fruit just as the wild-fig does. </p>                        </div>

The boat is kept straight by two steering-oars and two men standing upright, and the man inside pulls his oar while the man outside pushes. These vessels are made both of very large size and also smaller, the largest of them having a burden of as much as five thousand talents' weight; and in each one there is a live <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>, and in those of larger size several. So when they have arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> in their voyage and have disposed of their cargo, they sell by auction the ribs of the boat and all the straw, but they pack the hides upon their <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> and drive them off to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a>: for up the stream of the river it is not possible by any means to sail, owing to the swiftness of the current; and for this reason they make their boats not of timber but of hides.

In every village once in each year it was done as follows: — When the maidens grew to the age for marriage, they gathered these all together and brought them in a body to one place, and round them stood a company of men: and the crier caused each one severally to stand up, and proceeded to sell them, first the most comely of all, and afterwards, when she had been sold and had fetched a large sum of money, he would put up another who was the most comely after her: and they were sold for marriage. Now all the wealthy men of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a> who were ready to marry vied with one another in bidding for the most beautiful maidens; those however of the common sort who were ready to marry did not require a fine form, but they would accept money together with less comely maidens. For when the crier had made an end of selling the most comely of the maidens, then he would cause to stand up that one who was least shapely, or any one of them who might be crippled in any way, and he would make proclamation of her, asking who was willing for least gold to have her in marriage, until she was assigned to him who was willing to accept least: and the gold would be got from the sale of the comely maidens, and so those of beautiful form provided dowries for those which were unshapely or crippled; but to give in marriage one's own daughter to whomsoever each man would, was not allowed, nor to carry off the maiden after buying her without a surety; for it was necessary for the man to provide sureties that he would marry her, before he took her away; and if they did not agree well together, the law was laid down that he should pay back the money. It was allowed also for any one who wished it to come from another village and buy. This then was their most honourable custom; it does not however still exist at the present time, but they have found out of late another way, in order that the men may not ill-treat them or take them to another city: for since the time when being conquered they were oppressed and ruined, each one of the common people when he is in want of livelihood prostitutes his female children. </p>                        </div>

If thou dost suppose that thou art immortal and that thou dost command an army which is also immortal, it will be of no use for me to declare to thee my judgment; but if thou hast perceived that thou art a mortal man thyself and dost command others who are so likewise, then learn this first, that for the affairs of men there is a revolving wheel, and that this in its revolution suffers not the same persons always to have good fortune. I therefore now have an opinion about the matter laid before us, which is opposite to that of these men: for if we shall consent to receive the enemy into our land, there is for thee this danger in so doing: — if thou shalt be worsted thou wilt lose in addition all thy realm, for it is evident that if the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetai</a> are victors they will not turn back and fly, but will march upon the provinces of thy realm; and on the other hand if thou shalt be the victor, thou wilt not be victor so fully as if thou shouldest overcome the <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetai</a> after crossing over into their land and shouldest pursue them when they fled. For against that which I said before I will set the same again here, and say that thou, when thou hast conquered, wilt march straight against the realm of <a href=/people/2458 target=_blank>Tomyris</a>. Moreover besides that which has been said, it is a disgrace and not to be endured that <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> the son of <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a> should yield to a woman and so withdraw from her land. Now therefore it seems good to me that we should cross over and go forward from the crossing as far as they go in their retreat, and endeavour to get the better of them by doing as follows: — The <a href=/people/11022 target=_blank>Massagetai</a>, as I am informed, are without experience of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> good things, and have never enjoyed any great luxuries. Cut up therefore <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> without stint and dress the meat and set out for these men a banquet in our camp: moreover also provide without stint bowls of unmixed wine and provisions of every kind; and having so done, leave behind the most worthless part of thy army and let the rest begin to retreat from the camp towards the river: for if I am not mistaken in my judgment, they when they see a quantity of good things will fall to the feast, and after that it remains for us to display great deeds. </p>                        </div>

Now <a href=/people/1027 target=_blank>Psammetichos</a>, when he was not able by inquiry to find out any means of knowing who had come into being first of all men, contrived a device of the following kind: — Taking two new-born children belonging to persons of the common sort he gave them to a shepherd to bring up at the place where his flocks were, with a manner of bringing up such as I shall say, charging him namely that no man should utter any word in their presence, and that they should be placed by themselves in a room where none might come, and at the proper time he should bring to them she-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>, and when he had satisfied them with milk he should do for them whatever else was needed. These things <a href=/people/1027 target=_blank>Psammetichos</a> did and gave him this charge wishing to hear what word the children would let break forth first, after they had ceased from wailings without sense. And accordingly so it came to pass; for after a space of two years had gone by, during which the shepherd went on acting so, at length, when he opened the door and entered, both the children fell before him in entreaty and uttered the word bekos, stretching forth their hands. At first when he heard this the shepherd kept silence; but since this word was often repeated, as he visited them constantly and attended to them, at last he declared the matter to his master, and at his command he brought the children before his face. Then <a href=/people/1027 target=_blank>Psammetichos</a> having himself also heard it, began to inquire about what nation of men named anything bekos, and inquiring he found that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a> had this name for bread. In this manner and guided by an indication such as this, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> were brought to allow that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a> were a more ancient people than themselves. </p>                        </div>

How then should it flow from snow, when it flows from the hottest parts to those which are cooler? And indeed most of the facts are such as to convince a man (one at least who is capable of reasoning about such matters), that it is not at all likely that it flows from snow. The first and greatest evidence is afforded by the winds, which blow hot from these regions; the second is that the land is rainless always and without frost, whereas after snow has fallen rain must necessarily come within five days, so that if it snowed in those parts rain would fall there; the third evidence is afforded by the people dwelling there, who are of a black colour by reason of the burning heat. Moreover kites and swallows remain there through the year and do not leave the land; and cranes flying from the cold weather which comes on in the region of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a> come regularly to these parts for wintering: if then it snowed ever so little in that land through which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> flows and in which it has its rise, none of these things would take place, as necessity compels us to admit. </p>                        </div>

I think however that the Sun does not send away from himself all the water of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> of each year, but that he also lets some remain behind with himself. Then when the winter becomes milder, the Sun returns back again to the midst of the heaven, and from that time onwards he draws equally from all rivers; but in the meanwhile they flow in large volume, since water of rain mingles with them in great quantity, because their country receives rain then and is filled with torrent streams. In summer however they are weak, since not only the showers of rain fail then, but also they are drawn by the Sun. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> however, alone of all rivers, not having rain and being drawn by the Sun, naturally flows during this time of winter in much less than its proper volume, that is much less than in summer; for then it is drawn equally with all the other waters, but in winter it bears the burden alone.

To me however this man seemed not to be speaking seriously when he said that he had certain knowledge of it; and he said as follows, namely that there were two mountains of which the tops ran up to a sharp point, situated between the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/241329USye class=place long=32.898 lat=24.0811>Syene</a>, which is in the district of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/257326PThe class=place long=32.641 lat=25.684>Thebes</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/241329UEle class=place long=32.886 lat=24.0848>Elephantine</a>, and the names of the mountains were, of the one Crophi and of the other Mophi.

The root also of this lotos is edible and has a rather sweet taste: it is round in shape and about the size of an apple. There are other lilies too, in flower resembling roses, which also grow in the river, and from them the fruit is produced in a separate vessel springing from the root by the side of the plant itself, and very nearly resembles a <a href=/people/10963 target=_blank>wasp</a>'s comb: in this there grow edible seeds in great numbers of the size of an olive-stone, and they are eaten either fresh or dried. Besides this they pull up from the fens the papyrus which grows every year, and the upper parts of it they cut off and turn to other uses, but that which is left below for about a cubit in length they eat or sell: and those who desire to have the papyrus at its very best bake it in an oven heated red-hot, and then eat it.

The same however no longer lead the way as before, but the lead comes now to the females, and they leading the way in shoals do just as the males did, that is to say they shed forth their eggs by a few grains at a time, and the males coming after swallow them up. Now these grains are fish, and from the grains which survive and are not swallowed, the fish grow which afterwards are bred up. Now those of the fish which are caught as they swim out to sea are found to be rubbed on the left side of the head, but those which are caught as they swim up again are rubbed on the right side. This happens to them because as they swim down to the sea they keep close to the land on the left side of the river, and again as they swim up they keep to the same side, approaching and touching the bank as much as they can, for fear doubtless of straying from their course by reason of the stream.

In the preceding year, when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> goes down, the fish first lay eggs in the mud and then retire with the last of the retreating waters; and when the time comes round again, and the water once more comes over the land, from these eggs forthwith are produced the fishes of which I speak. </p>                        </div>

In truth however they lacked the power to give <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> back; and the Hellenes did not believe them, though they spoke the truth; because, as I declare my opinion, the divine power was purposing to cause them utterly to perish, and so make it evident to men that for great wrongs great also are the chastisements which come from the gods.

This king, they said, got great wealth of silver, which none of the kings born after him could surpass or even come near to; and wishing to store his wealth in safety he caused to be built a chamber of stone, one of the walls whereof was towards the outside of his palace: and the builder of this, having a design against it, contrived as follows, that is, he disposed one of the stones in such a manner that it could be taken out easily from the wall either by two men or even by one. So when the chamber was finished, the king stored his money in it, and after some time the builder, being near the end of his life, called to him his sons (for he had two) and to them he related how he had contrived in building the treasury of the king, and all in forethought for them, that they might have ample means of living. And when he had clearly set forth to them everything concerning the taking out of the stone, he gave them the measurements, saying that if they paid heed to this matter they would be stewards of the king's treasury. So he ended his life, and his sons made no long delay in setting to work, but went to the palace by night, and having found the stone in the wall of the chamber they dealt with it easily and carried forth for themselves great quantity of the wealth within. (b) And the king happening to open the chamber, he marvelled when he saw the vessels falling short of the full amount, and he did not know on whom he should lay the blame, since the seals were unbroken and the chamber had been close shut; but when upon his opening the chamber a second and a third time the money was each time seen to be diminished, for the thieves did not slacken in their assaults upon it, he did as follows: — having ordered traps to be made he set these round about the vessels in which the money was; and when the thieves had come as at former times and one of them had entered, then so soon as he came near to one of the vessels he was straightway caught in the trap: and when he perceived in what evil case he was, straightway calling his brother he showed him what the matter was, and bade him enter as quickly as possible and cut off his head, for fear lest being seen and known he might bring about the destruction of his brother also. And to the other it seemed that he spoke well, and he was persuaded and did so; and fitting the stone into its place he departed home bearing with him the head of his brother. (c) Now when it became day, the king entered into the chamber and was very greatly amazed, seeing the body of the thief held in the trap without his head, and the chamber unbroken, with no way to come in or go out: and being at a loss he hung up the dead body of the thief upon the wall and set guards there, with charge if they saw any one weeping or bewailing himself to seize him and bring him before the king. And when the dead body had been hung up, the mother was greatly grieved, and speaking with the son who survived she enjoined him, in whatever way he could, to contrive means by which he might take down and bring home the body of his dead brother; and if he should neglect to do this, she earnestly threatened that she would go and give information to the king that he had the money. (d) So as the mother dealt hardly with the surviving son, and he though saying many things to her did not persuade her, he contrived for his purpose a device as follows: — Providing himself with <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> he filled some skins with wine and laid them upon the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a>, and after that he drove them along: and when he came opposite to those who were guarding the corpse hung up, he drew towards him two or three of the necks of the skins and loosened the cords with which they were tied. Then when the wine was running out, he began to beat his head and cry out loudly, as if he did not know to which of the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> he should first turn; and when the guards saw the wine flowing out in streams, they ran together to the road with drinking vessels in their hands and collected the wine that was poured out, counting it so much gain; and he abused them all violently, making as if he were angry, but when the guards tried to appease him, after a time he feigned to be pacified and to abate his anger, and at length he drove his <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> out of the road and began to set their loads right. Then more talk arose among them, and one or two of them made jests at him and brought him to laugh with them; and in the end he made them a present of one of the skins in addition to what they had. Upon that they lay down there without more ado, being minded to drink, and they took him into their company and invited him to remain with them and join them in their drinking: so he (as may be supposed) was persuaded and stayed. Then as they in their drinking bade him welcome in a friendly manner, he made a present to them also of another of the skins; and so at length having drunk liberally the guards became completely intoxicated; and being overcome by sleep they went to bed on the spot where they had been drinking. He then, as it was now far on in the night, first took down the body of his brother, and then in mockery shaved the right cheeks of all the guards; and after that he put the dead body upon the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> and drove them away home, having accomplished that which was enjoined him by his mother. (e) Upon this the king, when it was reported to him that the dead body of the thief had been stolen away, displayed great anger; and desiring by all means that it should be found out who it might be who devised these things, did this (so at least they said, but I do not believe the account), — he caused his own daughter to sit in the stews, and enjoined her to receive all equally, and before having commerce with any one to compel him to tell her what was the most cunning and what the most unholy deed which had been done by him in all his life-time; and whosoever should relate that which had happened about the thief, him she must seize and not let him go out. Then as she was doing that which was enjoined by her father, the thief, hearing for what purpose this was done and having a desire to get the better of the king in resource, did thus: — from the body of one lately dead he cut off the arm at the shoulder and went with it under his mantle: and having gone in to the daughter of the king, and being asked that which the others also were asked, he related that he had done the most unholy deed when he cut off the head of his brother, who had been caught in a trap in the king's treasure-chamber, and the most cunning deed in that he made drunk the guards and took down the dead body of his brother hanging up; and she when she heard it tried to take hold of him, but the thief held out to her in the darkness the arm of the corpse, which she grasped and held, thinking that she was holding the arm of the man himself; but the thief left it in her hands and departed, escaping through the door. (f) Now when this also was reported to the king, he was at first amazed at the ready invention and daring of the fellow, and then afterwards he sent round to all the cities and made proclamation granting a free pardon to the thief, and also promising a great reward if he would come into his presence. The thief accordingly trusting to the proclamation came to the king, and <a href=/people/6876 target=_blank>Rhampsinitos</a> greatly marvelled at him, and gave him this daughter of his to wife, counting him to be the most knowing of all men; for as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> were distinguished from all other men, so was he from the other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>. </p>                        </div>

For if these also, like <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> the son of <a href=/people/495 target=_blank>Amphitryon</a>, had appeared before all men's eyes and had lived their lives to old age in Hellas, I mean <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a> the son of <a href=/people/205 target=_blank>Semele</a> and <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a> the son of <a href=/people/264 target=_blank>Penelope</a>, then one would have said that these also had been born mere men, having the names of those gods who had come into being long before: but as it is, with regard to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a> the Hellenes say that as soon as he was born <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> sewed him up in his thigh and carried him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000LNys class=place long=33.975 lat=28.539>Nysa</a>, which is above <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> in the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>; and as to <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a>, they cannot say whither he went after he was born.

The upper set of chambers we ourselves saw, going through them, and we tell of them having looked upon them with our own eyes; but the chambers under ground we heard about only; for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> who had charge of them were not willing on any account to show them, saying that here were the sepulchres of the kings who had first built this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/293309SLab class=place long=30.8987 lat=29.2742>labyrinth</a> and of the sacred crocodiles.

Over the whole of these is a roof made of stone like the walls; and the walls are covered with figures carved upon them, each court being surrounded with pillars of white stone fitted together most perfectly; and at the end of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/293309SLab class=place long=30.8987 lat=29.2742>labyrinth</a>, by the corner of it, there is a pyramid of forty fathoms, upon which large figures are carved, and to this there is a way made under ground. </p>                        </div>

Thus the pyramids are a hundred fathoms high; and these hundred fathoms are equal to a furlong of six hundred feet, the fathom being measured as six feet or four cubits, the feet being four palms each, and the cubits six. The water in the lake does not come from the place where it is, for the country there is very deficient in water, but it has been brought thither from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> by a canal: and for six months the water flows into the lake, and for six months out into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> again; and whenever it flows out, then for the six months it brings into the royal treasury a talent of silver a day from the fish which are caught, and twenty pounds when the water comes in. </p>                        </div>

There certain thieves formed a design once to carry away the wealth of Sardanapallos son of <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninos</a>, the king, which wealth was very great and was kept in treasure-houses under the earth. Accordingly they began from their own dwelling, and making estimate of their direction they dug under ground towards the king's palace; and the earth which was brought out of the excavation they used to carry away, when night came on, to the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a> which flows by the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363432UNin class=place long=43.1523 lat=36.3578>Nineveh</a>, until at last they accomplished that which they desired.

There is in this sacred enclosure a temple of <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a> made of one single stone as regards both height and length, and of which all the walls are in these two directions equal, each being forty cubits; and for the covering in of the roof there lies another stone upon the top, the cornice measuring four cubits. </p>                        </div>

And he answered them thus: They who have bows stretch them at such time as they wish to use them, and when they have finished using them they loose them again; for if they were stretched tight always they would break, so that the men would not be able to use them when they needed them. So also is the state of man: if he should always be in earnest and not relax himself for sport at the due time, he would either go mad or be struck with stupor before he was aware; and knowing this well, I distribute a portion of the time to each of the two ways of living.

Having, I say, this cause of quarrel, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> urged <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a> on by his counsel bidding him ask <a href=/people/424 target=_blank>Amasis</a> for his daughter, in order that he might either be grieved if he gave her, or if he refused to give her, might offend <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a>. So <a href=/people/424 target=_blank>Amasis</a>, who was vexed by the power of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and afraid of it, knew neither how to give nor how to refuse: for he was well assured that <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a> did not intend to have her as his wife but as a concubine. So making account of the matter thus, he did as follows: — there was a daughter of <a href=/people/1737 target=_blank>Apries</a> the former king, very tall and comely of form and the only person left of his house, and her name was <a href=/people/4232 target=_blank>Nitetis</a>. This girl <a href=/people/424 target=_blank>Amasis</a> adorned with raiment and with gold, and sent her away to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> as his own daughter: but after a time, when <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a> saluted her calling her by the name of her father, the girl said to him: O king, thou dost not perceive how thou hast been deceived by <a href=/people/424 target=_blank>Amasis</a>; for he adorned me with ornaments and sent me away giving me to thee as his own daughter, whereas in truth I am the daughter of <a href=/people/1737 target=_blank>Apries</a> against whom <a href=/people/424 target=_blank>Amasis</a> rose up with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> and murdered him, who was his lord and master.

Thus he asked, and the other answered as follows: O son of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, my own troubles were too great for me to lament them aloud, but the trouble of my companion was such as called for tears, seeing that he has been deprived of great wealth, and has come to beggary upon the threshold of old age.

Now the Royal Judges are men chosen out from among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, and hold their office until they die or until some injustice is found in them, so long and no longer.

Thus on the one hand they did not tamper with the law for fear of <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a>, and at the same time, that they might not perish themselves in maintaining the law, they found another law beside that which was asked for, which was in favour of him who wished to marry his sisters.

Now of the fact that all men are thus wont to think about their customs, we may judge by many other proofs and more specially by this which follows: — <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareios</a> in the course of his reign summoned those of the Hellenes who were present in his land, and asked them for what price they would consent to eat up their fathers when they died; and they answered that for no price would they do so.

Come back to thy home: cease to torment thyself. Pride is a mischievous possession. Heal not evil with evil. Many prefer that which is reasonable to that which is strictly just; and many ere now in seeking the things of their mother have lost the things of their father. Despotism is an insecure thing, and many desire it: moreover he is now an old man and past his prime. Give not thy good things unto others.

Having been wounded then in the same part where he had formerly struck <a href=/people/360 target=_blank>Apis</a> the god of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, and believing that he had been struck with a mortal blow, <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a> asked what was the name of that town, and they said <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348485UEcb class=place long=48.5166 lat=34.8054>Agbatana</a>. Now even before this he had been informed by the Oracle at the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312307UBou class=place long=30.744 lat=31.1963>Buto</a> that in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348485UEcb class=place long=48.5166 lat=34.8054>Agbatana</a> he should bring his life to an end: and he supposed that he should die of old age in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348485UEcb class=place long=48.5166 lat=34.8054>Agbatana</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a>, where was his chief seat of power; but the oracle, it appeared, meant in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348485UEcb class=place long=48.5166 lat=34.8054>Agbatana</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>. So when by questioning now he learnt the name of the town, being struck with fear both by the calamity caused by the Magian and at the same time by the wound, he came to his right mind, and understanding the meaning of the oracle he said: Here it is fated that <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a> the son of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> shall end his life. </p>                        </div>

Being in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> I saw a vision in my sleep, which I would I had never seen, and it seemed to me that a messenger came from home and reported to me that <a href=/people/1100 target=_blank>Smerdis</a> was sitting upon the royal throne and had touched the heaven with his head. Fearing then lest I should be deprived of my power by my brother, I acted quickly rather than wisely; for it seems that it is not possible for man to avert that which is destined to come to pass. I therefore, fool that I was, sent away <a href=/people/1963 target=_blank>Prexaspes</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus class=place long=48.247 lat=32.191>Susa</a> to kill <a href=/people/1100 target=_blank>Smerdis</a>; and when this great evil had been done, I lived in security, never considering the danger that some other man might at some time rise up against me, now that <a href=/people/1100 target=_blank>Smerdis</a> had been removed: and altogether missing the mark of that which was about to happen, I have both made myself the murderer of my brother, when there was no need, and I have been deprived none the less of the kingdom; for it was in fact <a href=/people/1100 target=_blank>Smerdis</a> the Magian of whom the divine power declared to me beforehand in the vision that he should rise up against me. So then, as I say, this deed has been done by me, and ye must imagine that ye no longer have <a href=/people/1100 target=_blank>Smerdis</a> the son of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> alive: but it is in truth the <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magians</a> who are masters of your kingdom, he whom I left as guardian of my household and his brother <a href=/people/1100 target=_blank>Smerdis</a>. The man then who ought above all others to have taken vengeance on my behalf for the dishonour which I have suffered from the <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magians</a>, has ended his life by an unholy death received from the hands of those who were his nearest of kin; and since he is no more, it becomes most needful for me, as the thing next best of those which remain, to charge you, O <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, with that which dying I desire should be done for me. This then I lay upon you, calling upon the gods of the royal house to witness it, — upon you and most of all upon those of the <a href=/people/3313 target=_blank>Achaemenidai</a> who are present here, — that ye do not permit the return of the chief power to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, but that if they have acquired it by craft, by craft they be deprived of it by you, or if they have conquered it by any kind of force, by force and by a strong hand ye recover it. And if ye do this, may the earth bring forth her produce and may your wives and your <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> be fruitful, while ye remain free for ever; but if ye do not recover the power nor attempt to recover it, I pray that curses the contrary of these blessings may come upon you, and moreover that each man of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> may have an end to his life like that which has come upon me.

Know ye however that the guards which are set are not difficult to pass: for in the first place, we being what we are, there is no one who will not let us go by, partly, as may be supposed, from having respect for us, and partly also perhaps from fear; and secondly I have myself a most specious pretext by means of which we may pass by; for I shall say that I am just now come from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> land and desire to declare to the king a certain message from my father: for where it is necessary that a lie be spoken, let it be spoken; seeing that we all aim at the same object, both they who lie and they who always speak the truth; those lie whenever they are likely to gain anything by persuading with their lies, and these tell the truth in order that they may draw to themselves gain by the truth, and that things may be entrusted to them more readily. Thus, while practising different ways, we aim all at the same thing. If however they were not likely to make any gain by it, the truth-teller would lie and the liar would speak the truth, with indifference. Whosoever then of the door-keepers shall let us pass by of his own free will, for him it shall be the better afterwards; but whosoever shall endeavour to oppose our passage, let him then and there be marked as our enemy, and after that let us push in and set about our work. </p>                        </div>

Ye saw the insolent temper of <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a>, to what lengths it went, and ye have had experience also of the insolence of the Magian: and how should the rule of one alone be a well-ordered thing, seeing that the monarch may do what he desires without rendering any account of his acts? Even the best of all men, if he were placed in this disposition, would be caused by it to change from his wonted disposition: for insolence is engendered in him by the good things which he possesses, and envy is implanted in man from the beginning; and having these two things, he has all vice: for he does many deeds of reckless wrong, partly moved by insolence proceeding from satiety, and partly by envy. And yet a despot at least ought to have been free from envy, seeing that he has all manner of good things. He is however naturally in just the opposite temper towards his subjects; for he grudges to the nobles that they should survive and live, but delights in the basest of citizens, and he is more ready than any other man to receive calumnies. Then of all things he is the most inconsistent; for if you express admiration of him moderately, he is offended that no very great court is paid to him, whereas if you pay court to him extravagantly, he is offended with you for being a flatterer. And the most important matter of all is that which I am about to say: — he disturbs the customs handed down from our fathers, he is a ravisher of women, and he puts men to death without trial. On the other hand the rule of many has first a name attaching to it which is the fairest of all names, that is to say 'Equality'; next, the multitude does none of those things which the monarch does: offices of state are exercised by lot, and the magistrates are compelled to render account of their action: and finally all matters of deliberation are referred to the public assembly. I therefore give as my opinion that we let monarchy go and increase the power of the multitude; for in the many is contained everything. </p>                        </div>

In an oligarchy however it happens often that many, while practising virtue with regard to the commonwealth, have strong private enmities arising among themselves; for as each man desires to be himself the leader and to prevail in counsels, they come to great enmities with one another, whence arise factions among them, and out of the factions comes murder, and from murder results the rule of one man; and thus it is shown in this instance by how much that is the best. Again, when the people rules, it is impossible that corruption should not arise, and when corruption arises in the commonwealth, there arise among the corrupt men not enmities but strong ties of friendship: for they who are acting corruptly to the injury of the commonwealth put their heads together secretly to do so. And this continues so until at last some one takes the leadership of the people and stops the course of such men. By reason of this the man of whom I speak is admired by the people, and being so admired he suddenly appears as monarch. Thus he too furnishes herein an example to prove that the rule of one is the best thing. Finally, to sum up all in a single word, whence arose the liberty which we possess, and who gave it to us? Was it a gift of the people or of an oligarchy or of a monarch? I therefore am of opinion that we, having been set free by one man, should preserve that form of rule, and in other respects also that we should not annul the customs of our fathers which are ordered well; for that is not the better way. </p>                        </div>

Thus it is in this case; whereas the lioness, which is the strongest and most courageous of creatures, produces one cub once only in her life; for when she produces young she casts out her womb together with her young; and the cause of it is this: — when the cub being within the mother begins to move about, then having claws by far sharper than those of any other beast he tears the womb, and as he grows larger he proceeds much further in his scratching: at last the time of birth approaches and there is now nothing at all left of it in a sound condition. </p>                        </div>

Those therefore who in former times had been wont to make use of the water, not being able now to make use of it are in great trouble: for during the winter they have rain from heaven, as also other men have, but in the summer they desire to use the water when they sow millet and sesame seed.

Then they strangle and bury in the remaining space of the tomb one of the king's mistresses, his cup-bearer, his cook, his horse-keeper, his attendant, and his bearer of messages, and also <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and a first portion of all things else, and cups of gold; for silver they do not use at all, nor yet bronze. Having thus done they all join together to pile up a great mound, vying with one another and zealously endeavouring to make it as large as possible. </p>                        </div>

So when he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a> he went down into the region called <a href=/people/4561 target=_blank>Hylaia</a> (this is along by the side of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415317RADr class=place long=31.65 lat=46.5>Racecourse</a> of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> and is quite full, as it happens, of trees of all kinds), — into this, I say, <a href=/people/606 target=_blank>Anacharsis</a> went down, and proceeded to perform all the ceremonies of the festival in honour of the goddess, with a kettle-drum and with images hung about himself. And one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> perceived him doing this and declared it to <a href=/people/8276 target=_blank>Saulios</a> the king; and the king came himself also, and when he saw <a href=/people/606 target=_blank>Anacharsis</a> doing this, he shot him with an arrow and killed him.

He then when he perceived that which was being done to his hurt and for what reason it was being done, fled for refuge to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>; and <a href=/people/5138 target=_blank>Octamasades</a> being informed of this, proceeded to march upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>.

Thou art my sister's son and thou hast in thy power my brother. Do thou give him back to me, and I will deliver to thee thy brother <a href=/people/2934 target=_blank>Skyles</a>: and let us not either of us set our armies in peril, either thou or I. Thus <a href=/people/1252 target=_blank>Sitalkes</a> proposed to him by a herald; for there was with <a href=/people/5138 target=_blank>Octamasades</a> a brother of <a href=/people/1252 target=_blank>Sitalkes</a>, who had gone into exile for fear of him. And <a href=/people/5138 target=_blank>Octamasades</a> agreed to this, and by giving up his own mother's brother to <a href=/people/1252 target=_blank>Sitalkes</a> he received his brother <a href=/people/2934 target=_blank>Skyles</a> in exchange: and <a href=/people/1252 target=_blank>Sitalkes</a> when he received his brother led him away as a prisoner, but <a href=/people/5138 target=_blank>Octamasades</a> cut off the head of <a href=/people/2934 target=_blank>Skyles</a> there upon the spot.

So a great multitude of arrow-heads was brought, and he resolved to make of them a memorial and to leave it behind him: from these then, they said, he made this bronze bowl and dedicated it in this place Exampaios. </p>                        </div>

At a yearly festival of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athene</a> their maidens take their stand in two parties and fight against one another with stones and staves, and they say that in doing so they are fulfilling the rites handed down by their fathers for the divinity who was sprung from that land, whom we call <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athene</a>: and those of the maidens who die of the wounds received they call false-maidens. But before they let them begin the fight they do this: — all join together and equip the maiden who is judged to be the fairest on each occasion, with a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a> helmet and with full Hellenic armour, and then causing her to go up into a chariot they conduct her round the lake.

There are there several pools, and the largest of them measures seventy feet each way and is two fathoms in depth.

This they pour into a pit dug near the pool; and when they have collected a large quantity, then they pour it into the jars from the pit: and whatever thing falls into the pool goes under ground and reappears in the sea, which is distant about four furlongs from the pool.

Then again they who occupy that continent have good things in such quantity as not all the other nations of the world together possess; first gold, then silver and bronze and embroidered garments and beasts of burden and slaves; all which ye might have for yourselves, if ye so desired. And the nations moreover dwell in such order one after the other as I shall declare: — the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=ethnic long=27.3 lat=38>Ionians</a> here; and next to them the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=ethnic long=28 lat=38.5>Lydians</a>, who not only dwell in a fertile land, but are also exceedingly rich in gold and silver, — and as he said this he pointed to the map of the <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>, which he carried with him engraved upon the tablet, — and here next to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=ethnic long=28 lat=38.5>Lydians</a>, continued <a href=/people/647 target=_blank>Aristagoras</a>, are the Eastern <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a>, who have both the greatest number of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> of any people that I know, and also the most abundant crops.

Now one of these men, named <a href=/people/393 target=_blank>Amphion</a>, had a daughter born to him who was lame, and her name was Labda. This daughter, since none of the <a href=/people/12119 target=_blank>Bacchiadai</a> wished to marry her, was taken to wife by <a href=/people/2203 target=_blank>Aetion</a> the son of <a href=/people/1996 target=_blank>Echecrates</a>, who was of the deme of <a href=/people/2341 target=_blank>Petra</a>, but by original descent a <a href=/people/721 target=_blank>Lapith</a> and of the race of Caineus. Neither from this wife nor from another were children born to him, therefore he set out to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> to inquire about offspring; and as he entered, forthwith the prophetess addressed him in these lines: 'Much to be honoured art thou, yet none doth render thee honour.

This answer given to <a href=/people/2203 target=_blank>Aetion</a> was by some means reported to the <a href=/people/12119 target=_blank>Bacchiadai</a>, to whom the oracle which had come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a> before this was not intelligible, an oracle which had reference to the same thing as that of <a href=/people/2203 target=_blank>Aetion</a> and said thus: 'An <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> conceives in the rocks and shall bear a ravening <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>, Strong and fierce to devour, who the knees of many shall loosen. Ponder this well in your minds, I bid you, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=ethnic long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthians</a>, whose dwelling Lies about fair <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229WPei class=place long=22.87585 lat=37.88935>Peirene</a>'s spring and in craggy <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>.' This oracle, I say, having come before to the <a href=/people/12119 target=_blank>Bacchiadai</a> was obscure; but afterwards when they heard that which had come to <a href=/people/2203 target=_blank>Aetion</a>, forthwith they understood the former also, that it was in accord with that of <a href=/people/2203 target=_blank>Aetion</a>; and understanding this one also they kept quiet, desiring to destroy the offspring which should be born to <a href=/people/2203 target=_blank>Aetion</a>. Then, so soon as his wife bore a child, they sent ten of their own number to the deme in which <a href=/people/2203 target=_blank>Aetion</a> had his dwelling, to slay the child; and when these had come to <a href=/people/2341 target=_blank>Petra</a> and had passed into the court of <a href=/people/2203 target=_blank>Aetion</a>'s house, they asked for the child; and Labda, not knowing anything of the purpose for which they had come, and supposing them to be asking for the child on account of friendly feeling towards its father, brought it and placed it in the hands of one of them. Now they, it seems, had resolved by the way that the first of them who received the child should dash it upon the ground. However, when Labda brought and gave it, it happened by divine providence that the child smiled at the man who had received it; and when he perceived this, a feeling of compassion prevented him from killing it, and having this compassion he delivered it to the next man, and he to the third. Thus it passed through the hands of all the ten, delivered from one to another, since none of them could bring himself to destroy its life.

Then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> following the suggestion of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372218RMes class=demonym long=21.8 lat=37.2>Messenian</a> watched the mother of the sons of <a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemos</a> and found that she gave honour thus to the first-born both in feeding and in washing; for she did not know with that design she was being watched.

Do thou therefore, I pray thee, receive the money, and take and keep these tallies; and whosoever shall ask for the money back having the tokens answering to these, to him do thou restore it.' (b) The stranger who had come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=place long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletos</a> said so much; and <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucos</a> accepted the deposit on the terms proposed. Then after a long time had gone by, there came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> the sons of him who had deposited the money with <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucos</a>; and they came to speech with <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucos</a>, and producing the tokens asked for the money to be given back: but he repulsed them answering them again thus: 'I do not remember the matter, nor does my mind bring back to me any knowledge of those things whereof ye speak; but I desire to recollect and do all that is just; for if I received it, I desire to restore it honestly; and if on the other hand I did not receive it at all, I will act towards you in accordance with the customs of the Hellenes: therefore I defer the settling of the matter with you for three months from now.' (c) The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=ethnic long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Milesians</a> accordingly went away grieved, for they supposed that they had been robbed of the money; but <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucos</a> set forth to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> to consult the Oracle: and when he inquired of the Oracle whether he should rob them of the money by an oath, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> prophetess rebuked him with these lines: '<a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucos</a>, thou, <a href=/people/968 target=_blank>Epikydes</a>' son, yea, this for the moment, This, to conquer their word by an oath and to rob, is more gainful. Swear, since the lot of death waits also for him who swears truly. But know thou that <a href=/people/2524 target=_blank>Oath</a> has a son, one nameless and handless and footless, Yet without feet he pursues, without hands he seizes, and wholly He shall destroy the race and the house of the man who offendeth. But for the man who swears truly his race is the better hereafter.' Having heard this <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucos</a> entreated that the god would pardon him for that which he had said, but the prophetess said that to make trial of the god and to do the deed were things equivalent. (d) <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucos</a> then, having sent for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=ethnic long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Milesians</a>, gave back to them the money: but the reason for which, O <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, I set forth to relate to you this story, shall now be told.

With a view to this gift, its nature being such, <a href=/people/564 target=_blank>Alcmaion</a> made preparations and used appliances as follows: — he put on a large tunic leaving a deep fold in the tunic to hang down in front, and he draw on his feet the widest boots which he could find, and so went to the treasury to which they conducted him. Then he fell upon a heap of gold-dust, and first he packed in by the side of his legs so much of the gold as his boots would contain, and then he filled the whole fold of the tunic with the gold and sprinkled some of the gold dust on the hair of his head and took some into his mouth, and having so done he came forth out of the treasury, with difficulty dragging along his boots and resembling anything in the world rather than a man; for his mouth was stuffed full, and every part of him was swelled out: and upon <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> came laughter when he saw him, and he not only gave him all that, but also presented him in addition with more not inferior in value to that.

Wherefore I have assembled you together now, in order that I may communicate to you that which I have it in my mind to do. (b) I design to yoke the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a> with a bridge, and to march an army through Europe against Hellas, in order that I may take vengeance on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> for all the things which they have done both to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and to my father. Ye saw how my father <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareios</a> also was purposing to make an expedition against these men; but he has ended his life and did not succeed in taking vengeance upon them. I however, on behalf of him and also of the other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, will not cease until I have conquered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> and burnt it with fire; seeing that they did wrong unprovoked to me and to my father. First they went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=place long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardis</a>, having come with <a href=/people/647 target=_blank>Aristagoras</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=person long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Milesian</a> our slave, and they set fire to the sacred groves and the sanctuaries; and then secondly, what things they did to us when we disembarked in their land, at the time when <a href=/people/1263 target=_blank>Datis</a> and <a href=/people/1879 target=_blank>Artaphrenes</a> were commanders of our army, ye all know well, as I think. (c) For these reasons I have resolved to make an expedition against them, and reckoning I find in the matter so many good things as ye shall hear: — if we shall subdue these and the neighbours of these, who dwell in the land of <a href=/people/170 target=_blank>Pelops</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=person long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a>, we shall cause the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> land to have the same boundaries as the heaven of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>; since in truth upon no land will the sun look down which borders ours, but I with your help shall make all the lands into one land, having passed through the whole extent of Europe. For I am informed that things are so, namely that there is no city of men nor any race of human beings remaining, which will be able to come to a contest with us, when those whom I just now mentioned have been removed out of the way. Thus both those who have committed wrong against us will have the yoke of slavery, and also those who have not committed wrong. (d) And ye will please me best if ye do this: — whensoever I shall signify to you the time at which ye ought to come, ye must appear every one of you with zeal for the service; and whosoever shall come with a force best equipped, to him I will give gifts such as are accounted in our land to be the most honourable. Thus must these things be done: but that I may not seem to you to be following my own counsel alone, I propose the matter for discussion, bidding any one of you who desires it, declare his opinion. </p>                        </div>

(a) Of what should we be afraid? — what gathering of numbers, or what resources of money? for their manner of fight we know, and as for their resources, we know that they are feeble; and we have moreover subdued already their sons, those I mean who are settled in our land and are called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=ethnic long=27.3 lat=38>Ionians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390271RAio class=ethnic long=27.1 lat=39>Aiolians</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor class=ethnic long=22.4 lat=38.7>Dorians</a>. Moreover I myself formerly made trial of marching against these men, being commanded thereto by thy father; and although I marched as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, and fell but little short of coming to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> itself, no man came to oppose me in fight. (b) And yet it is true that the Hellenes make wars, but (as I am informed) very much without wise consideration, by reason of obstinacy and want of skill: for when they have proclaimed war upon one another, they find out first the fairest and smoothest place, and to this they come down and fight; so that even the victors depart from the fight with great loss, and as to the vanquished, of them I make no mention at all, for they are utterly destroyed. They ought however, being men who speak the same language, to make use of heralds and messengers and so to take up their differences and settle them in any way rather than by battles; but if they must absolutely war with one another, they ought to find out each of them that place in which they themselves are hardest to overcome, and here to make their trial. Therefore the Hellenes, since they use no good way, when I had marched as far as the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, did not come to the resolution of fighting with me. (c) Who then is likely to set himself against thee, O king, offering war, when thou art leading both all the multitudes of Asia and the whole number of the ships? I for my part am of opinion that the power of the Hellenes has not attained to such a pitch of boldness: but if after all I should prove to be deceived in my judgment, and they stirred up by inconsiderate folly should come to battle with us, they would learn that we are the best of all men in the matters of war. However that may be, let not anything be left untried; for nothing comes of itself, but from trial all things are wont to come to men. </p>                        </div>

Now supposing it chance that we are worsted either by land or by sea, or even both, for the men are reported to be valiant in fight, (and we may judge for ourselves that it is so, since the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> by themselves destroyed that great army which came with <a href=/people/1263 target=_blank>Datis</a> and <a href=/people/1879 target=_blank>Artaphrenes</a> to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> land), — suppose however that they do not succeed in both, yet if they shall attack with their ships and conquer in a sea-fight, and then sail to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a> and break up the bridge, this of itself, O king, will prove to be a great peril. (c) Not however by any native wisdom of my own do I conjecture that this might happen: I am conjecturing only such a misfortune as all but came upon us at the former time, when thy father, having yoked the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411291WBos class=place long=29.0753 lat=41.1194>Bosphorus</a> of Thracia and made a bridge over the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>, had crossed over to go against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>. At that time the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> used every means of entreaty to persuade the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=ethnic long=27.3 lat=38>Ionians</a> to break up the passage, to whom it had been entrusted to guard the bridges of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a>. At that time, if <a href=/people/887 target=_blank>Histiaios</a> the despot of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=place long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletos</a> had followed the opinion of the other despots and had not made opposition to them, the power of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> would have been brought to an end. Yet it is a fearful thing even to hear it reported that the whole power of the king had come to depend upon one human creature. (d) Do not thou therefore propose to go into any such danger when there is no need, but do as I say: — at the present time dissolve this assembly; and afterwards at whatever time it shall seem good to thee, when thou hast considered prudently with thyself, proclaim that which seems to thee best: for good counsel I hold to be a very great gain; since even if anything shall prove adverse, the counsel which has been taken is no less good, though it has been defeated by fortune; while he who took counsel badly at first, if good fortune should go with him has lighted on a prize by chance, but none the less for that his counsel was bad. (e) Thou seest how God strikes with thunderbolts the creatures which stand above the rest and suffers them not to make a proud show; while those which are small do not provoke him to jealousy: thou seest also how he hurls his darts ever at those buildings which are the highest and those trees likewise; for God is wont to cut short all those things which stand out above the rest. Thus also a numerous army is destroyed by one of few men in some such manner as this, namely when God having become jealous of them casts upon them panic or thundering from heaven, then they are destroyed utterly and not as their worth deserves; for God suffers not any other to have high thoughts save only himself. (f) Moreover the hastening of any matter breeds disasters, whence great losses are wont to be produced; but in waiting there are many good things contained, as to which, if they do not appear to be good at first, yet one will find them to be so in course of time. (g) To thee, O king, I give this counsel: but thou son of <a href=/people/1536 target=_blank>Gobryas</a>, <a href=/people/252 target=_blank>Mardonios</a>, cease speaking foolish words about the Hellenes, since they in no way deserve to be spoken of with slight; for by uttering slander against the Hellenes thou art stirring the king himself to make an expedition, and it is to this very end that I think thou art straining all thy endeavour. Let not this be so; for slander is a most grievous thing: in it the wrongdoers are two, and the person who suffers wrong is one. The slanderer does a wrong in that he speaks against one who is not present, the other in that he is persuaded of the thing before he gets certain knowledge of it, and he who is not present when the words are spoken suffers wrong in the matter thus, — both because he has been slandered by the one and because he has been believed to be bad by the other. (h) However, if it be absolutely needful to make an expedition against these men, come, let the king himself remain behind in the abodes of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, and let us both set to the wager our sons; and then do thou lead an army by thyself, choosing for thyself the men whom thou desirest, and taking an army as large as thou thinkest good: and if matters turn out for the king as thou sayest, let my sons be slain and let me also be slain in addition to them; but if in the way which I predict, let thy sons suffer this, and with them thyself also, if thou shalt return back. But if thou art not willing to undergo this proof, but wilt by all means lead an army against Hellas, then I say that those who are left behind in this land will hear that <a href=/people/252 target=_blank>Mardonios</a>, after having done a great mischief to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, is torn by <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> and birds, either in the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, or else perchance thou wilt be in the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> (unless indeed this should have come to pass even before that upon the way), and that thou hast at length been made aware against what kind of men thou art persuading the king to march. </p>                        </div>

I however, when I was evil spoken of by thee, was not so much stung with pain for this, as because, when two opinions were laid before the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, the one tending to increase wanton insolence and the other tending to check it and saying that it was a bad thing to teach the soul to endeavour always to have something more than the present possession, — because, I say, when such opinions as these were laid before us, thou didst choose that one which was the more dangerous both for thyself and for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>. (b) And now that thou hast turned to the better counsel, thou sayest that when thou art disposed to let go the expedition against the Hellenes, a dream haunts thee sent by some god, which forbids thee to abandon thy enterprise. Nay, but here too thou dost err, my son, since this is not of the Deity; for the dreams of sleep which come roaming about to men, are of such nature as I shall inform thee, being by many years older than thou. The visions of dreams are wont to hover above us in such form for the most part as the things of which we were thinking during the day; and we in the days preceding were very much occupied with this campaign. (c) If however after all this is not such a thing as I interpret it to be, but is something which is concerned with God, thou hast summed the matter up in that which thou hast said: let it appear, as thou sayest, to me also, as to thee, and give commands. But supposing that it desires to appear to me at all, it is not bound to appear to me any the more if I have thy garments on me than if I have my own, nor any more if I take my rest in thy bed than if I am in thy own; for assuredly this thing, whatever it may be, which appears to thee in thy sleep, is not so foolish as to suppose, when it sees me, that it is thou, judging so because the garments are thine. That however which we must find out now is this, namely if it will hold me in no account, and not think fit to appear to me, whether I have my own garments or whether I have thine, but continue still to haunt thee; for if it shall indeed haunt thee perpetually, I shall myself also be disposed to say that it is of the Deity. But if thou hast resolved that it shall be so, and it is not possible to turn aside this thy resolution, but I must go to sleep in thy bed, then let it appear to me also, when I perform these things: but until then I shall hold to the opinion which I now have. </p>                        </div>

For neither in the sea is there, as I suppose, a harbour anywhere large enough to receive this fleet of thine, if a storm should arise, and to ensure the safety of the ships till it be over; and yet not one alone ought this harbour to be, but there should be such harbours along the whole coast of the continent by which thou sailest; and if there are not harbours to receive thy ships, know that accidents will rule men and not men the accidents.

The land, I say, becomes hostile to thee in this way: — if nothing shall come to oppose thee, the land is hostile to thee by so much the more in proportion as thou shalt advance more, ever stealing on further and further, for there is no satiety of good fortune felt by men: and this I say, that with no one to stand against thee the country traversed, growing more and more as time goes on, will produce for thee famine.

It is better to have good courage about everything and to suffer half the evils which threaten, than to have fear beforehand about everything and not to suffer any evil at all: and if, while contending against everything which is said, thou omit to declare the course which is safe, thou dost incur in these matters the reproach of failure equally with him who says the opposite to this. This then, I say, is evenly balanced: but how should one who is but man know the course which is safe? I think, in no way. To those then who choose to act, for the most part gain is wont to come; but to those who reckon for everything and shrink back, it is not much wont to come. Thou seest the power of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, to what great might it has advanced: if then those who came to be kings before me had had opinions like to thine, or, though not having such opinions, had had such counsellors as thou, thou wouldest never have seen it brought forward to this point. As it is however, by running risks they conducted it on to this: for great power is in general gained by running great risks. We therefore, following their example, are making our march now during the fairest season of the year; and after we have subdued all Europe we shall return back home, neither having met with famine anywhere nor having suffered any other thing which is unpleasant. For first we march bearing with us ourselves great store of food, and secondly we shall possess the corn-crops of all the peoples to whose land and nation we come; and we are making a march now against men who plough the soil, and not against nomad tribes. </p>                        </div>

Come tell me this: — thou sayest that thou wert thyself king of these men; wilt thou therefore consent forthwith to fight with ten men? and yet if your State is such throughout as thou dost describe it, thou their king ought by your laws to stand in array against double as many as another man; that is to say, if each of them is a match for ten men of my army, I expect of thee that thou shouldest be a match for twenty. Thus would be confirmed the report which is made by thee: but if ye, who boast thus greatly are such men and in size so great only as the Hellenes who come commonly to speech with me, thyself included, then beware lest this which has been spoken prove but an empty vaunt. For come, let me examine it by all that is probable: how could a thousand or ten thousand or even fifty thousand, at least if they were all equally free and were not ruled by one man, stand against so great an army? since, as thou knowest, we shall be more than a thousand coming about each one of them, supposing them to be in number five thousand. If indeed they were ruled by one man after our fashion, they might perhaps from fear of him become braver than it was their nature to be, or they might go compelled by the lash to fight with greater numbers, being themselves fewer in number; but if left at liberty, they would do neither of these things: and I for my part suppose that, even if equally matched in numbers, the Hellenes would hardly dare to fight with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> taken alone.

And yet how I am at this present time attached to them by affection thou knowest better than any; seeing that first they took away from me the rank and privileges which came to me from my fathers, and then also they have caused me to be without native land and an exile; but thy father took me up and gave me livelihood and a house to dwell in. Surely it is not to be supposed likely that the prudent man will thrust aside friendliness which is offered to him, but rather that he will accept it with full contentment. And I do not profess that I am able to fight either with ten men or with two, nay, if I had my will, I would not even fight with one; but if there were necessity or if the cause which urged me to the combat were a great one, I would fight most willingly with one of these men who says that he is a match for three of the Hellenes.

It is certain at least that they do whatsoever that master commands; and he commands ever the same thing, that is to say, he bids them not flee out of battle from any multitude of men, but stay in their post and win the victory or lose their life. But if when I say these things I seem to thee to be speaking at random, of other things for the future I prefer to be silent; and at this time I spake only because I was compelled.

Moreover a wall had once been built at this pass, and in old times there was a gate set in it; which wall was built by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=ethnic long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phokians</a>, who were struck with fear because the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> had come from the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394204RThp class=ethnic long=20.4 lat=39.4>Thesprotians</a> to settle in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390271RAio class=demonym long=27.1 lat=39>Aiolian</a> land, the same which they now possess. Since then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a>, as they supposed, were attempting to subdue them, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=ethnic long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phokians</a> guarded themselves against this beforehand; and at that time they let the water of the hot springs run over the passage, that the place might be converted into a ravine, and devised every means that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> might not make invasion of their land. Now the ancient wall had been built long before, and the greater part of it was by that time in ruins from lapse of time; the Hellenes however resolved to set it up again, and at this spot to repel the Barbarian from Hellas: and very near the road there is a village called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388226PAlp class=place long=22.5693 lat=38.8039>Alpenoi</a>, from which the Hellenes counted on getting supplies. </p>                        </div>

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> had been informed before all others that the king was preparing an expedition against Hellas; and thus it happened that they sent to the Oracle at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, where that reply was given them which I reported shortly before this.

When <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> had resolved to make a campaign against Hellas, <a href=/people/475 target=_blank>Demaratos</a>, being in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus class=place long=48.247 lat=32.191>Susa</a> and having been informed of this, had a desire to report it to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>. Now in no other way was he able to signify it, for there was danger that he should be discovered, but he contrived thus, that is to say, he took a folding tablet and scraped off the wax which was upon it, and then he wrote the design of the king upon the wood of the tablet, and having done so he melted the wax and poured it over the writing, so that the tablet (being carried without writing upon it) might not cause any trouble to be given by the keepers of the road. Then when it had arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemon</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> were not able to make conjecture of the matter; until at last, as I am informed, <a href=/people/2412 target=_blank>Gorgo</a>, the daughter of <a href=/people/81 target=_blank>Cleomenes</a> and wife of <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a>, suggested a plan of which she had herself thought, bidding them scrape the wax and they would find writing upon the wood; and doing as she said they found the writing and read it, and after that they sent notice to the other Hellenes.

For hear both ways, and then set them in comparison. If thou engage battle at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a>, thou wilt fight in an open sea, into which it is by no means convenient for us that we go to fight, seeing that we have ships which are heavier and fewer in number than those of the enemy. Then secondly thou wilt give up to destruction <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379235PSal class=place long=23.5408 lat=37.952>Salamis</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=place long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megara</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig class=place long=23.425 lat=37.75>Aigina</a>, even if we have success in all else; for with their fleet will come also the land-army, and thus thou wilt thyself lead them to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a> and wilt risk the safety of all Hellas. If however thou shalt do as I say, thou wilt find therein all the advantages which I shall tell thee of: — in the first place by engaging in a narrow place with few ships against many, if the fighting has that issue which it is reasonable to expect, we shall have very much the better; for to fight a sea-fight in a narrow space is for our advantage, but to fight in a wide open space is for theirs. Then again <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379235PSal class=place long=23.5408 lat=37.952>Salamis</a> will be preserved, whither our children and our wives have been removed for safety; and moreover there is this also secured thereby, to which ye are most of all attached, namely that by remaining here thou wilt fight in defence of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a> as much as if the fight were at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a>; and thou wilt not lead the enemy to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a>, if thou art wise. Then if that which I expect come to pass and we gain a victory with our ships, the Barbarians will not come to you at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a> nor will they advance further than <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, but they will retire in disorder; and we shall be the gainers by the preservation of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=place long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megara</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig class=place long=23.425 lat=37.75>Aigina</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379235PSal class=place long=23.5408 lat=37.952>Salamis</a>, at which place too an oracle tells us that we shall get the victory over our enemies.

And why must thou needs run the risk of sea-battles? Hast thou not <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> in thy possession, for the sake of which thou didst set forth on thy march, and also the rest of Hellas? and no man stands in thy way to resist, but those who did stand against thee came off as it was fitting that they should. (b) Now the manner in which I think the affairs of thy adversaries will have their issue, I will declare. If thou do not hasten to make a sea-fight, but keep thy ships here by the land, either remaining here thyself or even advancing on to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a>, that which thou hast come to do, O master, will easily be effected; for the Hellenes are not able to hold out against thee for any long time, but thou wilt soon disperse them and they will take flight to their several cities: since neither have they provisions with them in this island, as I am informed, nor is it probable that if thou shalt march thy land-army against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a>, they who have come from thence will remain still; for these will have no care to fight a battle in defence of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. (c) If however thou hasten to fight forthwith, I fear that damage done to the fleet may ruin the land-army also. Moreover, O king, consider also this, that the servants of good men are apt to grow bad, but those of bad men good; and thou, who art of all men the best, hast bad servants, namely those who are reckoned as allies, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=ethnic long=33 lat=35>Cyprians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=ethnic long=34.01 lat=37.01>Kilikians</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=ethnic long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylians</a>, in whom there is no profit. </p>                        </div>

While she was being pursued by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> ship she charged with full career against a ship of her own side manned by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367288UKal class=ethnic long=28.836 lat=36.7503>Calyndians</a> and in which the king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367288UKal class=ethnic long=28.836 lat=36.7503>Calyndians</a> Damasithymos was embarked.

It came however to be found out that <a href=/people/2456 target=_blank>Timoxeinos</a> was attempting by treachery to give up <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402233UPot class=place long=23.3278 lat=40.1937>Potidaia</a>; for <a href=/people/667 target=_blank>Artabazos</a>, shooting an arrow at the place agreed upon, missed this spot and struck a man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402233UPot class=person long=23.3278 lat=40.1937>Potidaia</a> in the shoulder; and when he was struck, a crowd came about him, as is apt to happen when there is fighting, and they forthwith took the arrow and having discovered the paper carried it to the commanders. Now there was present an allied force of the other men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400236LPal class=place long=23.41 lat=40.06>Pallene</a> also. Then when the commanders had read the paper and discovered who was guilty of the treachery, they resolved not openly to convict <a href=/people/2456 target=_blank>Timoxeinos</a> of treachery, for the sake of the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399236PSki class=place long=23.56402 lat=39.93675>Skione</a>, lest the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399236PSki class=place long=23.56402 lat=39.93675>Skione</a> should be esteemed traitors for all time to come. </p>                        </div>

And whenever she baked, the loaf of the boy their servant, namely <a href=/people/2339 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a>, became double as large as by nature it should be. When this happened constantly in the same manner, she told it to her husband, and he when he heard it conceived forthwith that this was a portent and tended to something great. He summoned the farm-servants therefore, and gave notice to them to depart out of his land; and they said that it was right that before they went forth they should receive the wages which were due. Now it chanced that the sun was shining into the house down through the opening which received the smoke, and the king when he heard about the wages said, being infatuated by a divine power: I pay you then this for wages, and it is such as ye deserve, pointing to the sunlight. So then Gauanes and Aeropos the elder brothers stood struck with amazement when they heard this, but the boy, who happened to have in his hand a knife, said these words: We accept, O king, that which thou dost give; and he traced a line with his knife round the sunlight on the floor of the house, and having traced the line round he thrice drew of the sunlight into his bosom, and after that he departed both himself and his fellows. </p>                        </div>

If therefore ye do not make an agreement forthwith, when they offer you great things as the terms on which they are willing to make a treaty, I have fear on your behalf, seeing that ye dwell more upon the highway than any of your allies, and are exposed ever to destruction alone, the land which ye possess being parted off from the rest and lying between the armies which are contending together.

For many and great are the reasons which hinder us from doing this, even though we should desire it; first and greatest the images and houses of the gods set on fire or reduced to ruin, which we must necessarily avenge to the very utmost rather than make an agreement with him who did these deeds; then secondly there is the bond of Hellenic race, by which we are of one blood and of one speech, the common temples of the gods and the common sacrifices, the manners of life which are the same for all; to these it would not be well that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> should become traitors.

Now therefore, with full conviction this is so, send out an army as speedily as ye may: for, as we conjecture, the Barbarian will be here invading our land at no far distant time but so soon as he shall be informed of the message sent, namely that we shall do none of those things which he desired of us. Therefore before he arrives here in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, it is fitting that ye come to our rescue quickly in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a>.

Thus sincerely is our duty done towards the Hellenes: but as for you, after having come then to great dread lest we should make a treaty with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, so soon as ye learnt certainly what our spirit was, namely that we should never betray Hellas, and because your wall across the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a> is all but finished, now ye make no account of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, but having agreed with us to come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a> to oppose the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, ye have now deserted us, and ye permitted the Barbarian moreover to make invasion of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>. For the present then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> have anger against you, for ye did not do as was fitting to be done: and now they bid you with all speed send out an army together with us, in order that we may receive the Barbarian in the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>; for since we failed of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a>, the most suitable place to fight in our land is the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381236LThr class=demonym long=23.59 lat=38.07>Thriasian</a> plain.. </p>                        </div>

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375224PTeg class=ethnic long=22.429 lat=37.464>Tegeans</a> on the one hand said as follows: We have been always judged worthy of this post by the whole body of allies in all the common expeditions which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=ethnic long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesians</a> have made before this, whether in old times or but lately, ever since that time when the sons of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> endeavoured after the death of <a href=/people/247 target=_blank>Eurystheus</a> to return to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a>. This honour we gained at that time by reason of the following event: — When with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaians</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=ethnic long=27.3 lat=38>Ionians</a> who were then in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a> we had come out to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a> to give assistance and were encamped opposite those who desired to return, then it is said that <a href=/people/787 target=_blank>Hyllos</a> made a speech saying that it was not right that the one army should risk its safety by engaging battle with the other, and urging that that man of the army of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=ethnic long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesians</a> whom they should judge to be the best of them should fight in single combat with himself on terms concerted between them. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=ethnic long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesians</a> then resolved that this should be done; and they made oath with one another on this condition, — that if <a href=/people/787 target=_blank>Hyllos</a> should conquer the leader of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=ethnic long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesians</a>, then the sons of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> should return to their father's heritage; but he should be conquered, then on the other hand the sons of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> should depart and lead away their army, and not within a hundred years attempt to return to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a>. There was selected then of all the allies, he himself making a voluntary offer, <a href=/people/2380 target=_blank>Echemos</a> the son of Aeropos, the son of <a href=/people/1542 target=_blank>Phegeus</a>, who was our commander and king: and he fought a single combat and slew <a href=/people/787 target=_blank>Hyllos</a>. By reason of this deed we obtained among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=ethnic long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesians</a> of that time, besides many other great privileges which we still possess, this also of always leading the other wing of the army, when a common expedition is made.

First as to the sons of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, whose leader they say that they slew at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230SIst class=place long=22.9932 lat=37.9159>Isthmus</a>, these in the former time, when they were driven away by all the Hellenes to whom they came flying from slavery under those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377228PMyk class=place long=22.7561 lat=37.7308>Mykene</a>, we alone received; and joining with them we subdued the insolence of <a href=/people/247 target=_blank>Eurystheus</a>, having conquered in fight those who then dwelt in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a>.

We have moreover another glorious deed performed against the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a> who invaded once the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> land, coming from the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412369WThe class=place long=36.942 lat=41.194>Thermodon</a>: and in the toils of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> we were not inferior to any.

This however they perhaps said from ill-will; and all these whose names I mentioned among the men who were killed in this battle, were specially honoured, except <a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemos</a>; but <a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemos</a>, since he desired to be slain on account of the before-mentioned charge, was not honoured. </p>                        </div>
