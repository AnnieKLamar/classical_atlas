That one thing surpasses all that I have said of you, and my only excuse for not having added this trait to my portrait is that I was not aware of it; if I had been, no other should have had precedence of it. In this light I find myself, far from exaggerating, to have fallen much short of the truth. Consider the magnitude of this omission, the convincing demonstration of a sterling character and a right disposition which I lost; for those will be the best in human relations who are most earnest in their dealings with the divine. Why, were it decided that I must correct my words and retouch my statue, I should do it not by presuming to take away from it, but by adding this as its crowning grace. But from another point of view I have a great debt of gratitude to acknowledge. I commend your natural modesty, and your freedom from that vanity and pride which so exalted a position as yours might excuse. The best witness to my correctness is just the exception that you have taken to my words. That instead of receiving the praise I offered as your right you should be disturbed at it and call it excessive, is the proof of your unassuming modesty. Nevertheless, the more you reveal that this is your view of praise, the stronger proof you give of your own worthiness to be praised. You are an exact illustration of what <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> said when some one asked him how he might become famous: — 'by despising fame.' So if I were asked who most deserve praise, I should answer, Those who refuse it. </p>                        </div>

I will deal directly with them, then. It has indeed been said long ago that poets and painters are irresponsible; that is still more true, I conceive, of panegyrists, even humble prose ones like myself who are not run away with by their metre. Panegyric is a chartered thing, with no standard quantitative measure to which it must conform; its one and only aim is to express deep admiration and set its object in the most enviable light.

I refer you to the proper formula of panegyric, which requires the author to introduce illustrations, and depends mainly on their goodness for success. Now this goodness is shown not when the illustration is just like the thing illustrated, nor yet when it is inferior, but when it is as high above it as may be. If in praising a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> one should remark that it was bigger than a <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>fox</a> or a <a href=/people/556 target=_blank>cat</a>, would you regard him as a skilful panegyrist? certainly not. Or if he calls it the equal of a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>, he has not made very much of it so either. Where is the right thing to be found? why, in likening the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>'s size and spirit to the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>'s. So the poet who would praise <a href=/people/297 target=_blank>Orion</a>'s <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> called it the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>-queller. There you have the perfect panegyric of the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>. Or take <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391171PCro class=person long=17.129 lat=39.081>Croton</a>, <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380244PKar class=person long=24.427 lat=38.027>Carystus</a>, or <a href=/people/783 target=_blank>Polydamas</a>; to say of them by way of panegyric that each of them was stronger than a woman would be to make oneself a laughing-stock; one man instead of the woman would not much mend matters. But what, pray, does a famous poet make of <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucus</a>? — To match those hands not e'en the might Of <a href=/people/327 target=_blank>Pollux</a>' self had dared; <a href=/people/1123 target=_blank>Alcmena</a>'s son, that iron wight, Had shrunk — See what Gods he equals him to, or rather what Gods he puts him above. And <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucus</a> took no exception to being praised at the expense of his art's patron deities; nor yet did they send any judgement on athlete or poet for irreverence; both continued to be honoured in Greece, one for his might, and the other for this even more than for his other odes. Do not be surprised, then, that when I wished to conform to the canons of my art and find an illustration, I took an exalted one, as reason was that I should. </p>                        </div>

The flatterer praises for selfish ends, cares little for truth, and makes it his business to magnify indiscriminately; most of his effects consist in lying additions of his own; he thinks nothing of making <a href=/people/1306 target=_blank>Thersites</a> handsomer than <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, or telling <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a> he is younger than any of the host; he will swear <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a>'s son hears better than <a href=/people/790 target=_blank>Melampus</a>, and give <a href=/people/615 target=_blank>Phineus</a> better sight than <a href=/people/6078 target=_blank>Lynceus</a>, if he sees his way to a profit on the lie. But the panegyrist pure and simple, instead of lying outright, or inventing a quality that does not exist, takes the virtues his subject really does possess, though possibly not in large measure, and makes the most of them. The <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> is really distinguished among the animals we know for light-footed speed; well, in praising a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, he will hazard: The corn-stalks brake not 'neath his airy tread.

But your flatterer would use that line about the swineherd's hovel, if he saw a chance of getting anything out of the swineherd. <a href=/people/234 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> Poliorcetes had a flatterer called <a href=/people/6405 target=_blank>Cynaethus</a> who, when he was gravelled for lack of matter, found some in a cough that troubled his patron — he cleared his throat so musically!

Well, I will keep truth at arm's length no longer; I did not, dear lady, compare you to Goddesses, but to the handiwork in marble and bronze and ivory of certain good artists. There is no impiety, surely, in illustrating mortal beauty by the work of mortal hands — unless you take the thing that <a href=/people/402 target=_blank>Phidias</a> fashioned to be indeed <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athene</a>, or <a href=/people/688 target=_blank>Praxiteles</a>'s not much later work at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=place long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidus</a> to be the heavenly <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>. But would that be quite a worthy conception of divine beings? I take the real presentment of them to be beyond the reach of human imitation. </p>                        </div>
